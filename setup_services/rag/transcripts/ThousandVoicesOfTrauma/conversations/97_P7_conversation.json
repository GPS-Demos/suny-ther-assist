    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the bullying incident?",
    "Client: It's hard to think about... I was 12, walking home from school. These older girls, maybe 14 or 15, started following me. They were laughing and whispering. I tried to ignore them, but my heart was racing. I knew something bad was going to happen.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that memory.",
    "Client: They caught up to me and surrounded me. The tallest one, with long blonde hair, she pushed me. I stumbled and dropped my books. They all laughed. I can still hear their laughter, it was so cruel. I felt so small and helpless.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I tried to pick up my books, but they kicked them away. The blonde girl grabbed my hair and pulled hard. It hurt so much. I started crying, which only made them laugh more. They called me names... \"cry baby,\" \"weakling,\" \"loser.\" Each word felt like a knife.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: I wanted to run, but I was frozen. They pushed me down onto the sidewalk. I scraped my knees and hands. The pain was sharp, but the humiliation was worse. People walked by, but no one helped. I felt so alone, so worthless.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Eventually, they got bored and left. I sat there crying for what felt like hours. When I finally got home, I lied to my parents about why I was late and hurt. I was too ashamed to tell the truth. That shame... it's still with me, even now.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. Angry. Sad. It's like I'm that helpless little girl again. But there's also a part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I survived it, and I can talk about it now.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to talk about, but it feels a little less overwhelming now. I've never really told anyone the full story before. It's like a weight I've been carrying for so long.",
    "Therapist: You've taken an important step. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel exhausted, but also... lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been holding onto for decades. It's strange, but I feel a bit proud of myself for facing this memory.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant achievement. You should be proud.",
    "Client: I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without breaking down completely. It still hurts, but it's different now. Like the memory doesn't have as much power over me.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How would you like to proceed?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to explore this more. Maybe talk about how it affected my relationships later in life? I've always struggled with trust, and I wonder if this is part of why.",
    "Therapist: That's a thoughtful observation. We can certainly explore that.",
    "Client: Thank you. This process is difficult, but I'm starting to see its value. I've spent so many years trying to forget, but facing it... it's challenging, yet somehow freeing.",
    "Therapist: Your insight is remarkable. Shall we continue?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm ready. It's strange, but talking about the bullying has made me think about other times I felt powerless. Like in my marriage. My husband wasn't physically abusive, but he could be very controlling. I wonder if I accepted that because of what happened when I was young.",
    "Therapist: That's an interesting connection. Tell me more.",
    "Client: Well, my husband would often make decisions without consulting me. He'd decide where we'd go on vacation, what car we'd buy, even what I should wear to parties. At the time, I thought it was normal, that he was just taking care of things. But now I wonder if I was just falling into that same pattern of helplessness I felt as a child.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great self-awareness. How does this realization make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. I feel angry at myself for not standing up more, but also sad for the woman I was. I wish I could go back and tell her she deserves better. But there's also a sense of... hope? Like now that I can see these patterns, maybe I can change them.",
    "Therapist: That's a very positive outlook. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's overwhelming to see how one event from childhood could have such a lasting impact. But I'm also starting to see that I'm not that helpless girl anymore. I've survived so much. Maybe I'm stronger than I thought.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you want to use this strength?",
    "Client: I think... I want to work on setting boundaries. With my family, with friends. I've always been a people-pleaser, afraid of conflict. But maybe it's time to start speaking up for myself more. It's scary, but also exciting.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent goal. You've made significant progress today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be here, talking about these things. It's painful, but also... liberating? Like I'm finally taking control of my own story. I'm grateful for this opportunity to heal.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable courage. How would you like to end our session?",
    "Client: I think I'd like to take a moment to just... breathe. To sit with these new realizations and acknowledge how far I've come. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's take that moment together."
