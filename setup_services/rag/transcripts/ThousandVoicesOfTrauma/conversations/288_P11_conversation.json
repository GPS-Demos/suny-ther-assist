    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Patel?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's strange, you know? I've thought about the accident so many times, but actually going through it in detail like that... it's different. My heart is still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sound. The screeching of tires and then that horrible crunch of metal. It's like... it's like I could hear it all over again. And the smell of burning rubber. I hadn't remembered that before, but it was so vivid this time.",
    "Therapist: How did reliving those sensations affect you?",
    "Client: It made everything feel so real again. For a moment, I was right back there in the car, gripping the steering wheel. I felt that same panic, that same helplessness. But... but I also noticed that I could breathe through it this time. I didn't feel completely overwhelmed like I usually do when I think about the accident.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant observation. What do you make of that?",
    "Client: I suppose... well, maybe I'm starting to process it better? It's still awful, don't get me wrong. But there's a small part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe a bit stronger? Like I can face it without completely falling apart.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How does this relate to your day-to-day experiences?",
    "Client: Well, I've been avoiding driving, as you know. Especially on that stretch of road where it happened. But after today, I'm wondering if maybe... maybe I could try a short drive soon. Not there, not yet, but somewhere quiet. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How do you feel about that idea?",
    "Client: Nervous, definitely. But also a little excited? It's been so long since I've felt like I could even consider getting behind the wheel again. It's like... like a tiny bit of freedom is peeking through.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What else has changed?",
    "Client: I've noticed that... well, my nightmares aren't as frequent. And when they do come, they're not as intense. I used to wake up in a cold sweat, feeling like I couldn't breathe. Now, sometimes I can remind myself it's just a dream and... and breathe through it.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel about your progress?",
    "Client: It's... it's encouraging. I mean, I still have a long way to go, I know that. But for the first time in a while, I feel like I'm actually moving forward instead of just... existing, you know? It's like I can see a glimmer of my old self again.",
    "Therapist: That's fantastic. What's helped you most so far?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's been facing it head-on like this. It's terrifying, don't get me wrong. Every time we do an imaginal exposure, part of me wants to run away. But afterwards, it's like... it's like I've reclaimed a little piece of myself. And the breathing exercises have been a lifesaver. When I start to panic, I can sometimes pull myself back now.",
    "Therapist: That's great. How can we build on this?",
    "Client: I... I think I'd like to try that short drive I mentioned. Maybe... maybe next week? And I was wondering if we could work more on how to handle flashbacks when I'm out in public. Sometimes I still freeze up when I hear a car horn or brakes squealing.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Anything else you want to address?",
    "Client: I... I think that's enough for now. This session was intense, but... but good. Thank you for guiding me through it. I feel... I feel heard, you know? And not so alone in this anymore.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm ready. It's hard, but I can see it's helping. And for the first time in a long time, I feel like there's hope. Like maybe I can get past this and... and just be me again, you know? Not defined by the accident, but... but stronger because I've survived it.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful perspective. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've done something really important today. Thank you again, doctor. I... I'm glad I found the courage to start this therapy.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Take care, Mrs. Patel.",
    "Client: Thank you. I will. See you next week."
