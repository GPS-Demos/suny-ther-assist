    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: (sighs deeply) It's... it's a lot to process. I mean, reliving that airplane crash... it's intense. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. But, I don't know, maybe not as bad as I thought it would be?",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sounds. God, the sounds were overwhelming. The screeching of metal, people screaming, that horrible impact... (pauses) It's like I was right back there, you know? But this time, I could... I could sort of step back a little. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. How did that feel?",
    "Client: Weird, actually. Like, I was still scared, but I could also kinda... observe? I noticed my hands were clenched super tight, and I was holding my breath. But I remembered what you said about breathing, so I tried to do that.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How else did your body react?",
    "Client: My back tensed up big time. That's where most of my chronic pain is, you know? It's like my body remembers the impact. But focusing on my breath helped a little with that too.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts came up for you?",
    "Client: (long pause) I... I kept thinking about how alone I felt. Even with all those people around, I felt so... neglected. Like no one cared if I lived or died. It reminded me of... of growing up, I guess.",
    "Therapist: How so?",
    "Client: (voice quivering) Just... that feeling of being invisible. Unimportant. In the crash, in my childhood... it's the same feeling. God, I never realized that before.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful connection. How does recognizing that make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's kinda overwhelming. But also... I don't know, validating? Like, maybe I'm not crazy for feeling this way. Maybe it makes sense, given everything.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How might this insight help moving forward?",
    "Client: (thoughtfully) Maybe... maybe I can work on feeling less alone? Like, reach out more to my roommates or coworkers. It's hard, but... I want to feel connected, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. What else?",
    "Client: I think... I want to keep working on this. It's tough, but I feel like I'm starting to understand myself better. And maybe... maybe I can learn to feel safer, even when I'm alone.",
    "Therapist: You're showing real courage. How can we build on this?",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) I want to keep doing these exposures. They're scary, but... I feel like I'm finally facing things. And maybe work more on that breathing stuff? It really helped.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Is there anything else you want to discuss?",
    "Client: I... I just want to say thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. I know I'm not the easiest client, with all my issues and the chronic pain and everything. But I feel like I'm finally making progress, you know?",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work. How shall we end today's session?",
    "Client: Can we... can we just sit quietly for a minute? I need to catch my breath, sort of ground myself before I head out. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take that minute now."
