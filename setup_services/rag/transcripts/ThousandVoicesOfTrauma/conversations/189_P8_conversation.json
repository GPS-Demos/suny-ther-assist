    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mrs. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like my whole body is trembling on the inside. Remembering that moment when I saw my grandson get hit by that car... it's still so vivid. I can hear the screeching tires, the thud, and then... silence. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of things. There's this heaviness in my chest, like I can't breathe properly. And I feel so guilty. I keep thinking, \"If only I had held his hand tighter,\" or \"If I had been more alert.\" I know it's not rational, but I can't shake the feeling that I failed him somehow.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How do these feelings compare to when it first happened?",
    "Client: Well, it's... it's not as raw now. Back then, I couldn't even function. I'd wake up screaming, reliving that moment over and over. Now, it's more... it's like a dull ache that never really goes away. But talking about it like this, it brings it all back. I can feel my heart racing, just like it did that day.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind as you remember?",
    "Client: I keep seeing his little face, you know? He was so excited about going to the park. We were laughing just moments before... And then, in an instant, everything changed. I think about how unfair it is. He had his whole life ahead of him. And I... I'm still here. Sometimes I wonder why it wasn't me instead.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly painful. How are you coping with those thoughts?",
    "Client: It's... it's a struggle every day. Some days are better than others. I try to remember the good times, the joy he brought to our lives. But then the guilt creeps in again. I've been trying to volunteer at the children's hospital, hoping it might help somehow. But sometimes, when I see the kids there, it just reminds me of what we lost.",
    "Therapist: How does volunteering impact your healing process?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. On one hand, it gives me a sense of purpose. Like I'm doing something to honor his memory. But on the other hand, it's a constant reminder of what happened. There are moments when I'm reading to a child, and suddenly I'll remember reading to my grandson. It's bittersweet, you know? I want to help these children, but at the same time, it hurts so much.",
    "Therapist: What helps you get through those difficult moments?",
    "Client: I... I try to focus on my breathing, like you taught me. And I remind myself that he wouldn't want me to be sad all the time. Sometimes I talk to him in my head, telling him about my day. It sounds silly, but it helps. And my daughter... she's been my rock through all of this. We grieve together, remember together. It's hard, but it's also... healing, in a way.",
    "Therapist: How has your perspective on life changed since the incident?",
    "Client: Oh, it's... it's completely different now. I used to take so much for granted. Now, I cherish every moment with my family. I'm more present, more aware of the fragility of life. It's made me both more cautious and more appreciative. I try to find beauty in small things, like the way the sunlight filters through the leaves. My grandson loved that. It's... it's a way of keeping him with me, I suppose.",
    "Therapist: What do you think your grandson would say to you now?",
    "Client: (long pause, voice wavering) I... I think he'd tell me it's okay. That it wasn't my fault. He was such a forgiving, loving child. He'd probably be upset seeing me so sad all the time. He'd want me to remember the happy times, the laughter. (starts to cry softly) I can almost hear him saying, \"Don't cry, Grandma. Let's go play.\" It's... it's both comforting and heartbreaking to imagine that.",
    "Therapist: How does imagining that make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a strange mix of emotions. There's sadness, of course, but also a warmth. Like he's still with me in some way. It makes me want to honor his memory by living fully, by being the person he saw me as. Strong, loving, fun. But it's so hard sometimes. The grief just... it comes in waves, you know? One moment I'm okay, and the next, I'm drowning in sorrow.",
    "Therapist: What helps you ride those waves?",
    "Client: I've started keeping a journal. Writing down memories, things I wish I could tell him. It helps to get it out. And I've been trying to do things he loved - flying kites, baking cookies. It hurts at first, but then... it's like I can feel his joy. And talking about him, sharing stories with my family, that helps too. It keeps his memory alive.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about your progress in therapy so far?",
    "Client: It's... it's been a journey. Some days, I feel like I'm making real progress. I can think about him without falling apart completely. Other days, it feels like I'm right back where I started. But overall, I think I'm... I'm learning to live with the pain. It's not gone, but it's... manageable, most of the time. This therapy, talking about it, facing it head-on... it's hard, but I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: What goals do you have for your continued healing?",
    "Client: I want to... I want to be able to remember him with more joy than pain. To be able to talk about him freely, to celebrate his life rather than just mourning his death. I want to find a way to keep his spirit alive, maybe by helping other children or families who've experienced loss. And... I want to forgive myself. That's the hardest part, but I know it's necessary for me to move forward.",
    "Therapist: Those are meaningful goals. How do you feel about our session today?",
    "Client: It's been... intense. Bringing up these memories, these feelings... it's exhausting. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, release? Like I've let out some of the pressure that's been building up inside. It hurts, but it's a good hurt, if that makes sense. Like I'm finally dealing with it instead of just trying to push it away.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing so openly. We'll continue working through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's not easy, but... I'm grateful for your help. I know it's a long road ahead, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this. It won't ever be the same, but... I think I can learn to live with it. For him, for my family, and for myself.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. We'll end here for today. Take care."
