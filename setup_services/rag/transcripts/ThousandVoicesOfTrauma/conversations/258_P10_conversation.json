    "Therapist: Welcome, Layla. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm honestly pretty anxious. My heart's racing a bit. But I also know this is important, so I'm trying to stay focused on that.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to support you. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in the library. It's late afternoon, and the sunlight is streaming through the windows. I can smell old books and hear the quiet rustling of pages. I'm studying for my biology exam.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: Um, I notice this guy. He's been hanging around for a while, and it's making me uncomfortable. He keeps glancing at me. I'm trying to focus on my textbook, but I can feel his eyes on me.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Uneasy. My stomach's in knots. I'm debating whether I should pack up and leave.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you?",
    "Client: Maybe... 40?",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: Right. So, I decide to leave. I start packing up my things, and that's when... that's when he approaches me. He's smiling, but it doesn't reach his eyes. He asks if I need help carrying my books. I say no, but he insists. He's blocking my path now.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you experiencing?",
    "Client: My heart's pounding. I can feel sweat on my palms. I'm looking around, hoping someone will notice, but the library's almost empty. He's so close now, I can smell his cologne. It's... it's overpowering.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember to breathe. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's higher. Maybe 60?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he grabs my arm. Hard. It hurts. He's whispering something about how pretty I am, how he's been watching me. I feel frozen. I can't move. He's pulling me towards the back of the library, behind the stacks where no one can see us.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're doing great, Layla.",
    "Client: I'm terrified. I want to scream, but no sound comes out. My legs are shaking. He pushes me against the wall, and I can feel his breath on my neck. I'm trying to push him away, but he's so much stronger.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's really high. Like 85.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. Remember, you're here with me, and you're safe.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... okay. I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: He... he starts touching me. His hands are everywhere. I'm crying silently. I can taste the salt of my tears. I keep thinking, \"This can't be happening. Someone help me.\" But no one comes.",
    "Therapist: You're doing so well, Layla. Keep going.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud noise. Someone dropped a book nearby. He jumps, startled. I see my chance and I knee him... you know, where it hurts. He doubles over, and I run. I'm grabbing my things, not caring what I leave behind. My legs feel like jelly, but I'm running faster than I ever have before.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Shaky. Relieved, but still scared. My heart's racing.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe 70?",
    "Therapist: That's good. Take another deep breath. What happens after you run?",
    "Client: I... I don't stop running until I'm out of the library. The sunlight hits my face, and it feels surreal. Like, how can the world still be normal when this just happened? I'm gasping for air, looking around wildly to make sure he didn't follow me.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: I fumble for my phone. My hands are shaking so much I can barely dial. I call my best friend, Aisha. I'm sobbing, trying to explain what happened. She tells me to stay where I am, that she's coming to get me.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to reach out for help?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of relief and shame. I'm so grateful Aisha's coming, but I also feel... dirty. Like maybe it was my fault somehow.",
    "Therapist: Remember, it was not your fault. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 65, I think.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. What happens while you wait for Aisha?",
    "Client: I'm huddled on a bench, trying to make myself as small as possible. Every person who walks by makes me flinch. I keep replaying what happened, wondering if I could have done something differently. My arm hurts where he grabbed me. I can still smell his cologne on my clothes, and it makes me feel sick.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Aisha arrives, and when I see her, I just break down. She hugs me, and I'm crying so hard I can barely breathe. She's asking what happened, if I'm hurt, if we should call the police. I can't... I can't form words. I just shake my head and cling to her.",
    "Therapist: How does Aisha's presence make you feel?",
    "Client: Safe. Supported. But also... exposed. Like now it's real because someone else knows.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 60 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Layla. What happens next?",
    "Client: Aisha helps me to her car. I'm trembling the whole time. She drives me to her place. I can't face going home, facing my parents like this. In the car, I manage to tell her bits and pieces of what happened. She's furious, wants to go back and find the guy. But I just want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about Aisha's reaction?",
    "Client: Part of me is grateful she's so protective. But I also feel... ashamed. Like I've let her down somehow by letting this happen to me.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you didn't let this happen. It was not your fault.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Right. It wasn't my fault.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: At Aisha's place, she helps me into the shower. I stand under the hot water for what feels like hours, scrubbing my skin raw. I can still feel his hands on me. When I get out, Aisha's laid out some clean clothes for me. She's made tea, and she's just... there. Not pushing me to talk, just being present.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Grateful. So, so grateful. But also... broken. Like I'll never be the same again.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 55.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Can you describe what you're thinking and feeling as the day ends?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Emotionally and physically drained. Aisha's made up the couch for me, and I'm lying there, staring at the ceiling. Every time I close my eyes, I see his face. I keep replaying the moment over and over, thinking of all the things I should have done differently. I should have left earlier. I should have screamed. I should have fought harder.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you did the best you could in that situation. There's no \"should\" here.",
    "Client: *sighs* I know. It's just... hard not to think that way.",
    "Therapist: I understand. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Numb, I guess. Like I'm watching everything from outside my body. I'm worried about what happens next. How do I face my parents? My professors? How do I ever feel safe in the library again?",
    "Therapist: These are all valid concerns. We'll work through them together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I don't know what I'd do without this support.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave, Layla. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down to about 50.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You've done incredibly well today. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end the session.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay. I... I feel a bit calmer now.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. You should be proud of yourself. We'll continue working through this in our next session."
