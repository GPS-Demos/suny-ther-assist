    "Therapist: Alright, Carlos, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's begin. Close your eyes and describe the memory.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in our old house. Maria is yelling at me again. Her face is red, and she's waving her arms wildly. I can smell the alcohol on her breath. She's calling me useless, worthless... saying I can't do anything right. I feel so small, like I'm shrinking into the corner.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Um... I'd say about a 6 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue.",
    "Client: She's getting closer, her voice getting louder. I can feel my heart racing, my palms are sweaty. I want to defend myself, but the words won't come out. I'm frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, like I can't breathe properly. My shoulders are tense, and I have this knot in my stomach.",
    "Therapist: SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to an 8. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with it.",
    "Client: She's throwing things now. A plate shatters against the wall near my head. I flinch, feeling the pieces scatter around me. I'm trembling, feeling so helpless and afraid. Why can't I stand up for myself? Why am I letting this happen?",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: That I'm weak, that I deserve this somehow. That I'll never be good enough. God, it hurts to remember this.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. I feel overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (audible deep breath) Okay... okay. Maria's words are cutting deep. She's bringing up every mistake I've ever made, twisting them, making them seem worse. I feel like I'm drowning in shame and guilt.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What else?",
    "Client: I... I can see the neighbors through the window. They're pretending not to notice, not to hear. I feel so alone, so isolated. No one's going to help me.",
    "Therapist: SUDS now?",
    "Client: Still a 9. My hands are shaking. I feel nauseous.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: Maria's grabbed my arm now. Her nails are digging into my skin. I can feel the pain, sharp and real. She's screaming in my face, telling me she wishes she'd never met me. I... I can't take it anymore. I push her away, harder than I meant to. She stumbles back, looks shocked. For a moment, there's silence.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: She starts crying. Suddenly, she's the victim. I feel guilty, confused. Was I wrong? Should I apologize? I hate myself for pushing her, but I also feel this spark of... relief? Like I finally stood up for myself.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually down to a 7 now. Remembering that moment of standing up for myself... it's bittersweet, but there's a strange comfort in it.",
    "Therapist: I see. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Drained. But also... I don't know. Maybe a little stronger? Like I survived something terrible, and I'm still here.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Let's take a moment to breathe.",
    "Client: (deep breath) Thank you. This was hard, but... I think it helped.",
    "Therapist: You did well. We'll process this more next time."
