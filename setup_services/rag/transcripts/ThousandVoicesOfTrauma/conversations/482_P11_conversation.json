    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Patel?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's strange, you know? Reliving that earthquake from all those years ago... I can still feel the ground trembling beneath my feet. It's like my body remembers even though my mind wants to forget.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sounds. The creaking of the buildings, the screams... It's funny, I hadn't thought about those details in years, but now they're so vivid. And the helplessness. I felt so small and powerless against nature's fury.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit those memories today?",
    "Client: It was... difficult. But also, in a way, freeing? Like I've been carrying this weight for so long, and now I'm finally setting it down. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Can you tell me more about that feeling?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... for years, I've avoided thinking about the earthquake. I'd change the channel if there was news about natural disasters, I'd make excuses not to visit my hometown. But going through it again in my mind, it's like I'm facing it head-on. It's scary, but also... empowering?",
    "Therapist: That's a significant insight. How does this relate to your current struggles?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's all connected. The way I've been isolating myself, even online. I've been so afraid of being hurt or losing control that I've pushed everyone away. But reliving the earthquake made me realize that I survived something massive. Maybe I'm stronger than I give myself credit for.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How might this affect your approach to cyberbullying?",
    "Client: Oh, goodness. I hadn't even thought about that connection. But you're right. I've been so scared of those nasty comments online, I stopped using social media altogether. But if I could survive an earthquake, surely I can handle some keyboard warriors, right?",
    "Therapist: That's an interesting perspective. How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: It makes me feel... braver, I suppose. Like maybe I don't need to be so afraid all the time. Don't get me wrong, I'm still nervous about going online, but... maybe I can start small. Maybe reconnect with my grandchildren on Facebook or something.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive step. What else came up for you?",
    "Client: I realized how much I miss my community. After the earthquake, we all came together. There was such a sense of unity. I've lost that here, especially since I retired. I think... I think I want to try to connect more, both online and in person.",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. How do you plan to approach this?",
    "Client: Well, I was thinking... maybe I could join a support group for earthquake survivors online? It might be a safe way to dip my toes back into social media. And locally, perhaps I could volunteer at the community center. Being around people who understand chronic pain might help me feel less isolated.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like excellent ideas. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... hopeful, I think. And a bit proud of myself. It wasn't easy to go through that memory, but I did it. And I'm learning from it. It's like... the earthquake shook my world, but now I'm the one choosing to shake things up, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a wonderful way to look at it. What's your takeaway from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'm realizing that avoiding my fears only makes them bigger. Facing them head-on, whether it's memories of the earthquake or my anxiety about going online, that's how I'll grow stronger. It's scary, but... I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: That's an incredibly powerful insight. How will you remind yourself of this?",
    "Client: Oh, good question. Hmm... Maybe I could set a reminder on my phone? Something like \"Face your fears, remember your strength.\" And I could put a little earthquake emoji next to it. Is that too silly?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's personal and meaningful to you.",
    "Client: You're right. I'll do that then. And maybe... maybe I'll write down how I'm feeling after each time I try something new online. That way I can see my progress.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent idea. How are you feeling about our next session?",
    "Client: I'm... nervous, but also excited. It's a strange mix. But I think I'm ready to keep going. This feels important, you know?",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: No, I think... I think I'm good for now. Thank you for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone listen and understand.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. I'm proud of your progress today."
