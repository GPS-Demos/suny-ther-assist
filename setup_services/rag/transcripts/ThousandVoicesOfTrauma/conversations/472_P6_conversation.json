    "Therapist: Welcome back, Sarah. Are you ready to continue our imaginal exposure exercise today?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with your SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 right now. My stomach feels a bit tight.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) I'm back in the car. It's dark, and I can hear the rain hitting the windshield. The wipers are moving frantically, but I can barely see the road. I'm gripping the steering wheel so tightly my knuckles are white.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a bright light. It's coming towards me so fast. I try to swerve, but... (voice trembles) I can't control the car. It's spinning. The screeching of tires is deafening. I'm screaming, but I can't hear my own voice over the noise.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to a 7. My heart is racing, and I feel like I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: The impact is so violent. Glass is shattering everywhere. I feel a sharp pain in my side. Everything is moving in slow motion. I can smell gasoline and burning rubber. I'm trapped, and I can't move. I'm so scared I'm going to die here.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. SUDS?",
    "Client: It's an 8 now. I feel dizzy, like I might pass out.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here in my office.",
    "Client: (breathing deeply) Okay. I... I hear sirens in the distance. They're getting closer. I'm still trapped, and the pain is getting worse. I can taste blood in my mouth. I'm trying to call for help, but I can barely make a sound.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: The SUDS is still at 8. My hands are shaking, and I feel cold all over.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I see flashing lights now. There are voices outside the car, but they sound muffled. Someone's telling me to stay still, that they're going to get me out. I hear metal groaning as they try to open the door. The pain is overwhelming. I'm fading in and out of consciousness.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually gone down to a 6. I feel exhausted, but less panicked.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Continue.",
    "Client: They've got me on a stretcher now. The paramedic is asking me questions, but I can barely focus. The lights in the ambulance are so bright. I'm shivering uncontrollably. I keep asking about the other driver, but no one will tell me anything.",

    "Client: (opens eyes) Wow, that was intense. But... I feel okay. Better than I expected.",
    "Therapist: You did wonderfully. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: My SUDS is back to a 3. I'm surprised at how quickly it came down.",
    "Therapist: That's common. You've shown great resilience.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard, but I feel like I'm starting to process it better.",
    "Therapist: That's the goal. We'll continue next session."
