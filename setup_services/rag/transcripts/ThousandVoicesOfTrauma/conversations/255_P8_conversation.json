    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is buzzing, you know? My hands are a bit shaky, and I can feel my heart racing. The memory of seeing that car accident... it's so vivid now. I can almost smell the gasoline and hear the sirens.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. Standing there, watching the paramedics work... I'm a professional, you know? I'm used to being in control, having answers. But in that moment, I was just... frozen. It's embarrassing, really. I should have done something, anything.",
    "Therapist: How does that feeling of helplessness sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... uncomfortable. It goes against everything I believe about myself. I've always prided myself on being capable, on having it together. But that day, I was just another bystander. It makes me question my worth, my ability to handle crises. And that scares me.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you noticing as you talk about this?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, like there's a weight on it. My throat's dry, and I'm having trouble swallowing. It's like my body is reliving that moment, you know? I can feel the tension in my shoulders, the same way I did when I was standing there, watching it all unfold.",
    "Therapist: And how do these sensations relate to your anxiety?",
    "Client: Oh, it's... it's definitely connected. This tightness, the racing heart - it's exactly how I feel when I'm having an anxiety attack. It's like my body is always on high alert now, waiting for the next disaster. I find myself constantly scanning for danger, even in safe situations. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: What else comes up for you as you reflect on this memory?",
    "Client: I... I feel guilty. Not just about not helping, but about how it's affecting my family. My partner tries to understand, but I can see the worry in their eyes. Our kids... they've noticed the change in me. I'm not as present as I used to be. It's like part of me is always back there, at that accident scene. I'm afraid I'm letting everyone down.",
    "Therapist: How does sharing this make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a relief, actually. I've been holding this in for so long, trying to be strong. But saying it out loud, here with you, it feels like I'm finally acknowledging the impact it's had on me. It's scary, but also... I don't know, maybe a bit freeing? Like maybe I don't have to carry this alone anymore.",
    "Therapist: What do you think this experience has taught you about yourself?",
    "Client: That's... that's a tough one. I guess it's shown me that I'm more vulnerable than I thought. That I'm not always in control, and that's... okay? Maybe? It's also made me realize how much I value my family, how much I need their support. And perhaps... perhaps it's okay to need that support. It doesn't make me weak, it makes me human.",
    "Therapist: How do you see this relating to your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's forcing me to confront my fears, to acknowledge my limitations. But also to recognize my strength. I'm here, aren't I? Talking about it, working through it. That takes courage. Maybe recovery isn't about going back to who I was before, but about becoming someone new - someone who understands themselves better, who can ask for help when they need it.",
    "Therapist: What's one thing you'd like to take away from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's the idea that it's okay to not be okay sometimes. That experiencing trauma doesn't make me less capable or less worthy. It's part of my story now, but it doesn't define me. And maybe, just maybe, by working through this, I can become even stronger, more compassionate. It's a long road, but I'm starting to believe I can walk it.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired, honestly. Emotionally drained. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe hope? Like I've taken a step forward today. It's still overwhelming, and I know I have a lot more work to do, but I feel like I can breathe a little easier. Like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I think... I think I want to talk to my partner about this. Really open up about what I'm going through. Maybe look into some support groups for people who've experienced similar traumas. And definitely continue with these sessions. They're hard, but I can feel them making a difference. I'm not ready to let this go just yet, but I'm ready to keep facing it head-on.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. Thank you for this. It's not easy, but... I'm grateful for the space to work through all of this. Same time next week?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Take care, and remember to be kind to yourself.",
    "Client: I'll try. Thank you again. See you next week."
