    "Therapist: Welcome back, James. Today we'll continue with our imaginal exposure exercise. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control. Let's start with your SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 right now. Just thinking about revisiting the accident makes me tense up a bit.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath and begin when you're ready.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm driving down the highway, it's late afternoon. The sun is low, making it hard to see. I'm tired from a long day at work, but I'm looking forward to getting home. Suddenly, there's a screech of tires and... oh God, I see the other car coming right at me. My heart is racing, I can feel my palms getting sweaty on the steering wheel.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to a 6. I can feel my chest tightening.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: The impact is deafening. Metal crunching, glass shattering. I'm jerked forward, the seatbelt cutting into my chest. Everything's spinning, I can't make sense of what's happening. The airbag deploys, it feels like I've been punched in the face. I taste blood in my mouth.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's an 8 now. My hands are shaking just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: The car finally stops moving. It's eerily quiet for a moment, then I hear people shouting. Someone's asking if I'm okay, but I can't respond. I'm frozen, staring at the crumpled hood of my car. I smell gasoline and burning rubber. My head is pounding, and I'm terrified the car might explode.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I'm at a 9. This is really intense. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here with me. You're safe.",
    "Client: I'm trying to unbuckle my seatbelt, but my hands are shaking so much. I hear sirens in the distance. Someone's telling me not to move, that help is coming. But all I can think about is getting out of the car. I'm panicking, feeling trapped. The pain is starting to set in, my neck and back are on fire.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: Still at a 9. My heart is racing just like it did then.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: The paramedics arrive. They're asking me questions, but I'm having trouble focusing. They're putting a neck brace on me, and I'm being carefully moved onto a backboard. The movement sends sharp pains through my body. I'm scared, confused, wondering if I'm seriously injured. As they load me into the ambulance, I catch a glimpse of the other car. It's completely mangled, and I'm overwhelmed with guilt and fear.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm back down to an 8. The worst part is over, but I still feel shaky.",
    "Therapist: You're doing excellent. Let's take a moment to breathe.",
    "Client: Okay... *deep breath* It's strange, but talking through it... it's helping. It's still intense, but I feel like I have more control now.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How would you rate your SUDS now?",
    "Client: I think I'm down to a 6. The memory is still vivid, but the panic is subsiding.",
    "Therapist: You've done remarkably well. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... kind of relieved? It's like a weight has been lifted. I didn't think I could face this memory head-on like that.",
    "Therapist: That's often the case. You've shown great courage today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It wasn't easy, but I'm glad we did this. I feel... stronger, somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's the goal. We'll end here for today. Well done, James."
