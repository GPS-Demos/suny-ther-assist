    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the airplane crash scene?",
    "Client: Okay... I was sitting in my seat, near the window. The plane had just taken off, and everything seemed normal at first. Then, suddenly, there was this loud noise, like an explosion. The plane started shaking violently. I could hear people screaming all around me. The oxygen masks dropped down, and I fumbled to put mine on. My hands were shaking so much...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The plane was losing altitude fast. I could see the ground getting closer through the window. My heart was racing, and I felt like I couldn't breathe. I kept thinking about my family, how I might never see them again. The flight attendants were trying to keep everyone calm, but I could see the panic in their eyes. It was chaos...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that memory. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can continue. It's too much.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *takes a deep breath* Okay... As we were going down, I closed my eyes. I could feel the impact when we hit the ground. It was so violent. The sound was deafening - metal tearing, people screaming. I was thrown forward, my seatbelt cutting into me. When I opened my eyes, everything was smoke and debris. I could smell fuel...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I was in shock, I think. I unbuckled my seatbelt and tried to stand, but my leg was injured. People were pushing past me, trying to get out. I could hear the crackling of fire somewhere behind me. I was terrified the plane would explode. Somehow, I managed to drag myself to an emergency exit. When I got out, I collapsed on the ground. The scene outside was horrific - parts of the plane scattered everywhere, people lying motionless...",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... shaken. My heart is racing, and I feel like I'm back there. But... I also feel a bit relieved to have said it out loud.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to talk about, but I know it's important. After I got out, I just lay there on the ground, watching as rescue workers arrived. I couldn't believe I had survived. The guilt hit me later - why me? Why did I survive when others didn't? I still struggle with that...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have those feelings. Continue.",
    "Client: The aftermath was almost as bad as the crash itself. Weeks in the hospital, surgeries for my injuries, physical therapy. But the worst part was the nightmares, the constant fear of flying, even of leaving my house. I felt so alone, even though my family tried to help. No one could understand what I'd been through...",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also a bit lighter. Talking about it is hard, but it helps to share the burden. I'm starting to realize that surviving doesn't mean I don't have the right to feel traumatized. It's a long journey, but I'm hopeful that I can work through this.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Well done today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I know we're almost out of time, but I wanted to ask - is it normal to feel physically exhausted after these sessions? Sometimes I go home and just sleep for hours.",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's common. Take care of yourself.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you for your support today. It means a lot to have someone listen without judgment. I'm nervous about our next session, but I'm also looking forward to it in a way. I feel like I'm finally making progress.",
    "Therapist: That's great. We'll continue next time.",
    "Client: Okay. See you then. And... thanks again. This isn't easy, but I'm glad I'm doing it.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. Take care."
