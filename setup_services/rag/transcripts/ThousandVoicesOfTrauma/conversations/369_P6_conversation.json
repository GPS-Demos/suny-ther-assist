    "Therapist: Welcome back. Today we'll continue with our imaginal exposure exercise. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control. Let's start with your baseline SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10. There's some tension in my shoulders already.",
    "Therapist: Noted. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day at the refugee camp.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm there. It's hot, dusty. I can smell sweat and hear children crying. There's a long line for water, and people look exhausted. I'm standing near the edge of the camp, watching...",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's shouting. A group of men with weapons appears at the camp entrance. My heart starts racing. People are screaming, running. I'm frozen in place, watching as they start pushing people around, demanding something...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 7. My palms are sweaty, and I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: One of the armed men grabs a young woman. She's screaming, trying to hold onto her baby. I want to help, but I'm terrified. I see him hit her with the butt of his gun. There's blood... oh god, there's so much blood...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel sick. My stomach's churning, and I'm shaking. It's like I'm right there again, helpless and scared. The guilt is overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's a 9. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: The woman falls to the ground. Her baby is wailing. Other people are trying to intervene now, but the armed men are firing shots into the air. The chaos is deafening. I'm backing away, looking for somewhere to hide...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm starting to feel a bit numb. Like I'm disconnecting from the memory. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: It's a common response. Stay present if you can. What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 6. The images are less vivid now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Can you describe what happens next?",
    "Client: I... I find myself behind a tent. I can still hear the commotion, but it's muffled. I'm breathing hard, trying to make myself as small as possible. I keep thinking about that woman and her baby, wondering if they're okay...",
    "Therapist: And now? How are you feeling?",
    "Client: The panic is subsiding, but there's this deep sadness settling in. My SUDS is probably around 5 now. I just feel... heavy.",
    "Therapist: That's a natural reaction. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Thanks. I... I stay hidden for what feels like hours. When I finally peek out, the armed men are gone. People are crying, comforting each other. Aid workers are rushing around. I see the woman being carried to the medical tent. Her baby is with another woman. I feel relieved they're alive, but also guilty for not helping...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's back down to a 4. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I survived reliving it.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's start to bring you back to the present.",
    "Client: Okay. As I open my eyes, I can feel myself back in your office. The memory feels less overwhelming now.",
    "Therapist: Well done. How do you feel about today's session?",
    "Client: It was tough, but I think it helped. The memory doesn't feel as scary as it did before.",
    "Therapist: That's great. We'll end here for today. Remember to practice your coping strategies."
