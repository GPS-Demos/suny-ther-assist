    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Ah, you know... I'm feeling a bit uneasy, to be honest. My hands are a little shaky. It's not easy to revisit these memories, especially at my age. I thought I'd left all this behind.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say... maybe a 6? My stomach's in knots.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we're here together. Begin when you're ready.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Alright... It was a Tuesday evening. I remember because my favorite telenovela was on. Mar\u00eda was yelling again. She always got worked up during her favorite shows. I was in the kitchen, trying to stay out of her way. The smell of frijoles was in the air...",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay in the moment.",
    "Client: The beans were almost done. I could hear the TV blaring in the living room. Mar\u00eda suddenly shouted, \"Carlos! Where's my coffee?\" Her voice... it was sharp, like a knife. I felt my shoulders tense up immediately.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's creeping up... maybe a 7.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: I... I called back, \"Coming, mi amor.\" But my hands were shaking as I poured the coffee. I knew it wouldn't be right, no matter what I did. As I walked to the living room, the floor creaked. Mar\u00eda's head snapped around. Her eyes... Dios m\u00edo, they were cold.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling.",
    "Client: *voice wavering* She snatched the cup from my hands. \"You're useless,\" she spat. \"Can't even make a decent cup of coffee.\" I tried to apologize, but she cut me off. \"Shut up! I can't hear my show.\" I felt so small, like a child. My chest was tight, I could barely breathe...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Carlos. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* The worst part wasn't the yelling. It was the silence after. The way she'd ignore me, like I didn't exist. I sat in the corner of the sofa, trying to make myself invisible. The TV kept playing, but all I could hear was my heart pounding.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. My hands are sweating.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I wanted to leave, but where would I go? At my age... with no job... She knew I had nowhere else. Sometimes, I'd catch her smirking when she thought I wasn't looking. Like she enjoyed seeing me squirm. God, I feel so ashamed...",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault, Carlos.",
    "Client: *voice breaking* But maybe if I'd been a better husband... if I'd made more money... She always said I was a disappointment. Maybe she was right. I sat there for hours, feeling worthless. The show ended, and she went to bed without a word. I slept on the couch that night. I couldn't bear to be near her.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I'm at a 9. My chest hurts. It's hard to breathe.",
    "Therapist: Let's take a moment. Focus on your surroundings.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... okay. I can see the painting on your wall. The blue ocean... it helps.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: The next morning, she acted like nothing happened. That was almost worse. I made her breakfast, my hands still shaking. She complained about the eggs being too dry. I apologized... again. Always apologizing. She said, \"At least you're good for something.\" Her words cut deep, but I smiled. What else could I do?",
    "Therapist: What were you feeling in that moment?",
    "Client: Trapped. Hopeless. Like I was slowly disappearing. Each day, a little more of me faded away. I used to be proud, you know? A man who could hold his head high. But there... in that house... I was nothing.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this, Carlos.",
    "Client: *wiping tears* It went on for years. The constant criticism, the cold silences, the threats to kick me out. I started to believe I deserved it. That this was all I was worth. My friends stopped calling. My family... they didn't understand why I stayed. How could I explain that I was too scared to leave?",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still a 9. My heart's racing.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *inhales shakily* I remember one night... it was our anniversary. I'd saved up to buy her flowers. When I gave them to her, she laughed. Actually laughed in my face. \"What am I supposed to do with these?\" she said. Then she threw them in the trash. I stood there, watching the petals scatter. That was the moment I knew I had to leave.",
    "Therapist: How did that realization feel?",
    "Client: Terrifying. Liberating. Like waking up from a long nightmare. But it took me another six months to actually do it. Six more months of insults, of feeling worthless. When I finally left, I had nothing but a suitcase and my dignity.",
    "Therapist: You showed incredible strength.",
    "Client: Did I? Sometimes I still wonder if I should have tried harder. If I could have made her happy somehow.",
    "Therapist: Remember, her actions were not your fault.",
    "Client: *sighs* I know that now... most of the time. But there are days when I hear her voice in my head, telling me I'm useless. It's hard to shake off decades of that, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's why we're here. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm coming down. Maybe a 7? My chest doesn't feel as tight.",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. Let's continue.",
    "Client: After I left, I stayed with my cousin for a while. It was strange, being treated with kindness again. I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop. For someone to start yelling or insulting me. But it didn't happen. Slowly, I started to remember who I was before Mar\u00eda.",
    "Therapist: What was that like?",
    "Client: Bittersweet. I felt relief, but also grief for all the years I'd lost. The first time I laughed without feeling guilty was... incredible. But I also had nightmares. I'd wake up in a cold sweat, thinking I was back in that house.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience for survivors.",
    "Client: Is it? Sometimes I feel so alone in this. Like no one could understand. But being here, talking about it... it helps. I'm starting to see that what happened wasn't normal. It wasn't love.",
    "Therapist: You're making great progress, Carlos.",
    "Client: Gracias. It's still hard, you know? There are days when I miss her, as crazy as that sounds. Or when I see a happy couple and feel a pang of envy. But then I remember how it felt to be free. To make my own choices without fear.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5, I think. Talking about it... it's draining, but also... I don't know, cleansing?",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. How do you feel about stopping here for today?",
    "Client: I think that's good. I'm tired, but... I feel lighter somehow. Like I've put down a heavy burden, even if just for a moment.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today, Carlos. Let's end with some grounding exercises.",
    "Client: Okay. *takes a deep breath* I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Great. Let's begin..."
