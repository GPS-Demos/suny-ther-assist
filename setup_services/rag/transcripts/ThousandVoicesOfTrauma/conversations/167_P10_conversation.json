    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Lee. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to dive into that night again, and part of me wants to just get it over with, but another part is dreading it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Yeah, I think so. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that night. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in my living room. It's late, maybe around 11 PM. I'm watching some mindless TV show, trying to wind down after a long day at work. The lights are dim, just the glow from the TV and a small lamp in the corner. I can hear the faint hum of traffic outside, but it's mostly quiet.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: There's a sudden crash from the kitchen. It's loud, like shattering glass. My heart... it just starts pounding immediately. I freeze for a second, thinking maybe I left a window open and something fell, but then I hear footsteps. Heavy, unfamiliar footsteps.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 6. My palms are getting sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I stand up, my legs feeling weak. I'm trying to be quiet, but my breathing is so loud in my ears. I take a few steps towards the hallway, thinking maybe I can make it to my phone in the bedroom. But then I see a shadow move across the wall.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: There's a man. He's tall, wearing dark clothes. I can't see his face clearly, but I catch a glimpse of something metallic in his hand. A knife, I think. Oh god, my heart is racing just like it did then.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here with me. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. I can feel my hands shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's ground ourselves for a moment. Can you name three things you see in this room?",
    "Client: Um... your desk, the plant in the corner, and the clock on the wall.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, when you're ready, continue with what happened.",
    "Client: Okay... The man, he sees me. There's this moment where we're just staring at each other, and time seems to stop. Then he lunges forward, and I... I just react. I grab the lamp from the side table and throw it at him. It misses, but it gives me a second to run.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My muscles are tense, like they're coiled and ready to spring. My throat feels tight, and I can feel my pulse in my temples.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What happens next?",
    "Client: I run towards the front door, but I'm fumbling with the lock. My hands are shaking so badly. I can hear him behind me, his footsteps getting closer. I finally get the door open and I'm out on the street, barefoot, in my pajamas.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's still high, maybe a 9. I can feel the panic rising in my chest.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to breathe. Remember, you survived this. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (Takes a few deep breaths) Yeah, okay. I'm... I'm running down the street. It's cold, and the pavement is rough under my feet. I'm screaming for help, but the street seems deserted. I can hear him behind me, getting closer.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I see a neighbor's porch light come on. Mr. Johnson, from two doors down. He opens his door, looking confused. I'm yelling, telling him to call the police. The man behind me, he stops. I hear him curse and then... footsteps running away.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix. There's relief, but also this lingering terror. My whole body is shaking, and I feel like I might throw up.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7 now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's continue. What happens after the intruder runs away?",
    "Client: Mr. Johnson, he's asking me what happened. I can barely speak, I'm gasping for air. His wife comes out, she puts a blanket around my shoulders. I'm suddenly aware that I'm freezing. The police sirens, I can hear them in the distance.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm shivering, but I don't know if it's from cold or shock. My legs feel weak, like they might give out. There's this hollow feeling in my stomach.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What happens when the police arrive?",
    "Client: They're asking me questions, but I'm having trouble focusing. Everything feels surreal, like I'm watching it happen to someone else. They want me to go back to the house, to see if anything was taken, but I... I can't. The thought of going back in there makes me feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 6. Talking about not being able to go back in, it brings up a lot of shame.",
    "Therapist: There's no need for shame. Your reaction was normal. What happens next?",
    "Client: The police, they go in without me. I stay outside with Mr. and Mrs. Johnson. Mrs. Johnson is holding my hand, telling me it's going to be okay. But I don't feel okay. I feel like everything has changed in an instant.",
    "Therapist: That's a profound realization. How does it sit with you now?",
    "Client: It's... it's heavy. Like a weight on my chest. I remember thinking that I'd never feel safe again. That my home, my sanctuary, had been violated.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid feelings. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's at a 5 now. Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also releasing something.",
    "Therapist: You're doing excellent work. Let's continue. What happens after the police finish their investigation?",
    "Client: They tell me it's safe to go back in. Nothing was taken - it looks like I interrupted him before he could steal anything. But I... I can't bring myself to go inside. The thought of sleeping there, of being alone in that space... it terrifies me.",
    "Therapist: How do you handle that fear?",
    "Client: I... I ask the Johnsons if I can stay with them for the night. They're kind, they set me up on their couch. But I don't sleep. I just lie there, every sound making me jump. I keep replaying the moment in my head, wondering what would have happened if I hadn't woken up, if I hadn't thrown the lamp...",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those thoughts. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 4. Talking about the aftermath, it's less intense than the actual event.",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. How do you feel about your actions that night, looking back?",
    "Client: I... I guess I'm proud that I reacted quickly. That I didn't freeze completely. But there's also this lingering sense of vulnerability. Like, no matter what I do, I can't ever be completely safe.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after trauma. How does that belief affect you now?",
    "Client: It's... it's why I moved to a shared living situation. I couldn't bear to live alone anymore. But even now, I check the locks multiple times a night. I startle at unexpected noises. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: You've been through a lot. What's your SUDS level as we wrap up this memory?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 3 now. Talking about it, going through it step by step... it's still hard, but it feels less overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm tired, emotionally drained. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe accomplishment? Like I've faced something I've been avoiding for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. Well done. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end the session.",
    "Client: (Takes several deep breaths) Thank you. This... this wasn't easy, but I think it was important.",
    "Therapist: It absolutely was. We'll continue to work through this in our future sessions. For now, remember to be kind to yourself and use the coping strategies we've discussed.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
