    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is buzzing, you know? My heart's still racing a bit. I can feel this tightness in my chest, and my hands are clammy. It's strange because I'm here in your office, but part of me still feels like I'm back there, watching it all happen again.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: It's a jumble, honestly. I keep seeing flashes of that night - the lights, the shouting, the chaos. I'm thinking about how helpless I felt, how angry I am that this kind of thing still happens. And then there's this voice in my head saying, \"You should be over this by now.\" But I'm not, am I? It's been years, and I'm still affected by it.",
    "Therapist: What emotion feels strongest at this moment?",
    "Client: Rage. Definitely rage. It's like this fire in my gut. I'm furious that those officers thought they could treat people like that, that they probably still do. And I'm angry at myself for not doing more, for just standing there frozen. But there's fear mixed in too, you know? This deep-seated fear that it could happen again, to me or someone I care about.",
    "Therapist: How does that fear manifest for you?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a constant state of alertness. I'm always scanning my surroundings, especially when I see police. My muscles tense up, I start to sweat. Sometimes I have trouble breathing. It's exhausting, living like this. And it's not just physical. I find myself second-guessing every interaction, wondering if I'm doing something that could be misinterpreted. It's affected my relationships, my work... everything.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your body right now?",
    "Client: I... wow, I didn't even realize until you asked, but I'm clenching my fists. My jaw feels tight too. It's like my body is getting ready for a fight that isn't coming. And there's this heaviness in my chest, like someone's sitting on it. It's hard to take a full breath.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to breathe. What else comes up for you?",
    "Client: As I'm breathing, I'm realizing how much this experience has shaped me. I used to be more outgoing, more trusting. Now I'm always on edge, always waiting for the other shoe to drop. It's like I'm carrying this invisible weight everywhere I go. And I'm tired, so tired of feeling this way. But at the same time, there's a part of me that feels... I don't know, almost guilty about the idea of letting it go. Like if I move on, I'm somehow saying what happened was okay.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt connect to your experience?",
    "Client: I guess... it's about justice, you know? Or the lack of it. Nothing ever happened to those officers. They're probably still out there, maybe doing the same thing to other people. If I just \"get over it,\" am I letting them off the hook? Am I betraying the part of me that deserves justice? It's complicated. I want to heal, but I don't want to forget.",
    "Therapist: What would healing look like for you?",
    "Client: That's a tough one. I suppose... being able to walk down the street without constantly looking over my shoulder. Being able to see a police car without my heart rate skyrocketing. Maybe even being able to trust authority figures again, or at least not immediately assume the worst. And I think... I think healing would mean being able to talk about what happened without feeling like I'm right back in that moment. To remember it as something that happened to me, not something that's still happening.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that possibility?",
    "Client: It feels... distant. Like a mirage, you know? Part of me wants it so badly, but another part is scared. What if I can't do it? What if I'm too broken? And there's this weird fear that if I heal, I'll lose part of my identity. This experience has been such a big part of who I am for so long. But when I really think about it, the idea of not being controlled by this fear and anger anymore... it's appealing. Terrifying, but appealing.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you could take towards that healing?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe talking about it more? Not just here in therapy, but with people I trust. Or maybe finding a way to channel this anger into something positive, like advocacy work. And I think... I think I need to work on being kinder to myself. I've been carrying so much guilt and shame, and that's not helping anyone, least of all me.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to consider these steps?",
    "Client: It's a mix of emotions. There's some hope there, which is nice. I haven't felt hopeful about this in a long time. But there's also fear. It's like I'm standing at the edge of a cliff, and I know I need to jump to get to the other side, but I can't see the bottom. It's scary. But... maybe it's scarier to stay where I am? I don't know. It's a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: What support do you need moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I need patience. From you, from my loved ones, but especially from myself. This isn't going to be a quick fix, and I need to be okay with that. I also think I need help staying accountable. It's easy to fall back into old patterns when things get tough. And maybe... maybe I need to connect with others who've been through similar experiences. To know I'm not alone in this.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, honestly. But also a little lighter, if that makes sense. Like I've put down a heavy bag I've been carrying. I'm still nervous about what comes next, but I think I'm ready to try. It's not going to be easy, but... maybe it's worth it. Maybe I'm worth it.",
