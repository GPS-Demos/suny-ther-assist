    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, James?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's strange, you know? Reliving that experience of being cyberbullied... it brought back a lot of emotions I thought I'd buried.",
    "Therapist: What stood out to you?",
    "Client: The overwhelming sense of helplessness, I suppose. It's like... even though it happened online, it felt so invasive, like they were right there in my personal space. I remember constantly checking my phone, dreading each notification. My heart would race every time I heard that ping.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was tough, really tough. I felt that same tightness in my chest, you know? But... it's different now. I mean, I'm here, safe, and it's in the past. It's weird, but I feel both vulnerable and stronger at the same time. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Can you tell me more about feeling stronger?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... I survived it, didn't I? At the time, it felt like it would never end. But now, looking back, I can see that I got through it. It doesn't define me anymore. I mean, it still affects me, obviously, but I'm not that same person who felt so powerless.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does this connect to your recovery goals?",
    "Client: I... I think it shows me that I'm making progress. Before, I couldn't even think about those messages without having a panic attack. Now, it's still uncomfortable, but I can talk about it. I want to get to a point where those memories don't have any power over me at all.",
    "Therapist: What strategies helped you during the exposure?",
    "Client: The breathing exercises we've practiced were really helpful. When I felt myself getting overwhelmed, I focused on my breath. And... I kept reminding myself that I'm safe now, that it's just a memory. It's like... I'm watching it happen to past me, but present me is okay.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent use of your coping skills. What's challenging you most right now?",
    "Client: I think... it's the lingering doubt. Part of me still wonders if I could have done something differently, you know? If I had just ignored them or been less active online... maybe it wouldn't have happened. I know it's not rational, but the thought is still there.",
    "Therapist: How might we address that doubt in future sessions?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe we could work on challenging those thoughts? Like, rationally, I know it wasn't my fault. But emotionally, I still feel responsible sometimes. I'd like to bridge that gap, if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: That's a great insight. We'll definitely focus on that. How are you feeling about continuing with exposures?",
    "Client: I'm... nervous, but determined. It's hard, reliving these memories. But I can see the progress I'm making. It's like... each time we do this, I'm reclaiming a bit of myself that I lost. I want to keep going, to see how much stronger I can become.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is commendable. Any final thoughts about today's session?",
    "Client: I just... I want to thank you. This process isn't easy, but I feel supported. For the first time in a long time, I feel like I'm taking control back. It's scary, but it's also empowering. I'm starting to believe that maybe, just maybe, I can fully heal from this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work, James. We'll continue this journey together."
