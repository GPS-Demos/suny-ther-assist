    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and take us to the moment of the animal attack.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm at the park near my house. It's a sunny day, and I can hear kids playing in the distance. I'm walking on the path, and suddenly I hear growling behind me. I turn around, and there's this huge dog, maybe a Rottweiler, baring its teeth at me. My heart starts racing...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I freeze. I can't move. The dog's eyes are locked on me, and I can see drool dripping from its mouth. I want to run, but my legs won't work. I can feel my palms getting sweaty, and my breathing is getting faster...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The dog lunges at me, and I finally manage to move. I turn to run, but I trip and fall. I can feel the ground scraping my hands and knees. The dog is right behind me, and I can hear its heavy breathing. I'm so scared... I can't...",
    "Therapist: It's okay. Take a deep breath. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: I roll over, and the dog is right there, snapping at my face. I throw my arm up to protect myself, and I feel its teeth sink into my forearm. The pain is intense, burning... I'm screaming, but it feels like no sound is coming out. I can smell the dog's breath, and it's making me nauseous...",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm kicking at the dog, trying to get it off me, but it's so strong. I can feel its claws digging into my chest as it stands over me. My arm is throbbing, and I can see blood... so much blood. I think I'm going to pass out...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you survived this.",
    "Client: Suddenly, I hear shouting. Someone is running towards us. The dog lets go of my arm and turns towards the sound. It's a man with a stick, yelling and waving his arms. The dog backs off, growling, and then runs away. I'm lying there, shaking, crying... The man is asking if I'm okay, but I can't speak. I just keep staring at my arm, watching the blood pool on the ground...",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel shaky. My heart is still racing, and I can almost feel the pain in my arm again. But... I also feel a little relieved. Like I made it through telling the story.",
    "Therapist: You did very well. How do you feel about sharing that memory?",
    "Client: It was hard. Really hard. But... I guess it wasn't as overwhelming as I thought it would be. I mean, I still felt scared and anxious, but I didn't completely lose it like I thought I might.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: I think... the helplessness. How frozen I felt at first, and then how powerless I was against the dog. It reminds me of... other times I've felt powerless.",
    "Therapist: Can you elaborate on that?",
    "Client: Well, it's like when my parents used to criticize me constantly. I'd freeze up, unable to defend myself, just like with the dog. And now, being unemployed and living with them again, I sometimes feel that same helplessness.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does recognizing that connection feel?",
    "Client: It's... eye-opening, I guess. And a little scary. But also, maybe... helpful? Like understanding it might help me deal with it better.",
    "Therapist: That's a great insight. How do you feel physically now?",
    "Client: I'm still a bit shaky, but it's getting better. My breathing is slowing down, and the tightness in my chest is easing up. I feel... tired, but also kind of accomplished.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've done difficult work today.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess I have. It's strange... talking about it was horrible, but now that it's over, I feel... I don't know, lighter maybe? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying around.",
    "Therapist: That's often how it works. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... maybe we could talk more about how this connects to my relationship with my parents? And maybe strategies for dealing with those feelings of helplessness?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling about ending our session?",
    "Client: I'm okay. A bit drained, but okay. I think I'll take it easy for the rest of the day, maybe do some of those breathing exercises we talked about.",
    "Therapist: That's a great idea. Take care of yourself, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. This was tough, but... I'm glad we did it. See you next week."
