    "Therapist: Welcome back, Carlos. Are you ready to continue our imaginal exposure exercise today?",
    "Client: I think so... I'm a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with your SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 right now. Just thinking about revisiting those memories makes me tense up a bit.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Let's begin when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in the compound. The walls are this sickly beige color, and there's this constant hum from the fluorescent lights. I can smell incense burning... it's supposed to be calming, but it just makes me nauseous now. The leader, he's standing at the front of the room, his voice is so... commanding. He's telling us that our families don't understand, that they're trying to poison our minds against the \"truth.\" I feel so conflicted, part of me wants to believe him, but there's this knot in my stomach...",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe a 6? My palms are getting sweaty, and my heart's beating faster.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue when ready.",
    "Client: He's singling people out now, making them confess their \"doubts\" in front of everyone. I'm terrified he'll pick me next. I can feel the eyes of everyone in the room, judging, waiting. My mouth is dry, and I'm trying so hard not to show any emotion on my face. He's getting closer to where I'm sitting, and I... I can't breathe properly. It feels like the walls are closing in...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. God, it feels so real. My chest is tight, and I'm starting to shake a little.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep going if you can.",
    "Client: He's looking right at me now, those piercing eyes. He asks me to stand up, to tell everyone about my commitment to the cause. I feel like I'm going to throw up. The words come out of my mouth, but they don't feel like mine. I'm praising him, the group, saying how they saved me from my \"misguided\" family. But inside, I'm screaming. I hate myself for saying these things, for betraying my loved ones. But I'm so scared of what will happen if I don't...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. A 9, maybe? I feel like I'm right back there, and the shame and fear are overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Remember, you're safe now.",
    "Client: I... I need a moment. (deep breaths) Okay... After my \"confession,\" he puts his hand on my shoulder, tells me I've done well. But his touch makes my skin crawl. I want to run, but I'm frozen in place. The rest of the group is nodding, smiling, but their eyes look empty. I feel so alone, so trapped. I can't believe I let myself get into this situation. I'm angry at myself, at him, at everyone who's buying into this lie...",
    "Therapist: Check in with your SUDS.",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. An 8, I think. My anger is building, but so is this deep sadness.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue when ready.",
    "Client: The session ends, and everyone's milling about, talking in hushed tones. I'm trying to slip away, but people keep coming up to me, congratulating me on my \"breakthrough.\" Each word of praise feels like a knife. I manage to get to my room, and as soon as the door closes, I collapse. I'm sobbing, but silently - I can't let anyone hear. I feel so lost, so betrayed, not just by them but by myself. How could I have fallen for this? How can I get out? I'm terrified of what they'll do if I try to leave, but I'm more scared of staying...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 6? I'm feeling drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I'm finally facing this.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. How do you feel about ending here?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think that's good. I'm exhausted, but... I feel like I've confronted something important.",
