    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like I'm back there again, you know? My heart's racing, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. The memory of her words, they're just echoing in my head. \"You're worthless,\" she said. God, it still hurts so much.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What else are you noticing right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking a bit. My hands are clammy. It's like I'm that scared little boy again, cowering in the corner while she screams at me. I can smell the alcohol on her breath, see the fury in her eyes. I feel so small, so... insignificant.",
    "Therapist: And what thoughts are coming up for you?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... maybe she was right. Maybe I am worthless. I mean, look at me now. My marriage is falling apart, and I can't help but wonder if it's because I'm just... not good enough. Never have been, never will be. It's like her words have become a self-fulfilling prophecy.",
    "Therapist: How does that belief impact you today?",
    "Client: It's... it's crippling, honestly. In my work, in my relationships... I'm always second-guessing myself. Always waiting for the other shoe to drop, you know? Like, even with my wife, I keep expecting her to realize that I'm not... that I'm not worthy of her love. And now that we're talking about divorce, it feels like confirmation of everything my mother said.",
    "Therapist: I see. What else comes up when you think about your marriage ending?",
    "Client: Fear. Overwhelming fear. I'm 68, for crying out loud. The thought of being alone at this age... it terrifies me. But at the same time, there's this small part of me that feels... relief? Like maybe I won't have to pretend to be good enough anymore. God, that sounds awful, doesn't it?",
    "Therapist: There's no right or wrong way to feel. What do you make of that relief?",
    "Client: I... I guess it's because being in a relationship, especially a marriage, it's constant pressure. Pressure to be the man she deserves, to live up to expectations. And I've always felt like I'm falling short. So the idea of not having to meet those expectations anymore... it's almost freeing. But then I hate myself for feeling that way. Shouldn't I want to fight for my marriage?",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your past experiences?",
    "Client: It's... it's like history repeating itself. My mother made me feel unworthy, and now I'm losing my wife. It's like I'm that helpless child again, watching my world fall apart and feeling powerless to stop it. I've spent my whole life trying to prove her wrong, trying to be worthy of love and respect. And now... now it feels like I've failed.",
    "Therapist: And how does that make you feel right now?",
    "Client: Angry. So, so angry. At my mother, at myself, at the world. I want to scream, to break something. But mostly, I just feel... tired. Bone-deep exhausted. Like I've been fighting this battle my whole life and I just can't do it anymore. And beneath all that... there's this profound sadness. This ache in my chest that feels like it'll never go away.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Part of me wants to curl up and disappear. Another part wants to rage against the unfairness of it all. But mostly... mostly I think I just need someone to tell me that I'm not worthless. That I have value, regardless of what my mother said or what's happening with my marriage. Is that... is that too much to ask?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. How can we work towards that?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. It's hard to undo a lifetime of believing you're not good enough. But... maybe... maybe if I could start recognizing the good things about myself? The things I've accomplished, the people I've helped... Maybe if I could learn to see myself through kinder eyes, it would help? I don't know. It feels impossible right now.",
    "Therapist: That's a great starting point. What's one positive thing about yourself?",
    "Client: Oh, um... well, I suppose I'm a good listener. My colleagues often come to me for advice or just to vent. And I've been told I have a calming presence. That's... that's something positive, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How does acknowledging that make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... strange. There's this little spark of warmth in my chest. But it's also scary. Like I'm waiting for someone to contradict me or point out why it's not true. It's hard to hold onto that good feeling without doubting it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm noticing that my breathing has slowed down a bit. The tightness in my chest isn't as bad. And... and I'm realizing that even though I'm going through this difficult time, I'm here. I'm seeking help. That takes some strength, doesn't it? Maybe... maybe I'm not as worthless as I thought.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... comforting, in a way. Like a small ray of hope breaking through the clouds. I mean, I still have a long way to go. The pain from my childhood, the fear about my marriage ending... it's all still there. But maybe, just maybe, I have the strength to face it. To work through it. I don't know if I believe that fully yet, but... I want to. I really want to.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. Where do you want to go from here?",
    "Client: I think... I think I want to explore this more. To dig deeper into these feelings and memories. It's terrifying, and I know it's going to be painful. But if there's even a chance that I can break free from this cycle, that I can learn to see myself differently... I want to try. I owe it to myself, don't I? After all these years of believing I wasn't worth it, maybe it's time to prove myself wrong.",
    "Therapist: That's a courageous decision. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... cautiously optimistic, I suppose. Still scared, still hurting, but... there's a glimmer of something else. Hope, maybe? It's faint, but it's there. And for the first time in a long while, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I have the strength to keep going. To face this head-on and see where it leads. It's not much, but it's... it's something. And right now, that feels like enough.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. This session has been... intense. But in a good way, I think. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've put down a burden I didn't even know I was carrying. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know we have a long road ahead, but I'm... I'm grateful for your help.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Take care, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'll see you then. And... thank you again. For everything."
