    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's this knot in my stomach, you know? Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is screaming to run out that door.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 6 right now. My hands are a bit clammy.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we're here to process this together. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I guess so. *deep breath* Where should I start?",
    "Therapist: Start with the beginning of the combat experience we discussed last time.",
    "Client: Right. Okay. *pause* It's early morning. The air is thick with humidity, and I can smell diesel fumes from the convoy. We're loading up, checking our gear. My hands are shaking slightly as I adjust my helmet.",
    "Therapist: Good. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The weight of my body armor. It's... it's suffocating in this heat. I can hear the low murmur of voices, guys cracking nervous jokes. My mouth is dry. God, I'm so thirsty.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: We... we start moving out. The vehicle lurches, and I'm squished between two other soldiers. Our knees are touching. I can feel the sweat trickling down my back. *voice wavers* I'm scared. So damn scared.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe an 8? My heart's racing.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Okay. We're driving through the city now. Eyes scanning rooftops, windows. Every piece of trash on the road could be an IED. My finger's resting on the trigger guard. I'm so tense it hurts.",
    "Therapist: What do you see around you?",
    "Client: Dusty buildings, some with bullet holes. A few locals watching us pass. Children... there are children playing in an alley. God, they shouldn't be out here. *voice breaks* What if...",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What happens next?",
    "Client: *swallows hard* There's a loud crack. Gunfire. Someone's shouting \"Contact left!\" I'm swinging my weapon around, trying to spot the shooter. My ears are ringing. I can smell cordite.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Terrified. Angry. My whole body's on fire with adrenaline. I'm returning fire, but I can't see the enemy. Just muzzle flashes from a window.",
    "Therapist: Keep going. You're doing great.",
    "Client: The vehicle stops. We're dismounting. I hit the ground hard, scrambling for cover. There's this deafening noise - our .50 cal is lighting up the building. I can feel the impacts through the ground.",
    "Therapist: What's happening to your body?",
    "Client: I'm shaking. Can't catch my breath. My mouth tastes like metal. I'm yelling something, but I can't even hear my own voice over the gunfire.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: Nine. Maybe higher. *breathing heavily*",
    "Therapist: Remember your grounding technique. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: *exhales slowly* Right. Okay. *pause* We're advancing on the building. Smoke everywhere. I can hear screaming - I don't know if it's us or them. We breach the door and... *voice cracks* There's a body. A civilian. An old man.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What do you see?",
    "Client: Blood. So much blood. His eyes are open, staring at nothing. I... I think I'm going to be sick.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* I can't look away. Someone's shouting to keep moving, but I'm frozen. Then there's more gunfire, closer this time. I snap out of it, pushing forward.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Numb. Like I'm watching myself from outside my body. We're clearing rooms, but it's all a blur. Muzzle flashes, the thud of bodies falling. The smell of blood and gunpowder is overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What happens next?",
    "Client: We reach the roof. I can see the whole city from up here. It's... strangely beautiful. Then I hear a whistle - incoming mortar. I'm yelling for everyone to get down.",
    "Therapist: What's your body doing?",
    "Client: I'm throwing myself to the ground, covering my head. The explosion is so loud, I feel it in my chest. Debris is raining down. Someone's screaming - it's Jones. His leg... oh god, his leg is...",
    "Therapist: Take a breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *shaky breath* I'm crawling to him, trying to apply a tourniquet. There's so much blood. I can hear the radio crackling - someone calling for medevac. Jones is going into shock, his eyes rolling back.",
    "Therapist: How are you handling this?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm trying to stay focused. Keep pressure on the wound. Talk to Jones. But inside, I'm falling apart. I can't let him die. I can't.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: Ten. Definitely a ten. *voice trembling*",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Remember, you're here now, safe.",
    "Client: *nods* The medevac arrives. We're loading Jones onto the helicopter. The rotors are kicking up dust, stinging my eyes. As they lift off, I realize... my hands are covered in his blood.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: Empty. Drained. Like the world has stopped making sense. We still have to clear the rest of the building, but I feel like I'm moving underwater.",
    "Therapist: Continue. What happens as you go back in?",
    "Client: We're moving room to room. My movements are mechanical. I'm hyper-aware of every sound, every shadow. We find two insurgents, wounded. They're taken prisoner. I can't look at their faces.",
    "Therapist: How does that affect you?",
    "Client: I... I feel conflicted. Part of me is glad we got them, but another part... they look so young. Not much older than kids. I wonder about their families, their stories.",
    "Therapist: That's a natural response. What occurs next?",
    "Client: The all-clear is finally called. We're heading back to base. The adrenaline's wearing off, and I'm starting to shake. Someone hands me a bottle of water, but I can barely hold it.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel now?",
    "Client: Heavy. So heavy. Every muscle aches. My ears are still ringing. I feel... dirty. Like I'll never be clean again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's check in - what's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down. Maybe a 7 now? I'm exhausted.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Can you describe the return to base?",
    "Client: It's a blur. Debriefing, turning in weapons. I remember standing in the shower, watching red-tinged water swirl down the drain. I can't stop seeing Jones' face, the old man's empty eyes.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with these images?",
    "Client: I... I don't. Not really. I try to push them away, focus on routine. Clean my gear, write letters home. But when I close my eyes, it's all there waiting for me.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. How does it affect your sleep?",
    "Client: Sleep? *bitter laugh* I don't sleep. I just... exist in this twilight state. When I do drift off, the nightmares come. I wake up screaming, drenched in sweat.",
    "Therapist: How do your fellow soldiers react?",
    "Client: They... they understand. No one says anything. We all have our demons. Some guys drink, some work out until they're ready to collapse. Me? I volunteer for extra patrols. Anything to keep moving.",
    "Therapist: How does that impact you over time?",
    "Client: It's... it's like I'm hollowing out. Each day, each mission, I feel less human. More like a machine. The fear is always there, but it's buried under layers of numbness.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Let's pause here. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. Like I've been through it all again. But... also lighter, somehow? Like I've set down a heavy pack.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5, I think. Still shaky, but... manageable.",
    "Therapist: Excellent work today, Sarah. Let's do some grounding exercises before we end.",
    "Client: Okay. *deep breath* Thank you. I... I never thought I could talk about this.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. We'll continue working through this together."
