    "Therapist: How are you feeling after going through that memory today?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. My heart is still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. But at the same time, there's this strange sense of relief? Like, I actually got through it without completely falling apart. I didn't think I could do that.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most about the experience?",
    "Client: The sounds, definitely. The explosions and gunfire... they felt so real. And the smell of smoke and dust. It's like I was right back there in that moment. I could feel the fear gripping my chest, you know? But this time, I was able to remind myself that I'm safe now. It's in the past.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant observation. How does this relate to your day-to-day experiences?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... I'm starting to see how those memories have been affecting me. Like, when I hear a loud noise or smell something that reminds me of that day, I usually panic. But going through it here, in a safe space, it's helping me realize that those triggers don't have to control me. It's hard, but I'm learning to separate then from now.",
    "Therapist: I see. What else did you notice about your reactions?",
    "Client: I felt so guilty. There was this moment when I couldn't save my friend, and I've always blamed myself. But talking about it out loud, I'm starting to understand that there was nothing more I could have done. It doesn't make it easier, but... maybe I can start to forgive myself?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How might this impact your recovery?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I can start being kinder to myself? Like, instead of beating myself up every time I have a flashback or a nightmare, I can remember that I'm working through it. It's a process, right? And maybe I can start opening up more to my partner about what I'm going through. I've been so scared to burden her with all this.",
    "Therapist: Hmm. What's giving you the courage to consider opening up?",
    "Client: I guess... going through this exposure and realizing I can face these memories without completely falling apart. It makes me feel stronger, you know? Like maybe I can handle talking about it with someone I trust. And honestly, keeping it all bottled up hasn't been helping. I'm tired of feeling so alone in this.",
    "Therapist: That's insightful. How do you feel about continuing with the exposures?",
    "Client: It's scary, for sure. But I'm starting to see the value in it. Each time we do this, it gets a little easier to separate the past from the present. I'm nervous about what other memories might come up, but I'm also... kind of hopeful? Like, maybe this really can help me get my life back. I want to be able to enjoy things again without constantly looking over my shoulder.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your honesty. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... maybe we could work on some of the guilt I'm feeling? Like, explore why I feel so responsible for everything that happened. And maybe talk more about how I can start communicating with my partner about all this. I want to let her in, but I'm not sure how to even begin that conversation.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted, honestly. But in a good way, if that makes sense? Like I've done something really hard but important. I'm proud of myself for getting through it, even though it was tough. And I'm grateful for your support. It helps to know I'm not alone in this process.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Remember to use your coping strategies.",
    "Client: Thank you, I will. I'll try that breathing exercise we practiced and maybe go for a walk later. It helps clear my head. I'm looking forward to our next session, even though I know it'll be challenging. But I'm starting to believe that I can get through this, you know? It's a small step, but it feels like a big one for me.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive outlook. Take care, and I'll see you next time.",
    "Client: Thanks, doc. See you then."
