    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Can you describe the animal attack incident?",
    "Client: Okay... I was walking in the park near my house. It was a sunny day, and I decided to take a shortcut through a wooded area. I remember hearing rustling in the bushes, and suddenly, a large dog came charging at me. It was growling and barking... I froze in fear.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: The dog lunged at me, and I felt its teeth sink into my leg. I screamed in pain and terror. I tried to back away, but I stumbled and fell. The dog kept coming at me, snapping and growling. I could smell its hot breath, and its eyes looked so fierce. I thought I was going to die right there.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) I... I can't. It's too much. I feel like I'm back there again.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're doing great.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay... I remember trying to protect my face with my arms. The dog was relentless, biting at my arms and legs. I could feel the warm blood trickling down my skin. I was crying and screaming for help, but no one seemed to hear me. The attack felt like it lasted forever.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Finally, I heard someone shouting. An older man came running with a stick, yelling at the dog. The dog backed off, and the man helped me up. I was shaking uncontrollably, and my clothes were torn and bloody. I couldn't stop crying. The man called an ambulance, and I remember feeling so ashamed and helpless as people gathered around.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (sniffling) The paramedics arrived, and they started treating my wounds. I was in shock, I think. I couldn't stop shaking, and I felt so cold. They took me to the hospital, and I had to get stitches and rabies shots. The whole time, I kept replaying the attack in my mind. I felt so vulnerable and afraid.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job describing this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel anxious and scared, but also a bit relieved. It's hard to talk about, but somehow it feels a little easier each time. I still have nightmares about dogs attacking me, though. And I can't go to that park anymore. I'm always on edge when I'm outside, especially if I hear a dog barking.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You're making progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's just... this incident changed me. I used to love animals, but now I'm terrified of dogs. I feel so weak and powerless. Sometimes, I wonder if I could have done something differently to prevent the attack. Maybe if I hadn't taken that shortcut...",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. You're very brave for sharing this.",
    "Client: (sighs) I know you're right, but it's hard to believe sometimes. The attack has affected my daily life so much. I avoid parks and open spaces. I'm always looking over my shoulder. It's exhausting being this afraid all the time. I miss the person I used to be before this happened.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. You're working hard to heal.",
    "Client: I am trying. It's just... sometimes I feel like I'll never be the same again. The fear is always there, lurking in the background. Even now, talking about it, my heart is racing, and I feel tense all over. But I want to get better. I want to be able to enjoy walks again without constantly being afraid.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage. Let's continue next session.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you for listening and guiding me through this. It's difficult, but I think it's helping. I feel a bit lighter after talking about it, even though it's still painful. I hope that one day, I'll be able to think about this without feeling so overwhelmed by fear and anxiety.",
    "Therapist: You're making excellent progress. We'll end here for today."
