    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. This whole cyber bullying thing has been eating at me, and I'm not sure I'm ready to dive back into it.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Remember, we're here to work through this together. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 6 out of 10. My stomach's in knots just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Let's begin. Close your eyes and describe the incident.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm sitting at my desk, it's late evening. The house is quiet, Sarah's already gone to bed. I'm scrolling through my social media, just unwinding after a long day. Then... then I see it. A comment on one of my business posts. It's... it's vicious.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: The screen's too bright in the dark room. The words... they're accusing me of fraud, of cheating customers. It's not true, none of it's true! But it's there for everyone to see.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My heart's racing. I can feel it pounding in my ears. My hands are shaking, I can barely hold the mouse.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I try to respond. To defend myself. But more comments pop up. It's like they were waiting. They're calling me names, threatening to report me. I can't keep up.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe higher. I feel sick.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I want to wake Sarah, to tell her what's happening. But I'm ashamed. What if she believes them? I feel so alone, so helpless. The comments keep coming, faster than I can read them.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking my business is ruined. Everything I've worked for, gone in an instant. These faceless people, they don't know me, but they're destroying me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I shut down the computer. I can't look anymore. But I can't sleep either. I keep imagining what people are saying, who's seeing it. I toss and turn all night.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you're lying there?",
    "Client: Tense. So tense. My jaw is clenched, my fists are balled up. I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe a 9. I can feel the panic rising again, just like that night.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going. What happens in the morning?",
    "Client: I... I don't want to get up. But I have to check. The comments have multiplied overnight. Some of my regular customers are asking questions, doubting me. I feel... I feel betrayed. Exposed.",
    "Therapist: What do you do?",
    "Client: I try to respond, to explain. But my hands are shaking so badly I can barely type. Each notification sound makes me flinch. I feel like I'm under attack.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I realize I haven't eaten. Haven't showered. Sarah's worried, asking what's wrong. But I can't tell her. I'm supposed to be strong, to handle things. But I'm falling apart.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: That I'm a failure. That everything I've built is crumbling. That I can't protect myself or my family from this... this invisible threat.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. How's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8 now. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I start to withdraw. I cancel appointments, ignore calls. I can't face anyone. What if they've seen the comments? What if they believe them?",
    "Therapist: How does this affect your daily life?",
    "Client: It... it consumes me. I can't focus on work. I keep checking online, hoping the comments will disappear. But they don't. They multiply. I feel... I feel like I'm drowning.",
    "Therapist: What do you wish you could do in that moment?",
    "Client: I... I wish I could make it all stop. Erase it all. Go back to before this happened. I feel so powerless, so exposed.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What else comes up?",
    "Client: Anger. I'm angry at these faceless accusers. At the internet for giving them a platform. At myself for not being able to fight back effectively.",
    "Therapist: How does this anger manifest?",
    "Client: I... I lash out at Sarah. She's trying to help, but I push her away. I'm ashamed of my weakness, my inability to handle this.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe a 7. Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also... I don't know, releasing something.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going. What happens as days pass?",
    "Client: The comments slow down, but the damage is done. I've lost customers. My reputation... it feels tarnished. I struggle to rebuild, to trust again.",
    "Therapist: How does this affect your relationships?",
    "Client: I... I become distant. Even with Sarah. I'm always on edge, waiting for the next attack. I feel like I can't be vulnerable, can't trust anyone fully.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your thoughts during this time?",
    "Client: They're... they're dark. Spiraling. I keep replaying the comments in my head, imagining worst-case scenarios. I struggle to see a way forward.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you think about this?",
    "Client: Heavy. Like there's a weight on my chest. My shoulders are tense, my jaw clenched. I realize I've been holding my breath.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Let it out slowly. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's around a 6 now. Talking about it... it's helping, somehow.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going. How do you start to cope?",
    "Client: I... I finally tell Sarah everything. It's hard, but her support... it helps. We work together to respond to the false claims, to reach out to loyal customers.",
    "Therapist: How does this make you feel?",
    "Client: Vulnerable, but also... stronger, somehow. Like I'm not facing this alone anymore.",
    "Therapist: What else changes as you start to address the situation?",
    "Client: I... I start to set boundaries. I limit my time online, focus on the customers and work I can control. It's hard, but it helps me feel more grounded.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you make these changes?",
    "Client: Less tense. I notice I'm breathing easier. The knot in my stomach... it's still there, but it's looser.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 5. Talking through it, remembering how I started to cope... it helps.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Drained, but... also lighter, somehow. Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for too long.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after these sessions. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm focusing on my breathing. I can feel the chair supporting me. The room feels... safer now.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. We'll end here for today. You've made great progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was tough, but... I think it's helping. I feel more equipped to face this now.",
    "Therapist: That's the goal. We'll continue working on this. For now, take care of yourself.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again."
