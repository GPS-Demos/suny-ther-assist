    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Lee. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Chen. I'm... a bit nervous, to be honest. I know we've been working towards this, but the idea of revisiting that day with the dog attack... it's making me quite anxious.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's discuss the imaginal exposure.",
    "Client: Alright. I've been wondering about this. What exactly will we be doing? And... is it really necessary? I mean, I've been trying so hard to forget that day.",
    "Therapist: It helps process the trauma. We'll revisit the memory safely.",
    "Client: Process the trauma? But won't that just make everything worse? I've been having nightmares about it already. I'm worried this might intensify them.",
    "Therapist: Actually, it often reduces nightmares. Your reactions are normal.",
    "Client: Really? That's... surprising. I guess I always thought avoiding it was the best way to handle it. But if you think this will help... I trust your expertise, Dr. Chen. Can you tell me more about what to expect?",
    "Therapist: We'll go through the memory step-by-step. You're in control.",
    "Client: That's somewhat reassuring. But I'm still concerned about how I might react. What if I panic? Or what if I can't handle it and need to stop?",
    "Therapist: We can pause anytime. I'll guide you through grounding techniques.",
    "Client: Okay, that's good to know. I appreciate your support, Dr. Chen. I've been carrying this burden for so long... the constant anxiety, the flashbacks. If this can help, I'm willing to try. But... how long will this process take?",
    "Therapist: It varies. We'll go at your pace. Your courage is admirable.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot. I've been feeling so... trapped by this experience. My wife has been incredibly supportive, but I know it's been hard on her too. I want to get better, not just for me, but for her as well. Do you think this could help with the anxiety I've been experiencing in other areas of my life too?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it often helps reduce overall anxiety symptoms.",
    "Client: That would be wonderful. I've noticed my work has been affected too. It's been harder to concentrate, and sometimes I find myself getting unnecessarily agitated with colleagues. I'm hoping this therapy can help me regain some normalcy in my professional life as well.",
    "Therapist: It's likely to improve various aspects of your life.",
    "Client: I'm feeling a mix of hope and apprehension now. It's a strange feeling. On one hand, I'm terrified of reliving that day, but on the other, I'm hopeful that this could be a turning point. Dr. Chen, how will you ensure that I don't become too overwhelmed during the process?",
    "Therapist: We'll use coping strategies. Your safety is my priority.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I appreciate your patience with all my questions. I suppose I'm just trying to prepare myself as best I can. Is there anything I should do to get ready for our next session when we actually start the imaginal exposure?",
    "Therapist: Just come as you are. We'll start slowly and carefully.",
    "Client: Alright, I can do that. Thank you, Dr. Chen. I'm still nervous, but I feel more prepared now. I'm grateful for your guidance and support through this process. I hope this will be the beginning of a real change for me.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is commendable. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm ready to take this step, despite my fears. I know it won't be easy, but I'm hopeful for the first time in a long while. Is there anything else I should know before we conclude today's session?",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're stronger than you think. See you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Chen. Those words mean a lot to me. I'll hold onto that thought as I prepare for our next session. I'm looking forward to it, despite my nervousness. Have a good week, and I'll see you then.",
    "Therapist: Take care, Mr. Lee. You're doing great."
