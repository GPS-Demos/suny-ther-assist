    "Therapist: Welcome, Tom. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to dive into some heavy stuff today, and part of me wants to just bolt out the door. But I'm here, so I guess that's something, right?",
    "Therapist: That's great self-awareness. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 6 or 7 out of 10. My stomach's in knots.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Where should I start?",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day at work. Describe what you see.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm at my desk. It's early, maybe 8:30 AM. The office is quiet, but there's this... tension in the air. I can smell coffee brewing in the break room. My boss, Mark, he's... he's walking towards me with this look on his face. God, my heart's already racing...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: Mark stops at my desk. He's looming over me, and I feel so small. He starts criticizing my latest project, but it's not just professional. He's getting personal, saying things like, \"I knew hiring you was a mistake\" and \"You'll never amount to anything in this industry.\" His voice is so cold, so dismissive. I can feel my face getting hot with shame.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe an 8?",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... So, Mark's still going on about how incompetent I am. Other coworkers are starting to arrive, and I can feel their eyes on us. Some look sympathetic, others are pretending not to notice. I want to defend myself, but my throat feels tight. I can't get any words out. My hands are shaking as I try to pull up the project files on my computer.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay in the moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... humiliated. Angry. But mostly, I feel powerless. Like I'm drowning and everyone's just watching. Mark's words are like daggers, each one chipping away at my self-esteem. I'm trying to explain my reasoning for the project choices, but he's not listening. He cuts me off, saying, \"Save your excuses. This is why you'll always be at the bottom of the ladder.\"",
    "Therapist: And your body? What sensations are you experiencing?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. It's hard to breathe. My palms are sweaty, and I feel lightheaded. I'm gripping the edge of my desk so hard my knuckles are white. I just want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here now. You're safe. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: Thanks... It's just... it's so vivid. I can still hear the contempt in his voice, see the disgust in his eyes. He finally walks away, but the damage is done. I sit there, trying not to cry, feeling like a complete failure. The worst part is, a small part of me believes him. Maybe I am worthless...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's pretty high. A 9, I think.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Let's take a few deep breaths together.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... I'm still at my desk. The initial shock is wearing off, but now I'm spiraling. All I can think about is how I'm going to lose my job, how I'll never find another one. I'm replaying every mistake I've ever made, convinced that Mark is right about me. The rest of the day is a blur. I can't focus on anything. Every time someone walks by my desk, I flinch, expecting more criticism.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens as the day progresses?",
    "Client: It's... it's awful. I feel like everyone's whispering about me. Lunch comes around, and I can't even think about eating. I hide in a bathroom stall for a while, trying to pull myself together. When I get back to my desk, there's an email from Mark demanding a complete revision of the project by tomorrow morning. I feel sick to my stomach. I know I'll be here all night, and it still won't be good enough.",
    "Therapist: How are you coping with these emotions in the moment?",
    "Client: I'm not, really. I'm just... numb. Going through the motions. I stay late, working on the revisions. The office empties out, and I'm alone with my thoughts. Every line of code I write, every decision I make, I'm second-guessing myself. I keep hearing Mark's voice in my head, telling me I'm worthless. By the time I finish, it's past midnight. I'm exhausted, both physically and emotionally.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe a 7? I'm feeling drained just remembering it all.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Let's continue. What happens when you leave the office?",
    "Client: I pack up my things, feeling like a zombie. The night air hits me as I leave the building, and it's like I can breathe again for the first time all day. But then the anxiety creeps back in. I'm dreading coming back tomorrow, facing Mark again. The walk to the subway is a blur. On the train, I'm hyper-aware of everyone around me, convinced they can see what a failure I am.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm questioning everything. My career choice, my abilities, my worth as a person. I'm thinking about my parents and how disappointed they'd be if they knew how badly I was doing. I'm wondering if I should just quit, move back home, start over. But then I remember my student loans, my rent... I feel trapped. Like there's no way out.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. How does the night end?",
    "Client: I get home late, maybe around 1 AM. My roommate's asleep, so the apartment's dark and quiet. I don't even bother turning on the lights. I just collapse on my bed, still in my work clothes. I'm exhausted, but my mind won't shut off. I keep replaying the day, thinking of all the things I should have said or done differently. I barely sleep, and when my alarm goes off a few hours later, I feel sick at the thought of going back.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level as we finish this memory?",
    "Client: It's... it's back up to an 8, I think. My heart's racing again, just thinking about facing another day like that.",
    "Therapist: You've done an incredible job. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... I'm here. In your office. It's... it's over.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You're safe now. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. But also... I don't know, maybe a little proud? I got through it. Talking about it... it was hard, but I did it.",
    "Therapist: You absolutely did. You showed immense courage. Let's debrief..."
