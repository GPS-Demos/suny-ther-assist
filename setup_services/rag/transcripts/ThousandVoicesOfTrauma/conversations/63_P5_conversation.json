    "Therapist: Mr. Johnson, today we'll be doing imaginal exposure. Are you familiar with this?",
    "Client: Not really, doc. Is it something to do with my memories? I'm not sure I'm ready to face all that again. You know, with everything that's happened...",
    "Therapist: It is. We'll revisit your trauma memories safely. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: Honestly? Terrified. I've spent years trying to forget. The neglect, the illness... it's all too much. I'm not sure I can handle it. What if I lose control?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace. How can I support you?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Maybe just be patient with me? I might need to stop sometimes. It's hard to talk about this stuff, especially at my age. I thought I'd left it all behind when I retired, but it seems to have caught up with me. And with the drinking... well, it's complicated.",
    "Therapist: I understand. We'll take breaks as needed. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Will this actually help? I mean, I've been carrying this burden for decades. How can talking about it now make a difference? And what if it makes things worse? I'm already struggling with my substance use...",
    "Therapist: Good question. Exposure often reduces PTSD symptoms over time. Shall we discuss how?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I need to understand what I'm getting into. It's not easy for me to trust this process, you know. I've been let down so many times before. But I'm here, aren't I? I guess that's a start.",
    "Therapist: It is. Your courage is commendable. Let's explore how this can help you heal.",
    "Client: Alright, I'm listening. But I want you to know that this is really hard for me. I've never talked about this with anyone before. Not even my ex-wife knew the full extent of what I went through. It's... it's like opening Pandora's box.",
    "Therapist: I hear you. Your bravery is remarkable. Shall we begin?"
