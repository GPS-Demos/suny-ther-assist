    "Therapist: Welcome, Amara. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares about the animal attack lately, and I'm not sure I'm ready to face it head-on.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's discuss the imaginal exposure we've planned.",
    "Client: Imaginal exposure? That sounds... intense. Can you explain what that means exactly? I'm not sure I like the sound of it.",
    "Therapist: It's a technique to help process your trauma. We'll revisit the memory safely.",
    "Client: Revisit the memory? I've been trying so hard to avoid thinking about it. The idea of purposely bringing it up makes my heart race. How is that supposed to help?",
    "Therapist: By confronting the memory, we can reduce its power over you.",
    "Client: I see... but what if I can't handle it? What if I completely fall apart during the session? I'm already struggling with depression, and I'm worried this might make everything worse.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace and I'll support you throughout.",
    "Client: That's somewhat reassuring. But can you tell me more about what to expect? Will I have to close my eyes and relive the whole thing? The thought of that is terrifying.",
    "Therapist: You'll describe the event aloud. We can pause anytime you need to.",
    "Client: Okay... I appreciate that we can pause if needed. I'm still scared, but I want to get better. My divorce and living alone have been hard enough, and this trauma is just making everything more difficult. Do you really think this will help?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it's proven effective for PTSD. Your courage is admirable.",
    "Client: Thank you. I don't feel very courageous right now, but I'm willing to try. Can you tell me how long we'll be doing this? And what should I do if I start to panic during the exercise?",
    "Therapist: We'll start with 15-20 minutes. If you panic, we'll use grounding techniques.",
    "Client: Okay, that doesn't sound too long. I think I can manage that. And grounding techniques... like the breathing exercises we've practiced before? Those have been helpful. I'm still nervous, but I think I'm ready to give this a try.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. Your readiness is a big step. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. Just... please be patient with me if I struggle. This is all so new and scary, but I trust you. Let's do this."
