    "Therapist: Alright, Mei. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember to focus on the car accident memory. Can you start by telling me what you see?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in my car, driving home from work. It's getting dark, and I can see the streetlights coming on. The road is wet from earlier rain. I'm feeling tired after a long day...",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 3. I'm a bit nervous, but okay so far.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Alright. I'm approaching an intersection, and the light turns yellow. I decide to slow down, but suddenly I hear screeching tires behind me. In my rearview mirror, I see headlights coming fast... too fast. My heart starts racing, and I grip the steering wheel tighter. I'm frozen, I can't move...",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's going up. Maybe a 6? My palms are getting sweaty, and I feel tense all over.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The car behind me slams into my rear bumper. The impact is so strong, my head snaps back, then forward. I hear the crunch of metal, the shattering of glass. Everything's spinning... I can't breathe. I'm gasping for air, but it feels like my chest is being crushed. The airbag deploys, hitting me in the face. It's all happening so fast, yet in slow motion at the same time...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe even a 9. My heart is pounding so hard, I can hear it in my ears. I feel like I'm back there, reliving it all over again.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a deep breath. You're doing great.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) Okay... After the initial impact, there's this eerie silence. Then I hear people shouting, car horns honking. I smell gasoline and burning rubber. My vision is blurry, and I taste blood in my mouth. I'm trying to move, but my body won't respond. I'm trapped, and the fear... it's overwhelming. I think I'm going to die...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now? What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 10. I can barely breathe. My chest hurts, and I feel dizzy. It's like I'm right back in that moment...",
    "Therapist: You're safe, Mei. Remember, you're here with me. Take slow, deep breaths.",
    "Client: (Breathing heavily) I... I'm trying. It just feels so real...",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Can you tell me what you see in the room right now?",
    "Client: I... I see the blue walls. Your bookshelf. The plant in the corner...",
    "Therapist: Good. And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... coming down. Maybe a 7? I still feel shaky, but I know I'm here.",
    "Therapist: You're doing excellent. Let's continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... I hear sirens in the distance. Someone's at my window, asking if I'm okay. I can't respond. I'm just staring straight ahead, my whole body trembling. The paramedics arrive, and they're working to get me out of the car. I feel hands on me, hear voices, but it's all muffled, like I'm underwater...",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's about a 6 now. I'm feeling less panicked, but still anxious.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. Keep going, you're doing well.",
    "Client: They get me onto a stretcher. I'm being lifted into the ambulance. The lights are so bright, it hurts my eyes. I hear the paramedic talking to me, but I can't focus on what he's saying. I'm in shock, I think. My body feels numb, but my mind is racing. I keep replaying the accident in my head, over and over...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 4, I think. I'm feeling calmer, but still a bit on edge.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Mei. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm surprised. It was intense, but I got through it. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger?",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. You did very well today."
