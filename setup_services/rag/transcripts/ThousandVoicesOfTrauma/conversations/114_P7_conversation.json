    "Therapist: Welcome, Jake. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about some difficult things.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We're here to support you.",
    "Client: Thanks. I've been thinking a lot about what happened last year during that protest. It's been hard to shake off.",
    "Therapist: I see. Are you ready to explore that memory?",
    "Client: I think so. Where should I start?",
    "Therapist: Begin wherever feels natural. Take your time.",
    "Client: Okay. Well, it was a warm summer evening. I was at the Black Lives Matter protest downtown. There were so many people, all gathered for the same cause. At first, it felt empowering, you know? But then things started to get tense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Right. So, the police started to form a line. They had riot gear on, and it was intimidating. I remember feeling my heart race. I wasn't doing anything wrong, but I felt scared.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The crowd was getting louder, and suddenly, I heard a loud bang. I think it was a flash grenade or something. People started screaming and running. I froze. I couldn't move.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you remember?",
    "Client: I... I remember the smell of smoke and sweat. My mouth was dry. I saw a girl next to me get knocked down by the crowd. I wanted to help her, but I couldn't move.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Jake. Keep going.",
    "Client: Then I felt someone grab my arm. It was a police officer. He was yelling at me to move, but I couldn't understand what he was saying. Everything was so loud. I tried to explain that I wasn't doing anything wrong, but he just kept pushing me.",
    "Therapist: How did that make you feel?",
    "Client: Terrified. Helpless. I felt like I couldn't breathe. It reminded me of when I was bullied in school, that same feeling of powerlessness.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: I started to panic. I couldn't see my friends anymore. The officer was so aggressive, and I didn't know what to do. I remember thinking, \"This isn't right. This isn't what's supposed to happen.\"",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Take a deep breath if you need to.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's hard to talk about this. I ended up getting pushed to the ground. My face hit the pavement, and I tasted blood. I was sure I was going to be arrested or worse.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an incredible job. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My heart's racing just thinking about it. I feel angry and scared all over again. But... also kind of relieved to be talking about it.",

    "Therapist: You've shown a lot of strength today, Jake.",
    "Client: It feels good to talk about it, but it's exhausting. I still feel so angry about how we were treated. We were just exercising our rights.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your support. It's been hard carrying this around.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. How do you feel about stopping here for today?",
    "Client: I think that's a good idea. I feel drained, but also... lighter? Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a common feeling after processing trauma.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you for listening and guiding me through this. It means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Jake. We'll continue next session. Take care."
