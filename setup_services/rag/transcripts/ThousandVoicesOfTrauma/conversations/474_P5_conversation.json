    "Therapist: Welcome, Fatima. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Samantha. I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares lately about that dog attack I witnessed in the park. It's been hard to shake off.",
    "Therapist: I understand. We'll work through this together. Ready to discuss imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I think so. But what exactly is it? It sounds a bit scary, to be honest.",
    "Therapist: It's a technique to help process trauma memories. We'll revisit the event in a safe space.",
    "Client: Revisit it? You mean... I have to remember everything? I've been trying so hard to forget.",
    "Therapist: Yes, but it's to help you heal. Avoiding memories often increases PTSD symptoms.",
    "Client: I see. But what if I panic? Or can't handle it?",
    "Therapist: I'll be here to support you. We can pause anytime. Remember your coping strategies?",
    "Client: Deep breathing and grounding, right? I've been practicing those. They help sometimes, especially when I'm alone in my apartment and feeling overwhelmed. But this seems so much more intense.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. Those skills will be valuable here too. How else can I help you feel safe?",
    "Client: Maybe... could we have a code word if I need to stop? And perhaps keep the lights on? Darkness reminds me of that night.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's use \"pause\" as our code word. Lights will stay on.",
    "Client: Okay, that helps. Um, what should I expect to feel during this?",
    "Therapist: You might experience strong emotions or physical sensations. It's normal and temporary.",
    "Client: That sounds challenging. But I guess that's the point, right? To face these feelings head-on instead of running from them? It's just... with my depression, I worry about spiraling after.",
    "Therapist: Your concern is valid. We'll process everything afterwards. How about scheduling a check-in call?",
    "Client: That would be really helpful, thank you. I appreciate your understanding about my depression too. It's been a struggle managing both issues.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your courage is admirable. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm scared, but I also want to get better. To not let this trauma and the depression control my life anymore. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Find a comfortable position. We'll start with some relaxation exercises.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Thank you for being here with me, Dr. Samantha. It means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Fatima. Let's begin. Take a deep breath..."
