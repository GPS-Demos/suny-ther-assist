    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm honestly quite nervous, Dr. Thompson. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of reliving that awful divorce and all the bullying I went through... it's making my stomach churn. My chronic pain is also flaring up, probably from the stress. I'm not sure I can handle this.",
    "Therapist: I understand your concerns. Can you tell me more about your fears?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried that talking about it will make everything worse. What if I can't stop crying? Or what if I have a panic attack? And with my chronic pain, I'm afraid the stress might make it unbearable. Plus, I've worked so hard to move on from my ex-husband and the bullying at work. I don't want to go backwards.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How do you think facing these memories might help?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe it could help me process things better? I still have nightmares about the bullying, and I flinch whenever someone raises their voice at work. And honestly, I haven't been able to trust anyone since the divorce. If this could help me move past that, it might be worth it. But I'm still scared.",
    "Therapist: Your insight is spot-on. Shall we discuss what to expect?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I need to know what I'm getting into. Will it be like reliving everything all over again? Because I'm not sure I can handle that. The memories are still so vivid - the cruel words from my colleagues, the betrayal from my ex-husband. It's like it all happened yesterday.",
    "Therapist: It won't be exactly like reliving it. We'll go at your pace. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Well, what if I get overwhelmed? Can we stop if it becomes too much? And how long will this process take? I'm worried about the impact on my job and my current relationship. My partner has been so supportive, but I don't want to burden him with all of this resurfacing trauma.",
    "Therapist: We can pause anytime. Your comfort is crucial. How else can I support you?",
    "Client: That's reassuring to hear. I think it would help if we could have some sort of signal or word I can use if I need a break. And maybe... could we have some water and tissues nearby? I have a feeling I'm going to need them. Also, would it be okay if I brought a comfort object? I have this small stone I often hold when I'm anxious. It helps ground me.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. A signal word and comfort objects are great ideas. Anything else?",
    "Client: Thank you, that makes me feel a bit better. I'm still nervous, but I think I'm ready to try. One last thing - after the session, could we spend a few minutes talking about something positive? I'm worried about leaving here feeling raw and vulnerable. Maybe we could end by discussing some coping strategies or even just chatting about something light?",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll end on a positive note. Your courage is admirable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Okay, I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Thank you for being so patient with me, Dr. Thompson. I know this isn't easy, but I trust you. And I really hope this will help me move forward. I'm tired of feeling stuck in the past, always looking over my shoulder. If this can help me reclaim my life and feel strong again, then it's worth trying. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave, Sarah. Remember, we're in this together. Let's start slowly..."
