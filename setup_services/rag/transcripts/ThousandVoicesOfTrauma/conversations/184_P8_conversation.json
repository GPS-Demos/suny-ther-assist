    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mr. Hernandez?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like I'm back there again, you know? The ground shaking, the sound of buildings crumbling... I can still hear the screams. My heart's racing, and I feel this tightness in my chest. It's hard to breathe normally.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Overwhelming fear. It's like I'm frozen in place, watching everything fall apart around me. I keep thinking about how helpless I felt, unable to do anything to stop it. And then there's this... guilt. Why did I survive when so many others didn't?",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How does that guilt manifest for you?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a weight pressing down on me. I see the faces of people I couldn't help, hear their cries. I wonder if I could have done more, you know? Maybe if I'd been stronger, or braver, or... I don't know. It just feels like I failed them somehow.",
    "Therapist: I see. What physical sensations are you noticing as you recall these memories?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking. They're... they're clammy too. And there's this knot in my stomach that won't go away. It's like my body is reliving the whole thing, even though I know I'm safe here. I can feel my heart pounding in my ears, and I'm... I'm having trouble focusing on anything else.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. How do these sensations compare to when the event was happening?",
    "Client: It's... it's almost the same, to be honest. Maybe not quite as strong, but... God, it's so vivid. I can smell the dust in the air, feel the heat of the sun. It's like I'm right back there in that moment, watching everything crumble around me. I keep expecting the ground to start shaking again at any second.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking about how fragile everything is. How in just a few moments, your whole world can be turned upside down. I wonder if I'll ever feel truly safe again. And then there's this... this anger. Why did this have to happen? Why couldn't we have been prepared? It just seems so... so unfair.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a fire in my chest. My jaw is clenched, and I can feel tension in my shoulders. It's almost like I want to lash out, you know? But at the same time, I feel... powerless. Like no matter how angry I get, it won't change anything that happened.",
    "Therapist: I understand. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking about my family. How close I came to losing them. And then I feel guilty again because I know so many others weren't as lucky. It's like this constant cycle of fear, relief, guilt, and anger. I'm exhausted just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: How do you think this experience has changed you?",
    "Client: I... I don't think I'll ever be the same person I was before. I used to take so much for granted, you know? Now, every little tremor, every loud noise... it sets me on edge. I find myself constantly checking for exits, planning escape routes. It's like I'm always waiting for the next disaster to strike.",
    "Therapist: Mm. How has this affected your daily life?",
    "Client: It's... it's made everything harder. I have trouble sleeping, always waking up in a cold sweat from nightmares. I can't enjoy simple things like I used to. Even going out to eat at a restaurant is stressful - I'm always worried about what might happen, where I'd go if there was an emergency. It's like I've lost the ability to just... be in the moment, you know?",
    "Therapist: I see. What helps you feel grounded when these memories surface?",
    "Client: I... I try to focus on my breathing. Sometimes I'll hold onto something solid, like the arms of a chair, just to remind myself that I'm here, that I'm safe. And... talking to my wife helps. She went through it too, so she understands. Sometimes just holding her hand can bring me back to the present.",
    "Therapist: That's good. How do you feel about the progress you've made so far?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard to see sometimes. There are days when I feel like I'm right back where I started. But then I remember how I couldn't even talk about this a few months ago without breaking down completely. So I guess... I guess I am making progress. It's just slow, you know? And there's still so far to go.",
    "Therapist: What gives you hope for your continued recovery?",
    "Client: I... I think about my grandkids. I want to be able to enjoy time with them without constantly worrying. And... I want to honor the memory of those who didn't make it by living my life as fully as I can. It's hard, but... I'm trying to see this as a second chance, you know? A chance to appreciate every moment, every little thing I might have overlooked before.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful perspective. How are you feeling now compared to when we started?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm still shaken up, to be honest. But it's not as overwhelming as it was at the beginning. Talking about it... it's hard, but it also feels like... like I'm taking some of the power away from the memory, if that makes sense. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter?",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. We'll end here for today. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: I think... I think that's good. It's a lot to process, you know? But I'm glad we did this. It's hard, but... I think it's helping. Thank you for listening, for... for helping me work through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
