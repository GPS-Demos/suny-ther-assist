    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Can you take me through the moment you learned about your loved one's passing?",
    "Client: It was a Tuesday morning. I remember because I had just made my usual cup of chai. The phone rang, and it was my daughter. Her voice was shaky, and I knew something was wrong. She said, \"Dad, it's about Mom.\" My heart sank. I could barely breathe as she told me that my wife had suffered a heart attack at work and... and she didn't make it. I felt like the world stopped spinning. The chai cup slipped from my hand and shattered on the floor.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I couldn't believe it. We had been married for 45 years. Just that morning, we had breakfast together, and she kissed me goodbye before leaving for work. How could she be gone? I felt this overwhelming sense of emptiness and confusion. I remember sinking to the floor, surrounded by the broken pieces of the cup, feeling like my heart had shattered just the same.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: It's hard to describe the pain. It felt like a physical ache in my chest. I kept thinking, \"This can't be real. This must be a mistake.\" But as the hours passed, and family members started arriving at our home, the reality began to sink in. I felt so lost, so alone, even though people were around me. My wife was always the one who knew how to handle difficult situations, and now she was gone.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I remember feeling angry too. Angry at the world, at God, even at her for leaving me. Then I'd feel guilty for being angry. It was a cycle of emotions that I couldn't control. I kept replaying our last conversation in my head, wishing I had said something different, or told her I loved her one more time. The house felt so empty without her presence. Her favorite chair, her books, her clothes \u2013 everything reminded me of her, and it was unbearable.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: The nights were the worst. I couldn't sleep in our bed alone. For weeks, I slept on the couch, leaving the TV on just to have some noise in the house. I felt like I was drowning in silence otherwise. I lost interest in everything \u2013 my hobbies, my friends, even my grandchildren. Nothing seemed to matter anymore. I kept thinking, \"What's the point of it all without her?\"",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Continue.",
    "Client: I started neglecting myself. Skipping meals, not bothering to change clothes for days. Our children were worried, but I pushed them away. I didn't want their pity or their help. I wanted my wife back, and no one could give me that. The grief was all-consuming. It felt like a heavy blanket that I couldn't shake off. Every morning, I'd wake up and for a split second, I'd forget she was gone. Then the reality would hit me all over again, and the pain would be just as fresh as the first day.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming to revisit these memories. I can feel that tightness in my chest again, that sense of loss. But somehow, talking about it... it's different now. It still hurts, but it's like I can look at the pain from a distance. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely breaking down.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. You should be proud.",
    "Client: I suppose you're right. It's just... I miss her so much. Even now, years later, there are moments when I turn to tell her something and remember she's not there. But I've learned to cherish the memories we shared, to find comfort in them rather than just pain. It's a process, and some days are harder than others, but I'm trying to honor her memory by living the life she would have wanted for me.",
    "Therapist: That's a beautiful perspective. How do you feel about ending our session here?",
    "Client: I think that would be good. It's been intense, but I feel... lighter somehow. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. We'll continue next time."
