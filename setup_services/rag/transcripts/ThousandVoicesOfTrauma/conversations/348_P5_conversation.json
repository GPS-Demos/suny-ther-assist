    "Therapist: Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: I'm not sure... To be honest, I'm a bit nervous. What exactly does that mean? Is it going to be like reliving everything that happened?",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel nervous. We'll revisit your memories, but I'll guide you through it safely.",
    "Client: Okay... I guess that makes sense. But what if I get too overwhelmed? Sometimes when I think about what happened, it feels like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. If it becomes too much, we can pause. Your safety is my priority.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I appreciate that. It's just... I've tried so hard to forget those experiences. The idea of purposely remembering them is scary.",
    "Therapist: I understand. This process helps reduce the power those memories have over you. Ready to learn more?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. Can you tell me more about what we'll actually be doing?",
    "Therapist: We'll start with a specific memory. You'll describe it in detail, in the present tense, as if it's happening now.",
    "Client: That sounds intense. Will I have to close my eyes? I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that.",
    "Therapist: You can keep your eyes open if you prefer. The goal is to process the memory in a safe environment.",
    "Client: Okay, that's good to know. I think I'd feel more in control with my eyes open. How long will we do this for?",
    "Therapist: We'll start with about 30 minutes. We can adjust based on how you're coping. Any other questions?",
    "Client: I guess I'm wondering... will this actually help? I've been carrying these memories for so long, it's hard to imagine them not affecting me anymore.",
    "Therapist: Many find it helpful in reducing PTSD symptoms over time. Your courage in trying is admirable.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot. I'm still nervous, but I think I'm ready to give it a try. Can we start with a less intense memory?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll start where you're comfortable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm ready. Thank you for being so patient and explaining everything. It really helps me feel more at ease about this process."
