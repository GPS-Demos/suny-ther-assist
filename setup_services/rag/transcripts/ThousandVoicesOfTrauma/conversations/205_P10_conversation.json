    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, doctor. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is terrified. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start slowly. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. Where should I begin?",
    "Therapist: Start with the memory we discussed last time. Describe what you see, using present tense.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm... I'm in the makeshift camp near the border. It's dusty, and the air feels heavy. There are tents everywhere, and I can hear children crying in the distance. I'm sitting on a crate, my hands are shaking as I clutch a worn photograph of my family.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's happening around you?",
    "Client: There's... there's a lot of movement. People are rushing around, speaking in hushed tones. I see a group of men approaching, they look... they look dangerous. My heart is racing, I can feel sweat forming on my forehead.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'd say... maybe a 60? It's getting harder to breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here in the office with me. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... The men are getting closer. I can smell cigarette smoke and something else... maybe alcohol? One of them, he has a scar on his face, he's looking right at me. I want to run, but my legs won't move. I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he grabs my arm. His grip is so tight, it hurts. He's saying something in a language I don't understand, but his tone... it's menacing. I'm trying to pull away, but I can't. I'm screaming inside my head, but no sound comes out.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Maria. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's higher. Maybe 75? My hands are clammy.",
    "Therapist: Remember your coping strategies. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... I'm being pulled to my feet. The man with the scar is dragging me towards a truck. I can see other women already in the back, their eyes... they look so scared. Just like I feel. I'm thinking about my children, wondering if I'll ever see them again.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you experiencing?",
    "Client: I feel... helpless. Angry. Terrified. My throat is dry, and I can taste bile. I'm being shoved into the truck, and the metal floor is cold against my skin. The door slams shut, and it's dark. So dark. I can hear muffled sobs around me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Maria. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. My heart is pounding. I can almost smell the fear in that truck.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The truck starts moving. We're bouncing around, and I can feel someone's arm against mine. We're all pressed together so tightly. I'm trying to stay calm, to think of a way out, but my mind is blank. All I can focus on is the darkness and the sound of the engine.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind at this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about my family. About the life I left behind. I'm wondering if I made a mistake trying to cross the border. But then I remember why I left - the violence, the poverty. I had to give my children a chance at a better life. But now... now I don't know if I'll ever see them again.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. Maybe 85? I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Focus on your breathing. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: *breathing deeply* Okay... I'm... I'm still in the truck. We've been driving for what feels like hours. My legs are cramping, and I'm so thirsty. I can hear whimpering around me, and someone is praying softly in Spanish. I want to comfort them, but I'm too scared to speak.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: The truck stops suddenly. We all lurch forward. I can hear voices outside, men shouting. The door opens, and bright light floods in. I'm blinded for a moment. As my eyes adjust, I see we're in some kind of warehouse. There are more men, they look... they look at us like we're not even human. Like we're... merchandise.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel violated. Angry. Scared. But also... determined. I'm thinking about my children again, about how I need to survive this for them. I'm being pulled out of the truck, my legs are wobbly from sitting for so long. I stumble, and one of the men laughs. It makes my skin crawl.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 80? My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Take a deep breath if you need to.",
    "Client: *deep breath* They're... they're lining us up. I can see the other women now. Some are young, barely more than girls. Others are older, with haunted looks in their eyes. I'm in the middle, trying to stand tall, to look strong. But inside, I'm terrified.",
    "Therapist: What's happening around you?",
    "Client: The men are walking up and down the line, inspecting us. They're speaking in a language I don't understand, but their tone... it's cruel. One of them stops in front of me. He grabs my chin, forces me to look at him. His eyes are cold, empty. I want to look away, but I can't.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel like I'm not even a person anymore. Like I'm just a thing to be bought and sold. But there's also a spark of defiance. I meet his gaze, and I try to pour all my anger, all my determination into that look.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 75? My heart is racing, but I feel... I feel more in control somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Remember, you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The man moves on. I can breathe again. They're separating us now, pushing some women to one side, others to another. I don't know what it means, but I'm scared. I'm put with a group of about five other women. We're herded into a small room. It's bare, just concrete walls and a dirty floor.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm trying to stay calm. To think. I look at the other women, and I see the same fear in their eyes that I feel. But I also see strength. We're all survivors. We've all been through so much to get here. I decide then that I'm not going to give up. That somehow, I'm going to find a way out of this.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel scared, but also determined. My hands have stopped shaking. I'm looking around the room, trying to find anything we could use to escape. There's a small window, high up on one wall. It's too small for us to fit through, but maybe we could use it to signal for help.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible resilience. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's lower now. Maybe 65? I'm still scared, but I feel like I have a purpose.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's pause here for a moment. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I've faced this memory and I'm still here.",
    "Therapist: You've done exceptionally well, Maria. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end the session.",
    "Client: *breathing deeply* Thank you, doctor. I... I never thought I could talk about this without falling apart.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible courage. We'll continue working through this in our next session. For now, remember your coping strategies and be kind to yourself.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you... I think I'm starting to see that I'm stronger than I thought.",
    "Therapist: You absolutely are. We'll end here for today. Take care, Maria."
