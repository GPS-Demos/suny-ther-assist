    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Chen?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's always hard to revisit those memories of my husband's time in Vietnam. Even though I wasn't there, the stories he shared... they're so vivid in my mind. It's like I can see it all happening.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you this time?",
    "Client: The sounds. I could almost hear the helicopters and the gunfire. And my husband's voice... he sounded so young and scared when he talked about his first combat experience. It's strange, you know? I never actually heard him like that in real life. He always tried to be strong for me.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How did it feel to imagine him in that vulnerable state?",
    "Client: It's... it's heartbreaking. I feel this overwhelming urge to protect him, even though I know I can't. And then I feel guilty for not being able to do more when he was alive. He suffered so much, and I... I couldn't take that pain away.",
    "Therapist: That's a heavy burden to carry. How does it relate to your current experiences?",
    "Client: I guess... I still feel that helplessness sometimes. When I wake up from nightmares about what he went through, or when I see news about current conflicts. It's like I'm right back there, trying to comfort him but not knowing how.",
    "Therapist: I see. What strategies have helped you cope with these feelings?",
    "Client: Well, I've been trying that grounding technique you taught me. Sometimes I'll hold onto his old dog tags and focus on the feel of the metal, the weight of them. It helps bring me back to the present. And I've been writing letters to him, things I wish I could have said.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How has this process been affecting your daily life?",
    "Client: It's... it's been challenging, but I think it's helping. I'm sleeping a bit better most nights. And I've been able to talk about John more with our children without breaking down. It still hurts, but it's... it's a different kind of pain now. More... bittersweet, I suppose.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant change. What do you think has contributed to that shift?",
    "Client: I think... I think facing these memories head-on has helped. It's terrifying, but each time we do this, I feel like I understand a little more. Not just about what John went through, but about my own feelings too. It's like I'm finally allowing myself to process it all.",
    "Therapist: That's very insightful. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm scared, but I want to keep going. I want to be able to remember John without feeling overwhelmed by grief and guilt. I want to honor his memory and his service, but also find a way to live my life fully. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Your commitment is admirable. Shall we schedule our next session?",
    "Client: Yes, please. And... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. I know it's not easy to hear these stories either.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your resilience is inspiring. See you next week, Mrs. Chen."
