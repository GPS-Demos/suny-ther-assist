    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. That memory... it's so vivid, you know? I could almost smell the dust and gunpowder in the air.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sounds. God, the sounds. The explosions, the shouting, the... the screams. It's like they're echoing in my head even now. I keep thinking about Private Johnson. He was right next to me when... when it happened.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that moment?",
    "Client: Terrifying. Guilt-ridden. I... I froze. I should have done something, anything. But I just stood there, watching it all unfold. It's like I was there again, but also watching from outside my body. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. Many experience that during trauma. How does this connect to your day-to-day life now?",
    "Client: I... I guess I still feel frozen sometimes. Like when I hear loud noises or when I'm in crowded places. It's like I'm back there, paralyzed. And the guilt... it never really goes away. I've been pushing people away, scared to get close. Maybe that's why I'm still single, living alone.",
    "Therapist: You're making important connections. How do you feel about your progress in therapy?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. Really hard. But I think it's helping. I'm starting to understand my reactions better. I still have nightmares, but they're less frequent. And I've been trying those grounding techniques you taught me. They help sometimes.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. What's been most challenging?",
    "Client: Facing these memories head-on. It's... it's like reopening old wounds. And sometimes I worry... what if I never get better? What if I'm always haunted by this?",
    "Therapist: Those are common concerns. How might you respond to those worries?",
    "Client: I... I guess I'd say that I've already come this far. And even though it's painful, I'm learning to cope better. Maybe... maybe I won't always feel this way. It's just hard to believe sometimes.",
    "Therapist: That's a hopeful perspective. What's your next step in healing?",
    "Client: I think... I need to work on self-forgiveness. And maybe... maybe try to connect with others who've been through similar experiences. It's isolating, feeling like no one understands.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent goals. How can we support that in our sessions?",
    "Client: Could we... could we maybe explore more ways to manage the guilt? And perhaps discuss how I might start reaching out to others? I'm scared, but I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll focus on that next time. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, but... oddly lighter? Like I've set down a heavy backpack I've been carrying. It's still there, but... I don't know, it feels more manageable somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful metaphor. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but... I think I'm on the right path. Even if it's a long one.",
    "Therapist: You're doing important work. We'll continue next session."
