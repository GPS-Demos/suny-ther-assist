    "Therapist: Let's discuss the imaginal exposure we'll be doing today. How are you feeling about it?",
    "Client: I'm honestly pretty nervous. I've never done anything like this before, and I'm not sure what to expect. The idea of revisiting my trauma is... well, it's scary.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried that talking about it will make me feel like I'm back in that situation again. I've worked so hard to try and move past it, and I'm afraid this might set me back. Plus, I'm not sure I can handle the emotions that might come up. What if I break down completely?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How do you think we could address them?",
    "Client: I'm not sure... Maybe if you could explain more about what exactly we'll be doing and why it's supposed to help? And I think I'd feel better if I knew I could stop at any time if it becomes too overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let me explain the process and its benefits.",
    "Client: Okay, I'm listening. I really want to understand how this is going to help me overcome my PTSD symptoms.",
    "Therapist: Imaginal exposure helps process traumatic memories. We'll revisit the event safely, reducing its power over time.",
    "Client: That makes sense, I guess. But how does just talking about it actually change anything? I've thought about it plenty of times before, and it hasn't helped.",
    "Therapist: It's different from just thinking about it. We'll work through it systematically, addressing emotions and beliefs.",
    "Client: Okay, I can see how that might be different. But what if I can't handle it? What if I panic or get too upset?",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. You're in control, and we can pause anytime you need.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I appreciate that you're letting me have some control over the process. It makes me feel a bit safer. Can you tell me what I might experience during the exposure?",
    "Therapist: You may feel strong emotions or physical reactions. This is normal and will decrease with time.",
    "Client: I see. That sounds challenging, but I guess it's part of the healing process, right? Is there anything I can do to prepare myself for these reactions?",
    "Therapist: Deep breathing can help. Remember, you're safe here. Your courage is admirable.",
    "Client: Thank you, that means a lot. I'm still nervous, but I think I'm ready to give this a try. Is there anything else I should know before we start?",
    "Therapist: Just be honest about your experiences and feelings. There's no right or wrong way to do this.",
    "Client: Okay, I'll do my best to be open and honest. I really appreciate your support and guidance through this process. It's not easy, but I'm hopeful that it will help me move forward and deal with my PTSD symptoms better.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is commendable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Let's do this."
