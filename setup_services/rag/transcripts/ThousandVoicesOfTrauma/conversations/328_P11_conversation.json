    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Lee?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's strange, Dr. Chen. Even though it happened years ago, reliving that dog attack in the park... it feels so vivid. My heart's still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sounds, I think. The growling, the barking... it was so loud in my head. And the feeling of helplessness. I keep thinking about how I couldn't protect myself or my wife. She was so scared...",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. Scary, but also... I don't know, maybe a little empowering? I mean, I got through it, both then and now. But I still felt that panic, that tightness in my chest. It's like my body doesn't know it's not happening anymore.",
    "Therapist: You're noticing your body's reactions. That's good insight.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess so. It's just... frustrating sometimes. I'm a successful professional, you know? I should be able to handle this better. But every time I see a large dog, or even hear barking in the distance, I feel that fear creeping back in.",
    "Therapist: How do you think this connects to your daily life?",
    "Client: Well, it's... it's affected a lot, actually. I avoid parks now, which used to be a favorite spot for my wife and me. I'm always on edge when we're out walking. It's impacting our relationship too. She wants to get a dog, but I just can't... I can't even consider it.",
    "Therapist: That sounds challenging. What have you learned from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I'm starting to see how much this incident has controlled my life. And perhaps... perhaps I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. I mean, I faced the memory today, right? That's something.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You showed great courage today.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Chen. It's hard, but... I want to get better. For myself and for my wife. Do you think... do you think I'll ever be able to enjoy walks in the park again? Or not panic at the sight of a dog?",
    "Therapist: What do you think?",
    "Client: I... I hope so. Maybe if I keep working at this, keep facing these memories and fears... it might get easier. It's just... it's a long road, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: It can be. But you're making progress.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's funny, you know. In my work, I deal with complex problems all the time. I'm good at finding solutions. But this... this feels so different. It's like I can't think my way out of it.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Frustrated, mostly. And a bit... I don't know, maybe ashamed? Like I should be able to handle this better. But then I remember what you've said about trauma and how it affects the brain. It helps me be a little kinder to myself.",
    "Therapist: Self-compassion is important. What's your takeaway from today?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'm realizing that it's okay to struggle with this. That facing it is brave, even if it's scary. And maybe... maybe I need to give myself credit for the small steps. Like today. It wasn't easy, but I did it.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How will you carry this forward?",
    "Client: I... I think I'll try to be more open with my wife about what I'm going through. Maybe we can start with small steps, like watching dogs play in the park from a distance. And I'll keep reminding myself that it's okay to feel scared, but also that I'm working on it. That I'm not letting it control me anymore.",
    "Therapist: Excellent plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: A bit drained, to be honest. But also... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful? Like I can see a path forward, even if it's not easy. Thank you, Dr. Chen. I know we have more work to do, but... I think I'm ready to keep going.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. We'll continue next week."
