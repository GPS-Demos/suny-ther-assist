    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing but also blank at the same time. My heart's still pounding a bit. That memory... it felt so real, like I was right back there in Afghanistan.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: (exhales slowly) It's a mix of things. I can still hear the explosions, you know? And there's this... heaviness in my chest. I keep seeing Private Johnson's face. He was so young, barely 19. I... I couldn't save him.",
    "Therapist: You're carrying a lot. What emotions are you experiencing?",
    "Client: Guilt. Overwhelming guilt. And anger, too. At myself, at the situation. I was supposed to be the leader, to bring everyone home safe. But I failed. And now... now I'm here, living with my parents at 31, while Johnson's family will never see him again. It's not fair.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings manifest in your body?",
    "Client: My shoulders are tense, like I'm carrying this massive weight. My stomach's in knots. And there's this... restlessness in my legs. Like part of me wants to run, to escape these memories. But I know I can't.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: (sighs) I keep thinking, \"What if I had made a different call?\" Maybe if we'd taken a different route, or if I'd been more vigilant... Johnson might still be alive. And then I think about how I'm letting this affect my life now. I should be stronger, you know? I survived, I should be able to move on. But here I am, unable to hold down a job, living with my parents. It's... it's humiliating.",
    "Therapist: How does sharing this make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. Part of me feels weak for talking about it. Like I'm betraying my training, my brothers in arms. We're supposed to be tough, to handle anything. But... there's also a small sense of relief. Like maybe I'm not crazy for feeling this way. I've never really talked about it before, not like this.",
    "Therapist: What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Part of me wants to curl up and disappear. But another part... I guess I need to know that it's okay to feel this way. That I'm not weak for struggling. And maybe... maybe I need help figuring out how to live with this. How to honor Johnson's memory without letting it consume me.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. What's one thing you can do to care for yourself today?",
    "Client: (pauses) I... I think I might go for a run. It usually helps clear my head. And maybe... maybe I'll call my old buddy from the unit. I've been avoiding him, but... talking about this made me realize I'm not alone in this. Maybe he's struggling too.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive step. How are you feeling now compared to when we started?",
    "Client: Still shaky, to be honest. But... there's a bit of lightness too. Like maybe I don't have to carry all this alone. It's scary, but... maybe there's hope. I didn't think I'd ever say that.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable courage today. What's one thing you've learned?",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) I think... I've learned that it's okay to not be okay. That talking about it doesn't make me weak. It's still hard, and I know I have a long way to go. But maybe... maybe I can start to forgive myself. Not today, but... someday.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How do you want to close our session?",
    "Client: I... I think I want to say thank you. This wasn't easy, but... I feel like I've taken a step forward. Even if it's a small one. And... I want to remember Johnson. Not just the way he died, but the way he lived. His laugh, his terrible jokes. Maybe that's how I start to heal.",
    "Therapist: That's a beautiful way to honor him. We'll continue this journey next week. Take care.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I'll try. See you next week."
