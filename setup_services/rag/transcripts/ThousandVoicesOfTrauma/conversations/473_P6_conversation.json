    "Therapist: Alright, let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your current SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that moment.",
    "Client: (taking a deep breath) I'm in the school hallway. It's loud, lockers slamming, kids laughing. I see Jake approaching Tom, my friend. Jake's bigger, always picking on the smaller kids. My heart starts racing as I realize what's about to happen.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. My palms are sweaty, and I feel this tightness in my chest.",
    "Therapist: Keep going. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Jake shoves Tom against the lockers. The sound echoes, and everyone goes quiet. I'm frozen, wanting to help but terrified. Tom looks at me, pleading silently. I can't move. Jake starts taunting Tom, calling him names. My stomach churns, and I feel so ashamed for not stepping in.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's an 8. God, I feel sick remembering this. My hands are shaking, and I have this lump in my throat.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: Jake punches Tom in the stomach. Tom doubles over, gasping. I flinch, feeling like I've been hit too. The other kids are just watching, some even laughing. I want to scream at them to stop, to help, but I'm paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. I can barely breathe thinking about it. My heart's pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: A teacher finally shows up, breaking it up. Tom's on the ground, crying. I rush over, trying to help him up, but he pushes me away. He looks at me with such disappointment and hurt. I feel like the worst friend in the world. The guilt is overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: Still a 9. I feel so ashamed, so useless. My whole body feels heavy with regret.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that. Stay present with those emotions.",
    "Client: The teacher's asking what happened. I open my mouth to speak, but nothing comes out. Jake's glaring at me, daring me to say something. I look away, hating myself for being such a coward. Tom limps off to the nurse's office, and I'm left standing there, feeling like I've failed him completely.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... actually down to an 8. I'm still feeling awful, but the intensity is lessening a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's natural. How are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: My breathing's a bit easier now. I still feel shaky, but not as much as before.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's continue for a few more minutes.",
    "Client: The rest of the day is a blur. I avoid Tom, too ashamed to face him. In class, I can't focus. I keep replaying the scene in my head, thinking of all the things I should have done. Every time I close my eyes, I see Tom's face, the hurt and betrayal in his eyes.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 7. I still feel terrible, but it's not as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How about we wrap up the exposure here?",
    "Client: Okay. Yeah, I think I need a break.",
    "Therapist: That's fine. Take a few deep breaths. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Drained, but... also a bit relieved. It's like I've been carrying this weight for so long, and now it's a little lighter.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. Well done today.",
    "Client: Thanks. It was tough, but I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: We'll process this more next session. For now, practice your relaxation techniques."
