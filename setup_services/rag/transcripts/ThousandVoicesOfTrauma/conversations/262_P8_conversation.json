    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also kind of blank at the same time. My heart is still pounding pretty hard. I can feel it in my chest, you know? It's like I'm right back there, watching everything unfold all over again.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's like this cold weight in my stomach. I keep thinking about how helpless I felt during the earthquake, and now with all this stuff about police brutality in the news... it's like, where can I feel safe, you know? It's all just too much sometimes.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. Can you tell me more about that feeling of helplessness?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. During the earthquake, I couldn't do anything to stop the world from literally falling apart around me. And now, seeing all these incidents with the police, it's like... even the people who are supposed to protect us can be a threat. I feel small, insignificant. Like nothing I do matters because larger forces can just sweep in and destroy everything in an instant.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your day-to-day life?",
    "Client: God, it affects everything. I'm constantly on edge. Every little shake or rumble makes me think another earthquake is coming. And when I see police officers, my heart starts racing. I find myself avoiding crowded areas or protests, even though I want to be involved and make a difference. It's like I'm paralyzed by this fear that something terrible could happen at any moment.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts come up when you feel this way?",
    "Client: I think... I think that I'm weak. That I should be stronger, you know? Like, why can't I just get over this? Other people seem to be doing fine. But then I also think about how unfair it all is. Why did I have to go through that earthquake? Why does our society have these problems with police brutality? It makes me angry, but then I feel guilty for being angry because I know not all cops are bad, and natural disasters aren't anyone's fault. It's just... it's a mess in my head.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts and feelings impact your relationships?",
    "Client: Uh, well... I've been pretty isolated lately. It's hard to explain to my friends why I don't want to go out much. I feel like they wouldn't understand, or they'd think I'm overreacting. And dating? Forget about it. The idea of being vulnerable with someone when I feel this unstable is terrifying. Plus, I'm embarrassed. Who wants to be with someone who's scared of their own shadow?",
    "Therapist: What do you notice in your body as you talk about this?",
    "Client: I... wow, I didn't even realize until you asked, but my shoulders are so tense they're practically up to my ears. My palms are sweaty, and I feel kind of nauseous. It's like my body is gearing up for another disaster, even though I'm just sitting here talking. Is that... is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Many trauma survivors experience similar physical responses. How do you cope with these sensations?",
    "Client: Honestly? Not very well. Sometimes I try to distract myself with schoolwork or video games, but it only works for a little while. Other times, I... I drink more than I probably should. It numbs everything for a bit, but I always feel worse afterward. I've tried some breathing exercises I found online, but it's hard to remember to do them when I'm in the middle of a panic attack.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to change about how you're coping?",
    "Client: I... I want to feel in control again. I want to be able to walk down the street without constantly looking over my shoulder. I want to be able to watch the news without spiraling into anxiety. And I really want to be able to connect with people again without this fear holding me back. I just want to feel... normal, I guess. Is that even possible?",
    "Therapist: Change is possible. What small step could you take this week towards that goal?",
    "Client: Hmm... maybe I could try reaching out to one of my old friends? Just a text or something. And... maybe I could look into some support groups for earthquake survivors or something like that. It might help to talk to people who've been through similar experiences. Is that... is that a good idea?",
    "Therapist: Those sound like positive steps. How does it feel to consider those options?",
    "Client: It's... it's a little scary, to be honest. The idea of opening up to people about all this is intimidating. But there's also this tiny spark of hope, you know? Like maybe I'm not as alone in this as I thought. And maybe... maybe things can get better. It's a small feeling, but it's there.",
    "Therapist: That hope is important. What else are you noticing now?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, somehow. Like some of the tension has drained out of me. My breathing feels easier. I'm still anxious, but it's not as overwhelming as it was at the beginning of our session. Is this... is this progress?",
    "Therapist: What do you think?",
    "Client: I... yeah, I think it might be. It's small, but it feels significant. Like maybe I'm starting to see a way forward, even if it's just a tiny glimpse. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe I can actually do this. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. How would you like to end our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to try one of those breathing exercises we talked about in our last session. Could you walk me through it again? I want to leave here feeling a bit more grounded, you know? And maybe... maybe I'll try to do it on my own later, when I'm feeling anxious. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's begin..."
