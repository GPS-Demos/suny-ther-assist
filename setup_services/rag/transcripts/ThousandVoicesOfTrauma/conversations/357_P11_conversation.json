    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Patel?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart is still racing a bit, and I feel somewhat drained. Reliving that memory of the domestic violence I witnessed as a child... it's never easy.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you about the experience today?",
    "Client: Well, I noticed that I could hear my mother's voice more clearly this time. Her pleading... it was so vivid. And I felt this overwhelming sense of helplessness, you know? Like I was that small boy again, unable to do anything to stop what was happening.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to connect with those emotions?",
    "Client: It was... intense. I felt a mix of anger and fear. Anger at my father for his actions, and fear for my mother's safety. But there was also this... guilt. I've always carried this feeling that I should have done more, even though logically I know I was just a child.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. How do these feelings relate to your current experiences?",
    "Client: I see the connection now. When I feel anxious at work or in social situations, it's often tied to that same feeling of helplessness. And sometimes, when my wife and I argue, I find myself freezing up, just like I did back then.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. How might this awareness help you moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe recognizing these triggers could help me respond differently. Instead of freezing, I could remind myself that I'm not that helpless child anymore. I have options now, and the power to make choices.",
    "Therapist: Excellent insight. What else did you notice during the exposure?",
    "Client: I realized that the memory itself doesn't have the same grip on me as it used to. Don't get me wrong, it's still difficult, but I felt like I could observe it more objectively this time. Is that... is that progress?",
    "Therapist: It certainly can be. How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... encouraging, I suppose. Like maybe all this work we're doing is actually paying off. But it's also a bit scary. I've carried this burden for so long, it's almost become a part of who I am. The idea of letting it go is both liberating and terrifying.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. What do you think about continuing this work?",
    "Client: I... I want to keep going. It's tough, and sometimes I dread these sessions, but I can see the value now. I want to be able to be more present for my wife and in my work without these old traumas holding me back. And maybe... maybe I can finally forgive that little boy who couldn't protect his mother.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful goal. How can we support that in our next session?",
    "Client: Could we... could we maybe focus on some coping strategies for when I feel those old feelings of helplessness creeping in? I think that would be really helpful, especially in my day-to-day life.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll work on that next time. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. Tired, but okay. Thank you for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone to process this with.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your courage is admirable. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, I'll be here. Thank you again."
