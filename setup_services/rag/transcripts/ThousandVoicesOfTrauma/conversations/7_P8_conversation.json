    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. The memory of that accident, it's so vivid now. I can still hear the screeching tires, the shattering glass. My heart is pounding, and I feel a bit shaky.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about those physical sensations?",
    "Client: Well, my hands are clammy, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's like I can't take a full breath. And my stomach feels like it's in knots. It's almost like I'm back there, you know? Like it's happening all over again.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... what if I had left the house five minutes later? Or earlier? Maybe it wouldn't have happened. And then I think about how close I came to... to not making it. It's overwhelming. I feel guilty for surviving when others didn't. And then I feel angry at myself for feeling guilty. It's this whole mess of emotions that I can't seem to untangle.",
    "Therapist: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot. How are you coping with these feelings in the moment?",
    "Client: I'm trying to remind myself that I'm safe now, that it's just a memory. But it's hard. My instinct is to push it all away, to distract myself. But I know that's not helpful in the long run. I'm trying to just... sit with it, I guess? Even though it's uncomfortable. It's like, I know logically that it's over, but my body hasn't quite caught up to that fact yet.",
    "Therapist: That's a really insightful observation. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much this accident has affected my daily life. Like, I've been avoiding driving, especially at night. And loud noises make me jump. It's like I'm always on edge, waiting for something bad to happen. But going through this memory, as hard as it is, it's also making me see how strong I am. I survived that, you know? Maybe I'm tougher than I give myself credit for.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does acknowledging that strength feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's kind of empowering, actually. Like, yeah, this terrible thing happened to me, but I'm still here. I'm still fighting. It doesn't take away the pain or the fear, but it gives me a little hope, I guess. Like maybe I can get through this, come out the other side. It's weird, but I feel a little bit lighter, even though I'm also exhausted.",
    "Therapist: Can you elaborate on that feeling of lightness?",
    "Client: It's like... some of the weight I've been carrying has shifted a bit. Not gone, but... I don't know, redistributed maybe? Like, before, it felt like this huge, overwhelming thing that I couldn't even look at. But now, it's still big and scary, but it feels a little more manageable. Like, okay, I can face this piece by piece. It's not going to be easy, but I can do it. And that gives me a tiny bit of relief, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a significant shift. How might this impact your day-to-day life?",
    "Client: I think... I think it might help me be a little braver. Like, maybe I could try driving short distances during the day. Or when I have those intrusive thoughts about the accident, instead of trying to push them away, I could acknowledge them and remind myself that I'm safe now. It's not going to be an overnight change, but I feel like I have a little more... I don't know, agency? Like I'm not just a victim of my circumstances, but I have some control over how I respond to them.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful perspective. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much I've been isolating myself. Like, I've been so caught up in my own head, trying to deal with all of this on my own. But talking about it, even though it's hard, it helps. It makes me think maybe I should reach out to some friends, maybe even consider a support group. I've been so afraid of being a burden, but maybe sharing this could actually help me heal. And who knows, maybe it could help someone else too. It's scary to think about being that vulnerable, but after facing this memory, it doesn't seem quite as terrifying.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that idea of reaching out?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of emotions, honestly. Part of me is excited about the possibility of connection, of not feeling so alone in this. But there's also fear. What if they don't understand? What if they think I'm overreacting or being dramatic? And then there's this guilt, like I shouldn't be burdening others with my problems. But I know that's probably the trauma talking. Logically, I know my friends care about me and would want to help. It's just... it's hard to bridge that gap between what I know and what I feel, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a common struggle. How might you take a first step?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I could start small. Like, maybe I could text a close friend, just to check in. Not necessarily diving into the heavy stuff right away, but just... reconnecting. And maybe, if that goes well, I could consider opening up a bit more. Or I could look into support groups in the area. Just gathering information, not committing to anything yet. Baby steps, right? It's scary, but also kind of exciting. Like I'm starting to see a path forward, even if it's still a bit foggy.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful approach. How are you feeling now, compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but in a good way? Like I've done some hard work. My emotions are still all over the place, but they feel less chaotic somehow. More... I don't know, organized maybe? Like I can start to make sense of them. And I feel a little proud of myself, for facing this head-on. It wasn't easy, but I did it. And that makes me feel like maybe, just maybe, I can handle whatever comes next. It's a small spark of hope, but it's there.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to explore more about how to manage those intrusive thoughts and memories in my daily life. And maybe we could talk more about strategies for reconnecting with people. Oh, and I'd like to work on some grounding techniques for when I feel overwhelmed. Is that too much?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. We'll address those topics. How would you like to close today's session?",
    "Client: Could we maybe do a quick grounding exercise? I'm feeling a bit shaky after all of this, and I want to make sure I'm okay to drive home. And... thank you. For guiding me through this. It wasn't easy, but I think it was important.",
