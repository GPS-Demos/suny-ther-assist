    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. Talking about my cult experiences isn't easy. It brings back a lot of memories I've tried to forget.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I suppose we should. Where do you want me to start?",
    "Therapist: Start from the moment you first encountered the cult. Use present tense.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm 22 years old. I've just moved to a new city for work. I'm feeling... lost, I guess. Lonely. There's a knock at my apartment door. I open it, and there's this friendly-looking guy, probably in his 40s. He's smiling, holding some pamphlets. He starts talking about finding purpose, about belonging. It... it resonates with me.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Uh, maybe a 3? It's not too bad yet.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: He invites me to a meeting. I'm hesitant, but... but I go. The building is this old community center. As I walk in, I'm hit by this... this energy. Everyone's so friendly, welcoming. They're all smiling, shaking my hand. It feels... it feels good, you know? Like I've found somewhere I belong.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What do you notice in your body?",
    "Client: My chest feels warm. I'm smiling. But there's also this... this knot in my stomach. Like part of me knows something's off.",
    "Therapist: That's good awareness. Keep going.",
    "Client: The meeting starts. The leader, he's... charismatic. Magnetic. He's talking about how society's broken, how we're the chosen ones to fix it. I'm nodding along, but... but I'm also feeling uneasy. It's like... like I'm being pulled in two directions.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's creeping up. Maybe a 5?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Take a deep breath. What happens after the meeting?",
    "Client: They... they don't let me leave. Not really. Someone's always by my side, talking to me, keeping me engaged. I'm feeling overwhelmed, but also... special? Like I'm part of something important. They're love-bombing me, I realize that now, but at the time... at the time, it felt amazing.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My heart's racing a bit. I'm... I'm sweating. It's like I'm back there, you know?",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Remember, this is just a memory. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. Days pass. I'm spending more and more time at the center. They're... they're breaking me down. Criticizing everything about me, then building me back up in their image. I'm confused, exhausted. But I also feel like I'm becoming a better person. It's... it's messed up.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to a 7 now. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: Thanks... I... I think I need a minute.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take some deep breaths. Ground yourself in the present.",
    "Client: Okay... okay, I'm ready to continue. So, I'm fully immersed in the cult now. I've cut off contact with my family, my friends. The outside world feels... dangerous. Hostile. The cult is my whole world. I'm working long hours for the 'cause', barely sleeping. I'm exhausted, but I feel... purposeful. Like I'm part of something greater than myself.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you describe this?",
    "Client: Tense. My jaw is clenched. My shoulders are tight. It's like... like I'm bracing for something.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: There's... there's a new recruit. A young woman. She's scared, confused. Just like I was. But now... now I'm one of the ones love-bombing her. Isolating her. I'm... I'm becoming what I feared. What I hated. But I believe I'm helping her. Saving her. God, it's so messed up.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe even a 9. This is... this is really tough.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well, John. Remember, you're here now, you're safe.",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, I know. It's just... it's overwhelming. The guilt, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. Keep going when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... So, years pass. I rise in the ranks. I'm one of the inner circle now. I see... I see things. Bad things. Financial exploitation. Emotional abuse. Even... even sexual abuse. But I justify it all. I believe in the cause so much that I... I ignore the red flags. I participate. I'm... I'm complicit.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Sick. Literally nauseous. My stomach's churning. I... I can't believe I let it go on for so long.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're not that person anymore. You've grown and changed.",
    "Client: I know, I know. It's just... it's hard to face.",
    "Therapist: I understand. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's maxed out. A solid 10. I don't know if I can keep going.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well, John. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. [Deep breath] I'm... I'm ready to continue.",
    "Therapist: Alright. What happens next?",
    "Client: It's... it's the breaking point. There's a new member, a teenager. She's... she's being groomed by the leader. I see it happening, and something just... snaps. All the doubts, all the buried guilt, it all comes rushing back. I can't... I can't ignore it anymore. I try to intervene, to protect her. But the others... they turn on me. Suddenly, I'm the enemy. The outsider.",
    "Therapist: How does that feel?",
    "Client: Terrifying. Liberating. It's like... like I'm waking up from a long nightmare. But I'm also losing everything I thought I had.",
    "Therapist: What's happening in your body?",
    "Client: I'm shaking. My heart's pounding. But there's also this... this sense of relief. Like a weight's being lifted.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I run. I grab what I can and I just... I just run. I'm terrified they'll come after me. I'm looking over my shoulder constantly. But I'm also... I'm also free. For the first time in years, I'm thinking for myself again. It's overwhelming. Scary. But also... exhilarating.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down. Maybe a 7? The worst is over, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's good. How do you feel about what you've just shared?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. Painful. But also... cathartic? Like I'm finally facing it all head-on. I've carried this for so long, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a big step, John. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: Thanks... I... I think I am. A little, at least. It's still hard to forgive myself for everything, but... but I'm trying.",
    "Therapist: That's all we can ask. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. Emotionally exhausted. But also... lighter? Like I've put down a heavy burden I've been carrying for years.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after processing trauma. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 4, I think. Still there, but... manageable.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress, John. How do you feel about ending the session here?",
    "Client: I think... I think that's good. It's been intense, but... but I feel like I've made some real progress today.",
    "Therapist: I agree. You've done incredibly well. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we wrap up.",
    "Client: Okay... [Deep breaths] Thank you. This... this helped. It was hard, but... but I think it was necessary.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, John. Remember to be kind to yourself this week. We'll continue working through this in our next session.",
    "Client: I will. Thanks again. I... I'm actually looking forward to our next session. Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a sign of progress. Take care, John. I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: You too. See you then."
