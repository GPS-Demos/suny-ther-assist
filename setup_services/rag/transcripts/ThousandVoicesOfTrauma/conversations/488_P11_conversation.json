    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Samir?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. Reliving that earthquake... it's not easy. My heart's still racing a bit, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's like I'm right back there, you know? The ground shaking, the sounds of buildings crumbling... it's all so vivid.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. I remember feeling so powerless as everything around me was falling apart. And now, with this cyberbullying situation... it's bringing up some of those same feelings. I know they're different situations, but that sense of not being in control... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: I see. How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... challenging. But also, I don't know, maybe a bit different this time? I noticed I was able to breathe through some of the tougher moments. That grounding technique we practiced last time - focusing on my feet on the floor - it actually helped a bit. I still felt scared, but... maybe a little less than before?",
    "Therapist: That's a great observation. How do you think this connects to your recovery?",
    "Client: Well, I guess it shows I'm making some progress, right? I mean, I'm still struggling with the memories and the anxiety, especially when I think about the online harassment I've been facing. But being able to use that technique during the exposure... it gives me a glimmer of hope. Maybe I can learn to manage these feelings better, both about the earthquake and the cyberbullying.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What else did you notice?",
    "Client: I realized that... well, during the earthquake, I helped my neighbor evacuate. I'd almost forgotten about that. It's strange how our minds work, isn't it? I've been so focused on the fear and helplessness, I overlooked the moments where I actually did something useful. Maybe... maybe I'm not as powerless as I sometimes feel?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How might that apply to your current situation?",
    "Client: Hmm... I suppose it means I might have more control than I think, even with this cyberbullying stuff. Maybe I can't stop people from saying nasty things online, but I can choose how I respond. I can reach out for support, set boundaries... maybe even help others who are going through similar things. It's not the same as rescuing someone from an earthquake, but it's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How does that realization make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... liberating, in a way. Don't get me wrong, I'm still scared and anxious a lot of the time. But thinking about it this way gives me a sense of... I don't know, maybe hope? Like maybe I'm not just a victim of circumstances. It's a small shift, but it feels important.",
    "Therapist: It is important. What do you think is the next step?",
    "Client: I think... I need to keep working on these exposures, as hard as they are. And maybe start applying some of what I'm learning to the cyberbullying situation. Like, using those grounding techniques when I start feeling overwhelmed online. And reminding myself that I have some control, even if it doesn't always feel like it. It's not going to be easy, but... I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great plan. How can I support you in this?",
    "Client: Just... keep pushing me, I guess? Even when it's tough. And maybe we could spend some time in our sessions specifically addressing the cyberbullying? I know we've touched on it, but I think I need more strategies for dealing with that particular issue. It's different from the earthquake, but it's bringing up a lot of the same feelings of vulnerability and powerlessness.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll work on that together. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. This isn't easy, but I feel like I'm starting to see a way forward. It's slow, and sometimes it feels like two steps forward, one step back. But sessions like this... they help me believe that maybe, just maybe, I can get through this and come out stronger on the other side.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work, Mr. Samir. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, I'll be here. Thanks again, Doctor."
