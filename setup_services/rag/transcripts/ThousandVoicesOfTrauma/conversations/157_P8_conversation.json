    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. My heart is still racing, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's like I'm right back there in that moment, you know? The screeching tires, the smell of burning rubber... it's all so vivid.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how powerless I felt. One minute I was just driving home from work, and the next... chaos. I couldn't do anything to stop it. And then there's this guilt... like, maybe if I had been more alert, I could have avoided it somehow. But rationally, I know that's not true. It all happened so fast.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does your body feel as you recall these details?",
    "Client: My muscles are tense, especially in my shoulders and neck. I notice I'm clenching my jaw too. There's this knot in my stomach that won't go away. It's like my body is preparing for impact all over again.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are you experiencing?",
    "Client: Mostly fear and anxiety. But there's also this underlying anger. I'm angry at the other driver for not paying attention, angry at the universe for putting me in that situation. And beneath all that, there's this deep sadness. My life changed in an instant, and sometimes I mourn for the person I was before the accident.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when the accident first happened?",
    "Client: They're... less intense now, I think. Right after the accident, I was a mess. I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw headlights coming at me. Now, the feelings are still there, but they're not as overwhelming. It's like... I can breathe around them now, if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: What's different about how you're handling these emotions now?",
    "Client: Well, I'm here, talking about it for one thing. Before, I would have done anything to avoid thinking about the accident. Now, even though it's hard, I can face it. I'm learning to sit with the discomfort instead of running from it. And I'm starting to realize that feeling these emotions doesn't mean I'm weak or broken. It's just part of processing what happened.",
    "Therapist: How does this realization make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... liberating, in a way. Like a weight is slowly being lifted off my shoulders. Don't get me wrong, it's still incredibly difficult to go through these memories. But there's a small part of me that feels... I don't know, proud? Proud that I'm facing this head-on instead of letting it control me.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your body now, compared to when we started?",
    "Client: Oh, wow. I didn't even realize, but my shoulders have dropped a bit. The knot in my stomach is still there, but it's not as tight. My breathing feels easier too. It's like... as we talk through it, my body is slowly coming out of that fight-or-flight state.",
    "Therapist: How does this change feel to you?",
    "Client: It feels... good. Surprising, but good. I didn't expect to feel any relief during these sessions. I thought it would just be reliving the trauma over and over. But there's something about talking it through, really examining my thoughts and feelings... it's like I'm slowly taking back control.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you recognize this shift?",
    "Client: Hope, I think. For the first time since the accident, I feel a glimmer of hope. Like maybe I won't always be defined by this trauma. It's still a big part of me, but... maybe it doesn't have to be the only part, you know? I'm starting to see that there might be a way forward, a way to integrate this experience into my life without letting it consume me.",
    "Therapist: How does this hope align with your goals for therapy?",
    "Client: It's exactly what I've been wanting, even if I couldn't articulate it before. I came here because I felt stuck, trapped in this cycle of fear and avoidance. But now... I can see the possibility of moving beyond that. It's not going to be easy, and I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time, I feel like I'm on the right path.",
    "Therapist: What do you think has contributed to this shift?",
    "Client: I think... a big part of it is just allowing myself to feel everything fully. Before, I was so scared of my emotions, like if I let them in, they'd overwhelm me completely. But going through this exposure, talking it out... I'm realizing that I can handle more than I thought. And having you here, guiding me through it, helping me make sense of it all... it makes me feel less alone in this process.",
    "Therapist: How might you use this experience moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I want to try to bring this openness into other areas of my life. Maybe I can start talking to my family about the accident more. And I've been avoiding driving, but... maybe I could start small, like just sitting in a parked car for a few minutes. Baby steps, you know? But steps forward nonetheless.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful approach. How do you feel about ending our session here today?",
    "Client: I feel... okay, actually. Better than I expected. There's still a lot to process, but I feel like I've made some real progress today. Thank you for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone who really listens and understands.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and we'll continue next week."
