    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is buzzing, you know? My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. The memory of that earthquake, it just... it brought everything back so vividly. I could almost feel the ground moving beneath me again.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: God, where do I even start? I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. How the world just... fell apart around me. And then my mind jumps to my childhood, you know? It's like... it's all connected somehow. The fear, the uncertainty. I couldn't control anything then, and I couldn't control anything during the earthquake either.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you're sharing this?",
    "Client: It's tense. Really tense. My shoulders are up to my ears, I think. And there's this knot in my stomach that won't go away. It's like... like I'm still bracing for impact or something. And my throat feels tight, like I might cry, but the tears aren't coming.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are you experiencing?",
    "Client: It's a mix, honestly. There's fear, definitely. A lot of anxiety. But also... anger? Yeah, anger. I'm angry that I had to go through this, that it's still affecting me. And there's this deep sadness too, for the little girl I was and for all the people who lost so much in that earthquake. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when the event was happening?",
    "Client: Hmm... It's similar in some ways, but different too. Back then, it was pure terror. Fight or flight, you know? Now, it's like... the fear is still there, but it's mixed with all these other emotions. And I'm more aware of it now, if that makes sense? Like, I can step back a bit and see what's happening, even if I can't control it.",
    "Therapist: What's the hardest part for you right now?",
    "Client: The hardest part... I think it's the feeling of vulnerability. Remembering how small and powerless I felt during the earthquake, and realizing that in some ways, I still feel like that. It's like... it's exposed this raw nerve that I've been trying to protect for so long. And now that it's out there, I don't know what to do with it.",
    "Therapist: How does this vulnerability connect to your past experiences?",
    "Client: Oh, wow. That's... that's a big question. I guess... growing up, I never felt safe. My home life was chaotic, unpredictable. And then the earthquake happened, and it was like the whole world became as unstable as my home life. It's all tied together - this feeling that at any moment, everything could fall apart. And I'm just... I'm so tired of feeling that way.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I need... I need to feel grounded, I think. Safe. But I also need to know that it's okay to feel this way. That I'm not weak for still being affected by all of this. And maybe... maybe I need to know that there's a way through this. That I won't always feel this raw and exposed.",
    "Therapist: How can we work towards that together?",
    "Client: I'm not sure, to be honest. But maybe... maybe just talking about it like this is a start? It's scary, but it also feels... I don't know, necessary? Like I'm finally facing something I've been running from for a long time. And having you here, listening, not judging... it helps. It really does.",
    "Therapist: What's one thing you've learned about yourself through this process?",
    "Client: One thing I've learned... I think I've realized how resilient I am. I mean, I've been through so much - the trauma from my childhood, the earthquake, everything after - and I'm still here. I'm still trying. And even though it's hard and scary, I'm facing it. That's... that's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How does recognizing that resilience feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's empowering, actually. Like, for the first time, I'm seeing myself as strong instead of just broken. Don't get me wrong, I still feel pretty messed up a lot of the time. But there's this little spark now, this feeling that maybe I can get through this. That I've gotten through tough things before, and I can do it again.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to explore more about how my past trauma and the earthquake are connected. And maybe... maybe start looking at ways to feel more grounded and safe in my daily life? I'm tired of always feeling on edge, you know? I want to learn how to relax, how to trust that the ground isn't going to disappear from under my feet at any moment.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, honestly. But also kind of... lighter? Like I've put down a heavy backpack I've been carrying for years. It's still there, I can still see it, but for the moment at least, I'm not carrying all that weight. It's a strange feeling, but not a bad one.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. We'll end here for today.",
    "Client: Thank you. This was tough, but... I think it was good. I appreciate your help with all of this. See you next time."
