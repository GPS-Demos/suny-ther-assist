    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's begin.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in our old house. I can see my ex-husband packing his bags. The air feels heavy, and I can hear the clock ticking loudly in the background. My hands are shaking as I watch him. I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Um... I'd say about a 6 right now.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue.",
    "Client: He's not looking at me. He's just... methodically folding his clothes, putting them in the suitcase. I want to say something, but my throat feels tight. I'm remembering how this reminds me of when my father left when I was a child. The same feeling of abandonment is washing over me.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's getting worse. Maybe an 8? My chest feels so tight, and I'm starting to feel dizzy.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I can't believe this is happening again. I'm 77 years old, and I feel like that helpless little girl all over again. I want to scream, to beg him to stay, but I know it won't make a difference. The silence in the room is deafening.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. I feel like I'm going to pass out.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (taking a shaky breath) I'm trying. He's zipping up his suitcase now. The sound feels so final. I'm frozen in place, unable to move or speak. My whole body is trembling.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I feel nauseous, and there's a ringing in my ears. It's like the world is closing in on me.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Still a 9. Maybe even a 9.5. I don't know how much more I can take.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it.",
    "Client: He's... he's walking towards the door now. I want to reach out, to stop him, but I can't move. It's like I'm paralyzed. The door closes behind him, and I'm left alone in this empty house. The silence is suffocating.",
    "Therapist: And now?",
    "Client: I... I think it's starting to come down a bit. Maybe an 8? I'm still shaking, but I can breathe a little easier.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's happening now?",
    "Client: I'm sinking to the floor. I can feel the cold hardwood against my skin. Tears are streaming down my face, but I'm not making a sound. It's like all the energy has been drained from my body.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 7 now. I feel... hollow.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: I'm just sitting there, staring at the door. Part of me is hoping he'll come back, apologize, say it was all a mistake. But deep down, I know he won't. The house feels so big and empty now. I can hear the wind outside, and it sounds like it's howling.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling?",
    "Client: The intensity is fading. Maybe a 6 now? I just feel... tired. So, so tired.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm slowly getting up from the floor. My joints ache - a reminder that I'm not that young girl anymore. I walk to the window and look out. The street looks the same as always, but everything feels different now. I'm alone again, just like when I was a child.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5. The panic is subsiding, but there's this deep sadness settling in.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I walk to the phone. My hand is shaking as I pick it up. I'm calling my sister. I need to hear a friendly voice. As it's ringing, I'm looking around the room, seeing all the empty spaces where his things used to be.",
    "Therapist: And how do you feel now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 4 now. I'm still sad, but I'm starting to feel a little calmer. Talking to my sister helps. She's saying she'll come over, and I feel a small sense of relief.",
    "Therapist: That's good. We're almost done. How does the memory end?",
    "Client: I hang up the phone and sit in his favorite armchair. It still smells like him. I'm crying, but it's softer now. I'm thinking about what comes next, how I'll have to rebuild my life. It's scary, but there's a tiny part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful?",
    "Therapist: Final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's a 3 now. I'm exhausted, but the worst of it has passed.",
    "Therapist: Well done. Let's end the exercise here. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm drained, but... I feel like I've faced something important. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You did great. Let's take a moment to breathe before we discuss the exercise."
