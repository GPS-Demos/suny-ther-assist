    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're in control. Can you describe what you witnessed?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm standing on the street corner near my office. It's late, around 9 PM. I see a young woman, probably in her early 20s, being forcefully pulled into a van by two men. She's crying and trying to resist, but they're too strong. I feel frozen, unable to move or help.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: I'd say it's about a 6 out of 10. My heart is starting to race a bit.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: The van door slams shut. I can still hear her muffled screams. My hands are shaking, and I feel this overwhelming sense of guilt. Why didn't I do something? I should have called for help or tried to intervene. The van speeds away, and I'm just standing there, useless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to an 8. I feel nauseous and my chest is tight.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Keep going, you're safe here.",
    "Client: I can't stop thinking about what might be happening to her. Images keep flashing through my mind - her terrified face, the men's cruel expressions. I start to hyperventilate. I fumble for my phone to call the police, but my fingers are trembling so much I can barely dial.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm back there. My palms are sweaty, and I'm having trouble catching my breath.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great. What happens next?",
    "Client: I finally manage to call 911. I'm stumbling over my words, trying to explain what I saw. The operator is asking questions, but I feel so useless. I can't remember the license plate or even the color of the van. I'm crying now, feeling helpless and scared.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Current SUDS?",
    "Client: Still a 9. My whole body is tense, and I feel lightheaded.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The police arrive, but it feels too late. They ask me questions, but I feel like I'm not giving them anything useful. I keep replaying the scene in my head, wishing I had done more. I can't shake the image of that poor woman's face. I feel sick to my stomach and so, so guilty.",
    "Therapist: How about your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down a bit. Maybe a 7? I still feel shaky, but talking about it is helping somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this well. What else do you remember?",
    "Client: I remember going home that night and not being able to sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw her face. I kept checking the news, hoping for any information. Days went by, and I didn't hear anything. I started having nightmares about being trapped in that van myself. I felt so powerless, both in the dreams and in real life.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's back up to an 8. Talking about the nightmares brings back that feeling of helplessness.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: In the weeks that followed, I became hyper-vigilant. I'd flinch at every van that passed by. I started avoiding that street corner entirely, taking longer routes to work. I felt guilty for trying to avoid the memory, like I was betraying that woman somehow. But I also felt so scared and anxious all the time. It was exhausting.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually down to a 6. Talking about it like this, it feels less overwhelming somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How do you feel now, reflecting on all of this?",
    "Client: I still feel sad and guilty, but there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe acceptance? I realize now that I did what I could in that moment. I wish I could have done more, but I'm not responsible for what those men did. It's a heavy feeling, but not as crushing as before.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. Final SUDS?",
    "Client: I'd say it's a 5 now. I feel drained, but also a bit lighter.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Let's start wrapping up."
