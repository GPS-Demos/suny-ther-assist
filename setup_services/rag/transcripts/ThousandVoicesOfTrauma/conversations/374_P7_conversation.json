    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the scene when you first learned about your severe illness?",
    "Client: Okay... I was at work, in my office. It was a Tuesday afternoon, and I had just gotten back from lunch. My phone rang, and it was my doctor's office. I remember feeling a sense of dread wash over me as I answered...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: The nurse on the phone said the doctor wanted to see me immediately. Her voice was... different. Serious. I felt my heart start racing. I told my boss I had to leave, and I drove to the clinic in a daze. The waiting room was so quiet, it felt suffocating...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: When the doctor called me in, his face was grim. He sat me down and said, \"I'm sorry, but the test results show advanced cancer.\" It felt like the floor dropped out from under me. I couldn't breathe. I kept thinking about my family, my job, my life...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I don't remember much after that. It's all a blur. I know he kept talking, explaining treatment options, but all I could hear was a loud ringing in my ears. I felt so alone, so scared. I wanted to run, to hide, to wake up from this nightmare...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I remember stumbling out of the office, barely able to walk. I sat in my car for what felt like hours, just staring at nothing. I couldn't bring myself to call anyone, to make it real by saying it out loud. I felt like my whole world had shattered in an instant...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How did your body feel in that moment?",
    "Client: My body felt... heavy. Like I was made of lead. My chest was tight, it was hard to breathe. My hands were shaking so badly I couldn't even turn the key in the ignition. I felt nauseous, dizzy... like I might pass out at any moment.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those physical sensations. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I remember feeling so cold, even though it was summer. I was shivering, but also sweating. My mouth was dry, and I had this metallic taste... like blood. I kept swallowing, trying to get rid of it, but it wouldn't go away. It was like my body was already fighting the cancer, even though I had just found out...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. What happened next?",
    "Client: I finally managed to start the car and drive home. The whole way, I was on autopilot. I kept thinking about how I was going to tell my partner, my family. How would they react? Would they leave me? I felt so... vulnerable, so fragile. Like I might break at any moment...",
    "Therapist: It's normal to have those thoughts. You're doing great.",
    "Client: When I got home, I just collapsed on the couch. I couldn't move, couldn't think. I just lay there, staring at the ceiling, feeling like my life was over before it had really begun. I was angry, scared, confused... all at once. I wanted to scream, to cry, to break things, but I couldn't do anything...",
    "Therapist: You're handling these intense emotions well. Keep going.",
    "Client: As the shock started to wear off, the reality began to sink in. I started thinking about all the things I might not get to do, the places I might not see. I thought about my work, my dreams, my future... everything seemed so uncertain now. I felt like I was drowning in a sea of \"what ifs\"...",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. How did you cope with those thoughts?",
    "Client: I... I didn't, at first. I just let them wash over me. It was overwhelming. But then, I remembered my grandmother. She had battled cancer too. I thought about her strength, her resilience. It gave me a tiny spark of hope. I decided I needed to fight, for her, for myself...",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. You're doing well.",
    "Client: I finally found the strength to call my partner. My voice was shaking so much, I could barely get the words out. But hearing their voice, their immediate support... it was like a lifeline. They came home right away, and just held me while I cried. For the first time since hearing the news, I felt like maybe, just maybe, I could face this...",
    "Therapist: You showed great courage. How do you feel now, recalling this memory?",
    "Client: It's... intense. My heart is racing again, and I feel that tightness in my chest. But it's different now. I can recognize those feelings without being overwhelmed by them. I know I'm here, in this room, safe. And I know that I survived that moment, and all the moments after...",
    "Therapist: You've done exceptionally well today. Let's take a few deep breaths together."
