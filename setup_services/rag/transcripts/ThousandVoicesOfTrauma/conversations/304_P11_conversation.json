    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Rahul?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. Reliving the moment when I found out about my brother's death... it's still so raw, you know? I felt my heart racing, and my palms got sweaty. It's like I was right back there in that moment, getting that phone call. I could even smell the curry I was cooking when it happened.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The guilt, I think. I keep replaying our last conversation in my head. We had a silly argument about him moving back to India. I was so frustrated with him, and now... now I can never take it back. I just wish I had been more understanding.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt connect to your daily life now?",
    "Client: It's... it's everywhere. I struggle to make decisions because I'm terrified of making the wrong choice. I've become overly cautious in my relationships, always afraid of saying the wrong thing. It's like I'm paralyzed by the fear of another irreversible mistake.",
    "Therapist: I see. What else did you notice during the exposure?",
    "Client: I felt... angry. Not just at the situation, but at the world. Why him? Why my brother? And then I felt guilty for being angry. It's this vicious cycle of emotions that I can't seem to break free from. And underneath it all, there's this deep sadness that I've been trying to avoid.",
    "Therapist: How was it to allow yourself to feel those emotions?",
    "Client: It was... surprisingly liberating. I've been holding back for so long, trying to be strong for my parents, for my girlfriend. But actually letting myself feel the anger and the sadness... it's exhausting, but also a relief. Like I can finally breathe a little deeper.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. How might this impact your healing process?",
    "Client: I think... maybe it's okay to not be okay all the time. I've been putting so much pressure on myself to 'get over it' quickly. But grief doesn't work like that, does it? Maybe I need to give myself permission to feel these emotions without judgment.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful reflection. What else?",
    "Client: I realized that I've been avoiding anything that reminds me of my brother. His favorite foods, the shows we used to watch together, even certain parts of the city we used to hang out in. But during the exposure, I found myself remembering some good times too. It hurt, but it was also... nice? To remember him as he was, not just as someone I've lost.",
    "Therapist: How might you incorporate that moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I could start small. Like watching one of our favorite movies or cooking his favorite dish. It might be painful, but it could also be a way to honor his memory, to keep him alive in a way. And maybe it'll help me process this grief instead of running from it.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful approach. How are you feeling about continuing with the exposures?",
    "Client: Honestly? I'm scared. It's not easy to face these memories and emotions. But I also feel... hopeful? For the first time in a while, I feel like I might be able to move through this grief instead of being stuck in it. It's hard work, but I think it's worth it. I want to be able to remember my brother without feeling like I'm drowning in sorrow.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. Shall we schedule our next session?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I'm nervous, but I'm ready to keep going. Thank you for guiding me through this. It means more than I can express."
