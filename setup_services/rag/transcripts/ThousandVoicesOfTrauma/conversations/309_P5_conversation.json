    "Therapist: Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. To be honest, I'm a bit nervous. What exactly does that mean? Is it going to be like reliving the whole thing again?",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel nervous. Imaginal exposure involves recounting your experience, but in a safe environment. How does that sound?",
    "Client: Safe environment? I don't know... I mean, I trust you, but the idea of talking about it makes my heart race. Will it be intense?",
    "Therapist: It can be challenging, but we'll go at your pace. What's your biggest concern?",
    "Client: I guess... I'm afraid of losing control. What if I can't handle it? Or what if I get stuck in those memories and can't get out?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll work together to keep you grounded. How can I support you best during this?",
    "Client: Maybe... could you remind me where I am if I seem too caught up? And perhaps we could have a code word if I need a break? I just... I've never really talked about this before, not in detail. It's always been this dark cloud hanging over me, you know? Especially after the earthquake last year, it's like everything got amplified.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We can use a code word. What would you like it to be?",
    "Client: How about... \"lighthouse\"? It reminds me of safety, of finding my way back.",
    "Therapist: \"Lighthouse\" it is. How else can I help you feel secure during this process?",
    "Client: Could we maybe have some water nearby? And... is it okay if I hold onto something? I have this small stone I carry sometimes, it helps me stay present.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Both are excellent ideas. Shall we discuss what to expect next?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I'm still nervous, but I think I'm ready to know more. Will this really help with my PTSD symptoms?",
    "Therapist: It's designed to reduce PTSD symptoms over time. Your bravery is commendable. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Thank you. I guess... how long will each session last? And will I have to do this multiple times? I'm worried about how I'll feel afterwards, especially since I live alone.",
    "Therapist: Sessions typically last about 45 minutes. We'll do this weekly. How do you feel about that timeline?",
    "Client: That sounds... manageable, I think. It's shorter than I expected. Will you guide me through it each time? And what should I do after sessions if I'm feeling overwhelmed?",
    "Therapist: I'll guide you throughout. For after, let's create a self-care plan. What helps you relax?",
    "Client: Well, I like taking long baths, or sometimes I paint. And I have this meditation app that's been helpful. But I'm worried about turning to alcohol to cope. I've been doing better with my substance use lately, but this feels like it might be triggering.",
    "Therapist: Your awareness is crucial. Let's incorporate those healthy coping strategies into your plan. How else can we address potential triggers?",
    "Client: Maybe I could call a friend after sessions? Or... is it okay if I check in with you briefly the day after? Just to make sure I'm on track. And perhaps we could discuss some grounding techniques I could use at home?",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent suggestions. We'll definitely cover grounding techniques. Ready to start?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm still nervous, but I also feel... hopeful? Like maybe this could really help me move forward. It's been so long since I've felt that way. Okay, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is inspiring. Remember, we're in this together. Shall we begin?"
