    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Lee. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I understand it's part of the process.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the memory we discussed.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in that dimly lit room. The air feels heavy, and I can smell cigarette smoke. I see the man who recruited me, his face twisted in a sneer. My heart is starting to race...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10. It's uncomfortable, but manageable.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: He's telling me that I owe him for bringing me to this country. That I have to work to pay off my debt. I feel so betrayed, so stupid for trusting him. My stomach is churning, and I'm starting to feel nauseous.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6 now. I can feel my palms getting sweaty, and my breathing is faster.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Stay with the memory. What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he grabs my arm roughly, pulling me towards the door. I want to resist, but I'm frozen with fear. I can hear other voices outside, laughing and talking in a language I don't understand. I feel so alone, so helpless...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's an 8. My chest feels tight, and I'm having trouble catching my breath.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Keep going if you can.",
    "Client: I... I see myself being pushed into a room with other people. They all look scared and confused, just like me. I want to scream, to run, but there's nowhere to go. I feel trapped, like the walls are closing in on me.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Still an 8. My hands are shaking now, and I feel dizzy.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it. What do you notice next?",
    "Client: I hear sirens in the distance. For a moment, I feel a spark of hope. But then I see the panic on the faces of our captors. They start shouting, pushing us around. I'm terrified they might hurt us to keep us quiet.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 9. I feel like I can't breathe. My heart is pounding so hard it hurts.",
    "Therapist: Take a slow, deep breath. You're safe here with me.",
    "Client: I'm trying... The room is chaos now. People are crying, shouting. I curl up in a corner, trying to make myself invisible. I'm shaking uncontrollably. Then suddenly, the door bursts open, and I see police officers. I should feel relieved, but I'm just overwhelmed with fear and confusion.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7 now. I still feel shaky, but the tightness in my chest is easing.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're doing really well. How does the memory end?",
    "Client: An officer approaches me, speaking softly. I can't understand the words, but her tone is gentle. She offers me a blanket and helps me stand. As we walk out, I feel a mix of relief and uncertainty. The bright sunlight hurts my eyes, but it also feels like... like hope.",
    "Therapist: And your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5 now. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger for having gone through this again.",
    "Therapist: You did excellently. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves."
