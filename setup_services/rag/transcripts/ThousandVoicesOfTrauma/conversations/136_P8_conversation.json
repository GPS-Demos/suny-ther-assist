    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is buzzing, you know? My hands are a bit shaky, and my heart's still racing. That memory... it was so vivid. I could almost smell the school cafeteria again.",
    "Therapist: Mhmm. What's coming up for you emotionally right now?",
    "Client: It's a mix of things. There's anger, definitely. Anger at those kids who thought it was okay to make fun of me because of how I looked. But there's also this... heaviness. Like a weight on my chest. I think it's sadness. Sadness for that little girl who just wanted to fit in.",
    "Therapist: I see. Can you tell me more about that sadness?",
    "Client: It's... it's like mourning, I guess. Mourning for the childhood I didn't get to have. I was always on edge, always waiting for the next insult or prank. I never got to just be a kid, you know? And now, even as an adult, I still carry that weight. It's affected everything - my relationships, my self-esteem, even my decision to go back to school now.",
    "Therapist: How do you notice that weight in your daily life?",
    "Client: It's... it's everywhere. When I'm in class, I'm hesitant to speak up, afraid someone will laugh at my accent or make fun of my ideas. When I'm walking down the street, I'm hyper-aware of people looking at me, wondering if they're judging me. It's exhausting, always being on guard like that.",
    "Therapist: Mhmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... I'm thinking about how unfair it all is. Why did I have to go through that? Why couldn't I have just been like everyone else? And then I feel guilty for thinking that because I know I should be proud of my heritage. But it's hard, you know? It's hard to feel proud when those experiences made me feel so... so ashamed for so long.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really challenging. How does your body feel as you share this?",
    "Client: My throat feels tight, like I'm trying not to cry. And my shoulders are tense. I guess I'm still bracing myself, even here. It's like my body is still stuck in that cafeteria, waiting for the next attack.",
    "Therapist: I hear you. What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to breathe. Just... just sit with this feeling for a bit. It's uncomfortable, but it's also... I don't know, maybe necessary? Like I'm finally letting myself feel what I've been pushing down for so long.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: As I sit here, I'm realizing that even though those memories are painful, I survived them. I'm here now, pursuing my education, working on myself. Maybe... maybe I'm stronger than I give myself credit for.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does that feel?",
    "Client: It feels... good. Scary, but good. Like maybe there's hope. Maybe I can work through this and come out the other side. I've always felt so defined by what happened to me, but maybe... maybe I can redefine myself.",
    "Therapist: What does that redefinition look like to you?",
    "Client: I think... I think it looks like someone who's proud of her heritage, who doesn't shrink away from attention. Someone who can walk into a room without immediately scanning for threats. Someone who can form close relationships without always waiting for the other shoe to drop. It looks like... freedom, I guess. Freedom from the past.",
    "Therapist: That's a beautiful vision. How can we work towards that?",
    "Client: I'm not entirely sure, but I think... I think talking about it like this is a start. Facing these memories head-on instead of trying to bury them. And maybe... maybe finding ways to connect with my culture in a positive way. To reclaim it, you know?",
    "Therapist: Those sound like great steps. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also lighter somehow. Like I've set down a heavy bag I've been carrying for years. It's not gone completely, but I can feel the difference. And there's this little spark of hope that wasn't there before. It's small, but it's there.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to explore more of these memories. It's hard, but I can see now that facing them might be the key to moving forward. And maybe we could talk about some practical ways I can start reconnecting with my culture in a positive way?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great plan. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. I know we have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I might actually be able to get there.",
    "Therapist: You're very welcome. I'm here to support you on this journey. We'll end here for today, but I look forward to our next session."
