    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. My heart's still racing, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's like I'm right back there, you know? I can still hear the growling, the snapping of its jaws. God, it's so vivid.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: Well, my palms are sweaty, and I feel this overwhelming sense of dread. It's like... like I'm frozen in place again. I keep seeing flashes of the dog's teeth, its eyes. They were so... wild. I remember thinking, \"This is it. This is how I die.\" And even now, sitting here, part of me still believes that.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. How are you coping with those feelings right now?",
    "Client: I'm trying to remind myself that I'm safe here, but it's hard. My body doesn't seem to believe it. I keep wanting to look over my shoulder, you know? Check for danger. It's exhausting, always being on high alert like this. But at the same time, I feel... I don't know, maybe a little proud? That I could face the memory without completely falling apart.",
    "Therapist: What do you make of that feeling of pride?",
    "Client: I guess... it's like I'm proving to myself that I'm stronger than I thought. For so long, I've avoided anything that reminds me of the attack. But here I am, talking about it, reliving it even. It's terrifying, but also... empowering? Is that weird to say?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. Can you tell me more about that?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... for years, this memory has had so much power over me. It's dictated where I go, what I do, how I live my life. But facing it head-on like this, it's like I'm reclaiming some of that power. Don't get me wrong, it's still scary as hell. But there's a part of me that feels like I'm finally fighting back.",
    "Therapist: How does this experience compare to your expectations?",
    "Client: Honestly? It's both better and worse than I expected. Worse because the emotions are so raw, so overwhelming. I didn't expect to feel it all so intensely. But better because... I don't know, I thought I'd completely fall apart. I thought I'd have a full-blown panic attack or something. But I'm still here, still talking. It's hard, but I'm doing it.",
    "Therapist: What does that tell you about yourself?",
    "Client: I suppose it shows that I'm more resilient than I give myself credit for. For so long, I've seen myself as this fragile, broken person. But maybe... maybe I'm stronger than I thought. It's a strange feeling, like I'm seeing a different side of myself.",
    "Therapist: Mm. How might this realization impact your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I think... I think it gives me hope. If I can face this memory, maybe I can face other things too. Maybe I can start reclaiming parts of my life that I've given up. Like, I haven't been to a park in years because of my fear of dogs. But now, I'm wondering if maybe, with time and work, I could do that again. It's scary to even think about, but also... exciting?",
    "Therapist: What emotions come up as you consider that possibility?",
    "Client: It's a mix. There's fear, definitely. The idea of being around dogs still terrifies me. But there's also this... I don't know, anticipation? Like, I can almost imagine how it would feel to walk in a park again, to feel the grass under my feet, the sun on my face. And there's sadness too, I guess. Sadness for all the time I've lost, all the experiences I've missed out on because of this fear.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you talk about this?",
    "Client: It's strange. I can feel my heart rate picking up again, but it's different this time. It's not just fear. There's a kind of energy running through me. My hands are a bit shaky, but it's almost like... excitement? And I notice I'm sitting up straighter, like I'm ready for something. It's a weird mix of nervousness and determination.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... maybe I can do this. Maybe I can actually heal from this. It's not going to be easy, and I know I have a long way to go. But for the first time in years, I feel like there's a light at the end of the tunnel. I'm also thinking about all the things I want to do, all the experiences I want to have. It's like I'm waking up from a long sleep, and I'm seeing possibilities I hadn't even considered before.",
    "Therapist: How does this shift feel?",
    "Client: It feels... liberating. Scary, but liberating. Like I've been carrying this heavy weight for so long, and I'm just now realizing that maybe, just maybe, I can put it down. Don't get me wrong, I'm still terrified. The memory still haunts me. But it's like... it's like I can see beyond it now. I can imagine a future where it doesn't control everything I do.",
    "Therapist: What do you need to move forward from here?",
    "Client: I think... I need to keep facing this. As hard as it is, I can see that avoiding it hasn't helped. I need to keep working on processing the memory, on challenging those fears. And I think I need to start small, you know? Maybe not jumping straight into walking in a park, but maybe looking at pictures of dogs, or watching videos. Building up my tolerance bit by bit.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful approach. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but in a good way? Like after a really intense workout. My body feels heavy, but my mind feels clearer than it has in a long time. There's still fear there, definitely. But there's also this sense of... I don't know, possibility? Hope? It's like I can breathe a little easier. And I'm proud of myself. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It's a small step, but it feels significant.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to explore more of these positive feelings. The pride, the hope. For so long, I've been focused on the fear and the pain. But there's more to this story, isn't there? There's resilience, and strength, and growth. I want to understand that better, to build on it. And maybe... maybe we could start talking about some of those small steps I mentioned? Start planning how I might gradually expose myself to my fears in a controlled, safe way?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Is there anything else you'd like to add?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I guess. For guiding me through this, for helping me see things differently. I know we have a long way to go, but for the first time in years, I feel like I'm moving forward instead of just treading water. It's scary, but it's also... exciting. I'm nervous about what comes next, but I'm also looking forward to it. Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a natural part of the healing process.",
    "Client: Right. Well, I guess that's it then. I'm exhausted, but in a good way. Like I've accomplished something important. I'm looking forward to our next session, even though I know it'll be challenging. But I feel... I don't know, ready? Like I can handle it. It's a new feeling, but I like it.",
    "Therapist: That's great. We'll end here for today. Take care."
