    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your current SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day at work.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Alright... I'm in the office. It's early morning, and I'm organizing files at my desk. I can smell the coffee brewing in the break room. Suddenly, I hear my coworker Sarah's voice behind me. She's whispering to someone else, but I can clearly hear her mocking the way I dress. My cheeks start to feel hot, and my stomach tightens.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. I can feel my heart beating faster.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: Sarah and her friend are giggling now. I pretend I can't hear them, but inside I'm screaming. I want to turn around and confront them, but I'm frozen. My hands are shaking as I try to keep working. I feel so small, so insignificant. It's like I'm back in high school all over again.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) I... I can hear them walking closer. Sarah says loudly, \"Oh, look at her outfit today. Does she own a mirror?\" They both laugh. I feel tears welling up in my eyes. I'm desperately trying not to cry. My chest feels so tight, and I'm gripping the edge of my desk so hard my knuckles are white.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: (Sniffles) It's a 9. I feel so humiliated and angry.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it.",
    "Client: I finally turn around, and they quickly look away, pretending they weren't talking about me. But I know. I can see the smirks on their faces. I feel so powerless, so... worthless. I want to disappear. My supervisor walks by, oblivious to what's happening. I consider telling him, but the words won't come out. I'm trapped in this nightmare, day after day.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS now?",
    "Client: (Voice shaky) It's still a 9. My whole body feels tense.",

    "Client: As the day goes on, I can feel their eyes on me. Every time I walk past, there are whispers and stifled laughs. By lunchtime, I'm exhausted from the constant stress.

    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: (Sighs) It's down to an 8 now. I feel drained.",
    "Therapist: That's natural. You're processing a lot.",
    "Client: The afternoon drags on. I make a mistake on a report because I can't concentrate. Sarah notices and makes a loud comment about my incompetence. I want to defend myself, but my voice fails me. I feel like a failure, both professionally and personally. By the time I leave work, I'm completely depleted. I sit in my car for ten minutes, just trying to gather the strength to drive home.",
    "Therapist: How about your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's back down to a 6. I feel... sad. So incredibly sad.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. Let's start bringing you back to the present.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay. I'm... I'm here. In your office. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You're safe here. How do you feel?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... also a bit relieved. It's like I've let go of something I've been holding onto for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. Your final SUDS?",
    "Client: I'd say it's down to a 3 now.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength today. How about we discuss what you experienced?"
