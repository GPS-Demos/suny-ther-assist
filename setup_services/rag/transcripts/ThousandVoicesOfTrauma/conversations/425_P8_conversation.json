    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing but also blank at the same time. The memory of the plane crash, it's so vivid now. I can still hear the screeching of metal, feel the violent shaking. My heart is pounding just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you noticing right now?",
    "Client: My hands are trembling a bit, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's hard to take a deep breath. I feel cold, even though the room isn't. It's like... like I'm back there, you know? In that moment of terror when I realized we were going down.",
    "Therapist: And what thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"Why did I survive when others didn't?\" It doesn't seem fair. And then I feel guilty for even thinking that because I should be grateful, right? But then I remember the faces of the people around me, the panic, the screams. I wonder about their families, their lives. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts and feelings compare to when you first experienced the crash?",
    "Client: It's... it's less intense now, I suppose. Back then, it was pure terror and shock. I couldn't process anything. Now, it's more like... a deep sadness mixed with anxiety. I'm able to think about it more, but that almost makes it worse in a way. I have time to consider all the implications, all the lives lost.",
    "Therapist: What's the most challenging part for you right now?",
    "Client: The guilt, I think. Not just survivor's guilt, but... I feel guilty for how this has affected my life. I've been so afraid to fly since then, and it's limited me in so many ways. I missed my granddaughter's wedding because I couldn't get on a plane. And then I feel selfish for making it about me when others lost so much more.",
    "Therapist: How do you see this experience connecting to your childhood trauma?",
    "Client: Oh... I hadn't really thought about that before. But now that you mention it, there's a similar feeling of helplessness. In both situations, I felt completely out of control, at the mercy of others or circumstances. And the fear... that bone-deep fear is familiar from my childhood. It's like my body remembers even if my mind tries to forget.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your ability to cope now compared to then?",
    "Client: Well, I'm here talking about it, aren't I? That's something. Back then, both as a child and right after the crash, I couldn't even speak about what happened. It was too much. Now, it's still difficult, but I can put words to it. I'm not completely overwhelmed. It's more like... waves of emotion that come and go.",
    "Therapist: How does discussing this impact your view of your recovery journey?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. On one hand, I can see that I've made progress. Being able to talk about it without completely falling apart is a big step. But on the other hand, it makes me realize how much this still affects me. It's frustrating sometimes, feeling like I should be \"over it\" by now. But I guess recovery isn't linear, is it?",
    "Therapist: What gives you hope in this process?",
    "Client: Hmm... I suppose the fact that I can see some change, even if it's slow. And talking about it here, it helps me feel less alone with it all. There's also a part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe proud? That I've survived not just the crash, but everything that came after. The nightmares, the anxiety, the depression. I'm still here, still trying. That has to count for something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How do you want to care for yourself after today's session?",
    "Client: I think I need some quiet time. Maybe I'll sit in my garden for a while, just breathe and remind myself that I'm safe now. And then... maybe I'll call my daughter. Talking about the crash makes me want to connect with her, tell her I love her. Is that okay? To want comfort after this?",
    "Therapist: Of course. What else might be helpful for you?",
    "Client: I might try that grounding exercise we talked about before. The one where I name things I can see, hear, and touch. It helps bring me back to the present when the memories feel too strong. And maybe... maybe I'll write a bit in my journal. Sometimes getting the thoughts out of my head and onto paper helps make them feel less overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling now as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm... tired. Emotionally drained. But also, there's a small sense of relief. Like I've set down a heavy burden, even if just for a moment. It's still there, waiting to be picked up again, but for now... I feel a little lighter. Thank you for listening, for helping me through this. It means more than I can say.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue this work next time."
