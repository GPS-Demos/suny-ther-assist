    "Therapist: Alright, Mr. Patel, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in the refugee camp. It's crowded, noisy. I can smell the sweat and fear. There are so many people crammed into this small space. I see children crying, adults arguing. The heat is oppressive.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: Um, about a 4 out of 10. It's uncomfortable, but manageable.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's shouting. Two men are fighting over food rations. It's escalating quickly. I can see the desperation in their eyes. Others are gathering around, some trying to stop it, others egging them on. My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 6. I can feel my palms getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: One man pulls out a knife. Oh god, I remember this vividly. The glint of metal in the sunlight. People are screaming now. I want to run, but I'm frozen. I can't look away. The other man is backing up, hands raised. I... I can see the fear in his eyes.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's an 8 now. My chest feels tight. I'm having trouble breathing.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (inhales shakily) The man with the knife lunges forward. There's blood. So much blood. People are pushing and shoving to get away. I'm knocked to the ground. I can taste dirt in my mouth. The screams are deafening.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm right back there. My whole body is shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here with me.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) Guards are running in now. They're shouting, but I can't understand them. Someone helps me up. I see the injured man on the ground. There's so much chaos. I feel so helpless, so scared.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: Still a 9. I can't seem to calm down. My heart is pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe. Take another deep breath.",
    "Client: (breathes deeply) The guards are taking the attacker away. People are crowding around the injured man. I can hear sirens in the distance. I'm shaking uncontrollably. I just want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe an 8 now. I still feel very anxious, but the worst is passing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. How about we start winding down?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I... I see medical staff arriving. People are starting to disperse. I'm sitting on the ground, trying to process what just happened. I feel numb, shocked.",
    "Therapist: And your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6 now. I'm still shaken, but I'm starting to feel more present here with you.",
    "Therapist: Excellent work today, Mr. Patel."
