    "Therapist: Good morning, Mr. Johnson. How are you feeling today as we begin our imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: Oh, hello Dr. Carter. I'm... well, I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. Talking about that day with the dog always gets me worked up.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to help you process this. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Let's get on with it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in the park near my old house. It's a sunny afternoon, warm for October. The leaves are starting to turn. I can smell the crisp air and... and hear children playing in the distance.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm walking along the path, using my cane. My arthritis is acting up a bit. I see... I see a woman approaching with a large dog. It looks like some kind of pit bull mix. She's struggling to control it.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Nervous. My heart's starting to race a little. I... I remember thinking I should cross to the other side of the path.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you?",
    "Client: About a 40, I'd say.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath and continue.",
    "Client: The dog... it starts barking. Loud, aggressive barks. The woman is yelling at it to stop, but it's not listening. I freeze up. I can't... I can't move fast enough with my cane.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What's happening in your body?",
    "Client: My palms are sweating. I feel hot all over. My chest is tight, and I... I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The dog breaks free. It's charging right at me. I try to turn away, but I'm too slow. It... it leaps at me. I can see its teeth, hear its growls. I raise my arm to protect myself, and...",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) The dog's teeth sink into my arm. The pain is... it's excruciating. I'm screaming, but it feels like no sound is coming out. I fall to the ground, and the dog is on top of me.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 75.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here in my office. You're safe. Can you feel the chair beneath you?",
    "Client: Yes... yes, I can.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I can smell the dog's breath. It's hot and rancid. I'm trying to push it off, but my arms feel weak. The woman is screaming now too. I hear running footsteps... someone else is coming.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm going to die. That this dog is going to tear me apart, and I'll never see my grandkids again.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: A man... a jogger, I think... he grabs the dog's collar. He's pulling it off me. The dog is still snarling, trying to get at me. I'm... I'm lying there on the ground, shaking. My arm is bleeding badly.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... numb. Like I'm watching it happen to someone else. But my arm... it's throbbing with pain.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: People are gathering around. Someone's calling an ambulance. The woman with the dog is crying, apologizing over and over. I... I can't speak. I just lie there, staring at the sky.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I feel helpless. Weak. Like I couldn't protect myself. I've never felt so vulnerable in my life.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful feeling. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 85 now.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. Remember, you survived this.",
    "Client: (taking a deep breath) Yes... yes, I did.",
    "Therapist: Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The ambulance arrives. The paramedics are talking to me, but their voices sound far away. They're examining my arm, asking me questions. I can't seem to focus on what they're saying.",
    "Therapist: What sensations are you aware of?",
    "Client: The pain in my arm is intense. I feel cold now, like I'm in shock. My clothes are torn and dirty. I can taste blood in my mouth... I must have bitten my lip during the attack.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep describing what's happening.",
    "Client: They're lifting me onto a stretcher. The movement sends a sharp pain through my arm and shoulder. As they wheel me to the ambulance, I catch a glimpse of the dog. It's being held by animal control now. It looks... it looks so ordinary. How could something so normal cause so much pain?",
    "Therapist: That's a profound observation. How does seeing the dog make you feel?",
    "Client: Angry. Terrified. And... and sad, somehow. Like something fundamental has changed in my world.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. What happens as you're in the ambulance?",
    "Client: The paramedic is cleaning my wound. It stings, but it's nothing compared to the initial pain. I'm starting to feel calmer, but... but also more aware of what just happened. I start to cry. I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're processing a traumatic event.",
    "Client: I... I keep replaying it in my mind. The sound of the dog's growl, the feeling of helplessness. I wonder if I could have done something differently.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 70. Still high, but not as bad as before.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. Let's continue.",
    "Client: We arrive at the hospital. Everything's a blur of bright lights and voices. They take me to a room, and a doctor examines my arm. He's talking about stitches, possible nerve damage. I'm only half-listening.",
    "Therapist: What are you focused on?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how quickly it all happened. How one moment I was enjoying a walk, and the next... everything changed. I feel... I feel like I've lost something. My sense of safety, maybe.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant realization. How does that loss affect you?",
    "Client: It... it makes me angry. And scared. I don't want to go outside anymore. I don't want to be around dogs. I feel... trapped by my own fear.",
    "Therapist: Those are normal reactions to trauma. How do you feel right now, describing this?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. My heart's still racing a bit. But... but I also feel a little relieved. Like I'm finally letting it out.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 60, I think.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's continue with what happened at the hospital.",
    "Client: They... they clean and stitch my wounds. The doctor explains that I'll need physical therapy to regain full use of my arm. I nod, but I'm not really processing it. I just want to go home, to feel safe again.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about the recovery process ahead of you?",
    "Client: Overwhelmed. Scared. I wonder if I'll ever feel normal again. Will I flinch every time I see a dog? Will I be able to enjoy a simple walk in the park?",
    "Therapist: These are all valid concerns. We'll work on addressing them in our sessions.",
    "Client: I... I hope so. Because right now, it feels like my whole world has shrunk. Like I'm a prisoner of this experience.",
    "Therapist: You've been through a lot. How are you feeling now, after sharing this?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. Drained. But also... maybe a little lighter? Like I've set down a heavy load, even if just for a moment.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive sign. What's your final distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 50 now. Still there, but... but not as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today, Mr. Johnson. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end the session.",
    "Client: (taking deep breaths) Thank you, Dr. Carter. This... this wasn't easy, but I think it helped.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great courage. We'll continue to work through this together."
