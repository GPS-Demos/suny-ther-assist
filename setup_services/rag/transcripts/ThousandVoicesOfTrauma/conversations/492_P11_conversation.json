    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Farah?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's strange, you know? I'm 77 years old, and here I am, still affected by something that happened so long ago. The divorce... it brought back so many memories of my childhood. I could almost smell the spices from my mother's kitchen, mixed with the tension in the air.",
    "Therapist: What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The silence. It was deafening. My father would come home, and suddenly, the whole house would go quiet. I remember hiding in my room, clutching my doll... I can still feel its scratchy fabric against my cheek. It's funny how vivid these memories are, even now.",
    "Therapist: How did reliving that feel today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. I felt like that little girl again, scared and confused. But there was also this strange sense of... I don't know, maybe strength? Like I've survived all this time, despite everything.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization.",
    "Client: Yes, I suppose it is. You know, I've always tried to be the perfect wife, the perfect mother. I think it was my way of trying to fix what was broken in my childhood. When my husband left... it was like history repeating itself. I felt that same helplessness, that same fear of abandonment. But this time, I'm not that little girl anymore. I have resources, I have... well, I have you, don't I?",
    "Therapist: Indeed. How does this connect to your current symptoms?",
    "Client: I think... I think my depression, it's not just about my husband leaving. It's about feeling like I failed, like I couldn't keep my family together any better than my parents did. And the nightmares, the flashbacks... they're not just about the divorce, are they? They're about all of it, everything I've been carrying for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard, you know? To face all of this. Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it, at my age. But then I think about my grandchildren, and I want to be present for them. I want to break this cycle.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's exhausting, but... I think it's necessary. I want to understand myself better, to stop being haunted by these ghosts. And maybe... maybe I can finally forgive myself for not being perfect.",
    "Therapist: That's a beautiful goal.",
    "Client: Yes, I think so too. You know, I've always been so focused on taking care of others. My husband, my children, even my neighbors. It's strange to be focusing on myself now. But I'm learning that it's okay to do that. It's okay to heal, even at my age. Even with everything that's happened.",
    "Therapist: What strategies have helped you so far?",
    "Client: The breathing exercises have been surprisingly helpful. And writing in my journal... it's like I'm having a conversation with my younger self. Sometimes I find myself comforting her, telling her it's not her fault. It's... it's quite powerful, actually.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I never thought I'd be doing this at my age. But I'm glad I am. It's like I'm finally giving myself permission to acknowledge my pain, to heal. And that feels... well, it feels like a gift I'm giving to myself.",
    "Therapist: How do you want to move forward?",
    "Client: I want to keep going. It's hard, but I feel like I'm finally starting to understand myself. And maybe... maybe I can start building a new life, one that isn't defined by my past traumas. I want to be more present for my grandchildren, to enjoy my retirement without this constant cloud hanging over me. Is that... is that possible?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Your commitment is inspiring.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot to me. You know, I've always been told I'm strong, but I never really believed it. Now, going through this process, I'm starting to see that strength in myself. It's... it's quite empowering, actually.",
    "Therapist: What's your biggest takeaway today?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's that it's never too late to heal. That even at 77, I can still grow, still change. And that my past doesn't have to dictate my future. It's part of me, yes, but it doesn't have to control me. Is that... is that right?",
    "Therapist: That's a profound insight.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I feel lighter somehow. Like I've put down a burden I've been carrying for decades. It's scary, but also... exciting? Is that the right word? To think that I might be able to live the rest of my life without this weight. It gives me hope.",
    "Therapist: Hope is powerful. Shall we end here?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm tired, but it's a good kind of tired. Like I've done something important. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know we have more work to do, but I feel... I feel ready for it now.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Take care."
