    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Azizi?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's not easy to revisit that memory of witnessing the violence online. The images are so vivid, even though it happened through a screen. I can still hear the screams, see the fear in people's eyes... It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most to you this time?",
    "Client: The helplessness. I felt so powerless watching it unfold. I wanted to reach through the screen and stop it, but I couldn't. And then the comments... people were cheering it on. It was sickening.",
    "Therapist: How did your body react during the exposure?",
    "Client: My hands were shaking. I felt nauseous, and my heart was racing. I had this urge to look away, but I couldn't. It's like I was frozen, just like I was when it actually happened.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: A little calmer, but still on edge. It's like... I'm here, but part of me is still stuck in that moment. I keep thinking about how technology can be used to spread such violence and hate. It makes me want to disconnect from everything.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does this connect to your daily life?",
    "Client: Well, I've been avoiding social media and news sites. I'm afraid of stumbling upon something violent again. It's affecting my business too. I used to do a lot of networking online, but now I'm hesitant to engage. My depression has gotten worse because I feel so isolated.",
    "Therapist: That sounds challenging. What's helped you cope so far?",
    "Client: I've been spending more time with my family. My daughter's been very supportive. And I've started painting again. It helps me express what I'm feeling without words. But sometimes, I still feel overwhelmed by the memory.",
    "Therapist: Those are positive steps. What did you learn from today's session?",
    "Client: I realized that even though the memory is painful, I can face it. And maybe... maybe by processing it, I can start to regain some control. I don't want to let fear dictate my life anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. How will you apply this moving forward?",
    "Client: I think I'll try to gradually re-engage online, but with boundaries. Maybe I can find support groups for people who've experienced similar trauma. And I want to continue with these exposures, as hard as they are. I feel like they're helping me process what happened.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How can I support you until our next session?",
    "Client: Could you... could you maybe give me some techniques to ground myself when the memories become overwhelming? Sometimes I feel like I'm spiraling, and I don't know how to pull myself out.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's discuss a few grounding techniques now.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your patience with me through this process. It's not easy, but I'm starting to see a glimmer of hope. I just want to feel like myself again, you know? To be able to connect with people online without this constant fear. It's a long road, but I'm committed to it.",
    "Therapist: Your dedication is commendable. Shall we schedule our next session?",
    "Client: Yes, please. Same time next week? And... I just want to say, even though it's difficult, I feel like I'm making progress. Slowly, but surely. It's like I'm reclaiming pieces of myself that I thought were lost forever. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your progress is evident. See you next week, Mrs. Azizi."
