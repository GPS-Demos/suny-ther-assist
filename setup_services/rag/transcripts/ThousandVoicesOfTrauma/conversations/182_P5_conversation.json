    "Therapist: Welcome back. Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm... honestly, I'm quite nervous. Ever since you mentioned it last session, I've been apprehensive. The idea of revisiting that hostage situation... it makes my heart race just thinking about it. I understand it's part of the treatment, but I'm scared of how I might react.",
    "Therapist: Your nervousness is completely normal. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I worry that reliving the experience might be too overwhelming. What if I have a panic attack? Or what if it makes my anxiety worse instead of better? I've worked so hard to keep those memories at bay, and now we're deliberately bringing them up. It feels counterintuitive and... frightening.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's address those concerns. How can I support you today?",
    "Client: I appreciate you asking. I think... maybe if you could explain more about why this is necessary? And perhaps some reassurance that you'll be there to guide me through it if things get too intense? I trust you, but this feels like a big step.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Imaginal exposure helps process trauma memories. I'll guide you throughout. Shall I explain more?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think understanding the process better might help calm my nerves a bit. And knowing what to expect could make me feel more prepared for what's to come.",
    "Therapist: It involves recounting the trauma in present tense. This helps your brain process the memory safely. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: That makes sense, but it sounds challenging. How long will we do this for? And what if I get too overwhelmed and can't continue? I'm worried about losing control of my emotions or getting stuck in that traumatic mindset.",
    "Therapist: We'll start with 30 minutes, adjusting as needed. You can pause anytime. What coping strategies might help?",
    "Client: Okay, that's reassuring to know I have some control. As for coping strategies, maybe some deep breathing exercises? And perhaps having a stress ball to squeeze? I also find it grounding to focus on physical sensations, like feeling my feet on the floor. Would those be okay to use during the exposure?",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent strategies. We'll incorporate them. How else can I support you today?",
    "Client: Thank you, that's helpful. I think... maybe just reminding me that I'm safe here in your office if I start to get too caught up in the memory? And perhaps we could have a code word or signal if I need a break? I want to push myself, but I also want to feel like I have an 'out' if it becomes too much.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll use \"pause\" as our code word. Remember, you're in control. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: Okay, \"pause\" - I'll remember that. I'm still nervous, but I feel more prepared now. I appreciate your patience and support. I guess... I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Let's do this. Can you guide me through how to start?",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes, take a deep breath. When you're ready, describe the hostage situation as if it's happening now.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Alright... I'm at the bank. It's a Tuesday afternoon, and I'm waiting in line to deposit a check. Everything seems normal, but then... suddenly, there's shouting. I turn around and see two men with masks bursting through the door. One of them is waving a gun. My heart starts pounding, and I feel frozen in place. They're yelling at everyone to get down on the ground...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: I... I can feel the cold tile floor against my cheek as I lie there. The smell of fear is palpable - a mix of sweat and something else I can't quite place. I hear whimpers and muffled sobs from the other hostages around me. The gunmen are arguing with the bank tellers, demanding money. Their voices are harsh, angry. I'm trying to make myself as small as possible, praying they don't notice me. My whole body is trembling, and I'm finding it hard to breathe...",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: (Voice shaking) The police arrive outside. I can hear sirens, and see flashing lights through the windows. This seems to agitate the gunmen even more. One of them grabs a young woman - maybe in her twenties - and uses her as a human shield. She's crying, begging them to let her go. I want to help her, but I'm paralyzed with fear. The negotiator's voice comes over a loudspeaker, but it all sounds muffled to me. Time seems to stretch on forever. I keep thinking about my family, wondering if I'll ever see them again...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember to breathe. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: (Taking a shaky breath) I... I feel scared. My heart is racing, just like it did that day. But I also feel... present. I can still sense the office around me, feel the chair I'm sitting in. It's intense, but not as overwhelming as I feared. I think I can continue, if that's okay?",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Let's continue for a few more minutes. Describe what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: Okay. The standoff continues for hours. My legs are cramping from staying still for so long. The air feels thick and stuffy. One of the gunmen is getting more erratic, pacing back and forth. I'm terrified he might start shooting at any moment. Then suddenly, there's a loud bang - a flash grenade, I think. Everything becomes chaotic. People are screaming, running. I'm disoriented, but somehow I manage to crawl towards an exit. As I reach the door, a police officer grabs me and pulls me to safety. I'm out, but I can still hear shouting and what sounds like gunshots from inside...",
    "Therapist: Well done. Let's pause here. Take a moment to ground yourself. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) I... I'm okay. That was intense, but not as bad as I thought it would be. I feel a bit shaky, but also... relieved? Like I've faced something I've been avoiding for a long time. Thank you for guiding me through this. I think I understand now why this is important for my healing process.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength today. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: I feel... cautiously optimistic. It was challenging, but I also feel a sense of accomplishment. I'm still nervous about future sessions, but I think I'm ready to continue this work. Knowing that you're here to support me makes a big difference. Can we talk about what to expect for our next session?",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll continue gradual exposure, building on today's progress. Any other questions?",
    "Client: Not right now, I think. I'm feeling a bit drained, to be honest. But in a good way, if that makes sense? Like I've done something important, even though it was difficult. Thank you for your guidance and support today. I'm looking forward to continuing this journey, even if it's scary at times.",
    "Therapist: You've made significant progress. Remember to use your coping strategies this week. See you next time.",
    "Client: Thank you. I will definitely practice those coping strategies. I'm feeling more hopeful than I have in a long time. See you next week."
