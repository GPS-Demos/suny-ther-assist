    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Amir. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit anxious, to be honest. I've been dreading this session all week. The idea of revisiting that terrible airplane crash... it's just overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Your feelings are valid.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's just... I've spent so long trying to forget it all. The thought of purposely bringing it up again terrifies me. What if I can't handle it? What if I completely fall apart?",
    "Therapist: Those concerns are normal. We'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. But can you explain why we need to do this? I mean, isn't it better to just leave the past in the past?",
    "Therapist: Facing memories can reduce their power over you.",
    "Client: I see. So, by confronting these memories, I might actually feel less afraid of them in the long run? That makes sense, but it still sounds incredibly difficult.",
    "Therapist: It is challenging, but you're not alone.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. Can you tell me more about what exactly we'll be doing? What should I expect during this... exposure, did you call it?",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit the memory gradually. You'll describe it aloud.",
    "Client: Describe it aloud? Oh my... That sounds intense. Will I have to go into every detail? I'm worried about getting too emotional or not being able to continue.",
    "Therapist: We'll start small. You can pause anytime.",
    "Client: Okay, that's somewhat comforting. I suppose knowing I can stop if it gets too much helps. How long will this process take? Is it just for today's session?",
    "Therapist: It's a process over several sessions. We'll build gradually.",
    "Client: I see. That actually makes me feel a bit better. Knowing we're not trying to tackle everything at once. But what if I start having nightmares again or my anxiety gets worse?",
    "Therapist: That's normal initially. We'll address it together.",
    "Client: Alright. I trust you, but I'm still scared. This crash... it's affected so much of my life. My anxiety, my relationships... even my work has suffered. Will this really help?",
    "Therapist: Many find it very effective for PTSD symptoms.",
    "Client: I hope so. I'm willing to try, even though it's frightening. My husband has been so supportive, but I know this affects him too. I want to get better, for both of us.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. Yes. Let's do this. But please, if you see me getting too distressed, can you help me calm down? I'm worried about losing control.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll use grounding techniques if needed.",
    "Client: Thank you. That helps. Okay, I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Where do we start? Do I just... start talking about the crash?",
    "Therapist: Start with the moments just before boarding.",
    "Client: Alright. Well, I remember standing in line at the gate. It was a busy day at the airport. I was traveling for work, a conference in Dubai. I remember feeling a bit nervous, as I always do before flying, but nothing out of the ordinary..."
