    "Therapist: Good morning, John. How are you feeling today as we begin our imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: Morning, Doc. I'm... well, I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. This whole cyber bullying thing with my granddaughter has got me more rattled than I'd like to admit. It's bringing up a lot of stuff.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0-100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: Oh, I'd say about a 60. My stomach's in knots.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Now, close your eyes and bring yourself back to the moment you first learned about the cyber bullying. Describe what's happening.",
    "Client: (deep breath) Okay... I'm sitting in my daughter's kitchen. She's making coffee, and I can smell it. The morning light is coming through the window. My granddaughter, Sarah, she's... she's at the table, and she looks upset. Her phone keeps buzzing, and she's ignoring it. I ask her what's wrong, and she... she starts crying.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... helpless. Angry. Sarah's showing me these horrible messages on her phone. Kids calling her names, saying she's ugly, worthless. It's... it's cruel. My hands are shaking. I want to protect her, but I don't know how.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's up to about 75. My heart's racing.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: Sarah's sobbing now. She's saying she doesn't want to go to school anymore. I... I feel so damn useless. This isn't like when I was a kid. You can't just confront a bully on the playground. These cowards are hiding behind screens. I... I'm remembering when my wife died. That same feeling of powerlessness.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I hug Sarah. I tell her it's not her fault. But the words feel hollow. I'm angry at these kids, at their parents, at the school for not doing anything. I'm... I'm scared for her. What if she does something drastic?",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 85. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Focus on your breathing. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: (audible breath) Okay... okay. I'm... I'm still in the kitchen. Sarah's crying has quieted down. My daughter's on the phone with the school. I feel... I feel useless. I should be able to fix this, but I can't. It's like when Clara died. I couldn't do anything then either.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... I'm thinking I've failed. As a grandfather, as a man. I should be able to protect her. But this... this is beyond me. I don't understand this world anymore. These kids, hiding behind screens, tearing others down. It makes me sick.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: Still around 85. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I'm looking at Sarah. She looks so small, so vulnerable. I remember when she was born, how I promised I'd always keep her safe. And now... now I can't. I'm useless in this situation. I... I want to find these kids, shake some sense into them. But I can't. I'm just an old man, out of touch with this digital world.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I ask to see her phone. The messages are cruel, vicious. It reminds me of the whispers and stares after Clara died. People can be so heartless. I feel a rage building inside me. I want to throw the damn phone across the room.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's at 90 now. I feel like I'm going to explode.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: (audible breath) Right... right. I'm... I'm still in the kitchen. Sarah's stopped crying, but she looks... defeated. I hate seeing her like this. I tell her I love her, that she's strong, that she'll get through this. But I don't know if I believe it myself. I feel... I feel old. Outdated. Useless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. Keep going.",
    "Client: My daughter's off the phone now. She's saying the school will look into it, but... but I can see the doubt in her eyes. She doesn't believe they'll do anything either. I'm... I'm remembering how helpless I felt when Clara got sick. How the doctors kept saying they were doing all they could, but... but it wasn't enough.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still at 90. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. You're doing well.",
    "Client: (audible breath) Okay... I'm... I'm still in the kitchen. Sarah's gone upstairs now. My daughter's crying. I... I don't know what to do. I want to fix this, but I can't. I feel... I feel like I'm failing them both. Like I failed Clara.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I sit down at the table. My coffee's gone cold. I'm staring at my hands, these old, wrinkled hands that can't protect my family anymore. I'm... I'm feeling lost. Overwhelmed. The world's changed so much, and I... I can't keep up.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 85 now. I feel... drained.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: I... I'm thinking about Clara. How she'd know what to do. She was always better with the emotional stuff. I... I miss her. I wish she was here to help. I feel... I feel alone. Even with my family right here, I feel alone.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I get up. I tell my daughter we need to do something. Anything. We can't just sit here. I... I suggest calling a lawyer, or the police. Something. Anything. I need to feel like I'm doing something.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: It... it helps a little. I feel less helpless. But... but I'm still angry. Still scared for Sarah. I... I keep thinking about how fragile life is. How quickly things can change. One day you're happy, the next... the next you're watching your wife die, or your granddaughter being tormented.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 80. I'm... I'm exhausted.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. Let's start to wind down. Take a few deep breaths.",
    "Client: (audible breaths) Okay... okay. I'm... I'm feeling a bit calmer now. Still worried, still angry, but... but not as overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: Good. As we end this session, what are your thoughts?",
    "Client: I... I realize I'm not as helpless as I felt. There are things we can do. It won't be easy, but... but we can fight this. For Sarah. I... I think Clara would be proud of that.",
    "Therapist: Excellent work today, John. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. But... but also a bit relieved. Talking through it... it helped. My SUDS is down to about 65 now.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. We'll end here for today. Remember to practice your breathing exercises.",
    "Client: Thanks, Doc. I... I appreciate your help. This isn't easy, but... but I'm glad I'm doing it.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, John. I'll see you next week."
