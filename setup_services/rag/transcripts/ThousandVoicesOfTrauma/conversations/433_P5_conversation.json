    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. My back pain's been acting up, and I've been having more flashbacks lately. It's been hard to focus at work.",
    "Therapist: I'm sorry to hear that. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you ready?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. What exactly does that involve? I'm feeling a bit nervous about it.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel nervous. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about reliving those awful experiences from the refugee camp. The neglect, the fear... I've tried so hard to forget. Won't this make things worse?",
    "Therapist: I understand your concern. How do you think revisiting might help?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe it could help me process what happened? But I'm scared of being overwhelmed by the memories.",
    "Therapist: That's insightful. We'll go at your pace and I'll support you throughout.",
    "Client: Okay... that's reassuring. Can you tell me more about what we'll actually do?",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit a memory, and you'll describe it in detail. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It sounds challenging, but I think I can try. Will it help with my nightmares and anxiety?",
    "Therapist: Many find it reduces symptoms over time. Your courage is admirable.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm still nervous, but I want to get better. How long will this process take?",
    "Therapist: It varies, but we'll take it session by session. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Alright, I'm ready. Just... please be patient with me if I struggle. This is all so new and a bit scary.",
    "Therapist: Of course. We're in this together. Let's start slowly..."
