    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's always intense to revisit that day at the hospital. The hostage situation... it's like I'm right back there, you know? I can still hear the alarms blaring, smell the antiseptic, feel the cold floor beneath me as we huddled in that supply closet. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really intense. What stood out to you this time?",
    "Client: (deep breath) The fear. It was so palpable. I remember thinking about my late husband, wishing he was there to protect me. And then feeling guilty because... well, because I was glad he wasn't there to experience it. It's a confusing mix of emotions.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... different. Still scary, but I noticed I could breathe through it better. I used those grounding techniques we practiced. I kept reminding myself that I'm here now, I'm safe. It helped, but it's still exhausting.",
    "Therapist: You're showing real progress, Sarah. How does this connect to your day-to-day life?",
    "Client: Well, I've noticed I'm less jumpy at work. Yesterday, a tray clattered in the cafeteria, and I didn't immediately panic. It's small, but it feels like a victory. I'm starting to believe that maybe I can feel safe again, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. What's challenging you now?",
    "Client: The loneliness, I think. Going through this without my husband... it's hard. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night, heart racing, and there's no one there. I'm trying to reach out to friends more, but it's not the same.",
    "Therapist: How are you coping with those moments?",
    "Client: I've been trying that journaling you suggested. It helps, sometimes. And I've started calling my sister more often. She's been really supportive. I'm learning it's okay to need people, to ask for help. It's not easy, but I'm trying.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible resilience, Sarah. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I think... I want to try volunteering at the hospital again. Not the same one, of course, but maybe at the children's hospital across town. I miss helping people, being a part of something bigger than myself. It's scary, but I think I'm ready to take that step.",
    "Therapist: That's a brave goal. How can we prepare for that?",
    "Client: Maybe we could... role-play some scenarios? Like, what to do if I start feeling panicky in the hospital environment? And perhaps work on some more grounding techniques specific to that setting? I want to be ready.",
    "Therapist: Excellent ideas. We'll focus on that next time. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... hopeful. Like I'm finally moving forward instead of being stuck. Thank you for helping me through this. It means more than I can say.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work, Sarah. I'm here to support you.",
    "Client: (smiles softly) I know. It's making all the difference. I just hope I can keep this momentum going. Sometimes I worry I'll backslide, you know? Like all this progress will suddenly disappear.",
    "Therapist: That's a common fear. How might you address it?",
    "Client: I suppose... by reminding myself of how far I've come? And maybe keeping a record of my progress, so on bad days I can look back and see that I am moving forward, even if it doesn't always feel like it.",
    "Therapist: That's a great strategy. Anything else you want to discuss today?",
    "Client: I think that's all for now. I feel drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've done something important. I'm looking forward to trying out more exposures, as scary as they are. I want my life back, you know?",
    "Therapist: Your determination is admirable, Sarah. We'll continue next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'll keep working on my homework and journaling. And... I think I'll call my sister tonight. Share a bit of what we talked about today. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. That's a positive step. Take care, Sarah.",
    "Client: You too. See you next week."
