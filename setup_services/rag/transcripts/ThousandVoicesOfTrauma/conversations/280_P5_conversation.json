    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Singh. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit anxious, to be honest. I know we've been building up to this, but I'm not sure I'm ready to revisit my combat experiences.",
    "Therapist: Your anxiety is understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I've spent years trying to forget those memories. The idea of deliberately bringing them up... it's terrifying. What if I can't handle it? What if it makes everything worse?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How have you been coping with memories so far?",
    "Client: I've been avoiding them, mostly. Keeping busy, trying not to think about it. But sometimes, especially at night, they come back. The nightmares... they're intense.",
    "Therapist: I see. How do you think facing these memories might affect you?",
    "Client: I'm worried it might trigger a breakdown. I've worked hard to maintain some semblance of normalcy since retiring. My wife... she's been so supportive. I don't want to disappoint her by falling apart now.",
    "Therapist: Your strength is admirable. How do you think this exercise might help?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe it could help me process what happened? But it's scary. These memories, they're not just images. They're smells, sounds, feelings. It's like being right back there.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. That's why this approach can be effective. Are you ready to try?",
    "Client: I... I think so. But what if it gets too intense? Can we stop if I need to?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're in control. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Okay. Yes, let's do this. I'm nervous, but I trust you. And I want to get better, for myself and my family. Where do we start?",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. When you're ready, describe the first moment."
