    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is buzzing, you know? My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. The memory of the earthquake, it just... it brought everything back so vividly. I could almost feel the ground moving beneath me again.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: It's a jumble, honestly. Part of me is relieved that it's over, that I survived. But there's this overwhelming sense of... I don't know, guilt? Sadness? My abuela... she didn't make it, and reliving that moment when I realized she was gone... (voice breaks) It's just so hard.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing?",
    "Client: Grief, I think. It's like a heavy weight on my chest. I miss her so much, and going through that memory again... it's like losing her all over again. But there's also this... anger. Why did it have to happen? Why her?",
    "Therapist: How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's hot. Like a burning in my stomach. My fists are clenched, and I just want to... I don't know, scream or punch something. But then I feel guilty for being angry because it's not like anyone caused the earthquake, you know?",
    "Therapist: I see. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking a little. And I keep seeing flashes of that day. The crumbling buildings, the dust everywhere, the sounds of people screaming... It's like I'm there again, but I'm also here, safe in this room. It's confusing.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to be experiencing these memories while knowing you're safe here?",
    "Client: It's... strange. Like, logically I know I'm okay, but my body is still reacting like I'm in danger. My breathing is fast, and I feel tense all over. But there's also this tiny part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe stronger? Like, I survived that, and I can survive remembering it too.",
    "Therapist: Mm. What's that strength like for you?",
    "Client: It's... it's small, but it's there. Like a little spark. I guess... I've never really let myself feel everything about that day before. It's always been too overwhelming. But now, even though it's hard, I'm doing it. I'm facing it. And that feels... important somehow.",
    "Therapist: How does this experience compare to when you usually think about the earthquake?",
    "Client: It's... more intense, definitely. Usually, I try to push the memories away as soon as they come up. But this time, I let myself really go into it. It's scarier, but also... I don't know, maybe more real? Like I'm not running from it anymore.",
    "Therapist: What do you think this might mean for your healing process?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me is terrified of doing this again, of feeling all of this pain. But another part... maybe it's that little spark of strength... it's telling me that this might be how I start to move forward. To really process what happened instead of just trying to forget.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How are you feeling now compared to when we started?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, honestly. But also, maybe a little lighter? Like I've set down a heavy bag I've been carrying. I'm still sad, still miss my abuela terribly, but it feels... I don't know, cleaner somehow? Less tangled up with fear and guilt.",
    "Therapist: What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I think... I think I just need a moment. To breathe, to let all of this settle. And maybe... maybe to remember some good times with my abuela. To balance out the painful memories with some happy ones.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good idea. Shall we take a few minutes for that?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I... I remember this time when I was little, and abuela was teaching me to make empanadas. She was so patient, even when I made a mess of the kitchen. (small laugh) She had flour on her nose, and when I pointed it out, she just dotted my nose with flour too. We ended up in a flour fight, giggling like crazy. It's... it's nice to remember her laugh.",
    "Therapist: How does sharing that memory feel?",
    "Client: It's... bittersweet. There's still sadness, but it's mixed with warmth now. Like... like she's not just a tragic figure in my mind anymore. She's my abuela again, with all her love and laughter. I miss her, but I'm grateful I had her in my life.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to take away from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I want to remember that I can do this. That I can face these memories and survive them. And that my abuela was more than just how I lost her. She was a whole person, full of love and life. I want to honor all of her, not just the loss.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How are you feeling as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm tired, but... okay, I think. Like I've run a marathon or something. It was hard, but I did it. And maybe... maybe I'm a little stronger for it. Thank you for being here with me through this.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredible work today. How will you take care of yourself for the rest of the day?",
    "Client: I think I'll call my mom. Share some memories of abuela with her. And then maybe take a long, hot shower and just let myself rest. This was... a lot. But I'm glad I did it.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Remember, you can reach out if you need support. I'll see you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, I'll be here. Thank you again. This was... hard, but important. I'll see you next week."
