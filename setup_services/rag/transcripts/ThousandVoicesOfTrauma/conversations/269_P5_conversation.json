    "Therapist: Welcome back, Carlos. Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. My back's been acting up, and I'm not sure I'm ready for this. What exactly are we going to do?",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's discuss the process and address your concerns.",
    "Client: Okay, that sounds good. I've been thinking a lot about our previous sessions, especially after that earthquake last month. It brought back so many memories of the disaster I experienced years ago. And then, with all this cult stuff in the news lately... I don't know, it's just been a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Imaginal exposure helps process these memories. Shall I explain more?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I'm particularly worried about how this might affect my pain. You know how stress tends to make it worse.",
    "Therapist: We'll monitor your pain throughout. The goal is to reduce overall stress, potentially helping your pain long-term.",
    "Client: That makes sense. I'm willing to try, but I'm scared of feeling overwhelmed. How intense will this get?",
    "Therapist: It may be challenging, but we'll go at your pace. I'm here to support you throughout.",
    "Client: Okay, I appreciate that. My partner's been really supportive too, but there are some things I haven't shared with her about my past experiences. Will I need to talk about everything?",
    "Therapist: We'll focus on key memories. You control what you share. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Just one more thing - how long will this process take? I've got a big project coming up at work, and I'm worried about balancing everything.",
    "Therapist: We'll work session by session. Your well-being is the priority. Shall we start?",
    "Client: Alright, I'm ready. I trust you, doc. It's just... these memories of the disaster, and then those weird cult experiences afterward... they're all jumbled up in my head. Where do we even begin?",
    "Therapist: We'll start with one specific memory. Choose what feels most important to address first.",
    "Client: I guess the earthquake would be a good place to start. It's been on my mind a lot lately, especially with the recent tremors we've had. I can still hear the rumbling, feel the ground shaking... it's like it happened yesterday.",
    "Therapist: Good choice. We'll explore that memory. Remember, you're safe here. Ready?",
    "Client: As ready as I'll ever be, I suppose. Let's do this. I just hope it helps with the nightmares and the constant feeling of being on edge. And maybe, if we're lucky, it'll even help with my back pain.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Let's begin. Close your eyes and take a deep breath..."
