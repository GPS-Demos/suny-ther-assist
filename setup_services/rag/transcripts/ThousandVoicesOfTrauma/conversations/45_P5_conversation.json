    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I suppose. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares lately about my time in prison, and I'm not sure I'm ready to face all of that again.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you familiar with it?",
    "Client: Not really. I mean, I've heard you mention it before, but I'm not sure what it entails. Is it going to be intense? I'm worried about losing control or feeling overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: It can be challenging, but I'll guide you through it. Shall I explain more?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I'd like to know what I'm getting into. My anxiety is already kicking in just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Imaginal exposure involves revisiting your trauma memory in a safe environment. It helps process emotions and reduce PTSD symptoms.",
    "Client: That sounds... terrifying, to be honest. I've spent so long trying to avoid thinking about my time in prison. The neglect, the isolation, the fear... I'm not sure I can handle reliving all of that.",
    "Therapist: Your hesitation is normal. We'll go at your pace. How does that sound?",
    "Client: A little better, I guess. But what if I panic? Or what if I can't stop crying once I start? I'm worried about embarrassing myself or disappointing you.",
    "Therapist: There's no judgment here. Any reaction is valid. I'm here to support you throughout.",
    "Client: Okay... I appreciate that. Can you tell me more about what exactly we'll be doing? Will I need to close my eyes? Will you be asking me questions?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount your experience while I guide you. Eyes closed often helps, but it's your choice.",
    "Client: I see. I'm still nervous, but I think I understand the process a bit better now. How long will this take? And will we be doing this every session from now on?",
    "Therapist: Sessions last about 40 minutes. We'll do this weekly, adjusting as needed. Any other concerns?",
    "Client: I guess I'm worried about how I'll feel afterward. Will I be able to function normally? I have responsibilities at home and work, and I can't afford to fall apart.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel emotional after. We'll debrief and ensure you're grounded before leaving.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I appreciate your patience with all my questions. I know this is important for my recovery, but it's scary to confront these memories after so long.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. This work is crucial for healing. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm still scared, but I trust you. And I want to get better, for myself and my family. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Find a comfortable position. We'll start when you're ready."
