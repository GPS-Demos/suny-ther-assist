    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling pretty shaken up, to be honest. It's like I was right back there, you know? The ground trembling beneath my feet, the sound of glass shattering... I can still hear the screams of my coworkers. My heart is racing, and I feel this tightness in my chest.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's like... even though I know I'm safe here, my body is still reacting as if I'm in danger. I keep looking around the room, half-expecting to see debris falling or the walls cracking. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: I see. Where in your body do you feel that fear most strongly?",
    "Client: It's mainly in my chest and stomach. There's this knot in my stomach that won't go away, and my chest feels so tight it's hard to breathe properly. My hands are shaking too... I didn't even notice that until now.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"What if it happens again?\" I know it's not rational, but I can't shake this feeling that I'm not safe anywhere. At work, at home... it's like I'm always waiting for the next disaster to strike. And then I feel guilty because I survived when others didn't. I wonder why I was spared when good people lost their lives. It doesn't make sense, and I can't stop questioning it.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts and feelings compare to right after the earthquake?",
    "Client: They're... they're similar, but not as intense. Right after, I was in shock. I couldn't process anything. Now, it's like I can think more clearly about what happened, but that almost makes it worse. I remember more details, and I can't stop my mind from replaying them over and over. The fear isn't as paralyzing as it was then, but it's more... persistent, if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: I understand. What's different about how you're coping now?",
    "Client: Well, I guess I'm more aware of my reactions now. Back then, everything was just raw emotion and survival instinct. Now, I can recognize when I'm starting to spiral into those fearful thoughts. I'm trying to use some of the grounding techniques we've talked about, like focusing on my breath or naming objects in the room. It helps a little, but sometimes it feels like I'm just putting a band-aid on a gaping wound.",
    "Therapist: That's a vivid analogy. Can you tell me more about that feeling?",
    "Client: It's like... I know these techniques are supposed to help, and they do take the edge off sometimes. But the trauma feels so deep, you know? Like it's become a part of me. When I use these coping strategies, it feels like I'm just treating the surface. The fear and guilt are still there, lurking underneath. I worry that I'll never truly feel safe or whole again.",
    "Therapist: How does that worry affect your daily life?",
    "Client: It's... it's exhausting. I'm constantly on edge, always prepared for the worst. I've stopped going to crowded places because I'm afraid of not being able to escape if something happens. I've been avoiding my old workplace and anyone associated with it. Even simple things like watching TV are hard because any mention of natural disasters sends me into a panic. I feel like I'm not living, just... existing. And it's putting a strain on my relationships too. My husband tries to understand, but I can see the frustration in his eyes when I refuse to go out or when I wake him up with my nightmares.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really challenging. What gives you hope?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. I guess... the fact that I'm here, trying to work through this? There are days when I feel like giving up, but something keeps pushing me forward. Maybe it's the thought that I owe it to those who didn't survive to make the most of my life. Or maybe it's the small moments when I feel almost normal again, like when I'm gardening or playing with my dog. Those glimpses of peace... they make me think that maybe, just maybe, I can get through this and find some kind of normalcy again.",
    "Therapist: How does sharing this make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of emotions. Part of me feels vulnerable and exposed, like I'm reopening the wound. But there's also a sense of relief. Talking about it, putting it into words... it's hard, but it also feels like I'm releasing some of the pressure that's been building up inside me. And I guess... I feel a little less alone. Knowing that you're listening and trying to understand... it helps. It doesn't fix everything, but it makes the burden a little lighter.",
    "Therapist: What's one thing you've learned about yourself through this process?",
    "Client: I think... I've learned that I'm stronger than I thought. There have been so many times when I wanted to give up, when the fear and pain felt too overwhelming. But I'm still here. I'm still trying. And even though it's a struggle, I'm slowly learning to cope. I've also realized how important connection is. Before this, I was pretty independent, maybe even a bit isolated. Now, I see how crucial it is to have support, to let people in. It's scary, but it's also... healing, in a way.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired, but in a good way, I think. Like I've released something that's been weighing on me. My heart isn't racing as much anymore, and the knot in my stomach has loosened a bit. I still feel shaky, but it's not as overwhelming as it was at the beginning of our session. There's this weird mix of exhaustion and... I don't know, maybe hope? Like maybe, just maybe, I'm making progress. It's a small step, but it feels significant.",
    "Therapist: That's great. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to work more on managing the fear in my daily life. Maybe we could explore some strategies for dealing with triggers when I'm out in public? And... I think I'd like to talk about how to communicate better with my husband about what I'm going through. I want him to understand, but I'm not always sure how to express it.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like excellent goals. We'll address them next time. How do you plan to take care of yourself for the rest of the day?",
    "Client: I think I'll take a long, hot shower when I get home. That usually helps me feel more grounded. Then maybe I'll spend some time in my garden. Working with the plants, feeling the soil... it's calming. And I think I'll try to talk to my husband tonight, even if it's just to tell him that I'm working on opening up more. Baby steps, right?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Remember to be gentle with yourself. I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I really appreciate your help. See you next week."
