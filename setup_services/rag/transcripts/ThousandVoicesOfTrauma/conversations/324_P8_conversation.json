    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. The memory of that airplane crash, it's so vivid. I can still hear the screeching of metal, feel the plane shaking... It's like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I feel this tightness in my chest, like I can't breathe properly. It's as if I'm still trapped in that seat, smoke filling the cabin. I keep seeing flashes of flames, hearing people screaming. God, it's terrible.",
    "Therapist: And what thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... why did I survive when others didn't? There was a young family seated just a few rows ahead of me. I saw them during boarding, they looked so happy. And now... now they're gone. It doesn't seem fair. I feel guilty, like maybe I should have done more to help others.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a heavy weight on my shoulders. My stomach feels knotted. I just want to curl up and disappear. I can't shake the image of that mother's face as she tried to protect her child. I should have helped her, but I was frozen in fear.",
    "Therapist: What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I'm angry. Angry at the airline, angry at fate, angry at myself. Why didn't the safety measures work? Why couldn't I do more? I've always prided myself on being level-headed in a crisis, but when it really mattered, I just... I just sat there.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger manifest for you?",
    "Client: My jaw is clenched. I want to hit something. I feel this energy coursing through my body, but it has nowhere to go. It's frustrating because I know logically that there wasn't much I could have done, but emotionally... emotionally, I feel like a coward.",
    "Therapist: What's it like to share these feelings?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a bit relieving. I haven't really talked about this with anyone, not even my husband. I've been trying to act like everything's fine, but inside, I'm a mess. I'm having nightmares, I can't get on a plane anymore, I'm drinking more than I should... It's affecting everything.",
    "Therapist: How do you see this impacting your life?",
    "Client: I... I feel like I'm not the same person anymore. Before the crash, I was confident, outgoing. Now, I'm constantly on edge. I've had to turn down work opportunities because they involve flying. I'm irritable with my family. It's like this dark cloud is hanging over everything.",
    "Therapist: What do you think about that change?",
    "Client: It scares me. I don't want to be this person. I want my old life back, but I don't know how to get there. Every time I close my eyes, I'm back on that plane. The smell of jet fuel, the taste of fear... it's always there, lurking in the background.",
    "Therapist: How does talking about it now feel different?",
    "Client: It's... it's still difficult, but there's a small part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe hopeful? Like maybe by facing this head-on, I can start to process it. It's terrifying, but also... maybe necessary? I'm tired of feeling like a prisoner to this memory.",
    "Therapist: What would moving forward look like to you?",
    "Client: I think... I think it would mean being able to think about the crash without feeling overwhelmed. Being able to fly again, eventually. Not feeling guilty for surviving. Maybe even being able to honor the memory of those who didn't make it, instead of just feeling this crushing guilt and fear.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea sit with you?",
    "Client: It feels... possible. Scary, but possible. For the first time since the crash, I feel like maybe there's a way through this. I know it won't be easy, but... I want to try. I want to reclaim my life.",
    "Therapist: What's giving you that sense of possibility?",
    "Client: I guess... talking about it like this. Facing the memory instead of running from it. And... and realizing that even though it's painful, I can tolerate these feelings. They're intense, but they're not destroying me. Maybe that means I'm stronger than I thought.",
    "Therapist: How would you like to build on this?",
    "Client: I... I think I'd like to keep doing these exercises. Maybe... maybe even try to write about the experience? And I think I need to talk to my husband about what I'm going through. He's been so patient, but I've been shutting him out. I'm realizing I don't have to face this alone.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive direction. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted, to be honest. Emotionally drained. But there's also this... I don't know, this tiny spark of something. Hope, maybe? Like maybe I'm not doomed to feel this way forever. It's small, but it's there.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to delve deeper into the guilt. It's the hardest part for me to shake. And maybe... maybe start talking about how to approach flying again. The thought terrifies me, but I know I can't avoid it forever if I want my life back.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How about we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that's good. This was... intense. But thank you. For the first time in a long while, I feel like maybe there's a light at the end of this very dark tunnel. It's a lot to process, but... I'm glad I came today.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work. Take care of yourself this week.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again. See you next time."
