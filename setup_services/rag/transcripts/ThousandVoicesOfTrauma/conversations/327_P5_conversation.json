    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Johnson. Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm honestly quite nervous, Dr. Rivera. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of revisiting those painful memories... it's overwhelming. I've spent so long trying to push them away, you know? And now you're asking me to deliberately bring them back. It feels counterintuitive and, frankly, a bit scary.",
    "Therapist: I understand your apprehension. It's a common reaction. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about losing control of my emotions. What if I can't handle it? And... I'm embarrassed to admit this, but I'm also concerned about how you might perceive me. These experiences with racial trauma, they're so personal and... raw. I've never really talked about them in detail before.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. How can I support you through this process?",
    "Client: I appreciate you asking that, Dr. Rivera. I think... I need reassurance that we can stop if it becomes too much. And maybe some guidance on how to ground myself if I start feeling overwhelmed? Also, it would help to know what exactly we'll be doing. The unknown is adding to my anxiety.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll go at your pace and can pause anytime. Let's discuss grounding techniques now.",
    "Client: That would be very helpful, thank you. I've heard about deep breathing exercises, but I'm not sure how effective they are. Are there other methods we could explore? And could you walk me through what the actual exposure process will look like?",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll practice grounding techniques first. Then, you'll recount the traumatic event while I guide you.",
    "Client: Okay, that makes sense. When you say recount the event, do you mean I should describe it as if it's happening now? That sounds intense. How long will we spend on this? And what if I can't remember all the details? Some parts of that experience are still a bit hazy for me.",
    "Therapist: Yes, present tense helps engagement. We'll start with 15-20 minutes. Don't worry about gaps in memory.",
    "Client: I see. Twenty minutes sounds like a long time to be in that headspace. But I trust your expertise, Dr. Rivera. I'm curious, how will this help me in the long run? It's hard to imagine reliving these experiences could be beneficial.",
    "Therapist: It helps process the memory, reducing its power over time. Your symptoms should decrease with practice.",
    "Client: That's encouraging to hear. I've been struggling with these memories for so long, it would be a relief to feel some control over them. I'm still nervous, but I think I'm ready to give this a try. Is there anything else I should know or prepare for before we begin?",
    "Therapist: Just remember, you're safe here. Your courage is admirable. Shall we start with a grounding exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. It might help calm my nerves a bit. I'm grateful for your guidance, Dr. Rivera. Even though this is challenging, I feel like I'm in good hands. Let's give it a try.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for your trust. Let's begin with deep breathing..."
