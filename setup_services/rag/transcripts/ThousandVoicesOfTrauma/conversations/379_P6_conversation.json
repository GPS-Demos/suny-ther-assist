    "Therapist: Welcome, Jane. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, you can pause anytime. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10. I'm a bit nervous, but okay.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Start when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in my house on that day. The wind is howling outside, and I can hear things hitting the roof. The radio's warning about the cyclone approaching. I'm alone, and I'm scared. My heart's starting to race a bit.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. My palms are getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: The lights start flickering, and then everything goes dark. I fumble for my flashlight, and that's when I hear a loud crash. Something's broken through the window. I'm shaking now, and I can barely breathe. The wind is so loud, it's deafening.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's an 8 now. My chest feels tight, and I'm trembling.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: I huddle in the hallway, away from the windows. The house is creaking and groaning. I'm terrified it might collapse. I can hear things breaking outside. It feels like the world is ending. I'm crying now, wishing someone was here with me.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here with me now.",
    "Client: The storm rages for what feels like hours. I'm exhausted, but too scared to sleep. When it finally quiets down, I'm afraid to move. The silence is almost as terrifying as the noise. I slowly make my way to the living room, and... oh god, half the roof is gone. Everything's destroyed.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My SUDS is still at 9. I'm shaking, and my heart's pounding.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I step outside, and it's like a war zone. Trees are down everywhere, power lines scattered across the street. My neighbor's house is completely flattened. I feel so helpless, so small against nature's fury.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down. Maybe an 8 now. I'm still shaky, but I'm starting to remember it's just a memory.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're doing well.",
    "Client: As I walk down the street, I see people emerging from their homes. We're all in shock. But then, I see my elderly neighbor, Mrs. Thompson. She's crying, looking at her destroyed home. Without thinking, I go to her and hug her. We just stand there, holding each other.",

    "Therapist: That's a normal response. Continue.",
    "Client: In the following days, the community comes together. We help each other clean up, share food and supplies. It's still devastating, but I don't feel so alone anymore. I realize how strong we can be when we support each other.",
    "Therapist: And your final SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 4 now. I feel drained, but also... proud, I guess? Proud that I survived, that we all did.",
    "Therapist: You did incredibly well, Jane. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... lighter somehow. Like I've faced it and come out the other side.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves before we end."
