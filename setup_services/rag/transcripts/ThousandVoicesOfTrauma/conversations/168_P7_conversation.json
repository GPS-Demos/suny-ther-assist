    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Can you describe the natural disaster experience?",
    "Client: Okay... It was a severe earthquake. I remember waking up in the middle of the night to violent shaking. The whole house was creaking and groaning. I could hear things falling and breaking all around us. My wife and I scrambled out of bed, but it was so hard to keep our balance.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: We managed to get to the doorway, holding onto each other. The kids were screaming from their rooms. I wanted to run to them, but I couldn't move. I felt so helpless, so terrified. The shaking seemed to go on forever.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) I... I can still hear their cries. My children needed me, and I couldn't get to them. What kind of father am I? The guilt... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're doing great.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) When the shaking finally stopped, we rushed to check on the kids. They were scared but unharmed. The relief was immense, but then I saw the destruction around us. Our home, our belongings... so much was damaged or destroyed.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: In the days that followed, the aftershocks were constant. Every tremor sent waves of panic through me. I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat. I was constantly on edge, waiting for the next big one. The fear... it was paralyzing.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: We had to live in a shelter for weeks. The uncertainty, the loss of control over our lives... it was maddening. I felt like I had failed my family. I couldn't protect them, couldn't provide for them. The shame and helplessness... it still haunts me.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. You're doing great.",
    "Client: (voice breaking) Even now, years later, loud noises or sudden movements can trigger that fear. I find myself scanning for exits, always prepared for the worst. It's exhausting, living like this. I want to feel safe again, but I don't know how.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. Stay with it.",
    "Client: Sometimes, I have nightmares about being trapped under rubble, unable to reach my family. I wake up in a cold sweat, heart racing. It's like reliving the trauma all over again. I feel so weak, so vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: It's okay. You're safe here now.",
    "Client: (sighs) I know rationally that we're safe now, that it's unlikely to happen again. But emotionally, I can't shake this constant dread. It's affected my work, my relationships. I feel like I'm not the same person I was before the earthquake.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great strength. Keep going.",
    "Client: I find myself overprotective of my family now. I'm always preparing for the worst, stockpiling supplies, creating emergency plans. My wife says I'm paranoid, but I can't help it. The thought of losing them... it's unbearable.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: (voice quivering) Sometimes, I wonder if I'll ever feel normal again. Will I always be this anxious, this afraid? I want to be the strong, confident man I used to be. But that earthquake... it shook more than just the ground. It shook my entire sense of security, my belief in my ability to protect my loved ones.",
    "Therapist: You're very courageous. Keep going.",
    "Client: I feel guilty for struggling so much when others lost so much more. We were lucky - we survived, our home was repairable. But the emotional scars... they run so deep. I feel like I should be over it by now, but I'm not. And that makes me feel weak.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're doing great.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Talking about it like this... it's hard, but also somewhat relieving. I've kept so much of this bottled up inside. I didn't want to burden my family with my fears. But carrying it alone has been... exhausting.",
    "Therapist: You're showing real strength. Continue.",
    "Client: I want to heal, to move past this. But part of me is afraid to let go of the fear. As if staying vigilant will somehow protect us from future disasters. It's irrational, I know, but I can't seem to shake it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You're doing well.",
    "Client: (sighs) I hope that by working through this, I can find a way to feel safe again. To enjoy life without constantly waiting for the next catastrophe. I want to be present for my family, not always distracted by my fears. I want to be the husband and father they deserve.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, but also... lighter, somehow. Talking about it is difficult, but I think it's helping. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know it's a long road ahead, but I'm willing to keep working at it.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellently today. Let's end here."
