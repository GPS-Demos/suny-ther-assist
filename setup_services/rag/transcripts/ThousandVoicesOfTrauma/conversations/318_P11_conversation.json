    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Marco?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, Dr. Thompson. It's a lot to process. Going through that memory of the earthquake again... it's like I was right back there, you know? I could feel the ground shaking, hear the screams... it's intense.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out most?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. I remember feeling so small, so powerless against nature. And now, with this breakup... it's like I'm reliving that powerlessness all over again. I couldn't control the earthquake, and I couldn't control her leaving me.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does that connect to your everyday life?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... I've been struggling with control issues lately. I'm always trying to plan everything, micromanage my studies, my friendships. It's exhausting, but I can't seem to stop. Maybe it's because I'm terrified of feeling that helpless again.",
    "Therapist: Understandable. What else?",
    "Client: I... I've been having nightmares. Not just about the earthquake, but now they're mixed with scenes from the breakup. It's like my brain is combining these two traumatic events. I wake up in cold sweats, heart racing. It's affecting my studies, my social life... everything.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with these nightmares?",
    "Client: Honestly? Not well. I've been avoiding sleep, staying up late studying or binge-watching shows. I know it's not healthy, but... the thought of facing those dreams again is terrifying.",
    "Therapist: I hear you. What's helped in the past?",
    "Client: Um... I used to do breathing exercises you taught me. They helped a bit. And... talking to my roommate. He's been pretty understanding. But lately, I've been isolating myself more. I'm scared of being a burden.",
    "Therapist: You're not a burden, Marco. How else has this affected you?",
    "Client: I... I've been having trouble concentrating in class. My grades are slipping. And... I've been thinking about dropping out. Maybe moving back home to be closer to family. But then I feel weak, like I'm running away from my problems.",
    "Therapist: Running away or seeking support?",
    "Client: I... I hadn't thought of it that way. Maybe... maybe it's okay to need support sometimes? It's just... hard to admit that I'm struggling.",
    "Therapist: It takes strength to admit that. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to be kinder to myself. Maybe talk to my academic advisor about my options. And... I want to keep working on these exposures. They're tough, but I can feel them helping, bit by bit.",
    "Therapist: That's great insight, Marco. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... lighter, I guess? Like I've unpacked some of the weight I've been carrying. It's still there, but... it feels more manageable now. Thank you, Dr. Thompson.",
    "Therapist: You did the work, Marco. Same time next week?",
    "Client: Yeah, I'll be here. Thanks again, doc."
