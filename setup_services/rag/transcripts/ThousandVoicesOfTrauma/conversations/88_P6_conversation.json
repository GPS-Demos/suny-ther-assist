    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's begin. Close your eyes and recall the memory.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in that dimly lit room. The air feels heavy, and there's a musty smell. I can hear muffled voices from the other side of the door. My heart is racing, and my palms are sweaty.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 6 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: I'm... I'm sitting on a worn-out mattress, and I can feel the springs digging into my legs. The wallpaper is peeling, and there are water stains on the ceiling. I'm trying to make myself as small as possible, hoping they won't notice me.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, and I'm starting to breathe faster. It's like I'm back there, and I can't escape.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to an 8.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Stay with the memory. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear footsteps approaching the door. My whole body tenses up, and I feel nauseous. The doorknob turns, and I... I can't...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: A man enters the room. He's tall and intimidating. His eyes are cold, and he's smiling, but it's not a kind smile. I want to run, but I'm frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe slowly. You're safe here in my office.",
    "Client: *takes a deep breath* Okay... I'm trying. The man is speaking, but I can't understand what he's saying. My ears are ringing, and everything feels distant.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What do you notice about your body?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking, and I feel dizzy. I want to close my eyes and disappear.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What's happening now?",
    "Client: He's... he's reaching out to touch my face. I flinch away, but there's nowhere to go. I feel so helpless and scared.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating at this point?",
    "Client: It's still a 9. Maybe even a 9.5. I don't know how much more I can take.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Remember, you survived this. You're strong.",
    "Client: *voice shaking* I know, but it feels so real right now. I can almost feel his hand on my skin.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud noise outside. The man turns away, distracted. I see my chance and... I run. I just run as fast as I can.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you're running?",
    "Client: My legs are burning, and my lungs feel like they're on fire. But I keep going. I don't look back.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down. Maybe a 7?",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're moving through it. What happens after you run?",
    "Client: I find myself on a busy street. People are walking by, not noticing me. I'm gasping for air, but I feel a sense of relief washing over me.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. My heart is still racing, but I feel safer. Like I've escaped.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5 now. I'm starting to feel more present.",
    "Therapist: You've done exceptionally well. Let's start to bring you back to the present moment.",
    "Client: *takes a deep breath* Okay. I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You are safe. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also relieved. It was intense, but I got through it.",
    "Therapist: You did. You showed incredible strength. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves."
