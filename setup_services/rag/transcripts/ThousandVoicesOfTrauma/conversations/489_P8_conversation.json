    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. The memory of that hurricane, it's so vivid now. I can still hear the wind howling, you know? It's like it's right here in the room with us.",
    "Therapist: What sensations are you noticing in your body right now?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking a bit. And there's this tightness in my chest, like I can't quite catch my breath. It's almost like I'm back there, trying to hold onto something, anything, as the water rises. I keep thinking about my neighbor's house, how it just... collapsed. Gone in an instant.",
    "Therapist: How does recalling that image make you feel?",
    "Client: Terrified. Helpless. I mean, I've lived through wars back home, but this... nature's fury, it's different. You can't reason with it, can't negotiate. I feel so small, so insignificant. And guilty too, you know? I survived when others didn't.",
    "Therapist: Can you tell me more about that guilt?",
    "Client: It's... it's consuming sometimes. Why me? Why did I get to walk away when Mrs. Johnson next door didn't make it? I keep thinking maybe if I'd gone to check on her sooner... And then there's this voice in my head saying I should be grateful, but how can I be when so many lost everything?",
    "Therapist: What do you think that voice is trying to tell you?",
    "Client: I suppose... it's trying to remind me that I have a second chance. But it's hard to feel worthy of it, you know? Especially now, with this chronic pain. Some days I wonder if surviving was really a blessing or just prolonging the suffering.",
    "Therapist: How does your pain relate to the memory of the hurricane?",
    "Client: It's... it's a constant reminder. I injured my back helping clear debris after the storm. Every twinge, every ache brings me right back to those chaotic days afterward. The pain and the memories, they're tangled up together. Sometimes I can't tell where one ends and the other begins.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts come up when you make that connection?",
    "Client: I feel... angry. Frustrated. Like my body's betrayed me. I used to be so strong, you know? Could work all day without breaking a sweat. Now, some days I can barely get out of bed. And then I feel guilty for complaining when I should just be thankful to be alive. It's exhausting, this cycle.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings impact your daily life?",
    "Client: They... they isolate me. I've withdrawn from friends, family. It's hard to explain to them what I'm going through. How do you describe the weight of survival? The constant replay of that day in my head? And the pain, it's invisible. People see an old man, they don't see the storm still raging inside.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to you to find some peace amidst that storm?",
    "Client: Peace? I... I'm not sure I even remember what that feels like. But I guess it would mean being able to remember without reliving. To honor those we lost without drowning in guilt. To feel the rain without fearing another flood. Maybe... maybe it would mean forgiving myself for surviving.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How does saying that out loud feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's scary. But also, there's a tiny spark of hope there. Like maybe, just maybe, I can learn to live with this. Not forget, never forget, but... coexist with the memory without letting it consume me. Is that even possible?",
    "Therapist: What do you think? Is it possible?",
    "Client: I... I want to believe it is. It's hard to imagine right now, but being here, talking about it... it feels like a step. A small one, but a step nonetheless. Maybe with time, with work, I can find a way to honor the past without sacrificing my present. It's just... it's going to be a long road.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about taking that road?",
    "Client: Scared. Overwhelmed. But also... determined, I think. I'm tired of feeling trapped by these memories, by the pain. I want to find a way forward, for myself and for those who didn't get the chance. It won't be easy, but... I'm here, aren't I? That's something.",
    "Therapist: Indeed it is. What's one thing you can do to support yourself this week?",
    "Client: I... I think I might try talking to my grandson. He's always asking about my life, and I've been pushing him away. Maybe sharing some good memories, not just the traumatic ones, could help. It's a small step, but it's something, right?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a meaningful step. How does planning this make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of emotions. There's some anxiety, wondering if I'll get overwhelmed. But there's also a glimmer of excitement. The idea of connecting, of sharing... it's been so long since I've allowed myself that. It feels like... like I'm starting to peek out from behind the walls I've built.",
    "Therapist: That's a beautiful image. What else are you noticing as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, somehow. Like I've set down a burden I didn't even realize I was carrying. The memories are still there, the pain too, but... there's a little more space around them now. It's like I can breathe a bit easier. Is this... is this what progress feels like?",
    "Therapist: What do you think? Does it feel like progress to you?",
    "Client: You know what? I think it does. It's small, and I know there's a long way to go, but... yeah. This feels like a step forward. Thank you for... for helping me see that there might be a way through this after all.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. How would you like to close our session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to take a moment of silence. To honor the memory of those we lost, but also to acknowledge this small step forward. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's do that.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I'm ready to face the week ahead now. It won't be easy, but... I feel a little stronger than I did when I walked in here today.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. I look forward to our next session."
