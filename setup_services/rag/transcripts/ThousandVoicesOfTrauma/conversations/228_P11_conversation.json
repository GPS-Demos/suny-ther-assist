    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. My heart is still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. But at the same time, there's this weird sense of relief? Like, I got through it, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you about the experience?",
    "Client: The sounds. I didn't expect that. When I was describing the camp, I could hear the constant murmur of voices, the crying babies, the occasional shouts. It was like I was right back there. And the smell... that musty, damp smell of too many people in too small a space. It made my stomach churn just like it did back then.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. I felt so vulnerable, like I was that scared young woman again. But this time, I knew I was safe here with you. It's strange, but I felt both trapped in the memory and aware that I could stop if I needed to. That helped me push through, I think.",
    "Therapist: You showed great courage. How do you think this relates to your PTSD symptoms?",
    "Client: Well, I've been avoiding anything that reminds me of that time. Even certain smells or sounds would send me into a panic. But going through it like this, it's like... I'm facing it head-on? I still felt afraid, but I didn't fall apart. Maybe that means I'm stronger than I thought.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. What else did you notice?",
    "Client: I realized how much anger I've been carrying. Not just about what happened to me, but about the whole situation. The injustice of it all. I've been so focused on being afraid that I didn't even recognize how angry I was.",
    "Therapist: How does acknowledging that anger feel?",
    "Client: It's... liberating, in a way. Like I'm allowing myself to feel something other than fear for once. But it's also scary. I'm not sure what to do with all this anger.",
    "Therapist: That's something we can work on. What else?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about the other women in the camp. Some of them were so kind to me, even though they were suffering too. I wonder if I've been too isolated, pushing people away when maybe connecting with others could help.",
    "Therapist: That's a valuable observation. How might you act on that?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe I could try reaching out to that support group you mentioned? It's terrifying to think about, but after today, I feel like maybe I could handle it.",
    "Therapist: That's a great idea. How are you feeling about continuing with the exposures?",
    "Client: It's hard, really hard. But I think I'm starting to see how it could help. Each time, it's like... I'm reclaiming a piece of myself that I thought I'd lost. I want to keep going, even though it scares me.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is admirable. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For guiding me through this, for being here. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in years, I feel like there might actually be a light at the end of this very dark tunnel.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?"
