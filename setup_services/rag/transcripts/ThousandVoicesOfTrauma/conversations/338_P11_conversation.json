    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart is still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. That memory of witnessing the violence when I was a kid... it's still so vivid, you know? I could almost smell the fear in the air again.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sounds, I think. The yelling, the crashes... I remember curling up in my closet, trying to block it all out. But what really got to me this time was realizing how small and helpless I felt. I've never really thought about that before.",
    "Therapist: How does recognizing that feeling impact you now?",
    "Client: It's... eye-opening, I guess. I've always tried to be strong, you know? But maybe that's why I get so anxious when I feel like I'm not in control. It's like I'm that scared kid again, waiting for the next bad thing to happen.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful connection. How does it relate to your current experiences?",
    "Client: Well, I've noticed I get really tense when there are loud noises or arguments at work. I think I'm always on guard, waiting for something terrible to happen. It's exhausting, honestly. And it affects my relationship with my wife too. I hate feeling vulnerable around her.",
    "Therapist: What do you think about that connection?",
    "Client: I... I never saw it that way before. It's like I'm still trying to protect myself from something that's not actually happening anymore. Maybe that's why I have trouble opening up to people, even my wife. I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop.",
    "Therapist: How might recognizing this impact your recovery goals?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I need to work on feeling safe in the present. Like, reminding myself that I'm not that helpless kid anymore. I have resources now, and people who care about me. It's just hard to internalize that sometimes.",
    "Therapist: That's a great insight. What might help you feel more grounded in the present?",
    "Client: I'm not sure... Maybe practicing some of those breathing exercises we talked about? And maybe... this is hard for me, but maybe trying to be more open with my wife about what I'm going through. She wants to help, but I've always pushed her away when it comes to this stuff.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like positive steps. How do you feel about trying that?",
    "Client: Nervous, honestly. But also... kind of hopeful? Like, maybe if I can start dealing with this stuff head-on instead of always trying to run from it, things might actually get better. It's scary, but I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: That's courageous. What support do you need moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... just knowing that I have a safe space here to process these memories is huge. And maybe some guidance on how to talk to my wife about this? I don't want to burden her, but I know keeping her at arm's length isn't helping either.",
    "Therapist: We can definitely work on that. How are you feeling now compared to when we started?",
    "Client: Still a bit shaky, but... clearer, I think. Like I understand myself a little better. It's hard facing these memories, but I can see how it might actually help in the long run. I just hope I can keep this perspective when I'm not here in your office.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. What might help you maintain this awareness?",
    "Client: Maybe... writing some of this down? Like a journal or something? I've never been much of a writer, but it might help me keep track of these realizations. And maybe setting some small goals for myself, like trying one of those grounding techniques when I start feeling anxious at work.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent ideas. How do you feel about our session today?",
    "Client: It was tough, but... good, I think. I feel like I've made some progress, even if it's just in understanding myself better. I'm grateful for your guidance, and... I think I'm actually looking forward to our next session. Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It shows your commitment. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For creating a space where I can face these memories without feeling judged. I know we have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like there might actually be a light at the end of this tunnel."
