    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. That memory of witnessing the human trafficking situation... it's just so vivid, you know? I can still see their faces, the fear in their eyes. It's like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. I remember feeling so powerless, watching those people being herded like cattle. I wanted to do something, anything, but I was frozen. It's frustrating to think about now. I should have done more.",
    "Therapist: How does that frustration feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like a knot in my stomach. Tight and uncomfortable. My jaw's clenched too. I guess I'm holding onto a lot of tension from that memory.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts come up as you notice that tension?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"I failed them.\" I know logically that I couldn't have taken on the traffickers alone, but emotionally... I feel like I let those people down. And now I'm always on edge, always looking for signs of trouble. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your day-to-day life?",
    "Client: Well, I'm constantly vigilant. I struggle to trust people, especially in crowded places. I've been avoiding the area where it happened completely. It's affecting my studies too - I have trouble concentrating when my mind wanders back to that day.",
    "Therapist: What have you learned about yourself through this process?",
    "Client: I've realized how much this event has shaped me. But also... I'm stronger than I thought. Reliving it is hard, but I'm doing it. I'm facing it. That counts for something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's tough, really tough. But I want to get better. I want to feel safe again, to not let this control my life. So yeah, I'm willing to keep going. It's just... it's a lot sometimes, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What helps you cope after sessions?",
    "Client: I've been trying that breathing exercise you taught me. It helps a bit. And talking to my sister - she doesn't know the details, but she's supportive. Sometimes I go for a long walk to clear my head.",
    "Therapist: Good. How else can we support you in this process?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. Maybe... could we spend some time at the end of sessions talking about something positive? Just to shift gears a bit before I leave? And I think I might need some extra support in the days after we do these exposures.",
    "Therapist: Those are great suggestions. Anything else you want to discuss?",
    "Client: I think that's it for now. I'm tired, but... I feel like I'm making progress. Slowly, but still. Thanks for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't judge.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue at your pace. Take care."
