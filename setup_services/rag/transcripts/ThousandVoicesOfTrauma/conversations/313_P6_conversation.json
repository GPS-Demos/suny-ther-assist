    "Therapist: Alright, Mrs. Johnson, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: I suppose so, dear. Though I must admit, I'm feeling a bit jittery about this whole thing. My hands are already starting to shake a little.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and describe the night of the home invasion.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) It was a chilly autumn evening. I was alone in my house, watching my favorite game show. Suddenly, I heard a loud crash from the kitchen. My heart nearly stopped. I... I froze in my chair, unable to move.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Oh, I'd say about a 4. My palms are getting a bit sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue, please.",
    "Client: Well, I heard footsteps. Heavy, unfamiliar footsteps. They were coming closer, and I couldn't breathe. I felt like a rabbit caught in a trap. Then, this... this man appeared in the doorway. He was wearing a mask, but his eyes... oh, his eyes were so cold. I've never seen such lifeless eyes before.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. My chest feels tight, and I can hear my heart pounding in my ears.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: He had a knife. It glinted in the light from the TV. I wanted to scream, but no sound came out. He demanded money, jewelry, anything valuable. I couldn't speak, I just pointed to my purse on the side table. He grabbed it, then started rummaging through my drawers. I felt so... so violated. Like my whole life was being torn apart.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) It's... it's an 8 now. I feel like I'm back there. My whole body is tense, and I'm having trouble catching my breath.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Inhales deeply) Thank you, dear. It's just... I keep seeing his face, or rather, that mask. And feeling so helpless. He took my wedding ring, you know. The last thing I had from my Harold. I... I felt like I'd failed Harold somehow, by letting it be taken.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Still at an 8. My hands are shaking something awful. But... but I want to continue. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. You're very brave.",
    "Client: After he left, I just sat there. For hours. I couldn't move. I was afraid he'd come back. The police came eventually - a neighbor had heard the commotion. But by then, he was long gone. I felt so ashamed, so weak. Like I should have done something, anything.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually gone down to a 7. Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also... I don't know, releasing somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: My heart's still racing, but my breathing's a bit easier. My shoulders are so tense though, like I'm carrying a heavy weight.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Keep going.",
    "Client: The worst part was the nights after. Every little sound made me jump. I couldn't sleep. I kept reliving it over and over. That's... that's when I started drinking more. To numb it all. I know it wasn't right, but I just couldn't bear feeling so... so vulnerable all the time.",
    "Therapist: SUDS now?",
    "Client: Back up to an 8. Remembering those sleepless nights, the constant fear... it's overwhelming. I feel a lump in my throat, like I might cry.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to cry. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Voice breaks) I just... I lost my sense of security that night. My home didn't feel like home anymore. It felt like a prison. I was too scared to leave, but too scared to stay. How... how do you move on from that?",
    "Therapist: That's what we're working on. SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a 6 now. Talking about it... it's helping. I feel less alone with it all.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Tired. So very tired. But also... lighter, somehow. Like I've set down a heavy burden, even if just for a moment.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Let's start winding down. Take some deep breaths.",
    "Client: (Breathes deeply) Thank you, dear. This wasn't easy, but... I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: You did wonderfully. How would you rate your SUDS now?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 3. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger?",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's end here for today."
