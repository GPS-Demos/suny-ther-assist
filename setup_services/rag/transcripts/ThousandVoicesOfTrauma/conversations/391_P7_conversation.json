    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the day of the animal attack?",
    "Client: Okay... I was 10 years old. It was a hot summer day, and I was playing in my uncle's backyard. The grass was dry and yellow, and I could hear cicadas buzzing. I remember feeling excited because my cousins were coming over later.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue with what happened next.",
    "Client: I saw my uncle's dog, a large German Shepherd, lying in the shade. I wanted to pet him, so I walked over slowly. As I got closer, I noticed his water bowl was empty. I thought I'd be helpful and fill it up.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that memory.",
    "Client: I... I reached for the bowl, and suddenly, the dog lunged at me. His teeth... (voice trembling) his teeth sank into my arm. The pain was excruciating. I screamed, but no one came immediately. The dog kept shaking my arm, and I could feel my skin tearing.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. It's okay to feel those emotions.",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) I can still hear the growling, feel the hot breath on my skin. I was terrified, thinking I was going to die. Blood was everywhere, and I couldn't free myself. I kept calling for help, but it felt like an eternity before anyone came.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it.",
    "Client: Finally, my uncle came running. He yelled at the dog, and it released me. I collapsed on the ground, sobbing uncontrollably. My arm was mangled, and I was in shock. The pain... it was unlike anything I'd ever felt before.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel distressed. You're safe now.",
    "Client: My uncle scooped me up and rushed me to the car. I remember the fabric of his shirt against my face, soaked with my tears and blood. The drive to the hospital was a blur of sirens and my own whimpering. I kept thinking about how I'd never be able to use my arm again.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. Keep going.",
    "Client: At the hospital, everything was chaotic. Doctors and nurses swarmed around me. I was so scared of the needles, the stitches... I didn't want them to touch me. But the pain was unbearable. I remember my mother arriving, her face pale with shock. She tried to comfort me, but I couldn't stop crying.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The recovery was long and painful. I had nightmares for months. Every time I saw a dog, even a small one, I'd freeze up. I couldn't go back to my uncle's house for years. The scars on my arm... they're a constant reminder. Sometimes, I still wake up in a cold sweat, feeling those teeth.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: (deep breath) Shaken, but... oddly relieved. It's like a weight has been lifted, talking about it in detail. I've never really done that before. It's still painful, but maybe... maybe it's getting easier to face.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. We'll end here for today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I didn't think I could get through that, but I did. It's still vivid, but I feel... I don't know, maybe a bit stronger?",
    "Therapist: That's normal. We'll continue working through this together."
