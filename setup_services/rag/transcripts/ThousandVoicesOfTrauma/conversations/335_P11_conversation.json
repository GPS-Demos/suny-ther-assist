    "Therapist: How are you feeling after today's imaginal exposure, Mrs. Amir?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. Reliving that moment when I saw the dog attack my neighbor's child... it's still so vivid in my mind. I can hear the screams, see the blood... (voice trembles) It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most to you this time?",
    "Client: The helplessness. I remember feeling frozen, unable to move or help. I keep thinking, \"Why didn't I do something?\" It's... it's eating me up inside. I've lived a long life, seen many things, but this... this haunts me.",
    "Therapist: How does that feeling of helplessness connect to your daily life now?",
    "Client: Well, I... I find myself constantly on edge, especially around animals. I used to love going to the park with my grandchildren, but now I'm terrified something might happen. It's affecting my relationship with my family. My husband doesn't understand why I've become so... so anxious all the time.",
    "Therapist: What insights have you gained from today's session?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm starting to see how much this incident has changed me. I've always been strong, you know? Raising children in a new country, adapting to a different culture. But this... this has shaken my foundation. I realize now that I've been avoiding so many things, isolating myself. It's not just about the attack anymore; it's affecting everything.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it feel to recognize that?",
    "Client: It's... it's both frightening and somewhat liberating. Frightening because I see how much work I have ahead of me. But liberating because... well, because now I can see why I've been feeling so low, so depressed. It's not just old age or retirement like I thought. There's a reason, and maybe... maybe there's hope for change.",
    "Therapist: What do you think might be a small step forward?",
    "Client: I... I think I'd like to try visiting the park again. Maybe not where children play at first, but just... just to sit on a bench and breathe. To prove to myself that I can do it. It's been so long since I've enjoyed the outdoors without fear.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a brave goal. How can we support that?",
    "Client: Perhaps... perhaps my husband could come with me? He's been so patient, even when he doesn't understand. And maybe we could start with just a few minutes, then gradually increase the time? I don't want to push too hard and set myself back.",
    "Therapist: Excellent idea. Is there anything else you'd like to share?",
    "Client: I... I want to thank you. This isn't easy, reliving these memories. But for the first time in a long while, I feel like I'm not just stuck in that moment anymore. There's a glimmer of... of something. Hope, maybe? It's small, but it's there.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's difficult, no doubt. But I've survived worse, haven't I? I came to a new country, learned a new language, built a life here. If I could do all that, then... then I can face this too. I want to be present for my family again, to enjoy life without this constant fear. So yes, I'm willing to keep going, no matter how hard it gets.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful commitment. What's one thing you'll take away today?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's that I'm not alone in this. The attack happened to me, yes, but its effects ripple out to my whole family. And that means... that means I'm not just doing this for myself. I'm doing it for them too. That gives me strength, you know? To keep pushing forward, even when it's hard.",
    "Therapist: Beautiful insight. How would you like to end our session?",
    "Client: I'd like to take a moment to just... breathe. To remind myself that I'm here, now, safe. And to hold onto that feeling of hope we talked about. It's small, but it's there. And maybe... maybe next time, it'll be a little bit stronger."
