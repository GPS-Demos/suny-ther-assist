    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I think so... I'm feeling a bit jittery, to be honest. But I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Uh, I'd say about a 6 out of 10 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath, and when you're ready, describe the scene.",
    "Client: (inhales deeply) Alright... I'm 8 years old. It's a warm evening, and I'm in our small apartment in the city. The TV is on, but I'm not really watching it. I can hear raised voices from next door...",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: I see our old beige couch, a bit torn on the armrest. There's a half-empty glass of water on the coffee table. The curtains are drawn, but there's still some light coming through. I... I can hear the argument getting louder.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: (voice trembling slightly) The shouting gets worse. I hear a loud crash, like something breaking. I'm frozen on the couch, my heart is racing. I want to cover my ears, but I can't move.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about an 8.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep going, Carlos.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a scream. It's... it's Mrs. Rodriguez from next door. I hear heavy footsteps, and then a thud. Oh God, I remember feeling so scared...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (breathes shakily) I... I get up from the couch. My legs feel wobbly. I creep to the window and peek through the curtains. I can see into their apartment... (voice breaks) There's blood on the floor...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it, Carlos. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (crying softly) Mrs. Rodriguez is on the ground. Mr. Rodriguez is standing over her, his fists clenched. He looks... he looks so angry. I've never seen someone look like that before.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My stomach is in knots. My hands are shaking. I feel like I can't breathe...",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe with me. In... and out.",
    "Client: (breathes with the therapist) Okay... okay. I'm still there, watching. Mr. Rodriguez starts pacing, running his hands through his hair. Mrs. Rodriguez isn't moving. I'm terrified he'll see me watching.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear sirens in the distance. Mr. Rodriguez hears them too. He looks panicked now. He grabs his keys and runs out of the apartment. I duck away from the window, my heart pounding so hard I think it might burst out of my chest.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. Maybe even a 10. I feel like I'm right back there...",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. This is a memory. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm huddled on the floor, my back against the wall. The sirens are getting closer. I'm shaking all over. I want to help Mrs. Rodriguez, but I'm too scared to move. I feel... I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: That must have been terrifying for you. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I finally get the courage to move. I creep to our front door and open it just a crack. I can see police officers running up the stairs. They're shouting, but I can't understand what they're saying. Everything seems muffled, like I'm underwater.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Carlos. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: One of the officers sees me. He asks me something, but I can't speak. I just point to the Rodriguez's apartment. They rush over there. I see them kick the door open. There's so much noise, so much chaos...",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel numb. Like I'm watching everything happen from far away. But my body is still shaking. I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response to trauma. You're safe now. What happens after the police arrive?",
    "Client: More people come. Paramedics. They bring out Mrs. Rodriguez on a stretcher. She's covered in blood, but I can see her chest moving. She's alive. I feel a rush of relief, but I'm still so scared.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe a 7?",
    "Therapist: That's good. Keep going.",
    "Client: A policewoman comes over to me. She's gentle, asks me if I'm okay. I can't speak, I just nod. She asks where my parents are. I manage to tell her they're at work. She stays with me, tells me everything will be okay. But I don't believe her. How can things ever be okay after this?",
    "Therapist: That's a very normal thought to have. What happens next?",
    "Client: My parents come home. They look scared when they see the police. The policewoman explains what happened. My mom hugs me so tight I can barely breathe. My dad looks angry, but also sad. They take me inside, away from all the commotion.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel as your parents take you inside?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel safe with them, but also still scared. Like the world isn't safe anymore. I keep seeing Mrs. Rodriguez on the floor, the blood... (voice breaks) I can't get it out of my head.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. You went through something very traumatic. How does your body feel now?",
    "Client: My shoulders are so tense they hurt. My stomach is still in knots. I feel exhausted, but I know I won't be able to sleep.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here now, you're safe. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 6 now. I feel drained.",
    "Therapist: That's normal after processing such a difficult memory. You did very well, Carlos. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you name five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: (looks around) I see... the plant in the corner, your desk, the clock on the wall, the painting of the ocean, and the box of tissues.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, four things you can touch.",
    "Client: The armrest of this chair, my wedding ring, the fabric of my shirt, and... the floor under my feet.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Three things you can hear?",
    "Client: The air conditioning, a car passing outside, and my own breathing.",
    "Therapist: Two things you can smell?",
    "Client: The faint scent of your air freshener, and coffee from somewhere.",
    "Therapist: And finally, one thing you can taste?",
    "Client: The mint from the gum I had earlier.",
    "Therapist: Great job, Carlos. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... more present. Still shaken, but not as overwhelmed. My SUDS is probably down to a 4 now.",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. You've done some hard work today. How are you feeling about the session?",
    "Client: It was tough... really tough. But I also feel like I've faced something I've been running from for a long time. It's... it's a strange mix of exhaustion and... I don't know, maybe a tiny bit of pride?",
    "Therapist: That pride is well-deserved. You showed great courage today. Let's talk about some self-care strategies for the rest of your day.",
    "Client: Okay... I think I might need a nap when I get home. Maybe call my wife and ask her to pick up some comfort food for dinner.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like good ideas. Remember to be gentle with yourself. We'll process more in our next session. Do you have any questions before we wrap up?",
    "Client: No, I don't think so. Thank you for guiding me through this. It was hard, but... I think it was important.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Carlos. I'm proud of the work you did today. Take care, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. See you next week."
