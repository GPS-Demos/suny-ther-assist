    "Therapist: Welcome back. Are you ready to continue our imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with your SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10. I'm anxious, but not overwhelmed yet.",
    "Therapist: Okay. When you're ready, close your eyes and describe the airplane crash.",
    "Client: *deep breath* I'm in my seat, feeling the plane shake. The turbulence is getting worse. I can hear the engines straining... Oh god, we're dropping! People are screaming. I'm gripping the armrests so tight my knuckles are white. The oxygen masks drop down, and I'm fumbling to put mine on. My heart is racing, and I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 7 now. My palms are sweating, and my chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: The plane is nosediving. I can see the ocean getting closer through the window. Someone next to me is praying out loud. I'm thinking about my family, wondering if I'll ever see them again. The flight attendants are strapped in, looking terrified. We hit the water with a massive jolt, and I'm thrown forward against my seatbelt. Water starts rushing in...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm there again. My body is shaking, and I can almost taste the saltwater.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *inhales shakily* The water is rising fast. People are panicking, trying to get out of their seats. I'm struggling with my seatbelt, my fingers feel numb. The plane is tilting, and I'm sliding towards the window. I manage to unbuckle and start moving towards the emergency exit. The water is up to my chest now, and it's so cold...",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: Still a 9. My heart is pounding so hard it hurts.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I reach the exit, but it's jammed. People are pushing and shoving. Someone helps me, and we finally get it open. The rush of water nearly knocks me over. I take a deep breath and dive into the ocean. It's dark, and I can't tell which way is up. I'm kicking desperately, my lungs burning...",
    "Therapist: And now?",
    "Client: *voice trembling* It's... it's an 8. I can feel my body starting to relax a little, but I'm still shaking.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I break the surface, gasping for air. There's debris everywhere. I grab onto a floating seat cushion. I can see other survivors in the water, and some... some bodies. The plane is sinking quickly. I'm so cold, my teeth are chattering. I keep looking around, hoping to see rescue boats or helicopters, but there's nothing...",

    "Client: Exhausted. Drained. But... also a bit relieved? Like I've faced something I've been avoiding for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. Shall we end here?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think I need a moment to process all of this.",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've shown incredible strength today."
