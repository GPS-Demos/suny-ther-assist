    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. Reliving that earthquake was more intense than I expected. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of drained. It's strange, you know? I haven't thought about that day in such detail for years, but going through it just now, it felt so real again.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sound. I'd forgotten how loud it was. The rumbling of the earth, the crashing of things falling all around us. And the screams... God, the screams of people panicking. It was like being in the middle of a war zone. I remember huddling under my desk, convinced the building was going to collapse on top of me. My coworkers were crying, and I just felt so... helpless.",
    "Therapist: That sounds terrifying. How did it feel to revisit that memory?",
    "Client: It was tough, really tough. I felt that same panic rising in my chest, you know? That feeling of not knowing if you're going to make it out alive. But... there was something different this time. I mean, I knew I was safe here with you, even as I was reliving it. It's like... I could feel scared but also know I wasn't actually in danger. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How does this relate to your daily life?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... I've been avoiding anything that reminds me of earthquakes. I don't watch disaster movies, I change the channel if there's news about earthquakes, I even avoid tall buildings when I can. But going through this memory, as hard as it was, makes me wonder if I've been giving those fears too much power. Maybe I don't need to be so controlled by them.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. What else?",
    "Client: I... I noticed something else too. When I was describing the aftermath, how we all came together to help each other, check on our neighbors... I felt a warmth, almost pride. We survived something terrible, but we weren't broken by it. I'd forgotten that part, you know? How resilient we can be.",
    "Therapist: Mm. How might this realization impact you moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I need to give myself more credit. I've been so focused on how the earthquake traumatized me that I forgot how strong I was, how strong we all were. Maybe I can face my fears a bit more. Not just about earthquakes, but in general. I've been letting my anxiety hold me back in my business, always fearing the worst. But if I could get through that day, maybe I can handle more than I think.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's scary, but... I think I'm ready. I want to feel more in control of my life again. This session was hard, but I also feel like I've taken a step forward. I want to keep going, even if it's difficult. I want to reclaim the parts of myself I've been hiding away.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. Shall we schedule our next session?",
    "Client: Yes, please. And... thank you. For guiding me through this. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel hopeful about the future.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Sarah. Your progress today was significant. See you next week?",
    "Client: Definitely. I'll be here. Thank you again."
