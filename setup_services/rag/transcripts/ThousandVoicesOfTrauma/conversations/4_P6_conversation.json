    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Can you describe the memory we're focusing on today?",
    "Client: Sure... It's about the day I found out my brother had been trafficked. I remember sitting in my living room when I got the call from the police. They said he'd been missing for weeks, and they'd just found him in a warehouse across the country. He'd been... he'd been forced to work in terrible conditions. I felt so helpless, so guilty that I hadn't known...",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: I'd say it's about a 6 out of 10. My heart's starting to race a bit just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue with the memory, please.",
    "Client: Well, after I got the call, I just sat there in shock. I couldn't move. My mind was racing with all these horrible scenarios of what my brother must have gone through. I kept thinking about how scared he must have been, how alone he must have felt. And I... I wasn't there for him. I should have known something was wrong when he stopped calling...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Maybe an 8 now. My palms are sweating, and I feel this tightness in my chest.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Stay with it. What happened next?",
    "Client: I... I remember finally getting up and pacing around the room. I called our parents, and hearing their voices break when I told them... God, it was awful. I felt like I was destroying their world. And then I had to start making arrangements to go see him, to bring him home. But I was terrified of what I'd find when I got there...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's still an 8, maybe even a 9 now. I feel like I can't breathe properly. My hands are shaking...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... *deep breath* When I finally saw him in the hospital, he looked... broken. Physically and emotionally. His eyes were so empty, and he flinched when I tried to hug him. I felt this overwhelming mix of relief that he was alive, and horror at what he'd been through. And guilt... so much guilt that I hadn't protected him somehow.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually gone down a bit. Maybe a 7? I still feel shaky, but talking about it... it's helping somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Keep going.",
    "Client: The next few weeks were a blur of hospitals, police interviews, and trying to help him recover. He wouldn't talk much about what happened, but sometimes he'd wake up screaming. I'd sit with him, feeling completely useless. I wanted so badly to fix everything, to turn back time and prevent it all from happening. But I couldn't, and that helplessness was crushing.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's about a 6 again. I feel... drained, but also like some of the pressure has eased a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. How does your body feel?",
    "Client: My muscles are really tense, especially in my shoulders and jaw. But the tightness in my chest has eased up some.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Let's continue.",
    "Client: As time went on, I threw myself into helping him recover, into advocating against human trafficking. It gave me a sense of purpose, but... it also meant I was constantly thinking about what happened. I'd have nightmares too, imagining what he went through. And every time I saw a missing person poster, I'd feel this wave of panic and grief...",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's back up to a 7. Talking about the aftermath... it brings back a lot of those intense feelings.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. How are you managing right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. It's hard, but I know I'm safe here. And talking about it... it's painful, but it also feels like I'm finally facing it head-on instead of trying to push it away.",
    "Therapist: You're doing very well. Let's continue.",
    "Client: Thank you... You know, one of the hardest parts was watching how it affected our whole family. Our parents aged years in just months. Our other siblings didn't know how to act around him. And I felt like I had to be the strong one, to hold everything together. But inside, I was falling apart.
