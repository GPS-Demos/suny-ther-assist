    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's like my body is buzzing, you know? My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel this tightness in my chest. The memories of that cyclone, they just came flooding back so vividly. I could almost hear the wind howling again, feel the panic rising in my throat.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: It's a jumble, really. Part of me is relieved that I made it through the exercise, but another part is angry. Angry that this still affects me so much after all these years. And then there's this... guilt. I survived when others didn't. Why me? It doesn't seem fair.",
    "Therapist: I see. How do these feelings compare to when you first experienced the cyclone?",
    "Client: They're... they're less intense now, I suppose. Back then, it was pure terror. I remember thinking I was going to die, that this was it. Now, it's more like... a shadow of that fear. It's still there, but I can breathe through it. But you know what's weird? When we started talking about police brutality, it brought up similar feelings of helplessness.",
    "Therapist: Can you tell me more about that connection?",
    "Client: Well, during the cyclone, I felt completely at the mercy of nature. No control whatsoever. And when I think about police brutality, even though I haven't experienced it personally, I imagine that same feeling of powerlessness. It's like... you're trapped, and there's this force much stronger than you that could hurt you at any moment.",
    "Therapist: How does recognizing that connection impact you?",
    "Client: It's... it's eye-opening, actually. I never realized how much that feeling of powerlessness has affected me. It makes me wonder if that's why I became self-employed - to have more control over my life. But it also makes me feel... I don't know, more connected to others who've experienced trauma? Like, even if the circumstances are different, that core feeling is something we might share.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing about your body or emotions right now?",
    "Client: I'm starting to feel a bit calmer. The tightness in my chest is easing up. But there's this... heaviness in my limbs. Like I've run a marathon or something. Emotionally, I'm drained, but also... maybe a tiny bit proud? That I faced this memory head-on instead of avoiding it like I usually do.",
    "Therapist: How might this experience influence your daily life moving forward?",
    "Client: That's a good question. I think... I think it might make me more aware of when I'm avoiding things out of fear. Maybe I'll be able to catch myself and say, \"Hey, you faced down a cyclone in therapy. You can handle this.\" And perhaps I'll be more empathetic towards others who've been through trauma. It's easy to judge from the outside, but now I really get how these experiences can stick with you.",
    "Therapist: What support do you need as you process this experience?",
    "Client: I... I think I need some time to just sit with these feelings. Maybe talk to a close friend about it. And... is it okay if we spend a bit more time in our next session unpacking this? I feel like there's more to explore, especially this connection between natural disasters and other forms of trauma.",
    "Therapist: Of course. How are you feeling about ending our session today?",
    "Client: I'm okay. A bit wrung out, to be honest, but in a good way? Like I've done something important. I'm grateful for the space to work through this. It's not easy, but I think it's helping. I just hope I can hold onto this feeling of... I don't know, progress? When I'm back in my day-to-day life.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What will you do to take care of yourself for the rest of the day?",
    "Client: I think I'll go for a long walk by the beach. The sound of the waves usually calms me down. And maybe call my sister - she's always been a good listener. Oh, and I'll make sure to eat something nourishing. These sessions always leave me feeling a bit drained, so I need to refuel.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Remember to be gentle with yourself.",
    "Client: Thanks, I will. It's still hard sometimes, you know? To be kind to myself. But I'm working on it. This session... it's reminded me how far I've come. I couldn't have even talked about the cyclone a year ago without having a panic attack. So yeah, I'll try to acknowledge that progress.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad you recognize that. We'll pick this up next week. Take care.",
    "Client: Thank you. See you next week."
