    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my whole body is tingling. I can feel my heart racing, and there's this tightness in my chest. The memory of being so sick, alone in that hospital room... it's overwhelming. I can almost smell the disinfectant and hear the beeping of the machines.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how scared I was. I remember lying there, wondering if I was going to die, and feeling so... abandoned. My parents were supposed to be there for me, but they weren't. They never came to visit. I was just a kid, and I needed them so badly.",
    "Therapist: How does that feeling of abandonment sit with you now?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a heavy weight on my chest. I feel angry, but also incredibly sad. I wonder what was so important that they couldn't be there for their own child. Was I not worth their time? Did they not care if I lived or died? These thoughts... they're suffocating.",
    "Therapist: I hear the pain in your voice. Can you tell me more about that anger?",
    "Client: The anger... it's like a fire in my stomach. I want to scream at them, ask them how they could be so cruel. But then I remember how young I was, how helpless I felt, and the anger turns into this deep, aching sadness. I feel like that little girl again, alone and terrified in a big, cold hospital room.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice happening in your body as you connect with those emotions?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking, and I feel nauseous. It's like my body is reliving the experience. I can feel the scratchy hospital sheets, the IV in my arm. I'm sweating, but I also feel cold. It's... it's intense. I didn't realize how vivid these memories still were.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How does sharing this experience make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's oddly relieving, in a way. Like I'm finally letting out something I've kept bottled up for so long. But it's also scary. I've spent so much time trying to forget, to pretend it didn't affect me. Now that I'm facing it, it's like opening Pandora's box. I'm afraid of what else might come out.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful metaphor. What do you think might come out?",
    "Client: I'm worried that once I start really dealing with this, I'll realize how much it's affected my life. My relationships, my trust issues... Even my career choices. I became a nurse, you know? Part of me wonders if I did that to give others the care I never received. It's... it's a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. On one hand, I'm proud of the work I do, helping others. But on the other, I feel a bit... resentful? Like, why did I have to go through that to become who I am? And there's this fear... what if I'm not as healed as I thought I was? What if this affects my work, my patients?",
    "Therapist: Those are important questions. How might exploring them help you?",
    "Client: I suppose... it could help me understand myself better. Maybe I could finally address some of the trust issues I have, especially with authority figures. And perhaps... perhaps I could find a way to forgive my parents, or at least come to terms with what happened. It's scary, but I think it might be necessary for me to truly move forward.",
    "Therapist: That's a brave perspective. What's your next step?",
    "Client: I think... I need to keep talking about this. Maybe write about it, too. I've always avoided thinking about that time in the hospital, but now I see how much it's shaped me. I want to understand it better, to process it fully. And maybe... maybe I need to have a conversation with my parents about it. That's terrifying to think about, but I feel like I need answers.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that decision?",
    "Client: It's... it's scary, but also empowering. For the first time, I feel like I'm taking control of this part of my life, instead of letting it control me. There's a part of me that's excited to see what I might discover about myself through this process. But there's also fear... fear of the pain I might uncover, fear of confronting my parents. It's a mix of emotions, really.",
    "Therapist: That mix of emotions is natural. What support do you need?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'll need help preparing for that conversation with my parents. And maybe some techniques to manage the anxiety and fear that comes up when I think about the hospital. I'm also wondering if there are support groups for people who've experienced medical trauma or childhood neglect. It might help to talk to others who understand.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent ideas. Shall we discuss resources?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I feel... I feel like I'm at the beginning of a long journey. It's daunting, but also... hopeful? For the first time in a long time, I feel like I might be able to heal this part of me. It's scary, but I'm ready to face it. I just... I just need to know I have support along the way.",
    "Therapist: You do. Let's talk about building that support system.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I appreciate your guidance through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm finally facing something I've avoided for far too long. I'm nervous about what's to come, but also... excited? Is that strange? To feel excited about dealing with something so painful?",
    "Therapist: Not strange at all. It's a sign of readiness for change.",
    "Client: That's... that's comforting to hear. I guess I am ready for change. I've carried this weight for so long, it's almost become a part of me. But now, I can see the possibility of setting it down, of moving forward without it. It's like... like I'm standing at the edge of something new. It's scary, but also exhilarating.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful image. How does it make you feel?",
    "Client: It makes me feel... alive. Like I'm waking up from a long sleep. There's fear, yes, but also hope and determination. I want to understand myself better, to heal these old wounds. And maybe... maybe even use my experience to help others. I think that's why I became a nurse in the first place. It's like I'm rediscovering my purpose.",
    "Therapist: That's a profound insight. What's your next step?",
    "Client: I think... I think I want to start journaling about my experiences. Get it all out on paper, you know? And maybe look into those support groups we mentioned. I also want to start preparing for that conversation with my parents. It's going to be hard, but I think it's necessary for my healing process. And... I want to continue our sessions, if that's okay. I feel like I'm making real progress here.",
    "Therapist: Of course. I'm here to support you on this journey.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I'm grateful for your help. This session has been intense, but also incredibly enlightening. I feel like I've taken the first step on a long road, but for the first time, I'm not afraid to walk it. It's like... like I'm reclaiming a part of myself I thought I'd lost. It's overwhelming, but in a good way.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How would you like to end today?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to take a moment to just sit with these feelings. To acknowledge how far I've come today, and to think about the path ahead. And maybe... maybe to thank that scared little girl in the hospital. To let her know that she's not alone anymore, that I'm here to take care of her now. Is that... is that okay?",
    "Therapist: That's beautiful. Let's take that moment together.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Thank you. I... I feel different. Lighter, somehow. Like I've set down a burden I didn't even know I was carrying. It's... it's a good feeling. I'm nervous about what's to come, but I'm also excited. For the first time in a long time, I feel... hopeful. Really, truly hopeful.",
    "Therapist: That's a wonderful note to end on. Until next time."
