    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I'm back there, you know? The sounds, the smells... it's all so vivid. I can still hear the shouting, the screams. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What physical sensations are you noticing right now?",
    "Client: My hands are clammy, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's hard to breathe normally. I feel like I'm on edge, like I need to be ready to run at any moment. My legs are tense, almost twitching.",
    "Therapist: I see. And what thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"Why didn't I do something?\" I know logically that I couldn't have, but there's this guilt. I saw those women being herded like cattle, and I just... froze. I feel so ashamed. And then there's this fear that it could happen to me, that I'm not safe either.",
    "Therapist: How does that fear manifest for you?",
    "Client: It's like a constant knot in my stomach. I'm always looking over my shoulder, especially when I'm alone. I've become paranoid about strangers, always assuming the worst. It's exhausting, living like this. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel normal again.",
    "Therapist: What does \"normal\" mean to you in this context?",
    "Client: I guess... feeling safe? Being able to walk down the street without constantly scanning for threats. Trusting people again. Not having these memories intrude on every aspect of my life. It's like the experience has colored everything, and I can't seem to wash it off.",
    "Therapist: How do you see this experience fitting into your broader life story?",
    "Client: That's... that's a tough one. I suppose it's made me more aware of the darker side of humanity. But it's also pushed me to want to make a difference. I've been thinking about volunteering for organizations that help trafficking survivors. It's like... if I can't change what happened, maybe I can help prevent it from happening to others?",
    "Therapist: Mm. What emotions come up when you think about that possibility?",
    "Client: A mix, really. There's hope, definitely. A sense of purpose. But also fear. What if I'm not strong enough? What if it triggers me too much? And then there's this... anger. Anger at the people who do this, at a world where this happens. It's intense, almost overwhelming sometimes.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with these intense emotions?",
    "Client: I try to breathe through it, like we've practiced. Sometimes I write in my journal, just to get it all out. Other times... I'll admit, I isolate myself. It feels safer that way, but I know it's not healthy in the long run. I'm trying to reach out more, to my friends, my family. It's hard, though. I feel like they can't really understand.",
    "Therapist: What would understanding look like to you?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe just acknowledging that this has changed me, and that's okay? Not trying to rush me to \"get over it\" or be who I was before. Supporting me even when I'm not at my best. And maybe... maybe understanding that while this experience is part of me now, it doesn't define me entirely.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... comforting, actually. Like maybe there's a way forward that doesn't involve forgetting or pretending it didn't happen. But also doesn't mean I'll always feel this raw and vulnerable. It's a bit scary, though. Change always is, I guess.",
    "Therapist: What scares you about it?",
    "Client: The unknown, I suppose. Who will I be on the other side of this? Will people still recognize me? Will I recognize myself? And there's this irrational fear that if I let go of the hyper-vigilance, something bad will happen again. It's like... the fear has become a security blanket, as awful as it feels.",
    "Therapist: How might you begin to loosen that security blanket?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe by taking small steps? Like, going for a walk without constantly looking over my shoulder. Or maybe trying to connect with a support group, to see that I'm not alone in this. It's terrifying to think about, but also... there's a small part of me that feels ready. Ready to start reclaiming my life, bit by bit.",
    "Therapist: What does that readiness feel like in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a warmth in my chest. A little spark of something. Hope, maybe? Or determination. My shoulders feel a bit lighter, like I'm not carrying quite so much weight. It's subtle, but it's there.",
    "Therapist: Mm. How would you like to nurture that feeling?",
    "Client: I think... maybe by setting small goals for myself. Things that challenge me a little but don't overwhelm me. And by reminding myself of how far I've come already. It's easy to forget that sometimes, when I'm in the thick of it. But I'm here, I'm talking about it. That's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Indeed. What's coming up for you as we near the end of our session?",
    "Client: A mix of things. There's relief, definitely. These sessions are hard, but I always feel a bit lighter afterwards. There's also... gratitude, I think. For having a space to process all of this. And there's a bit of anxiety about going back out into the world after delving into these memories. But overall, I feel... okay. Not great, but okay. And maybe that's enough for now.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. We'll pick up here next time."
