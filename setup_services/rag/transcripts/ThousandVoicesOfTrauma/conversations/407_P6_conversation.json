    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the incident.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm walking home from the grocery store. It's a warm evening, and I can hear the cicadas chirping. Suddenly, I see a police car pull up beside me. Two officers get out, and they look angry. My heart starts racing.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, about a 4. I'm feeling tense, but it's manageable.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue.",
    "Client: They approach me, demanding to see my ID. I'm confused and scared. I try to explain that I live nearby, but they won't listen. One officer grabs my arm roughly. I can feel my breath getting shallow.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 6. My palms are sweating, and I feel a knot in my stomach.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The officer twists my arm behind my back. It hurts so much. I cry out, begging them to stop. I don't understand why this is happening. My grocery bags fall to the ground, and I watch as my oranges roll across the sidewalk. I feel so helpless, so violated.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. My heart is pounding, and I feel dizzy. It's like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a deep breath. What happens next?",
    "Client: They... they push me against the car. I can feel the cold metal on my cheek. I'm sobbing now, trying to explain that I've done nothing wrong. But they won't listen. They're so rough, so angry. I don't understand why.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's still an 8. My chest feels tight, and I'm shaking.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing great. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: A neighbor comes out and starts yelling at the officers. They seem surprised. Finally, they let me go, but they don't apologize. They just drive away, leaving me there on the sidewalk, surrounded by my spilled groceries. I feel so small, so humiliated.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down to a 6. I feel drained, but the intense fear is fading.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this well.",

    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's a 5 now. I feel sad and angry, but the panic has subsided.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How do you feel now, recalling this memory?",
    "Client: I... I feel stronger than I expected. It still hurts, but I can talk about it without falling apart. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're showing resilience.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to face this memory head-on like this. It's hard, but... I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 3. I feel... I feel like I've reclaimed some control.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today. Let's end here and discuss what you've experienced."
