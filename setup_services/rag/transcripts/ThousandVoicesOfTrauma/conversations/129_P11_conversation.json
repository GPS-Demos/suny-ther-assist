    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken up, to be honest. It's not easy revisiting that memory of the dog attack. My heart's still racing a bit, and I can feel my hands trembling. It's like I was right back there in that moment, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sound... The growling. It was so loud and vicious. I could practically feel the dog's hot breath on my skin again. And the pain... Oh, the pain when its teeth sank into my arm. I remember thinking, \"This is it. This is how I die.\" It's silly, I know, but in that moment, it felt so real.",
    "Therapist: It's not silly at all. How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. Scary, but also... different somehow. I mean, I was still afraid, but I didn't feel as helpless as I did back then. Maybe because I knew I was safe here, with you. It's strange, but I feel like I faced something I've been running from for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant observation. How does this connect to your daily life?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... I've been avoiding dogs ever since. Even small ones. I'd cross the street if I saw someone walking their dog. It's affected my social life too. I stopped visiting my granddaughter because they have a dog. But going through this memory... it's like I'm starting to see it for what it was - a terrible event, yes, but one that's over now.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. What do you think this means for your recovery?",
    "Client: I... I think it means I might be able to start facing my fears bit by bit. Maybe I could look at pictures of dogs without panicking. Or even consider visiting my granddaughter, as long as the dog is in another room. It's a small step, but it feels like a possibility now.",
    "Therapist: Those are great ideas. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's tough, no doubt about it. But... I want to keep going. I want my life back. I'm tired of letting this fear control me. It's not going to be easy, but I think I'm ready to face it head-on.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is commendable. What's one thing you've learned today?",
    "Client: I've learned that... while the memory is still scary, it doesn't have the same power over me it once did. I'm stronger than I thought. And maybe, just maybe, I can learn to live with this experience without letting it define me.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How can you apply this moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I'll try to remind myself of this feeling when I start to panic. That I've faced the worst of it here, and I survived. Maybe I'll even try looking at a picture of a dog this week. Baby steps, right?",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: I... I just want to thank you. This isn't easy, but I feel like I'm finally making progress. For the first time in years, I feel a glimmer of hope. It's like a weight is slowly lifting off my shoulders. I know we have a long way to go, but... I think I'm ready for it now.",
    "Therapist: Your progress is truly remarkable. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. I'm feeling drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've accomplished something important. I'm looking forward to our next session, even if it's challenging. Thank you again for your help and patience.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
