    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is terrified. It's like my stomach is doing somersaults.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 6 or 7 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Just... give me a moment to breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. When you're ready, start describing the hostage situation.",
    "Client: Alright. I'm... I'm standing in line at the bank. It's a Tuesday afternoon, and I'm there to deposit a check from a client. The air conditioning is on full blast, and I remember thinking how cold it was...",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue in the present tense.",
    "Client: Right, sorry. So, I'm in line, and suddenly there's this loud bang. At first, I think someone's dropped something, but then I hear shouting. \"Everyone on the ground! Now!\" There are two men in ski masks, waving guns around. My heart is racing, and I can feel my palms getting sweaty...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe an 8?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I drop to the floor. My cheek is pressed against the cold tile. I can smell cleaning products and feel the grit under my face. One of the men is yelling at the tellers to empty the cash drawers. The other one is pacing, keeping an eye on us. I'm trying not to move, not to breathe too loudly. I'm terrified they'll notice me...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking about my family. What if I never see them again? What if these men decide to start shooting? I can hear someone crying softly nearby, and it's making me want to cry too. But I'm too scared to make a sound.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How's your anxiety level?",
    "Client: It's... it's pretty high. Maybe a 9 now.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. So, I'm still on the floor. My heart is pounding so hard I think everyone must be able to hear it. One of the robbers shouts, \"Hurry up!\" and I flinch. The sound of his voice makes me feel sick. I can hear rustling and the sound of a bag being zipped up. Then... then there's the sound of sirens in the distance.",
    "Therapist: What happens when you hear the sirens?",
    "Client: Everything seems to speed up. The robbers start swearing, and one of them grabs a woman near me. She screams as he yanks her to her feet. \"She's coming with us!\" he yells. \"Anyone tries to follow, she dies!\" I... I feel so helpless. I want to do something, but I'm paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I feel guilty. I should be doing something to help her, but I can't move. I'm just lying there, praying they don't take me too. The woman is sobbing, begging them to let her go. I can hear the fear in her voice, and it mirrors exactly how I'm feeling inside.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's maxed out. A solid 10.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. Remember, you're here in the office with me.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm trying. It just feels so real...",
    "Therapist: I know. You're doing well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Alright. So, they're dragging the woman towards the exit. I can hear the sirens getting closer. One of the robbers is shouting at the other to hurry up. The woman stumbles, and I hear her cry out in pain. I squeeze my eyes shut, wishing it would all just stop...",
    "Therapist: What do you feel in your body right now?",
    "Client: My... my muscles are so tense they're starting to ache. My mouth is dry, and I feel like I can't get enough air. I'm shaking, and I can feel tears running down my face onto the floor.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What happens next?",
    "Client: There's a sudden commotion. I hear glass breaking, and then there's shouting - different voices this time. \"Police! Drop your weapons!\" My eyes snap open, and I see officers flooding into the bank. Everything's chaotic. People are screaming, there's the sound of a scuffle...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Relieved, but still terrified. My body won't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Keep going.",
    "Client: One of the robbers tries to run, but he's tackled by an officer. The other one... he's still holding onto the woman. He's using her as a shield, backing towards a corner. I can see the fear in her eyes, and I feel this surge of... I don't know, anger? Desperation?",
    "Therapist: What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I don't know what comes over me. I see a heavy paperweight on a nearby desk. Without thinking, I grab it and throw it at the robber's legs. It hits him, and he stumbles. In that moment of distraction, the woman breaks free, and the police swarm him.",
    "Therapist: That was brave. How do you feel about that action now?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me is proud that I did something, but another part is terrified thinking about what could have happened if I'd missed, or if he'd seen me...",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7 or 8 now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. What happens after the police subdue the robbers?",
    "Client: It's... it's a blur. The police are everywhere, asking questions, taking statements. Paramedics come in to check on everyone. I'm sitting on a chair, wrapped in a shock blanket. My hands won't stop shaking. Someone hands me a cup of water, but I can barely hold it...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I... I keep replaying everything in my head. Wondering if I could have done more, sooner. Feeling grateful that I'm alive, but guilty that I feel relieved when others might be traumatized. I... I just want to go home, but I'm scared to leave the bank. What if something happens on the way?",
    "Therapist: Those are all common reactions. How's your anxiety now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still there, but it's not as intense. Maybe a 6?",
    "Therapist: Good. You're doing well. What happens as you prepare to leave?",
    "Client: A police officer comes over to talk to me. He tells me I did a good thing, that my actions helped. But I... I don't feel like a hero. I feel exhausted and scared. As I stand up to leave, my legs are wobbly. I take a deep breath and step outside. The sunlight feels too bright, too normal after what just happened...",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to be outside?",
    "Client: It's... surreal. Like the world shouldn't be going on as normal. I can hear traffic, people talking, birds singing. But it all feels distant, like I'm in a bubble. I start walking towards my car, but every sudden noise makes me jump.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around a 5, I think. I'm still on edge, but the immediate danger is over.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm here in the office. I can feel the chair beneath me, see the paintings on the wall. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. But also... I don't know, maybe a little proud? I got through it. Both the actual event and reliving it just now.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You've shown great courage. Let's end here for today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It... it wasn't easy, but I think it helped.",
    "Therapist: You've made significant progress. We'll continue working through this in our next session."
