    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's begin. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that moment.",
    "Client: (Taking a deep breath) Okay... I'm there. It's dark, and I can feel the cold concrete beneath me. The cell is so small, I can barely move. My heart is racing, and I can't stop thinking about what happened before they brought me here.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: It's about a 6. I'm feeling anxious, but it's manageable.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The guard's footsteps are echoing down the hallway. I'm trying to make myself as small as possible in the corner. My hands are shaking, and I feel nauseous. I keep replaying the abuse in my mind, wondering if I could have done something differently.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to an 8. I'm feeling really overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) I can smell his cologne. It's making me feel sick. I want to scream, but I'm afraid of what might happen if I do. My chest feels tight, and I'm having trouble breathing. I feel so helpless and alone.",
    "Therapist: How about your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's a 9 now. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: I know it's difficult. You're very brave. Take a deep breath and continue.",
    "Client: (Breathing deeply) I'm trying to focus on something else, anything else. But all I can think about is his hands on me, his voice in my ear. I feel dirty and ashamed. My body is tense, and I have this overwhelming urge to run, but there's nowhere to go.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: Still a 9. I don't know if I can keep going.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're safe here. Let's stay with it a bit longer.",
    "Client: (Nodding) Okay. I'm trying to remind myself that it's over, but it feels so real. My throat is dry, and I'm sweating. I keep hearing the sound of the cell door closing, trapping me inside. I feel so powerless.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down to an 8. I'm still scared, but I'm starting to feel a little more grounded.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're doing really well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm focusing on my breathing now. In and out. I can feel my heartbeat slowing down a little. The memory is still there, but it's not as overwhelming. I'm reminding myself that I survived, that I'm stronger than I thought.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 7 now. I'm feeling a bit calmer.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. You're making progress. Let's continue for a few more minutes.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm thinking about the day I was finally released. The sunlight on my face, the fresh air. It was like being reborn. I still felt scared and damaged, but there was also a glimmer of hope. I made it through. I survived.",
    "Therapist: What's your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's a 6 now. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little proud of myself for getting through this.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You did incredibly well. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves before we end the session."
