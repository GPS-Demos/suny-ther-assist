    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. Going through that memory of the domestic violence incident... it brought back so many intense emotions. I could almost feel the fear and helplessness all over again.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sound of glass shattering. When he threw that bottle against the wall, I remember thinking he was going to hurt me next. I felt so trapped, you know? Like there was nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. And then I started thinking about my mom, how she always told me to be strong, but in that moment, I felt anything but strong.",
    "Therapist: How does reflecting on it now feel different?",
    "Client: It's... strange. I mean, I'm safe here, but part of me still feels on edge. But there's also this weird sense of... I don't know, maybe control? Like, I can talk about it without completely falling apart. That's new for me.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress, Sarah.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess it is. It's just... hard to reconcile. On one hand, I'm proud of myself for facing this memory. On the other, I'm angry that I ever had to experience it in the first place. And then there's this guilt... like, why couldn't I have been stronger? Why didn't I leave sooner?",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts relate to your recovery goals?",
    "Client: I... I think they show me that I'm still struggling with self-blame. But I also realize that being able to talk about this without turning to substances is a huge step for me. I've been using drugs to numb these memories for so long, and now I'm facing them head-on. It's terrifying, but also... empowering, in a way?",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. What else?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about my mom. Losing her was devastating, and I think that loss made me more vulnerable in my relationships. I was so desperate not to be alone that I ignored red flags. But now, going through this therapy, I'm starting to see that I can be strong on my own, just like she always wanted for me.",
    "Therapist: How might this realization impact your future choices?",
    "Client: I think... I think it'll help me set better boundaries. Not just in romantic relationships, but in all aspects of my life. I'm learning that it's okay to put myself first, to protect myself. And maybe, by doing that, I'm honoring my mom's memory in a way.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful perspective. What's challenging you most right now?",
    "Client: The urge to use is still there, you know? When these memories and emotions come flooding back, part of me still wants to numb it all. But I'm trying to remind myself that facing this pain is part of healing. It's just... it's exhausting sometimes.",
    "Therapist: How are you managing those urges?",
    "Client: I've been using some of the grounding techniques we've practiced. Deep breathing, focusing on my senses. And I've been journaling a lot. It helps to get the thoughts out of my head and onto paper. I'm also trying to reach out to my sponsor more when I'm struggling, instead of isolating myself.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent strategies. What else helps?",
    "Client: Honestly? These sessions. Knowing that I have a safe space to process all of this... it makes a huge difference. And seeing the progress, even if it's small, gives me hope. I never thought I'd be able to talk about the abuse without completely breaking down, but here I am.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable resilience. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: It's scary, but I'm committed. I want to keep pushing forward, you know? I want to get to a place where these memories don't have so much power over me. Where I can think about my mom without feeling overwhelmed by grief and guilt. I want to build a life she'd be proud of.",
    "Therapist: That's a beautiful goal. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I guess. For guiding me through this, for being patient with me. I know I'm not always the easiest client, especially with my substance use history. But I feel like I'm finally starting to see a way forward, and that means everything to me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work, Sarah. I'm here to support you.",
    "Client: I appreciate that more than you know. I'm nervous about what other memories might come up, but I'm trying to trust the process. One day at a time, right?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. We'll take it step by step.",
    "Client: Okay. I can do that. I'm exhausted, but... I think I'm ready for whatever comes next. As long as I don't have to face it alone.",
    "Therapist: You're not alone. Same time next week?",
    "Client: Yeah, I'll be here. Thanks again, doc. This... it means a lot."
