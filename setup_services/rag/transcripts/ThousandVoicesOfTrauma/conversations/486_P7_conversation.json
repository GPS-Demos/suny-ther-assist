    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the hostage situation?",
    "Client: Okay... I was at work, in my office. It was a normal Tuesday afternoon. Suddenly, I heard shouting from the lobby. I thought it was just an argument, but then I heard a gunshot. My heart started racing. I froze, not knowing what to do.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: I... I locked my office door and hid under my desk. I could hear heavy footsteps coming down the hallway. My hands were shaking so much I could barely text my partner to tell them what was happening. I felt so alone and terrified.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe now.",
    "Client: The footsteps stopped outside my door. I held my breath, praying they wouldn't come in. Then I heard a voice shouting, demanding everyone come out or they'd start shooting. I was paralyzed with fear. I couldn't move, couldn't breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I heard more gunshots and screaming. I wanted to help, but I was too scared. I felt like a coward. Then my door burst open. A man with a gun grabbed me and dragged me out. I couldn't even resist. I just... went limp.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. You're safe here.",
    "Client: He pushed me into the lobby with the others. There were two gunmen. They looked desperate, sweating and shouting. One of them kept pacing, waving his gun around. I thought any moment he might just start shooting us all.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How were you feeling at that moment?",
    "Client: Terrified. Helpless. I kept thinking about my family, wondering if I'd ever see them again. The gunmen were arguing about what to do next. Every time they raised their voices, I flinched. I felt like a child again, powerless and afraid.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. Continue.",
    "Client: Hours passed. Some people were crying quietly. I just sat there, numb. When the police finally arrived, there was chaos. More shouting, more gunshots. I thought I was going to die. When it was over, I couldn't stop shaking. I still can't shake that feeling of helplessness.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Drained. Reliving it... it's exhausting. But also... I feel a little lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been holding onto for too long.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. You've done well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to talk about, but I think it's getting easier. I just wish I could forget it all sometimes.",
    "Therapist: Remember, processing is part of healing. We'll continue next session."
