    "Therapist: Alright, let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your current SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: I'm at home, watching the news. There's a report about police brutality at a peaceful protest. It's bringing back memories of the earthquake I experienced last year. I feel my heart racing...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: My palms are sweaty, and I'm starting to feel dizzy. The room seems to be spinning, just like during the earthquake. I can hear sirens in the distance, both on TV and in my memory.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 7. I'm really starting to feel overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The images on TV are blurring with my memories. I see people running, screaming. Buildings shaking, crumbling. I feel so helpless, just like I did during the earthquake. My chest is tight, I can barely breathe...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Current SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. God, this is intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: I'm shaking. I can't stop shaking. The ground feels unsteady beneath me. I want to run, but I'm frozen. The sirens are getting louder. I see flashing lights... red and blue. Police? Ambulances? I don't know anymore...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I smell dust and smoke. My throat feels dry. I'm coughing, struggling to breathe. The walls are closing in. I'm trapped. I can't get out. Oh god, I can't get out!",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I don't know if I can do this anymore.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I hear screams. So many screams. Are they from the TV or my memory? I can't tell anymore. My legs are weak. I'm sliding down the wall, curling into a ball. I feel so small, so helpless. Why can't I do anything? Why can't I help anyone?",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My heart is pounding so hard it hurts. My muscles are tense, aching. I'm trembling all over. I feel nauseous, like I might throw up. My head is spinning, and I can't focus on anything.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Still... still a 9. But it's not getting worse.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're holding steady. What's happening now?",
    "Client: The shaking is starting to subside. The screams are getting quieter. I'm still curled up, but I'm becoming more aware of my surroundings. The TV is still on, but the report has changed. I'm... I'm starting to breathe a little easier.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel?",
    "Client: My muscles are starting to relax a bit. The nausea is fading. I still feel shaky, but it's not as intense. My heart rate is slowing down.",
    "Therapist: Current SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 7 now. I'm feeling a bit calmer.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Keep describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: I'm uncurling from the ball. My limbs feel heavy, tired. I'm looking around the room, reminding myself where I am. The TV is just background noise now. I'm focusing on my breathing, trying to slow it down.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling emotionally?",
    "Client: Drained. Exhausted. But also... I don't know, maybe a little proud? I got through it. It was tough, but I did it.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5. I'm feeling more grounded.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. You've done remarkably well. Let's start wrapping up.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm taking deep breaths. The room feels normal again. My heart rate is almost back to normal. I feel tired, but... okay.",
    "Therapist: Final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: I'd say it's a 3 now. I'm feeling much calmer.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How do you feel about the exercise?",
    "Client: It was intense, but... I feel like I learned something. Like maybe I can handle more than I thought.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. We'll discuss this more next time."
