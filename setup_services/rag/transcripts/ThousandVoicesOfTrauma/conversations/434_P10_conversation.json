    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Johnson. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, Dr. Martin. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is terrified. My hands are a bit shaky.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Yes, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day at work. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in my office. It's late, most people have gone home. The fluorescent lights are buzzing overhead. I can smell the stale coffee from my mug.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: My boss walks in. He... he closes the door behind him. My stomach instantly knots up. I know something's wrong.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 6? My heart's starting to race.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: He's smiling, but it's not friendly. He says, \"Working late again, huh?\" I nod, trying to focus on my computer screen. But he... he comes closer. I can smell his cologne now.",
    "Therapist: You're right there. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Trapped. Scared. I... I want to run, but I'm frozen. Oh God, I can feel his hand on my shoulder.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it.",
    "Client: He's leaning down, whispering in my ear. I can feel his breath. He's saying... saying how pretty I look today. His hand is moving down my arm. I feel sick.",
    "Therapist: What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I try to stand up, but he pushes me back down. He's stronger than me. I'm saying \"No, please stop,\" but my voice is so weak. Why can't I yell?",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. Keep going.",
    "Client: His hands are... they're everywhere. I'm crying now, silently. I can taste the salt of my tears. He's unbuttoning my blouse. I'm shaking my head, pleading with my eyes, but he's not stopping.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... okay. I'm... I'm still there. He's... he's touching me. I feel so dirty, so ashamed. Why didn't I fight harder?",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. You did what you could to survive.",
    "Client: I close my eyes, trying to pretend I'm somewhere else. But I can hear his heavy breathing, feel his weight on me. I'm... I'm disconnecting from my body. It's like I'm floating above, watching this happen to someone else.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What do you see, hear, feel?",
    "Client: I... I see the ceiling tiles. There's a water stain in one corner. I hear the hum of my computer. My skin feels cold where he's... where he's touched me.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: It feels like forever, but finally... finally, he's done. He stands up, straightens his tie like nothing happened. Says, \"See you tomorrow,\" and leaves. Just like that.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Numb. Dirty. I can't move for a long time. When I finally do, my legs are shaky. I grab my purse and run to the bathroom. I'm... I'm throwing up. The tile is cold against my knees.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8?",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe now.",
    "Client: *inhales shakily* I... I clean myself up as best I can. My reflection in the mirror looks... broken. I don't recognize myself. I drive home in a daze, thankful my husband is out of town. I shower for hours, but I still feel dirty.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My chest hurts. But... but I got through it. I told the story.",
    "Therapist: Yes, you did. You're very brave. Let's work on grounding now.",
    "Client: Okay... *deep breath* I can feel the chair beneath me. The air conditioning on my skin. I'm... I'm here, not there.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's coming down. Maybe a 6?",
    "Therapist: That's progress. How are you feeling about sharing this memory?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. But also... I don't know, maybe a little freeing? Like I'm not carrying it alone anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. How do you feel about your workplace now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm still scared. I avoid being alone there. But talking about it... it's helping me face it.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's continue working through this.",
    "Client: Okay. I... I want to be able to feel safe at work again. To not jump every time I hear footsteps.",
    "Therapist: We'll work on that. What else comes to mind about that day?",
    "Client: I remember... I remember the shame. Wondering if I did something to invite this. If I should have seen it coming.",
    "Therapist: Those are common thoughts, but remember, it wasn't your fault.",
    "Client: I know that logically, but emotionally... it's hard. I keep replaying it, wondering what I could have done differently.",
    "Therapist: That's natural. How does it feel to talk about those thoughts?",
    "Client: It's... it's uncomfortable. But also, saying it out loud... it sounds different. Like maybe I'm being too hard on myself?",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. What else?",
    "Client: I... I haven't told my husband. I'm afraid of how he'll react. Will he look at me differently?",
    "Therapist: That's a valid concern. How do you think he might respond?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Part of me thinks he'll be supportive, but another part... I'm scared he'll blame me too.",
    "Therapist: These are important thoughts to explore. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: A bit drained, but... lighter? Like I've put down a heavy backpack I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's a good analogy. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 4, I think. I feel more... present.",
    "Therapist: Excellent progress. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's scary, but... I want to keep going. I want to take my life back.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful goal. We'll work towards it together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I never thought I'd be able to talk about this. But here I am.",
    "Therapist: Yes, you are. And you're doing incredibly well.",
    "Client: I... I have a question. Is it normal to still have nightmares about it?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's very common. We can work on strategies to manage those.",
    "Client: Okay. Sometimes I wake up and I can still... still feel his hands on me. It's so vivid.",
    "Therapist: That's a form of re-experiencing. We'll address that in our sessions.",
    "Client: I hope so. I'm... I'm tired of being afraid all the time.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. Tired, but... maybe a little hopeful?",
    "Therapist: That's great. Hope is powerful. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. This was... intense, but I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: You did excellent work today. Remember to use your coping strategies.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you, Dr. Martin. Same time next week?",
    "Therapist: Yes, I'll see you then. Take care, Mrs. Johnson."
