    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to dive into some heavy stuff today, and I'm not sure I'm ready. But I guess that's why I'm here, right?",
    "Therapist: Your honesty is appreciated. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 6 out of 10. My stomach's in knots.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Can you describe the cyber bullying incident?",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Okay... It started on a Tuesday evening. I was scrolling through my social media feed after a long day at work. I'd just moved into this new shared flat, and I was feeling a bit isolated. Then I saw it \u2013 a post about me from an anonymous account.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue in the present tense.",
    "Client: Right, sorry. I'm sitting at my desk, staring at my phone. The post... it's a photo of me from a work event, but it's been edited. They've made me look... grotesque. The caption says, \"This is what happens when you let a junkie handle your accounts.\"",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",

    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's up to an 8 now.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Ground yourself in the present.",
    "Client: (Inhales deeply) Okay... I'm scrolling through the comments. People from work are laughing. Some are asking who posted it. Others are adding their own cruel jokes. I... I can't believe this is happening.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm thinking, \"How did they find out about my past? Who would do this?\" I feel so exposed, so vulnerable. My heart's racing, and I can't stop sweating.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I close the app, but my phone keeps buzzing with notifications. I'm panicking now. What if my boss sees this? What if I lose my job? I've worked so hard to get clean and build a career.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe now. This is just a memory.",
    "Client: Right, right. (Pauses) I'm pacing around my room now. I want to call someone, but I don't know who to trust. What if everyone's seen it? What if they're all laughing at me behind my back?",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I grab my keys and rush out of the flat. I can't stand being alone with my thoughts. I'm walking down the street, but it feels like everyone's staring at me. Like they all know.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's a solid 9. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. Focus on the present.",
    "Client: (Breathing deeply) Okay... I'm walking faster now. I end up at a park nearby. It's getting dark, and there's a chill in the air. I sit on a bench and just... break down. I'm sobbing, and I can't stop.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: I feel so alone. So... worthless. All the progress I've made feels like it's crumbling around me. I'm thinking about using again, just to numb this pain.",
    "Therapist: Remember your coping strategies. What helped you resist that urge?",
    "Client: I... I pull out my phone and call my sponsor. My hands are shaking so much I can barely dial. When she answers, I just start rambling, crying, trying to explain what happened.",
    "Therapist: How does your sponsor respond?",
    "Client: She's calm. She tells me to breathe, to focus on her voice. She reminds me that I'm strong, that I've overcome so much already. She says we'll get through this together.",
    "Therapist: Good. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: A little calmer. Maybe a 7 on the SUDS scale. But I'm still terrified about what's going to happen next.",
    "Therapist: Keep going. What happens when you return home?",
    "Client: I walk back slowly. My flatmate is in the kitchen when I get in. She looks at me with concern and asks if I'm okay. I burst into tears again and tell her everything.",
    "Therapist: How does she react?",
    "Client: She's... surprisingly supportive. She hugs me and tells me that whoever did this is the one who should be ashamed, not me. She offers to help me report the post and block the account.",
    "Therapist: That sounds comforting. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6. I still feel shaky, but not as alone.",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you do next?",
    "Client: We sit down together and report the post. My flatmate helps me strengthen my privacy settings. I'm still scared, but I feel like I'm taking back some control.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about going to work the next day?",
    "Client: Terrified. I barely sleep that night. When I get to the office, I feel like everyone's watching me. I go straight to my manager's office.",
    "Therapist: What happens in that conversation?",
    "Client: I... I tell her everything. About the post, about my past struggles. I'm shaking the whole time, expecting to be fired on the spot.",
    "Therapist: And how does she respond?",
    "Client: She's... understanding. She assures me that my past doesn't define me, and that the company values my work. She promises to address the issue if anyone brings it up at work.",
    "Therapist: That must have been a relief. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5. I still feel exposed and vulnerable, but also... supported?",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How do the next few days unfold?",
    "Client: It's tough. Some colleagues are awkward around me, but others are surprisingly kind. My sponsor checks in daily. I throw myself into work, trying to prove my worth.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with the ongoing stress?",
    "Client: I start attending more support group meetings. I talk to my therapist more frequently. I even start meditating, which helps with the anxiety.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent self-care. How does the situation evolve over time?",
    "Client: Slowly, things start to calm down. The post gets taken down after a few days. People at work stop whispering. I still have moments of panic, but they become less frequent.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about the incident now?",
    "Client: It still hurts, but... I also feel stronger. I realized I have more support than I thought. And I'm proud that I got through it without relapsing.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant achievement. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: I'd say it's down to a 3. I still feel a twinge of anxiety talking about it, but it doesn't overwhelm me anymore.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable resilience. How has this experience changed you?",
    "Client: I'm more cautious online now, but I'm also more open with people I trust. I've realized that my past doesn't have to be a secret I'm ashamed of. It's part of my journey.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you feel about your ability to handle future challenges?",
    "Client: I feel... stronger. Not invincible, but more confident. I know I have tools and support to face difficult situations.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. As we wrap up, what's your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: I'd say a 2. Talking about it still brings up some emotions, but I feel calm and grounded.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today, Sarah. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Tired, but... good. Like I've faced something I've been avoiding for a long time. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You did all the hard work. We'll end here for today. Well done."
