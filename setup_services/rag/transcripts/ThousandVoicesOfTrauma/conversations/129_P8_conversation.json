    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mr. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel a little shaky. That memory of the dog attack... it's like I was right back there in that moment, you know? I could almost feel the gravel under my feet as I tried to back away, hear the growling... It's strange how vivid it all becomes.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I think. No, not just fear... terror. Even though I know I'm safe here, there's this lingering sense of danger. It's like my body hasn't quite caught up with my mind yet. I keep glancing at the door, half-expecting that dog to burst in. Silly, I know, but... that's what it feels like.",
    "Therapist: That makes sense. What physical sensations are you noticing?",
    "Client: Well, as I mentioned, my heart's still pounding. My palms are sweaty, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's hard to take a deep breath. And my legs... they feel weak, like they might give out if I tried to stand up right now. It's amazing how just thinking about it can make my body react so strongly, even after all these years.",
    "Therapist: How do these sensations compare to when the attack happened?",
    "Client: They're... they're similar, but not as intense. Back then, it was like my whole world narrowed down to just me and that dog. I couldn't think, couldn't breathe. Now, it's like... like an echo of that feeling. I'm aware of where I am, that I'm safe, but my body's still reacting. It's frustrating, you know? To still be affected by this after so long.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"Why me?\" Why did this have to happen to me? I was just out for a walk, minding my own business. And then there's this voice in my head saying, \"You should have been more careful. You should have seen it coming.\" I know that's not fair, but... it's there. And then I think about how this has affected my life, how I still get nervous around dogs, how I avoid certain places. It makes me angry, to be honest. Angry at that dog, at its owner, at myself for still being affected by it.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about sharing this memory today?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. Really hard. But also... I don't know, maybe a little relieving? Like I'm finally letting out something I've been holding in for a long time. I've never really talked about it in this much detail before. It's scary, but also... maybe a bit empowering? Like I'm facing it head-on instead of trying to push it away. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What's different about talking about it now?",
    "Client: Well, for one thing, I feel... safer, I suppose. You're here, guiding me through it, and that helps. And I guess... I'm older now. I've lived with this for so long, and while it still affects me, I can look at it with a bit more distance. It's not just something that happened to me, but something I survived. That's a new thought, actually. I survived it. I'm still here.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of things. There's a sense of pride, I suppose. Strength. But also sadness for the younger me who went through that. And maybe a bit of hope? Like, if I survived that, maybe I can get through this too. Face these memories and come out the other side. It's scary, but... maybe also exciting? I don't know. It's all a bit jumbled up right now.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I think... I think I just need a moment. To breathe, to let all of this settle. Maybe a glass of water? My throat feels dry from all this talking. And... I don't know if this makes sense, but I feel like I need to move. To remind myself that I can, that I'm not frozen in that moment anymore. Is it okay if I stand up and stretch a bit?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take your time.",
    "Client: (After a pause and some movement) Thank you. That helps. I feel a bit more... grounded now. Still shaky, but more present. You know, I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It's hard, really hard, but... I'm doing it. That's something, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: It certainly is. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: I'm... cautiously optimistic, I think. It's not easy, and part of me is scared of what other memories might come up. But another part of me feels... I don't know, ready? Like maybe it's time to face this head-on. I've spent so long trying to avoid thinking about it, and that hasn't really helped. So yeah, it's scary, but I think I want to keep going. If you think it'll help, that is.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Shall we schedule our next session?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do that. And... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It means a lot. I know we have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can get past this. It's a good feeling.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. I'll see you next week, same time?",
    "Client: Yes, that works for me. Thank you again. I'll... I'll try to keep processing this over the week. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Take care, Mr. Johnson.",
    "Client: You too. See you next week."
