    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Carlos?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. Reliving that moment when I found out about my brother's death... it's still so raw, you know? Even though it's been two years since it happened back in Venezuela. I can still feel the shock, the disbelief. It's like I'm right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you this time?",
    "Client: The sounds. I could hear my mother's wailing so clearly. It was... it was unbearable. And the way my hands were shaking when I tried to call other family members. I felt so helpless, so far away from everyone. Being here in the US while my family was going through that... it was torture.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. My heart was racing, and I felt this tightness in my chest. But... but it was different this time. I didn't feel as overwhelmed as I usually do when I think about it. It's like... I could observe it a bit more, if that makes sense?",
    "Therapist: That's a significant observation. Can you tell me more about that?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... I could see the pain, feel it even, but it didn't consume me entirely. I remembered to breathe like we practiced. And I kept reminding myself that I'm here now, that I'm safe. It's still painful, but... maybe a bit more manageable?",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Carlos. How does this relate to your day-to-day experiences?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's helping me deal with the guilt better. You know, the guilt of not being there, of leaving my family behind. I still feel it, but I'm starting to understand that it wasn't my fault. I couldn't have prevented what happened, even if I had been there.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... liberating, in a way. But also sad. It's like I'm letting go of something that's been a part of me for so long. It's scary, but... I think it's good? I don't know. It's confusing.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have mixed feelings. What do you think this means for your recovery?",
    "Client: I guess... it means I'm moving forward? Like, maybe I can start focusing more on building my life here without constantly looking back. Don't get me wrong, I still miss my brother terribly, and I worry about my family. But maybe I can honor his memory by living my life fully, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a beautiful way to look at it. How might you do that?",
    "Client: I've been thinking about that. Maybe I could volunteer with refugee organizations here? Use my experience to help others who are going through similar situations. And... and maybe I can finally accept my classmates' invitations to hang out more. I've been isolating myself a lot.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like great ideas. How do you feel about trying them?",
    "Client: Nervous, but... excited too? It's like I can see a future now that isn't completely shadowed by grief. It's still there, but... it's not all-consuming anymore. Is that... is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Everyone's journey is unique. What matters is how it feels for you.",
    "Client: It feels... right. Like I'm honoring my brother's memory while also allowing myself to live. It's bittersweet, you know? But I think... I think he would want me to be happy, to make the most of the opportunities I have here.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What's your next step?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'll start by reaching out to that refugee organization I heard about. Maybe see if they need any Spanish-speaking volunteers. And... and I'll say yes the next time my classmates invite me out. Baby steps, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How do you feel about our session today?",
    "Client: Grateful, I guess. It's still hard, going through these memories. But I feel like I'm gaining something from it now. Like each time, I understand myself a little better. It's tough, but... I think it's worth it.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing, Carlos. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: No, I think... I think that's all for now. Thank you for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't judge. I'm looking forward to our next session, even though I know it'll be challenging.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Carlos. I'll see you next week."
