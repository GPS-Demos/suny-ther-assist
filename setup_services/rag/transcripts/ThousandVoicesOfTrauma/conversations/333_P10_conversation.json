    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. We're diving into some heavy stuff today, and part of me wants to just run out that door. But I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Let's do this before I change my mind.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see the cramped room. It's dark, musty. There's a small window, but it's covered with a heavy curtain. I can hear muffled voices outside. My heart is racing already.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Uh, about a 6, I'd say.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: The door creaks open. A man enters \u2013 he's tall, imposing. I can smell alcohol on his breath. He's... he's pulling someone behind him. A girl. She can't be more than 14 or 15. God, she looks terrified.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... helpless. Angry. Scared for her. My stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Right, breathing. Okay. The man, he... he shoves the girl towards me. Says, \"Show her the ropes, kid.\" His voice is gruff, threatening. I want to help her, but I'm frozen. I can't move.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to an 8.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. Let's take a moment. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay. I'm here. I'm safe. *pause* The girl is crying silently. Her eyes meet mine, and I see... I see myself in them. The same fear, the same desperation. I want to tell her it'll be okay, but I know it's a lie.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I step forward. My legs feel like lead. I whisper to her, \"I'm sorry.\" It's all I can manage. The man laughs, a harsh sound that makes me flinch. He leaves, slamming the door behind him.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: Tense. My shoulders are hunched, like I'm trying to make myself smaller. My hands are shaking. I feel nauseous.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What happens next?",
    "Client: The girl collapses on the dirty mattress in the corner. She's sobbing now, no longer silent. I... I sit next to her, careful not to touch her. I don't know what to say. I feel so... so damn useless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's still at an 8. Maybe even a 9 now.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here in the present.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Yeah, okay. I'm here. *exhales* In the room, I can hear footsteps outside. Heavy boots. My heart starts pounding even harder. I know what's coming next, and I can't stop it.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... I'm thinking I need to protect her somehow. But I also know that if I try, it'll only be worse for both of us. I feel like a coward. I should do something, anything.",
    "Therapist: How does that conflict feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like... like I'm being torn apart. My chest is tight, it's hard to breathe. My muscles are so tense they're aching.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. Keep going.",
    "Client: The door opens again. It's a different man this time. He looks at the girl with... with this horrible hunger in his eyes. I want to scream, to fight, but I can't move. I can't even look at her. I turn away, squeezing my eyes shut.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 10. I can't... I can't do this.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, John. You're safe here. Let's ground ourselves.",
    "Client: *breathing heavily* Okay, okay. I'm... I'm here. In the office. It's not real.",
    "Therapist: Good. Can you name five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: Um, your desk. The bookshelf. The plant in the corner. The clock on the wall. My hands.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: A little better. Maybe... maybe down to an 8?",
    "Therapist: That's good. When you're ready, let's continue.",
    "Client: Alright. *deep breath* I'm back in that room. The man is... he's grabbing the girl. She's screaming now, begging. I can't bear it. I stand up, finally finding my voice. \"Stop!\" I shout. The man turns to me, his face twisted with anger.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to stand up to him?",
    "Client: Terrifying. Exhilarating. Like I might throw up. But also... proud? For the first time, I feel like I'm doing something right.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: He lets go of the girl and comes at me instead. I brace myself for the blow I know is coming. It hurts, God, it hurts. But the girl... she's scrambling away, towards the door. Part of me hopes she'll make it out.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible bravery. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually down to a 7 now. Remembering that moment... it's painful, but it's also the first time I felt like I had any power.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant shift. How does your body feel now?",
    "Client: Still tense, but... different. Like the tension is readying me for action rather than paralyzing me.",
    "Therapist: Good observation. What happens after the man hits you?",
    "Client: I fall to the ground. My vision is blurry, but I can see the girl. She's at the door, her hand on the knob. She looks back at me, and there's this moment... this moment of connection. I nod at her, trying to tell her to go. And she does. She runs.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Relieved. Hopeful. Even as the man is kicking me, yelling, I feel... I feel like I've done something good. For once.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually down to a 5. Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a sign of progress. Let's stay with this moment a bit longer.",
    "Client: Okay. The man is still... still hurting me. But I'm focused on the open door. I can hear shouting in the hallway. Maybe... maybe she'll make it out. Maybe someone will find us. For the first time in so long, I feel a glimmer of hope.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant shift in perspective. How does hope feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a warmth in my chest. Despite the pain, despite the fear, there's this tiny spark of warmth. It's unfamiliar, but... good.",
    "Therapist: Hold onto that feeling. We're going to start bringing you back to the present now. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Okay. I'm... I'm back. In your office.",
    "Therapist: Well done, John. That was incredibly brave. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Drained. Shaky. But also... I don't know. Like I've let go of something heavy.",
    "Therapist: That's normal after an intense session like this. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 3, I think. I'm surprised.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's take a few moments to debrief and discuss some coping strategies for the rest of your day.",
    "Client: Yeah, that sounds good. I... I never thought I'd be able to talk about this. But I did it. I actually did it.",
    "Therapist: Yes, you did. And that's a huge step forward. Let's end our session by focusing on your strength and resilience..."
