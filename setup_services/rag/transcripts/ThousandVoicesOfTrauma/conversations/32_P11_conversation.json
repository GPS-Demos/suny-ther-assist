    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, John?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. Going back to those cult experiences, especially the sexual abuse... it's overwhelming. I can still hear the chanting, you know? And the smell of incense... it's like I was right back there.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The powerlessness. I felt so small, so trapped. I remember thinking, \"Why can't I just run away?\" But I couldn't. They had this... this hold over me. It's like I was paralyzed. And the shame... God, the shame is suffocating.",
    "Therapist: How does that shame feel in your body right now?",
    "Client: It's like a heavy weight on my chest. Makes it hard to breathe. And my stomach's in knots. I just want to curl up and disappear sometimes.",
    "Therapist: That's a strong reaction. How does it compare to before we started PE?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a bit less intense now. Before, I couldn't even think about it without having a panic attack. Now, it's still awful, but... I can talk about it. That's progress, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What do you make of that change?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe I'm starting to see that it wasn't my fault? That I was a victim, not... not someone who chose that. It's hard to believe, but... I'm trying.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How might that affect your daily life?",
    "Client: Well, maybe I could stop avoiding places that remind me of the cult. Like, there's this park where they used to have gatherings. I haven't been there in years. Maybe I could try visiting?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a brave step. How do you feel about trying that?",
    "Client: Scared, honestly. But also... kind of excited? Like I'm taking my life back, bit by bit. It's empowering, in a way.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What else have you noticed changing?",
    "Client: I've been sleeping a bit better. The nightmares are less frequent. And I actually laughed with my daughter yesterday. It felt... normal. I'd forgotten what that felt like.",
    "Therapist: Those are significant improvements. How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Hopeful, I think. For the first time in years, I feel like maybe I can have a life after all this. Like maybe I'm not broken beyond repair.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's helping you feel that way?",
    "Client: This therapy, for one. Facing these memories head-on... it's terrifying, but it's like lancing a wound. And my family's support. They've been so patient. I'm starting to believe them when they say they love me, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful. How can you build on this progress?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I could start journaling? Get these thoughts out of my head. And perhaps join that support group you mentioned. I've been afraid to, but... maybe it's time.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like excellent ideas. How do you feel about continuing our work?",
    "Client: It's hard, really hard. But I'm seeing results, and that gives me strength. I want to keep going. I want my life back.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. What would you like to focus on next session?",
    "Client: Could we... could we maybe work on the guilt? I still feel so responsible for not leaving sooner, for not protecting others. I know it's not rational, but...",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll address that next time. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, but... lighter? Like I've set down a heavy load, even if just for a moment. Thank you for... for helping me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work. I'm just here to guide you. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yeah, see you next week. Thanks again."
