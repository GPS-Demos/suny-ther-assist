    "Therapist: Hello, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Oh, hello Dr. Johnson. I'm... I'm okay, I suppose. A bit nervous about what we might be doing today. I've been thinking a lot about our last session, and I'm not sure I'm ready for whatever comes next.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... you mentioned last time that we'd be doing something called imaginal exposure. It sounds frightening, to be honest. The idea of reliving those moments... I've spent years trying to forget them. The thought of purposely bringing them back up makes my stomach churn.",
    "Therapist: That's a natural reaction. Let's discuss the purpose behind this exercise.",
    "Client: Alright, I'm listening. But I have to admit, I'm still quite apprehensive. You know, at my age, I thought I'd be past all this. Retired, enjoying life... not dealing with ghosts from the past. It's embarrassing, really.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. This exercise aims to help, not harm. Shall I explain more?",
    "Client: Yes, please do. I need to understand why we're doing this. It's hard enough to talk about the neglect and violence I experienced, let alone relive it. I've never told anyone the full extent of what happened in my marriage. It's not something you discuss over tea with the neighbors, you know?",
    "Therapist: Imaginal exposure helps process traumatic memories. It can reduce PTSD symptoms over time.",
    "Client: I see. But how exactly does bringing up these painful memories help? Won't it just make everything worse? I've been having nightmares again, and I'm worried this might intensify them.",
    "Therapist: It may be difficult initially, but it often leads to decreased symptoms. We'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: My pace? That's reassuring, I suppose. But what if I can't handle it? What if I break down or panic? I'm not as young as I used to be, and my nerves aren't what they were.",
    "Therapist: I'll be here to support you throughout. We can pause or stop anytime you need.",
    "Client: That's... that's good to know. I appreciate that, Dr. Johnson. I guess I'm just scared of what might come up. There's so much I've tried to bury over the years. The constant belittling, the threats, the isolation... it's like opening Pandora's box.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. This process can be empowering. How are you feeling about trying?",
    "Client: I'm still nervous, but... I think I'm willing to give it a try. If you really think it will help, I'll do my best. I just hope I'm strong enough for this. It's not easy being vulnerable at my age, especially when you've spent a lifetime building walls.",
    "Therapist: You are strong. We'll take it step by step. Any other questions or concerns?",
    "Client: I suppose my main worry is... what happens after? Once we've opened up these old wounds, how do we close them again? I've managed to build a life for myself since the divorce, and I'm afraid of losing the peace I've found.",
    "Therapist: That's a valid concern. We'll work on coping strategies and integration throughout the process.",
    "Client: Alright, I think I understand a bit better now. It's still scary, but I'm willing to try. You'll be with me the whole time, right? And we can stop if it gets too overwhelming?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Your well-being is the priority. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. As ready as I'll ever be, anyway. Let's do this before I lose my nerve. Just... please be patient with me if I struggle. This isn't easy for me.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Your bravery is commendable. Let's start slowly..."
