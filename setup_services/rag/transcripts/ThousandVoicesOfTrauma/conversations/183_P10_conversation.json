    "Therapist: Welcome, Fatima. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. We've talked about this before, but actually diving into these memories... it's daunting.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see the bars. Cold, metal bars. The cell is small, maybe 8 by 10 feet. The walls are this sickly yellowish-gray color. There's a small window, but it's so high up I can't see out of it. Just a sliver of light...",
    "Therapist: Good. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The smell. It's... it's overwhelming. Sweat, urine, and something else I can't quite place. Disinfectant, maybe? My stomach is churning just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 60? It's uncomfortable, but I can handle it.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear footsteps. Heavy boots on concrete. My heart starts racing. I... I know what's coming. Oh god, I can feel my hands shaking...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What do you see?",
    "Client: The door opens. It's him. The guard. He's... he's smiling, but it's not a kind smile. It's... predatory. I feel so small, so helpless. I want to disappear into the wall.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Fatima. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's higher. Maybe 75? My palms are sweating.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Remember, you're here in the room with me. You're safe. Can you describe what the guard does?",
    "Client: He... he comes closer. I can smell his breath - cigarettes and coffee. He reaches out and... and touches my face. I flinch, but there's nowhere to go. I'm frozen. I can't breathe...",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe with me. In... and out.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... okay. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: He... he says something. \"You're a pretty one, aren't you?\" His voice is gruff, almost a growl. I want to scream, but no sound comes out. I'm just... paralyzed.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave, Fatima. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My heart is pounding. It feels so real...",
    "Therapist: Remember, it's a memory. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he grabs my arm. Hard. It hurts. I can feel his fingernails digging into my skin. I try to pull away, but he's so strong. I... I can hear other prisoners in the background. Some are crying, others are yelling. But no one comes to help.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're doing well.",
    "Client: He drags me out of the cell. The hallway is long and dark. Other guards are there, laughing. I... I feel so exposed, so vulnerable. My legs are shaking so badly I can barely walk.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. 85, maybe 90. I feel like I can't breathe...",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Focus on my voice. You're here, in this room. You're safe.",
    "Client: *deep, shaky breath* Okay... okay. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. Can you continue?",
    "Client: Yes... They take me to a room. It's bright, too bright after the darkness of the cell. There's a table... and tools. I don't want to look at them, but I can't help it. My whole body is trembling...",
    "Therapist: You're very courageous, Fatima. Remember, this is just a memory.",
    "Client: I... I know. But it feels so real. I can smell the fear in the room. My own, and... and others. There are stains on the floor. Old stains. I know what they are, and I... I think I'm going to be sick...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Ground yourself. What do you feel beneath your feet?",
    "Client: The... the carpet. It's soft. Not like the cold concrete floor in that room.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, can you continue?",
    "Client: They... they push me onto the table. It's cold. Metal. I can hear them talking, laughing. Someone says, \"Let's see how loud she can scream.\" I... I close my eyes. I'm trying to be somewhere else, anywhere else...",
    "Therapist: You're doing very well. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. 95. I feel like I'm there again...",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here with me. You're safe. Can you tell me three things you see in this room?",
    "Client: I... I see the plant by the window. The blue painting on the wall. Your... your glasses.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, can you continue with the memory?",
    "Client: Yes... I... I feel a hand on my arm. They're tying me down. The straps are tight, cutting into my skin. I try to struggle, but it's useless. I hear the sound of something metallic being picked up...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I... I can't. I can't do this. It's too much. I feel like I'm going to pass out...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Fatima. You're safe here. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: *deep, shaky breaths* Okay... okay. I'm... I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. Can you tell me what you're feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. My heart is racing. I feel sick to my stomach. But... but I'm also angry. So angry that this happened to me.",
    "Therapist: That anger is valid. It's okay to feel it. Are you ready to continue?",
    "Client: I... I think so. Yes.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Take us back to that room.",
    "Client: The... the guard with the tool. He comes closer. I can see his face clearly now. He's... he's enjoying this. I close my eyes tight, but I can still feel his presence. The anticipation is almost worse than... than what comes next.",
    "Therapist: What happens next, Fatima?",
    "Client: I... I feel the first cut. It's sharp, burning. I scream, I can't help it. They laugh. Someone says, \"Music to my ears.\" I... I want to die. I'm praying for it to be over...",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My hands are clenched so tight. But... but I'm here. I'm getting through it.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You're here, and you're safe. Can you continue?",
    "Client: Yes... The pain... it's intense. Wave after wave. I lose track of time. It could be minutes or hours. I... I retreat into my mind. I think of my mother, of home. Anything to escape this hell...",
    "Therapist: You're doing very well. What happens next?",
    "Client: Eventually... eventually, it stops. They untie me. I can barely move. Every part of me hurts. They drag me back to my cell. I... I collapse on the floor. I'm crying, but no sound comes out. I feel... broken.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. But... but also relieved. Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after processing trauma. You've done incredibly well, Fatima.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I never thought I could talk about this. It's always been this... this dark secret.",
    "Therapist: You've shown immense courage today. How do you feel about what we've accomplished?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, somehow. It's still painful, but it's like... like the memory doesn't have the same power over me anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: I am. I really am. It's... it's overwhelming, but in a different way now.",
    "Therapist: That's great to hear. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay. I... I think I need that.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's start with some deep breathing..."
