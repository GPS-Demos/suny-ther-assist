    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in our old apartment. It's evening, and I can hear Maria in the kitchen. The TV is on, but I'm not really watching it. I'm... I'm nervous because I know she's upset about something.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: I hear her slamming cabinet doors. My heart starts racing. I want to get up and leave, but I'm frozen in place. She storms into the living room, her face twisted with anger. I can smell the alcohol on her breath.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: She starts yelling at me. Calling me useless, a burden. Says I can't do anything right. I try to speak, but my voice comes out weak. She gets closer, her finger jabbing at my chest. I feel so small, so powerless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I don't want to remember this part. It's too much.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) She grabs my arm, her nails digging into my skin. I can still feel the sting. She's screaming in my face now, telling me I'm worthless, that no one would ever want me. I believe her. In that moment, I truly believe every word.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I start to cry, which only makes her angrier. She mocks my tears, calls me pathetic. I want to disappear, to sink into the floor. The verbal assault goes on for what feels like hours. When she finally stops, she just walks away, leaving me there, broken and alone.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. Sad. But also a little stronger, like I survived it again, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You did survive.",
    "Client: Yeah, I did. It's still painful to remember, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming as before.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. How would you like to proceed?",
    "Client: Can we take a short break? I need a moment to collect myself.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's pause here."
