    "Therapist: Welcome, Amira. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is terrified of reliving everything. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day at the hospital. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in the emergency room. The lights are so bright, and there's this constant beeping from machines. I can smell antiseptic, and it's making me nauseous. My heart is racing, and I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's happening around you?",
    "Client: Doctors and nurses are rushing past. I'm lying on a gurney, and my chest feels like it's on fire. Someone's shouting about my blood pressure dropping. I... I think I'm having a heart attack.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm terrified. I keep thinking, \"This is it. I'm going to die.\" My arms are tingling, and I can't feel my legs. Oh god, I can't breathe!",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Amira. You're safe here. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe even a 9.",
    "Therapist: That's high, but you're handling it. What happens next?",
    "Client: They're cutting off my clothes. I feel so exposed, so vulnerable. A nurse is trying to put an IV in, but my veins keep collapsing. It hurts, and I'm crying. I want my husband, but he's not here. I'm all alone.",
    "Therapist: You're not alone now. I'm here with you. Keep going.",
    "Client: They're attaching electrodes to my chest. The doctor is saying something about an irregular heartbeat. I'm trying to focus, but everything's fuzzy. I think... I think I'm passing out.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What do you experience as you lose consciousness?",
    "Client: It's like I'm floating. The voices around me are getting distant. I'm scared, but also... relieved? The pain is fading. But then there's this jolt, like electricity through my body.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking. I can feel my heart pounding, just like it was then.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're safe here in my office.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... okay. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens after the jolt?",
    "Client: I'm gasping for air. Everything comes rushing back \u2013 the pain, the fear. They're shouting that they've got me back. I didn't even realize I'd... that I'd died for a moment.",
    "Therapist: That must have been terrifying. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about my daughter. She's only 12. What if I never see her again? What if I die here, surrounded by strangers? I'm not ready. I have so much left to do.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Amira. Stay with those thoughts.",
    "Client: There's a moment of calm. They've given me something for the pain. I can breathe a little easier, but I'm still scared. A nurse holds my hand and tells me I'm going to be okay. I want to believe her, but...",
    "Therapist: But what?",
    "Client: But I don't. I've never felt so out of control, so helpless. It's like my body has betrayed me. I've always been healthy, you know? And now... now I could die at any moment.",
    "Therapist: That loss of control is frightening. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe a 7?",
    "Therapist: You're managing well. Let's continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: They're moving me to the ICU. The ceiling lights flash by as they wheel me down the hallway. I'm trying to stay awake, but I'm so tired. Every breath hurts.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What do you notice?",
    "Client: The ICU is quieter, but there's still a constant hum of machines. I'm hooked up to so many monitors. A doctor comes in and starts explaining what happened, but I can barely focus. Something about a blocked artery, emergency stents...",
    "Therapist: How does hearing that make you feel?",
    "Client: Overwhelmed. Confused. I keep thinking, \"This can't be happening to me.\" I'm only 50. I eat well, I exercise. It doesn't make sense.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. What else are you experiencing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm angry. At my body, at the universe. Why me? And then I feel guilty for being angry when I should just be grateful to be alive.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid emotions. How does your body feel as you remember this?",
    "Client: Tense. My jaw is clenched, and my shoulders are up to my ears. I can feel this knot in my stomach, like a ball of anxiety.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to release that tension. Breathe deeply.",
    "Client: *exhales slowly* That helps a little.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens as you spend more time in the ICU?",
    "Client: The days blur together. I'm in and out of consciousness. When I'm awake, I'm hyper-aware of every twinge, every irregular heartbeat. I keep asking the nurses if I'm okay, if I'm going to have another heart attack.",
    "Therapist: How do they respond?",
    "Client: They're patient, kind. But I can see the pity in their eyes. It makes me feel weak, like a burden. I hate feeling this way.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to need help sometimes. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe a 5 or 6?",
    "Therapist: That's progress. Let's continue. Tell me about when your family visits.",
    "Client: My husband comes first. He looks so worried, and I feel guilty for putting him through this. When my daughter visits, I try to put on a brave face, but she sees right through it. She hugs me, and I just break down.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like an emotional moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Love, fear, guilt... all mixed together. I'm terrified of leaving them, of not seeing my daughter grow up. But I'm also so grateful to have them.",
    "Therapist: Those are powerful emotions. How does your body react?",
    "Client: I'm crying now, just like I did then. My chest feels tight, but it's different from the heart attack. It's... it's emotion, not pain.",
    "Therapist: That's an important distinction. What happens as you start to recover?",
    "Client: The doctors start talking about rehabilitation, lifestyle changes. It's overwhelming. I'm afraid to leave the hospital. What if it happens again when I'm home alone?",
    "Therapist: That's a common fear. How do you cope with it?",
    "Client: I ask a million questions. I want to know every detail, every risk. But the more I know, the more anxious I get. It's like I can't win.",
    "Therapist: Knowledge can be both empowering and frightening. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually down to a 4, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How do you feel as you prepare to leave the hospital?",
    "Client: Nervous, but also eager to get home. The hospital feels safe, but I know I can't stay forever. I'm scared of the unknown, of what my life will be like now.",
    "Therapist: Those are normal feelings. What do you do to prepare?",
    "Client: I make lists. Medications, emergency contacts, warning signs to watch for. I practice deep breathing exercises they taught me. But mostly, I just try to focus on getting stronger each day.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive approach. How do you feel now, thinking back on all of this?",
    "Client: It's... it's still scary. But I also feel proud, in a way. I survived something terrifying. I'm stronger than I thought.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Let's start wrapping up. Take a few deep breaths.",
    "Client: *breathes deeply* Okay. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today, Amira. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Drained, but... lighter, somehow. Like I've let go of something I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's often how people feel after these sessions. What's your final SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to a 3 now. I didn't think that was possible when we started.",
    "Therapist: That's fantastic progress. You should be proud of yourself. Let's take a few more moments to ground ourselves before we end.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think this is helping. It's hard, but I feel like I'm starting to process what happened.",
    "Therapist: That's the goal. You're doing great work, Amira. We'll pick up here next session."
