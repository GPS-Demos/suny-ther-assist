    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Abboud?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's not easy revisiting those memories. The way those officers treated me, it just brings back so much anger and fear. I can still hear their voices, you know? The way they shouted at me, as if I was some kind of criminal. I've lived in this country for over 40 years, built a life here, and in that moment, I felt like I didn't belong.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really challenging. What stood out to you most about the experience today?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. I keep replaying the moment when they pushed me against the wall. I'm not a young man anymore, and I felt so vulnerable. I couldn't defend myself, couldn't explain. It's like... like my dignity was stripped away in an instant. And the worst part is, I saw the fear in my wife's eyes. She was terrified, and I couldn't protect her. That's what hurts the most, you know?",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to share that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... difficult. My heart was racing, and I felt that same tightness in my chest that I felt that day. But there's also a part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I'm not carrying this burden alone anymore. It's strange, but talking about it, as painful as it is, makes it feel a little less overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant observation. How does this connect to your everyday life?",
    "Client: Well, I've noticed that I'm always on edge now, especially around police. I used to enjoy taking walks in the park, but now I'm constantly looking over my shoulder. And loud noises... they startle me more than they used to. It's affecting my relationship with my wife too. She wants to go out more, but I find myself making excuses to stay home where I feel safe.",
    "Therapist: I see. What have you learned about yourself through this process?",
    "Client: I've realized that I'm stronger than I thought. Despite everything, I'm here, talking about it, trying to heal. And I've learned that it's okay to feel vulnerable sometimes. It doesn't make me less of a man or less worthy of respect. I'm also starting to understand that not all authority figures are the same. It's a slow process, but I'm trying to not let this incident define all my future interactions.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How can we use this moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to start reclaiming my life bit by bit. Maybe I can start with short walks again, perhaps with my wife. And I've been thinking about joining a community group for seniors. It might help me feel more connected and less isolated. I know it won't be easy, but I'm tired of letting fear control my life.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like great steps. How are you feeling about continuing this work?",
    "Client: I'm nervous, but also... hopeful? For the first time in a while, I feel like there might be a way through this. It's not going to be easy, and I know we have more difficult sessions ahead, but I'm willing to keep trying. I want to be the husband and grandfather I used to be, you know? I want to feel like myself again.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is commendable. What else would you like to discuss today?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to talk about strategies for managing my anxiety when I'm out in public. Sometimes it gets so overwhelming that I just want to rush back home. And maybe we could discuss how I can better communicate with my wife about what I'm going through? She's been so patient, but I know it's hard for her too. I want her to understand, but I don't want to burden her with all of this.",
    "Therapist: Those are important topics. Let's start with the anxiety management. What's worked for you so far?",
    "Client: Well, I've been trying that breathing exercise you taught me. It helps sometimes, especially when I feel the panic starting to build. And I've started carrying a small worry stone in my pocket. Feeling it there reminds me that I'm safe in the present moment. But sometimes, it's just not enough, you know? Especially if I see a police car or hear sirens.",
    "Therapist: I see. Have you considered any other coping strategies?",
    "Client: I've thought about maybe listening to calming music when I'm out, using earphones. And my grandson showed me this mindfulness app on my phone. I haven't really used it much, but maybe it could help? I'm open to suggestions. I just... I just want to feel normal again, to be able to enjoy life without this constant fear hanging over me.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent ideas. Shall we explore them further next session?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be helpful. And maybe we could also talk about how to handle flashbacks? I had a pretty bad one last week at the grocery store. It was so embarrassing... I don't want to put myself or others in that situation again. But I also don't want to stop living my life, you know? There has to be a balance somewhere, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll address that next time. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... tired, but in a good way? Like I've done something important today. It's still hard to talk about all of this, but I'm starting to see that it might actually be helping. Thank you for listening, for not judging. It means more than you know."
