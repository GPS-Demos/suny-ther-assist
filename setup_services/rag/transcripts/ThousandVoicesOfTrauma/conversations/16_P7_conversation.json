    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Can you describe the scene of the police brutality incident?",
    "Client: Okay... I was at the hospital for a routine checkup when I heard commotion in the hallway. I stepped out and saw two police officers roughly handling a young man. He was crying out in pain, and they were twisting his arm behind his back. I felt my heart racing...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you saw and felt.",
    "Client: The young man was begging them to stop, saying he couldn't breathe. I wanted to intervene, but I froze. The officers slammed him against the wall, and I heard a sickening crack. My stomach churned, and I felt dizzy. It was like I was reliving my own medical trauma all over again...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I can't... It's too much. I feel like I'm back there, helpless and scared. My hands are shaking, and I can hear the man's cries echoing in my head. I should have done something, but I just stood there...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) The nurses were trying to calm the situation, but the officers weren't listening. I saw blood on the floor, and it triggered memories of my own hospitalization. I felt trapped, like I couldn't escape. The walls seemed to be closing in...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I started to hyperventilate. My vision blurred, and I felt like I was going to pass out. A nurse noticed me and guided me to a chair. But even as I sat there, I couldn't stop watching. The young man was now on the ground, not moving. I was terrified he was dead...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How did your body feel in that moment?",
    "Client: My whole body was tense. My chest felt tight, and I could barely breathe. My hands were clammy, and I felt a cold sweat break out all over. I wanted to run, but my legs wouldn't move. It was like I was paralyzed with fear...",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. You're safe now. Continue.",
    "Client: Eventually, more hospital staff arrived, and they managed to separate the officers from the young man. He was alive but badly hurt. I couldn't stop shaking. Even after it was over, I felt like I was in danger. For weeks after, I had nightmares about it, mixing with memories of my own hospital trauma...",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. How do you feel now, recalling this?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. My heart is racing again, and I feel a knot in my stomach. But it's not as overwhelming as before. I still feel guilty for not doing anything, but I understand I was frozen with fear. It's like I'm watching it happen from a distance now...",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. You're processing it well.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still painful to think about, but I feel like I can breathe a little easier now. I'm starting to understand that it wasn't my fault, and that my reaction was normal given my past experiences. It's a relief to be able to talk about it without completely falling apart...",
    "Therapist: You've made remarkable progress. How do you feel about ending here today?",
    "Client: I think that would be good. I feel drained, but also a bit lighter. It's like I've released some of the weight I've been carrying. I'm grateful for your support through this...",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. We'll continue next session."
