    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart is still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. Going through that memory of the workplace accident was more intense than I expected.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sounds, definitely. The screeching of metal and people shouting... it was so vivid. I could almost smell the burning too. It's like I was right back there in that moment, you know? I keep thinking about how helpless I felt, just frozen in place while everything was chaos around me.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to have gone through that memory today?",
    "Client: It's... it's tough. I'm exhausted, honestly. But there's also this weird sense of... I don't know, maybe relief? Like, I've been avoiding thinking about it for so long, and now that I've faced it, it's still terrible, but it's not as overwhelming as I feared it would be. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Many find relief in facing their fears.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess so. It's just... I've been having nightmares about it, and I've been so jumpy at work. Every loud noise makes me panic. But going through it step by step like this, it's helping me see it more clearly. I realize now that I did what I could in that situation. I couldn't have prevented it, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. How does it relate to your recovery goals?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's helping me feel less guilty. I've been blaming myself for not doing more, but now I can see that I was just in shock, like anyone would be. And maybe if I can accept that, I can start to feel safer at work again. That's one of my main goals - to not feel constantly on edge.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent insight. What else have you noticed?",
    "Client: Well, I've realized that talking about it doesn't make it happen again. That's been a big fear of mine. And... I don't know, maybe this sounds weird, but I feel a bit stronger after facing it. Like, if I can talk about the worst day of my life and survive, maybe I can handle other difficult things too.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful perspective. How might you apply this moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I think I might try to be more open with my friends about what happened. I've been isolating myself because I didn't want to burden them or have to explain. But maybe talking about it more will help me process it better. And at work, instead of avoiding certain areas or tasks, I could try to face them gradually, knowing that I can handle the memories if they come up.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a solid plan. Any concerns about it?",
    "Client: Um, yeah... I'm worried that I might have a panic attack or freeze up if I try to do some of these things. And I'm scared that people might not understand or they'll treat me differently if I open up about it. But I guess that's part of the process, right? Facing those fears?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. How can you prepare for those challenges?",
    "Client: I could... maybe practice some of the breathing exercises we've gone over before I try anything new. And I could start by talking to just one close friend, someone I really trust. As for work, I could ask my supervisor if I could have a buddy for certain tasks, just until I feel more comfortable. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent strategies. How do you feel about our session today?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but in a good way? Like I've accomplished something important. It wasn't easy, but I'm glad we did this. I think I understand my reactions better now, and I have some hope that things can improve. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just that... I'm nervous about continuing this process, but I'm also kind of excited to see how much more I can heal. I didn't think I'd ever feel hopeful again after the accident, but here I am. It's a good feeling.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful progress. We'll build on this next time.",
    "Client: Okay, thank you. I'm looking forward to it, even if it's challenging. I appreciate your support through all of this."
