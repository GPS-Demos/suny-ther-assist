    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's begin. Close your eyes and recall the workplace incident.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in the office. It's a regular Tuesday morning. I can smell the coffee from the break room. My coworker, Maria, she... she collapses suddenly. There's commotion, people are yelling for help. I... I freeze. I can't move.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably a 6. My heart is starting to race a bit.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: I see people rushing to Maria. Someone's calling 911. I want to help, but I'm just... stuck. My legs feel heavy. I'm thinking, \"This can't be happening.\" The paramedics arrive, they're working on her. I can hear the defibrillator. It's so loud.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Maybe an 8. I feel my hands shaking.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: They... they can't revive her. I hear someone say, \"She's gone.\" I feel sick to my stomach. All I can think is that I should have done something. I should have helped. Why didn't I move? I... I let her die.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I can't breathe. My chest is so tight.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep breathing. What happens next?",
    "Client: Everyone's crying. I finally move, but it's too late. I touch Maria's hand, it's... it's cold. I feel so guilty. I keep thinking if I had acted faster, maybe she'd still be alive. The office is silent except for sobs. It's suffocating.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: Still a 9. My palms are sweating. I feel lightheaded.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: The paramedics are packing up. They look so defeated. I catch a glimpse of Maria's face. She looks... peaceful. But all I feel is turmoil. The guilt is overwhelming. I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: How about your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down a bit. Maybe an 8. I still feel shaky, but my breathing is slowing down.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're processing this well. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I see my boss. He looks shocked. He's trying to comfort people, but he's struggling too. I remember thinking how unfair life is. Maria was so young, so full of life. And now... now she's gone. Just like that.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's a 7 now. I feel... I feel sad. Really sad.",
    "Therapist: That's a natural response. Continue.",
    "Client: People start to leave. Some are crying, others look numb. I'm still there, rooted to the spot. I can't leave her. Someone... someone touches my shoulder. It's Maria's best friend from accounting. We hug and cry together. It feels... it feels less lonely.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6. I feel drained, but... but also a bit relieved. Like sharing the pain makes it a little easier to bear.",
    "Therapist: That's common. How does the memory end?",
    "Client: We all eventually leave. The office is empty, but it feels... haunted. As I walk out, I look back at Maria's desk. Her coffee mug is still there, half-full. I promise myself I'll never forget her. The guilt is still there, but... but I also feel a strange sense of peace. Like... like maybe it wasn't my fault after all.",
    "Therapist: And your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's a 5 now. I feel exhausted, but... but okay. Like I've confronted something I've been avoiding for a long time.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. You did very well. Let's take a moment to breathe and ground ourselves."
