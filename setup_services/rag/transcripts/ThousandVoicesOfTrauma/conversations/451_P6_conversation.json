    "Therapist: Alright, Priya. Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Just focus on the memory and describe it aloud.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm walking down the hallway at school. It's crowded, and I can hear people whispering and laughing. I know they're talking about me. My heart is racing, and my palms are getting sweaty. I'm trying to keep my head down, but I can feel their eyes on me.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 5 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: As I'm walking, I hear someone shout, \"Hey, curry breath!\" My cheeks burn with embarrassment, and I feel like I can't breathe. I want to disappear. I quicken my pace, but I trip over someone's foot. I fall, and my books scatter across the floor. Everyone's laughing now. It's so loud, and I feel so small.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 7 now.",
    "Therapist: I see. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm on the floor, trying to gather my books. My hands are shaking, and I can barely grip them. Someone kicks one of my books away, and I hear more laughter. I feel tears welling up, but I'm fighting them back. I don't want to cry in front of them. I finally manage to get up, clutching my books to my chest like a shield.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. I can feel my heart pounding just like it did then.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *takes a shaky breath* I'm standing now, but I feel frozen. I want to run, but my legs won't move. Someone shoves me from behind, and I stumble forward. I hear someone say, \"Go back to your country!\" I feel so alone, so rejected. It's like I don't belong anywhere.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. I feel like I'm right there again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Priya. Remember, you're here with me, and you're safe.",
    "Client: *nods, wiping tears* I finally start moving again, practically running to the bathroom. I lock myself in a stall and just cry. I can hear people coming in and out, laughing and talking. I feel so isolated, so different from everyone else. I wonder if I'll ever fit in, if I'll ever feel safe at school again.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's still at a 9. My chest feels tight, and I'm having trouble catching my breath.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe with me.",
    "Client: *takes several deep breaths* Okay... I'm calming down a bit. In the memory, I stay in the bathroom until the bell rings. When I finally come out, the hallway is empty. I look at myself in the mirror, and I barely recognize myself. My eyes are red and puffy, and I look so defeated. I splash some water on my face and try to pull myself together before going to class.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's gone down to a 7. I still feel shaky, but not as overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Priya. Let's continue for a few more minutes.",
    "Client: Alright. As I leave the bathroom, I feel drained. The rest of the day is a blur. I can't concentrate in class, and I keep replaying the incident in my mind. I feel so alone, even when I'm surrounded by other students. When the final bell rings, I rush out of school, desperate to get home where I feel safe.",
    "Therapist: And your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6 now. I feel exhausted, but also a bit relieved that it's over.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Priya. You did an excellent job."
