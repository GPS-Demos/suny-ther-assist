    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about the car accident again, and it still makes me anxious just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'll try to keep that in mind. It's just... every time I think about that day, my heart starts racing.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm trying. So, it was a Tuesday afternoon. I was driving home from a client meeting. The sky was overcast, and there was a light drizzle. I remember thinking I should have left earlier to avoid rush hour traffic.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue describing what you see.",
    "Client: I was on the highway, in the middle lane. Traffic was heavy but moving. I glanced at the clock on my dashboard \u2013 it was 5:37 PM. Suddenly, I heard a loud screeching noise behind me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: I... I looked in my rearview mirror and saw a car swerving wildly. It was coming towards me so fast. I froze. I couldn't move. I couldn't even scream. The next thing I knew, there was a deafening crash, and my car was spinning.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I can still hear the sound of metal crunching. The airbag deployed, hitting me in the face. Everything was a blur of motion and noise. When the car finally stopped spinning, I was facing the wrong direction on the highway. My ears were ringing, and I tasted blood in my mouth.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Keep going.",
    "Client: I was so disoriented. I remember unbuckling my seatbelt with shaking hands. There was shattered glass everywhere. I could smell gasoline and burning rubber. I was terrified the car might explode.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel scared. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I tried to open my door, but it was jammed. I started to panic. I could hear people shouting outside, but it all sounded muffled, like I was underwater. I remember thinking about my husband, wondering if I'd ever see him again.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I'm sorry, I need a moment. This is harder than I thought it would be.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. You're doing really well.",
    "Client: Thank you. Okay... I managed to roll down my window. Someone \u2013 a man \u2013 reached in and helped me climb out. My legs were so wobbly, I could barely stand. He kept telling me not to look at the other car, but I couldn't help it. When I saw it... oh God, it was completely crushed. I thought for sure the driver must be dead.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: I sat on the side of the road, wrapped in a blanket someone gave me. I was shivering uncontrollably. The paramedics arrived, and they were asking me questions, but I could barely focus. All I could think about was how close I had come to dying.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I know, but sometimes it feels like I'm right back there. Like it just happened. I have nightmares about it. Sometimes when I'm driving, I'll hear a loud noise and just freeze up. I'm scared all the time now.",
    "Therapist: Your reactions are normal. You're making progress.",
    "Client: Am I? It doesn't feel like it. I used to be so confident, especially when it came to driving. Now, I can barely get behind the wheel without having a panic attack. My husband has been so patient, but I can tell he's frustrated. I'm frustrated with myself too.",
    "Therapist: Be kind to yourself. Healing takes time.",
    "Client: I know, I'm trying. But it's affecting everything \u2013 my work, my relationships. I'm constantly on edge, waiting for something bad to happen. I hate feeling this way. I just want to feel normal again.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. You're working hard.",
    "Client: Thank you. I guess I just need to keep working at it. It's just... sometimes I wonder if I'll ever fully get over this. Will I always be the woman who panics at loud noises? The one who can't drive on highways?",
    "Therapist: Recovery isn't linear. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I hope so. I really do. I want to be able to drive without fear again. I want to stop reliving that moment every time I close my eyes. I want to feel like myself again.",
    "Therapist: Your desire to heal is powerful. You're resilient.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your support. It's not easy talking about this, but I know it's necessary. I just hope that one day, I'll be able to think about the accident without feeling this overwhelming sense of fear and panic.",
    "Therapist: That's a good goal. You're on the right path.",
    "Client: I hope you're right. I'm trying to stay positive, but some days are harder than others. Especially when something triggers a memory \u2013 like hearing tires screech or seeing an accident on the news. It's like I'm right back there on that highway.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have difficult days. You're growing stronger.",
    "Client: I suppose so. It's just... I never realized how much a single moment could change everything. Before the accident, I never thought twice about getting in a car. Now, it's a constant battle with my own mind. But I'm here, I'm talking about it. That's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think... I think I need a break now. This has been intense, but I'm glad we did it. Even though it's hard, I do feel a little lighter after talking about it.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Let's end here."
