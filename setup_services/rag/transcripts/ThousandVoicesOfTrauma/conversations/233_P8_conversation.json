    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. The memory of the hospital, the beeping machines, the smell of disinfectant... it's like I was right back there again. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel this tightness in my chest. It's hard to shake off the image of my wife lying there, so pale and still.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how powerless I felt. How unfair it all was. We were supposed to grow old together, you know? And then suddenly, in just a matter of days, she was gone. I remember standing there, watching the doctors work on her, and feeling like I was in some kind of horrible dream. Part of me still can't believe it's real.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you recall these moments?",
    "Client: My shoulders are tense, and there's this knot in my stomach. I feel... heavy, I guess. Like there's this weight pressing down on me. And my throat feels tight, like I'm trying to hold back tears. It's strange, but I can almost taste that metallic hospital air again.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are coming up for you?",
    "Client: Grief, definitely. A deep, aching sadness. But also... anger? Yeah, I'm angry. At the doctors, at the disease, at the universe. And guilt. God, the guilt. I keep wondering if I could have done something differently, noticed something sooner. It's irrational, I know, but I can't shake it.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when it first happened?",
    "Client: They're... less intense now, I suppose. When it first happened, it was like being hit by a truck. I couldn't eat, couldn't sleep. Everything felt pointless. Now, it's more of a dull ache. But sometimes, like during this exercise, it all comes rushing back. The rawness of it. The shock.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your ability to sit with these feelings now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard, but I can do it. Before, I would have done anything to avoid thinking about it. I'd throw myself into work, or have a drink, anything to numb it out. Now, it still hurts, but I can breathe through it. I can acknowledge the pain without feeling like it's going to swallow me whole.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization make you feel?",
    "Client: Surprised, actually. And a little proud, I guess? It's like... I'm stronger than I thought. Don't get me wrong, it still hurts like hell. But I'm not falling apart. I'm here, I'm talking about it. That's... that's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Indeed. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm noticing that... well, along with the pain, there's love. So much love. When I think about her, it's not just the hospital room. I remember her laugh, the way her eyes crinkled when she smiled. It's bittersweet, you know? It hurts because it mattered. Because she mattered.",
    "Therapist: How does acknowledging that love feel?",
    "Client: It's... comforting, in a way. Like a warm blanket. But it also makes the loss feel more acute. It's this strange mix of warmth and emptiness. I miss her so much, but I'm grateful for every moment we had. Is that normal? To feel grateful and devastated at the same time?",
    "Therapist: There's no right or wrong way to feel. What else?",
    "Client: I'm realizing that... I'm not just sad about the past. I'm scared about the future. How do I move forward without her? We had all these plans, dreams. Now I have to figure out who I am without her. It's terrifying, but also... I don't know, maybe a little exciting? Is that awful to say?",
    "Therapist: It's a natural part of the grieving process. How does that idea sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... uncomfortable. Part of me feels guilty for even considering a future without her. Like I'm betraying her somehow. But another part knows she'd want me to live, to find joy again. It's just... it's hard to reconcile those feelings, you know?",
    "Therapist: What do you think she would say to you right now?",
    "Client: (long pause) She'd... she'd probably tell me to stop being so hard on myself. (chuckles softly) She always said I was my own worst critic. I can almost hear her voice, telling me it's okay to be a mess, that healing takes time. And... and that she loves me, no matter what.",
    "Therapist: How does imagining her support affect you?",
    "Client: It's... it's comforting. And painful. But mostly comforting. It's like... even though she's gone, her love is still here. Still supporting me. I hadn't really thought about it that way before. Maybe... maybe I don't have to figure this all out alone?",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. What else comes to mind?",
    "Client: I'm thinking about how... how this grief has changed me. I'm more empathetic now, I think. More aware of how fragile life is. And in some ways, I appreciate the little things more. A sunny day, a good cup of coffee... they mean more now. Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. How do you feel about these changes?",
    "Client: Mixed, I guess. I wish I didn't have to learn these lessons this way. But... I'm also grateful for the perspective. It's like... I'm carrying her with me, in a way. Seeing the world through new eyes. It hurts, but it's also... beautiful, in a strange way.",
    "Therapist: What does this tell you about your journey?",
    "Client: That it's... complex. Messy. There's no straight line through grief. Some days are better, some are worse. But I'm... I'm moving. Maybe not forward, exactly, but... somewhere. And maybe that's okay. Maybe that's enough for now.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel as we wrap up this session?",
    "Client: Exhausted, honestly. But also... lighter, somehow? Like I've set down a heavy backpack I didn't even realize I was carrying. It's still there, waiting for me, but for now... I can breathe a little easier. Thank you for... for helping me navigate this.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. How would you like to close?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to take a moment to just breathe. To sit with these feelings, good and bad. And maybe... maybe send a little thought of love to my wife. Let her know I'm okay. Or at least, that I will be."
