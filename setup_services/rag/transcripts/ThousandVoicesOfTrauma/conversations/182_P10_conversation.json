    "Therapist: Welcome back. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm feeling a bit jittery, to be honest. But I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Let's start with your SUDS level.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 6 out of 10. My stomach's in knots.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. When you're ready, close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Alright... I'm at the bank. It's a Tuesday afternoon, and I'm there to deposit a check from work. The air conditioning is on full blast, and I can feel goosebumps on my arms. There's a faint smell of cleaning solution in the air. I'm standing in line, fidgeting with my phone, when suddenly...",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay in the moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: There's a loud crash. People start screaming. I look up and see three men in masks, waving guns. One of them shouts, \"Everyone on the ground, now!\" My heart is pounding so hard I can hear it in my ears. I... I drop to the floor, my cheek pressed against the cold tile.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. It's hard to breathe. I can feel sweat beading on my forehead. My hands are shaking uncontrollably.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Shaky breath) The masked men are shouting at the tellers. I can hear drawers slamming, the rustle of money. Someone near me is crying softly. I want to comfort them, but I'm paralyzed with fear. One of the robbers walks by, his boots heavy on the floor. I can smell gunpowder and leather.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking about my family. Will I see them again? What if I die here? I feel so helpless, so small. I'm angry at myself for not being braver, for not doing something. But I'm terrified.",
    "Therapist: Those are all normal reactions. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to an 8, I think. My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: (Deep breaths) Okay... I'm still there. The robbers are arguing now. One wants to leave, but another insists on checking the vault. I can hear sirens in the distance, getting closer. The atmosphere in the bank changes. Everyone tenses up.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: The leader, I think, starts yelling at us. He's demanding a hostage. My blood runs cold. I'm praying he doesn't pick me, and I hate myself for it. He grabs a young woman near the counter. She's sobbing, begging. I want to help her, but I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: The police are outside now. I can hear megaphones, but I can't make out what they're saying. The robbers are panicking. One of them is pacing, his gun waving around wildly. I'm terrified he'll accidentally shoot someone. The hostage situation drags on for what feels like hours. My muscles are cramping from lying still for so long.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My SUDS is probably a 9. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Take a few deep breaths. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: (Breathing deeply) Okay... The negotiation continues. I can hear snippets of conversation. The robbers want a car, immunity. Suddenly, there's a loud bang - a flash grenade, I think. Everything's chaos. People are screaming, running. I'm disoriented, my ears ringing. Someone grabs my arm, pulling me up. It's a police officer. \"Run!\" he shouts. I stumble towards the exit, my legs weak and shaky.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens as you leave the bank?",
    "Client: I... I burst out into the sunlight. It's so bright after the dim bank interior. There are police cars everywhere, ambulances. Someone wraps a blanket around my shoulders, asks if I'm hurt. I shake my head, unable to speak. I'm scanning the crowd, looking for the other hostages, hoping everyone made it out okay.",
    "Therapist: And how do you feel in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... overwhelmed. Relieved, but also in shock. My body feels like it's buzzing. I can't stop shaking. There's this surreal feeling, like it can't be over, like any moment I'll wake up and still be in that bank.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. How would you rate your distress now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down. Maybe a 7? I feel drained, but also... I don't know, grateful?",
    "Therapist: That's progress. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you name five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: (Opens eyes) Um, your desk lamp, the blue chair, the window, the bookshelf, and the plant in the corner.",
    "Therapist: Good. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Better. Still shaky, but... more present. That was intense.",
    "Therapist: You did very well. We'll end here for today. Remember to practice your breathing exercises.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard, but... I think it's helping. I feel a bit stronger each time.",
    "Therapist: That's great to hear. We'll continue next session. Take care of yourself this week."
