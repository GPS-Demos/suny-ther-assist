    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's begin when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in Afghanistan. It's hot, dusty. The air feels thick with tension. We're on patrol, moving through a small village. The streets are narrow, buildings close on either side. I can hear my own breathing, heavy in my ears. My rifle is at the ready, fingers tense on the trigger. Every shadow, every doorway feels like a potential threat. My heart is racing...",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Um, about a 6 right now. It's... it's getting more vivid.",
    "Therapist: Continue. You're doing well.",
    "Client: We turn a corner, and suddenly there's shouting. A local man is yelling, pointing at us. I can't understand him, but his face is contorted with anger. My squad leader is trying to calm him down, but... oh God, I see movement in a window above. A glint of metal. Before I can shout a warning, there's a deafening crack. Our translator crumples to the ground. Blood... there's so much blood...",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. My hands are shaking. I can almost smell the gunpowder, the dust...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: Everything happens so fast. We're returning fire, taking cover. I can hear screaming - civilians, my teammates, I can't tell. The man who was shouting is on the ground now, not moving. Did I shoot him? I... I can't remember. There's more gunfire, the crack of bullets hitting stone around us. Someone's calling for a medic. I feel frozen, can't move...",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I can't breathe. My chest is so tight...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here, you're safe. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: I... I see our translator. He's not moving. There's so much blood. I should help him, but I can't move. I'm useless. Why can't I move? The gunfire is dying down, but the ringing in my ears is so loud. Someone's shaking me, yelling at me to move. I feel sick... I think I'm going to throw up...",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's still a 9. My heart is pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Stay with it.",
    "Client: We're... we're clearing the buildings now. Room by room. Every doorway feels like it could be my last. The smell of gunpowder and blood is overwhelming. We find the shooter - he's just a kid, can't be more than 15. He's dead. I feel... I feel numb. Like this isn't real. But it is. It was. God, why couldn't I have done something different?",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7? I feel... drained. Exhausted.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're processing a lot. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I... I feel tired. Sad. Angry, too. Why did it have to happen like that? We were supposed to be helping these people, but... but we just brought more death.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid feelings. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Look around the room. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see... I see your bookshelf. The plant in the corner. The sunlight coming through the window. I'm... I'm here. Not there.",
    "Therapist: Good. Final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5 now. I feel... drained, but also... I don't know. Maybe a little lighter? Like I've let something out that I've been holding in for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's end here and discuss what you experienced."
