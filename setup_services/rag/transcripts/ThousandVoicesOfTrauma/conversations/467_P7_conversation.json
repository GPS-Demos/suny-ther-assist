    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's perfectly normal. Take a deep breath. We'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm back in our old apartment. It's late at night, and I can hear my parents arguing in the kitchen. The shouting is getting louder, and I'm scared. I'm hiding in my room, under the covers, trying to block out the noise.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with that memory.",
    "Client: I can hear footsteps coming towards my room. My heart is racing. I'm trembling under the blanket, hoping they won't come in. But then the door bursts open, and I see my father. He looks so angry, his face is red, and he's shouting at me to get up.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: I don't want to get up. I'm frozen with fear. He grabs my arm and yanks me out of bed. It hurts so much. I can smell alcohol on his breath. He's screaming at me, saying it's my fault that he and mom are fighting. I don't understand why he's blaming me. I'm just a kid.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Remember, it's a memory.",
    "Client: My mom comes into the room, trying to pull him away from me. They're both yelling now. I'm caught in the middle, and I feel so helpless. Suddenly, my father pushes my mom, and she falls against the dresser. There's a loud crash as things fall off. I'm terrified he's going to hurt her badly.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I want to help my mom, but I'm too scared to move. I'm crying and begging them to stop. My father turns to me, his eyes wild with anger. He raises his hand, and I flinch, expecting to be hit. But then he stops, looking shocked at what he was about to do. He stumbles back and leaves the room.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're safe now.",
    "Client: My mom is on the floor, crying. I go to her, but I don't know what to do. I feel so guilty, like it's all my fault. The room is a mess, there's broken glass on the floor. I can still hear my father in the other room, throwing things. I'm shaking uncontrollably, holding onto my mom, wishing I could make it all stop.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... overwhelmed. My heart is pounding, and I feel like I'm back there. It's hard to remind myself that it's just a memory.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Take a deep breath. You're here, you're safe.",
    "Client: It's just... I've never talked about this in so much detail before. I can still see their faces, hear their voices. I feel like that scared little boy again.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How are you doing now?",
    "Client: I'm calming down a bit. It's still vivid, but I feel more grounded here in the present. It's strange, but talking about it... it's like I'm seeing it from a different perspective now.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive sign. Would you like to continue or take a break?",
    "Client: I think I can continue. There's more to the memory, but it feels a little easier to talk about now. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're doing great. Whenever you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay. After my father left the room, my mom and I just sat there for a while. She was trying to comfort me, but I could tell she was scared too. We could hear my father in the living room, still angry, still breaking things. I remember feeling so helpless, wishing I could do something to make it all better.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to feel that way. Keep going.",
    "Client: Eventually, things got quieter. My mom helped me back into bed, but I couldn't sleep. I lay there, listening for any sound, afraid it might start again. I remember feeling so alone, even though my mom was just in the next room. I didn't understand why this was happening to us.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory very well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's still painful, but it feels different talking about it here. Like I'm looking at it from the outside. I feel sad for that little boy, but I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a common experience. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It's still hard, but it feels... manageable somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How would you like to proceed?",
    "Client: I think I'd like to stop here for today. It feels like a lot to process. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've done remarkable work today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm feeling drained, but also a bit relieved. Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time. It's a strange mix of exhaustion and... I don't know, maybe hope?",
    "Therapist: That's a very positive outcome. Let's wrap up for today."
