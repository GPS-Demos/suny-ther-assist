    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Carlos?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, Dr. Martinez. It was intense. I felt like I was right back there, you know? The earthquake, the chaos... it all came rushing back. My heart's still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sounds, I think. The rumbling of the earth, people screaming... It reminded me of... of when I was abused. That feeling of helplessness, like I couldn't escape. I haven't thought about that in years.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit those memories?",
    "Client: Honestly? Terrifying. But also... I don't know, maybe a little liberating? Like I'm finally facing it head-on. It's hard to explain.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight, Carlos. Can you elaborate?",
    "Client: Well, for so long I've tried to push these memories away. The abuse, the earthquake... I thought if I ignored them, they'd disappear. But going through this exposure, it's like... I'm acknowledging they happened. They're part of me, but they don't define me. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How does this relate to your PTSD symptoms?",
    "Client: I've noticed my nightmares aren't as frequent lately. And today, even though it was tough, I didn't feel that overwhelming panic I used to. It's like... I'm gaining some control back.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. What's helping you feel more in control?",
    "Client: I think... it's the techniques we've practiced. The breathing exercises, grounding myself in the present. During the exposure, I kept reminding myself that I'm safe now, that I survived. It helped me stay focused.",
    "Therapist: Excellent use of those strategies. What's challenging you most right now?",
    "Client: The guilt, I suppose. I keep thinking about the others during the earthquake, wondering if I could've done more to help. And with the abuse... I still struggle with feeling like it was somehow my fault.",
    "Therapist: How do you think we could address that moving forward?",
    "Client: Maybe... we could work on challenging those thoughts? I know logically that I'm not to blame, but emotionally, it's still there.",
    "Therapist: That's a great suggestion. Anything else you'd like to focus on?",
    "Client: I'd like to work on opening up to my wife more. She's been so supportive, but I still find it hard to talk about these experiences with her.",
    "Therapist: We can definitely incorporate that. How are you feeling about continuing with the exposures?",
    "Client: It's tough, but... I'm seeing the benefits. I feel stronger after each session, like I'm reclaiming parts of myself. I want to keep going.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is commendable, Carlos. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, Dr. Martinez. I never thought I'd be able to face these memories. It's still a journey, but I feel like I'm finally moving forward.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work, Carlos. See you next week?",
    "Client: Definitely. I'll be here."
