    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Chen?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Revisiting those memories of my husband's passing... it's like reopening an old wound. I can still see his face in the hospital bed, so pale and fragile. It's been five years, but it feels like yesterday.",
    "Therapist: What stood out to you most about the experience?",
    "Client: The guilt. It's always the guilt that hits me hardest. I keep thinking about all the times I wasn't there for him because of my... my drinking. I wasted so much time that I could have spent with him. And now, he's gone, and I can never make it up to him.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to confront those emotions today?",
    "Client: It was... difficult. Painful. But also, in a strange way, somewhat liberating. I've been carrying this burden for so long, afraid to really look at it. But facing it head-on, it's like... I don't know, like I'm finally acknowledging the full weight of what happened.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant insight. How does this connect to your recovery goals?",
    "Client: I suppose... it makes me realize that I need to forgive myself. Not just for Liang's sake, but for my own. I've been using alcohol to numb these feelings for years, but that's not really living, is it? I want to be present for my family now, especially my grandchildren. I don't want to miss out on any more precious time.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What do you think might help you move towards self-forgiveness?",
    "Client: I... I'm not entirely sure. Maybe... maybe talking more about these memories, instead of trying to push them away? And perhaps... finding ways to honor Liang's memory that don't involve drinking. He always loved when I gardened. I could start doing that again.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like positive steps. How are you feeling about continuing this process?",
    "Client: It's scary, I won't lie. But I also feel... hopeful? For the first time in a long while, I feel like I might be able to move forward. It won't be easy, but... I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. What support do you need moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I need to lean on my family more. I've been pushing them away, afraid of being a burden. But I see now that I need their support. And... I might need some help with my drinking. It's been my crutch for so long, I'm not sure how to cope without it.",
    "Therapist: Those are important recognitions. How can we address those in our sessions?",
    "Client: Could we... could we work on strategies for when I feel the urge to drink? And maybe... ways to open up to my family? I've kept everything bottled up for so long, I'm not sure I even remember how to express myself anymore.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll focus on those areas. Any final thoughts on today's session?",
    "Client: It was hard, but... I'm glad we did it. For the first time in years, I feel like I might be able to face my past without drowning in it. Thank you for... for helping me see that there might be a way forward."
