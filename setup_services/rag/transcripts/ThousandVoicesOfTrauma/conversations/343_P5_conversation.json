    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, Dr. Thompson. I've been thinking about our last session and what you mentioned about imaginal exposure. To be honest, I'm not sure I'm ready for this.",
    "Therapist: I understand. It's normal to feel apprehensive. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... I've spent so long trying to avoid thinking about what happened. The idea of purposely reliving it feels terrifying. I'm worried I might fall apart or lose control. And with everything going on with my divorce, I'm not sure I can handle more stress right now.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. Let's discuss the purpose and how we'll approach this together.",
    "Client: Okay, I'm listening. But I'm still not sure about this. How is reliving that awful night supposed to help me? I've been trying so hard to move past it, especially with all the changes in my life right now.",
    "Therapist: Imaginal exposure helps process the trauma memory. It can reduce its power over you. How does that sound?",
    "Client: I understand the logic, but it still feels scary. What if I can't handle it? What if it makes things worse? I'm already struggling with anxiety about my divorce and my job performance. I'm worried this might push me over the edge.",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. I'll be here to support you throughout. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: I appreciate that, Dr. Thompson. I guess I'm wondering, what exactly will happen during the exposure? Will I have to close my eyes? How long will it last? And what if I start panicking? I'm afraid I might have a full-blown anxiety attack.",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the memory aloud. We'll start small, about 20 minutes. Eyes open or closed - your choice. We can pause anytime.",
    "Client: Okay, that doesn't sound as bad as I imagined. Twenty minutes seems manageable. And it's good to know we can pause if needed. I'm still nervous, but I think I can try. Do you really think this will help with my PTSD symptoms?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it's a proven technique. Your courage is admirable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Thank you for saying that. It means a lot to hear you acknowledge how difficult this is. I think I'm ready to try. Can you just remind me one more time what I need to do? And maybe... could you hold onto this stress ball for me? I might need it if things get too intense.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Describe the memory in present tense. I'll guide you. Here's the stress ball. Ready?",
    "Client: Okay, I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. I'll try to describe it in the present tense. Just... please stop me if I seem too overwhelmed, okay? I trust you, Dr. Thompson, but I'm still scared. Let's do this before I lose my nerve.",
    "Therapist: I'm here with you. You're safe. Let's start when you're comfortable.",
    "Client: Alright. I'm taking a deep breath. Here goes... I'm at my friend's house. It's late evening, and we're laughing, having a good time. Suddenly, we hear shouting outside. It's getting louder, and I'm starting to feel uneasy..."
