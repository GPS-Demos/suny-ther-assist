    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the car accident?",
    "Client: Okay... I was driving home from work. It was raining heavily, and visibility was poor. I remember gripping the steering wheel tightly, trying to focus on the road ahead. Suddenly, I saw headlights coming towards me in my lane. My heart started racing...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: The other car was swerving. I tried to avoid it, but everything happened so fast. I jerked the wheel, and my car started spinning. The screeching of tires was deafening. I felt a sharp impact, and then... silence. Just the sound of rain and my own rapid breathing.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I smell gasoline. And wet asphalt. My hands are shaking uncontrollably. I'm trying to unbuckle my seatbelt, but my fingers won't cooperate. I'm panicking, thinking the car might catch fire. I can't get out...",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. Keep going.",
    "Client: I hear someone shouting. They're asking if I'm okay, but their voice sounds distant. I'm disoriented. My head hurts, and I taste blood in my mouth. I finally manage to unlock the seatbelt and push the door open. The cold rain hits my face, and I stumble out of the car.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. What happens next?",
    "Client: I see the other driver. They're okay, just shaken up. We're both standing in the rain, looking at our damaged cars. I start feeling guilty, wondering if I could have done something differently. But mostly, I feel... relieved. Relieved that we're both alive.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. Continue.",
    "Client: The police and ambulance arrive. The flashing lights are disorienting. They're asking me questions, but I'm having trouble focusing. I keep replaying the accident in my mind, feeling the car spin, hearing the crash. I'm shivering, but I'm not sure if it's from the cold or shock.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel overwhelmed. My heart is racing again, just like it did during the accident. I can almost feel the impact, the jolt through my body. It's hard to breathe...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm trying to calm down. The paramedics are checking me over. They're concerned about a possible concussion. I'm worried about how this will affect my work, my life. The reality of what just happened is starting to sink in, and I feel... vulnerable. Like everything can change in an instant.",
    "Therapist: That's a natural reaction. Keep going.",
    "Client: They want to take me to the hospital for further checks. As I'm getting into the ambulance, I look back at my car. It's completely wrecked. I realize how close I came to... to not making it. The thought terrifies me. I start crying in the ambulance, overwhelmed by everything.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel emotional. You're doing well.",
    "Client: At the hospital, everything feels surreal. The bright lights, the busy staff, the beeping machines. I'm answering questions mechanically, but inside, I'm reliving the accident over and over. Every time I close my eyes, I see those headlights coming towards me. I'm exhausted, but I'm afraid to sleep.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory bravely. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. Talking about it brings back all those intense emotions - the fear, the panic, the relief, the guilt. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe catharsis? Like I'm finally confronting something I've been avoiding. It's hard, but I think it's necessary.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. We'll end here for today."
