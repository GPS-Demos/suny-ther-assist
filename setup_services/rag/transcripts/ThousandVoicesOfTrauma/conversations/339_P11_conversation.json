    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. The memories of that plane crash... they're so vivid. I can still hear the screams, the sound of metal tearing apart. It's like I was right back there, you know? My heart is still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. Watching it all unfold and not being able to do anything. I keep thinking about the faces of the people on the ground, how terrified they looked. And the smell... God, the smell of burning fuel and... and worse. It's stuck in my nose even now.",
    "Therapist: How does that compare to your everyday experiences?",
    "Client: It's... it's similar, actually. I often feel powerless in my daily life, like I'm just watching things happen around me. And certain smells can trigger memories instantly. It's probably why I've been drinking more lately, trying to numb it all out.",
    "Therapist: I see. How did sharing this memory feel different from your usual coping?",
    "Client: It was harder, definitely. But... I don't know, maybe a bit relieving too? Like, I've been carrying this weight for so long, and for once I'm not doing it alone. It's scary, but also... maybe a little freeing?",
    "Therapist: That's a significant insight. What else have you noticed?",
    "Client: I realized how much I've been isolating myself. Even in my shared accommodation, I barely interact with others. I'm always afraid they'll see how messed up I am, or that I'll break down in front of them. But talking about it here... it makes me wonder if maybe I could open up a bit more.",
    "Therapist: That's a brave consideration. How might that impact your recovery?",
    "Client: I guess... it could help me feel less alone? Maybe talking about it more would make the memories less powerful. But it's scary. I've spent so long trying to forget, the idea of confronting it head-on is terrifying.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. What's one small step you could take?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I could try talking to my roommate a bit more. Just casual stuff at first, nothing heavy. Baby steps, right? And perhaps cut back on the drinking a little. It's not really helping anyway.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful approach. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... okay, I think. Like I've run a marathon, but maybe in a good way? There's this weird mix of exhaustion and... I don't know, hope? Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: It's a common experience. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to explore more of how this affects my daily life. Maybe find some strategies to deal with the flashbacks when they happen. And... maybe talk more about the drinking. I know it's not helping, but it's been my crutch for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a great plan. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's hard, really hard. But I think it's worth it. For the first time in a long time, I feel like maybe there's a way forward. It's scary, but... I'm ready to keep trying.",
    "Therapist: Your resilience is inspiring. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: I... I don't think so. Just... thank you, I guess. For listening, for guiding me through this. It means more than I can say.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Remember to be kind to yourself this week.",
    "Client: I'll try. It's not easy, but I'll try. Same time next week?",
    "Therapist: Yes, I'll see you then. Take care."
