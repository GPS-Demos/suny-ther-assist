    "Therapist: Welcome back. Today we'll be doing an imaginal exposure focused on your experience with severe illness. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. It's a bit daunting, to be honest. I'm feeling a mix of anticipation and unease.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath and begin describing the event as if it's happening now.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm in my bedroom. It's early morning, and I've just woken up. Something feels... off. My body aches all over, and there's this crushing fatigue weighing me down. I try to sit up, but my head spins, and I collapse back onto the pillow. My heart starts racing. This isn't normal. I... I reach for my phone on the nightstand, but my hand is shaking so much I can barely grip it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: I manage to unlock my phone and call my housemate. My voice comes out as a rasp. \"Hey, I... I need help.\" There's a long pause, and I hear shuffling on the other end. Then footsteps in the hallway. My door creaks open, and I see my housemate's face. Their eyes widen with shock. \"Oh my god, what's wrong?\" they ask. I try to explain, but my words are slurring. The room starts to tilt and blur...",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, and my palms are sweaty. It's like I'm back there, you know? I can feel the fever burning through me.",
    "Therapist: Take a slow, deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... The next thing I remember clearly is being in an ambulance. The siren is wailing, and I'm strapped to a gurney. There's an oxygen mask on my face, and I can hear the paramedics talking urgently. Their voices sound muffled, like I'm underwater. I'm trying to focus, to understand what's happening, but it's so hard. My whole body feels like it's on fire, and I can't stop shivering. I... I'm terrified. I've never felt so helpless in my life.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 7, I think.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here in this room, safe. Keep going.",
    "Client: We arrive at the hospital, and everything becomes a blur of activity. I'm wheeled through bright corridors, voices echoing around me. They transfer me to a bed, and suddenly I'm surrounded by doctors and nurses. They're attaching wires and tubes, asking me questions I can barely comprehend. I hear snippets of conversation - \"severe pneumonia,\" \"possible sepsis,\" \"critical condition.\" Each word feels like a hammer blow. I want to speak, to ask what's happening, but I can't find my voice. The fear is overwhelming, choking me more than the illness itself.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... I'm in the ICU now. The constant beeping of machines fills the air. I drift in and out of consciousness. When I'm awake, the pain is excruciating. It feels like every breath is a battle. I see doctors conferring at the foot of my bed, their faces grim. One of them approaches me, speaking softly. \"We're doing everything we can,\" they say, but their eyes tell a different story. I... I realize I might die here. The thought crashes over me like a wave, and I start to panic. My heart monitor starts beeping frantically, and a nurse rushes over...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I... I feel shaky. My heart's racing. It's like I'm back there, fighting for every breath.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here now, you're safe. Take a moment to ground yourself.",
    "Client: *takes a deep breath* Okay... I'm here. I'm safe. It's just... it's so vivid, you know?",
    "Therapist: I understand. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: Alright... Days blur together in the ICU. I'm in a haze of pain and medication. Nurses come and go, checking vitals, adjusting IVs. I catch glimpses of my reflection in the window - I barely recognize myself. I've lost so much weight, my skin is sallow, my eyes sunken. There's a constant war raging in my body, and I'm not sure if I'm winning. One night, I wake up gasping for air. Alarms are blaring, and suddenly my bed is surrounded by medical staff. They're shouting instructions, working frantically. I feel like I'm drowning, desperate for air. In that moment, I'm certain this is the end. I close my eyes, thinking of all the things I never got to do, the people I'll never see again...",
    "Therapist: Take a breath. You're here now, you survived.",
    "Client: *inhales shakily* Yeah... I did. It's just... it was so close, you know?",
    "Therapist: I understand. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about an 8. This is really intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... Somehow, I make it through that night. The next few days are a blur of tests, treatments, and slowly, very slowly, I start to improve. I remember the first time I manage to sit up on my own - it feels like climbing a mountain. Every small victory is huge - being able to eat solid food again, taking my first steps with a walker. But the fear lingers. Every twinge, every cough sends a jolt of panic through me. I'm terrified of relapsing, of ending up back where I started. The doctors start talking about discharge, but I'm not sure I'm ready. The world outside seems so daunting now...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling as you describe this?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of relief and anxiety. I'm glad I survived, but the memory of how close I came to not making it... it's overwhelming.",

    "Client: *deep breath* You're right. I did make it. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. When you're ready, continue with the final part of your experience.",
    "Client: The day I'm discharged is surreal. I'm wheeled out of the hospital, the same doors I came through weeks ago, barely conscious. The sunlight feels too bright, the world too loud. My housemate is there to pick me up, and I can see the relief on their face. The car ride home is quiet - I'm lost in thought, processing everything that's happened. When we arrive home, I stand in my bedroom doorway, staring at the unmade bed where this all started. It hits me then - the full weight of what I've been through, how close I came to never seeing this room again. I break down crying, a mix of relief, fear, and gratitude. My housemate hugs me, and for the first time in weeks, I feel safe. But I know the road to recovery, both physical and mental, is just beginning.

    "Therapist: You've done an incredible job. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, but also kind of relieved. It's like a weight has been lifted, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's common after an exposure exercise. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's come down to about a 5, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's take a few minutes to debrief and process what you've just shared."

My housemate is there to pick me up, and I can see the relief on their face. The car ride home is quiet - I'm lost in thought, processing everything that's happened.

My housemate hugs me, and for the first time in weeks, I feel safe. But I know the road to recovery, both physical and mental, is just beginning. The experience has changed me, and I'm not sure who I am now on the other side of it all.",
