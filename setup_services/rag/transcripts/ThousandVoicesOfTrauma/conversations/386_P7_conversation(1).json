    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the bullying incident?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in the school cafeteria. It's lunchtime, and I can smell the food. I'm sitting alone, trying to eat my lunch quietly. I see a group of girls approaching my table. My heart starts racing because I know what's coming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: They surround my table, and the leader, Sarah, starts making fun of my clothes. She's saying things like, \"Where did you get that shirt? The dollar store?\" The others are laughing. I'm trying to ignore them, but I can feel my face getting hot.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Sarah reaches out and knocks my tray off the table. My food spills everywhere. I'm so embarrassed. People are staring. I want to disappear. I can feel tears welling up in my eyes, but I'm trying not to cry.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Continue.",
    "Client: I start picking up the mess, and Sarah says, \"Oh look, she's cleaning like a good little maid.\" They're all laughing even harder now. I feel so small, so worthless. I wish I could stand up to them, but I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: A teacher finally notices and comes over. The girls quickly scatter, acting innocent. The teacher helps me clean up, but I can't even look at her. I'm so humiliated. I just want to run away and never come back to school.",
    "Therapist: You're being very courageous. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel sick to my stomach. My hands are shaking. It's like I'm right back there, feeling so helpless and alone. I hate that they had so much power over me.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have these reactions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I know, but it still feels so real. I can see their faces, hear their laughter. It's like it never stopped. Sometimes I wonder if that's why I struggle with my relationships now. I'm always waiting for people to turn on me.",
    "Therapist: You're making important connections. Keep going.",
    "Client: Even with my boyfriend, I find it hard to trust completely. When he compliments me, part of me is always waiting for the punchline, you know? Like, when will he realize I'm not good enough and start treating me like those girls did?",
    "Therapist: You're showing great insight. How does that affect you?",
    "Client: It makes me constantly on edge. I overanalyze everything he says or does. Sometimes I push him away before he has a chance to hurt me. I know it's not fair to him, but I can't help it. It's like I'm still that girl in the cafeteria, waiting for the next attack.",
    "Therapist: You're recognizing patterns. That's progress.",
    "Client: I guess so. But it's exhausting living like this. Always waiting for the other shoe to drop. I want to be able to trust people, to feel worthy of love and respect. But those girls' voices are always in the back of my mind, telling me I'm not good enough.",
