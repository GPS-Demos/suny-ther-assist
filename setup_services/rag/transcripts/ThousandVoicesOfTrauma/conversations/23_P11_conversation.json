    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. Going through that memory of witnessing the violence between my parents... it's like I was right back there, you know? I could hear the shouting, the sound of things breaking. I could even smell the alcohol on my dad's breath. It's just... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The fear, I think. I remembered how small and helpless I felt, hiding in the corner of my room. I could hear my mom crying, and I wanted to help her, but I was too scared to move. It's... it's frustrating to remember that now. I wish I had done something, anything.",
    "Therapist: How does that frustration feel in your body right now?",
    "Client: It's like a tightness in my chest, and my fists are clenched. I just... I feel angry at myself, at my dad, at the whole situation. But mostly, I feel guilty for not helping my mom. I know logically that I was just a child, but emotionally... it's hard to shake that feeling.",
    "Therapist: Mm. How does this connect to your day-to-day life now?",
    "Client: I... I think it explains a lot, actually. Like why I'm always on edge, always watching for signs of danger. And maybe... maybe it's part of why I turned to drugs. To numb that constant fear and guilt. It's exhausting, always feeling like I need to be ready to protect myself or others.",
    "Therapist: What's it like to make that connection?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually kind of relieving, in a way. Like, oh, there's a reason I feel like this. It's not just me being crazy or weak. But it's also scary because... well, how do I change something that's been with me for so long?",
    "Therapist: That's a great question. What ideas do you have?",
    "Client: I'm not sure... Maybe... maybe recognizing when I'm reacting to old fears instead of current situations? And... and maybe talking to my husband about it. He's always wondered why I get so anxious sometimes, and now I have a better explanation. I think... I think that might help me feel less alone in dealing with this.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like good steps. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's tough, really tough. But... I think it's helping. I feel like I'm understanding myself better, even if it's painful. And... and I want to get better. For myself, for my family. I don't want to be controlled by these memories anymore. So yeah, I'm scared, but I'm willing to keep going.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. What else came up for you during the exposure?",
    "Client: I... I remembered something I hadn't thought about in years. After one of those violent nights, my mom came to check on me. She was crying, but she hugged me and told me everything would be okay. I'd forgotten about that moment of... of love, I guess, in the middle of all that fear. It's... it's bittersweet to remember it now.",
    "Therapist: How does that memory impact you?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. On one hand, it makes me sad because I know now that things weren't okay, not really. But on the other hand, it reminds me that there was still love there, even in the worst times. And maybe... maybe that's part of why I've been able to build a loving relationship with my husband, despite everything. I don't know. It's a lot to think about.",
    "Therapist: Indeed. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to explore more about how these experiences have shaped my relationships. Especially with my husband and my son. I want to make sure I'm not passing on this fear and anxiety to them. And maybe... maybe we could talk more about strategies for managing my anxiety when it gets triggered by memories like this?",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. Emotionally drained. But also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've put down a heavy bag I've been carrying for a long time. It's not gone, but... but I feel like I understand it better now. And that gives me hope, I think. Hope that I can learn to carry it differently, or maybe even put parts of it down for good.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. We'll pick up here next time.",
    "Client: Thank you. This isn't easy, but... I'm grateful for your help in working through it. I'll see you next week."
