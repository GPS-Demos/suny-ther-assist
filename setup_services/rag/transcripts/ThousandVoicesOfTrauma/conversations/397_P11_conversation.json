    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Maria?",
    "Client: (deep breath) It's... it's hard to put into words, Dr. Johnson. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? It's strange. Going through that memory of witnessing the violence at the grocery store, it brought back so many vivid details I thought I'd forgotten. The sounds, the smells, the fear... it was all there again.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: (pause) I think... the helplessness. I remember feeling so frozen, like I couldn't do anything to stop what was happening. And the guilt afterwards, wondering if I could have done more. It's the same feeling I had when I lost my brother last year. That sense of powerlessness...",
    "Therapist: How did reliving that memory feel different from your usual thoughts about it?",
    "Client: Well, usually when I think about it, I try to push it away as quickly as possible. But this time, going through it step by step, I noticed things I hadn't before. Like how brave that young cashier was, trying to calm everyone down. And I realized that even though I felt helpless, I did manage to call 911. I guess I wasn't completely powerless after all.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. How might this new perspective impact you?",
    "Client: (thoughtful pause) I suppose... it could help me be a little less hard on myself. Both for that incident and for my brother's passing. Maybe I did what I could in both situations, even if it didn't feel like enough at the time.",
    "Therapist: Excellent insight. How does this connect to your anxiety?",
    "Client: Oh, wow. I hadn't thought about that, but... I guess a lot of my anxiety comes from feeling like I'm not in control, like something bad could happen at any moment. But if I can recognize that I'm not completely helpless, even in the worst situations, maybe that could help me feel a bit more... grounded?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful connection. What else did you notice during the exposure?",
    "Client: (sighs) I noticed how tense my body got, especially my shoulders and chest. It was like I was right back there, feeling that fear and panic. But I also noticed that as we continued, it started to ease up a bit. By the end, I wasn't as overwhelmed as I thought I'd be.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that progress?",
    "Client: It's... encouraging, I think. I mean, it's still tough to go through, but knowing that it gets a little easier gives me hope. It makes me feel like maybe I can handle this, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's great, Maria. What's your takeaway from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I'm realizing that facing these memories head-on, as scary as it is, might actually be helping. It's like... by going through it in a safe environment, I'm learning that I can handle it. And maybe, just maybe, I'm stronger than I thought I was.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How will you apply this before our next session?",
    "Client: Well, I think I'll try to be more mindful of when I'm feeling anxious or out of control. Instead of just reacting, I'll try to pause and remind myself of times when I've been able to cope, even in difficult situations. And maybe I'll practice some of those breathing exercises we talked about, to help stay grounded.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a solid plan. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, Dr. Johnson. This isn't easy, but I feel like I'm starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel. It's a long way off, but at least now I know it's there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work, Maria. See you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you, Doctor. See you then."
