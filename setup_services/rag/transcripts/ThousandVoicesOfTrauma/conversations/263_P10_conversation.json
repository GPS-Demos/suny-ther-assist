    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. Talking about this stuff always gets me worked up. But I suppose that's the point, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel that way. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess so. Let's get on with it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm at the docks. It's early morning, still dark out. The air is damp and cold. I can smell the sea, mixed with diesel fumes from the ships. I'm... I'm supposed to be overseeing a shipment, but something feels off.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I notice a container that's not on my manifest. It's... it's tucked away in a corner, like someone's trying to hide it. I approach it, and... God, I can hear muffled sounds coming from inside. My heart starts racing.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: Uh, about a 6... maybe 7. My palms are getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: I... I call over one of the dock workers. Ask him to bring bolt cutters. My hands are shaking as I cut the lock. The smell when I open the container... it's awful. Stale air, sweat, fear. And then I see them. People. Huddled together, squinting at the light. Men, women... even kids. They look terrified.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (inhales shakily) It's... it's hard to breathe. I feel like I'm back there.",
    "Therapist: Focus on my voice. You're in my office. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to an 8. I can't... I can't shake the image of their faces.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Let's ground ourselves. Can you name five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: Um... your desk, the window, a plant, a clock, and... and that painting on the wall.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, when you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm calling the police. My hands are shaking so badly I can barely hold the phone. I'm trying to keep my voice down, afraid whoever's behind this might still be around. The people in the container are starting to realize what's happening. Some are crying, others look hopeful. I... I don't know what to do while we wait for help.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in that moment?",
    "Client: Overwhelmed. Angry. Scared. I want to help them, but I'm also terrified of what might happen if the traffickers come back.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those emotions. What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's still at an 8. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The wait for the police feels like forever. I'm trying to communicate with the people, but there's a language barrier. I give them water, blankets from my car. Some of them are in bad shape. Dehydrated, weak. There's a little girl, can't be more than six or seven. She reminds me of my daughter at that age. I... I can't stop thinking about what she's been through.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Furious. Heartbroken. I want to find whoever did this and... and... (voice breaks) God, I've never felt so angry in my life.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that anger. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually down to a 7. Talking about it... it helps, somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The police finally arrive. It's chaos. They're questioning me, trying to get statements from the victims. Social services shows up. I'm giving my statement over and over. I keep looking at that little girl. She's clinging to a woman I assume is her mother. I can't stop thinking about how close they came to... to... (voice trails off)",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe.",
    "Client: (deep breath) I'm okay. I... I keep replaying it in my head. What if I hadn't noticed that container? What if I'd just ignored it? Those people... they could have...",
    "Therapist: But you didn't ignore it. You took action.",
    "Client: Yeah, I... I guess I did. It's just... it's hard to feel good about it when I know this is happening all over the world.",
    "Therapist: Focus on what you could control. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 6. Talking about it, it's like... like I'm starting to process it better.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's continue.",
    "Client: The aftermath was... intense. Interviews, court appearances. I had to testify. Seeing the traffickers in court... I wanted to lunge at them. But I held it together. For those people. They were so brave, telling their stories.",
    "Therapist: How did testifying make you feel?",
    "Client: Scared at first. But then... empowered. Like I was finally doing something to help.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 5. I'm feeling a bit lighter, actually.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's keep going.",
    "Client: After the trial, I... I couldn't just go back to my normal life. I started volunteering with organizations that help trafficking survivors. It's hard work, emotionally draining. But it feels... necessary. Like I have to do something, you know?",
    "Therapist: How has that impacted you?",
    "Client: It's... it's given me purpose. But it's also... it's made me more aware of how big this problem is. Sometimes it feels overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hovering around a 4. Talking about the work I'm doing now, it helps balance out the heavy stuff.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Tired. Emotionally drained. But also... I don't know, maybe a little proud? Like I've faced this head-on instead of running from it.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. Well done.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's... it's still hard. I still have nightmares sometimes. But they're less frequent now. And when I wake up, I remind myself that I'm doing something to help. It doesn't fix everything, but... it helps.",
    "Therapist: That's a healthy perspective. What's your final SUDS?",
    "Client: I'd say... about a 3. I feel... I feel okay. Tired, but okay.",
    "Therapist: That's fantastic progress, John. How do you feel about ending the session here?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think that's good. This was... intense. But I feel like I've processed some things I've been avoiding.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later. We'll pick this up next session.",
    "Client: Okay. Thanks, doc. This... this helps. More than I thought it would.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. Take care, John. I'll see you next week."
