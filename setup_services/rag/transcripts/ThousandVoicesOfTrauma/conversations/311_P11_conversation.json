    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not quite sure. It's a mix of emotions, really. That natural disaster we just went through in the imaginal... it brought back a lot of memories from my time in combat. The chaos, the uncertainty, the feeling of helplessness. It's all so vivid now.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The sounds, I think. The roaring of the wind during the hurricane... it reminded me so much of the explosions and gunfire I experienced in combat. I could feel my heart racing, just like it did back then. And the darkness... when the power went out, it was like being back in those pitch-black nights on patrol. I felt so... exposed and vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit those sensations?",
    "Client: It was... intense. Scary, but also... I don't know, maybe a bit empowering? I mean, I got through it. Both the real experience and now this imaginal one. It's like... I'm proving to myself that I can face these memories without completely falling apart.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does this connect to your everyday life?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... it makes me see that maybe I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. You know, in my day-to-day life, I often avoid situations that might trigger these memories. But going through this imaginal exposure, it's like... maybe I don't need to be so afraid all the time. Maybe I can handle more than I thought.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. What else?",
    "Client: I... I noticed something else too. During the imaginal exposure, when things were at their worst, I found myself thinking about my family. About protecting them, getting them to safety. It's funny, because in my combat experiences, I was always focused on my fellow soldiers. But now, my priorities have shifted. It's like... my PTSD isn't just about me anymore. It's about how it affects my loved ones too.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization impact you?",
    "Client: It's... motivating, I suppose. It makes me want to work harder at this therapy, to get better not just for myself, but for them too. They deserve a wife and mother who isn't constantly on edge, you know? But it's also... a bit overwhelming. Like, there's more pressure now.",
    "Therapist: I hear that. How might you balance that?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe I need to remind myself that by taking care of my own mental health, I'm also taking care of them? It's like they say on airplanes - put your own oxygen mask on first before helping others. I guess the same applies here.",
    "Therapist: That's a helpful analogy. What's one thing you'll take away from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's that I'm more resilient than I realized. And that facing these memories, as hard as it is, is actually making me stronger. It's not easy, and sometimes I feel like I'm right back there in the thick of it all. But I'm starting to see that I can get through it. And maybe, just maybe, I can start applying that strength to other areas of my life too.",
    "Therapist: Excellent insight, Sarah. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: I'm... cautiously optimistic, I think. It's tough, and there are moments when I want to just give up and go back to avoiding everything. But I can see the progress, even if it's small. And that gives me hope. I want to keep going, to see where this leads. I want to be able to live my life fully again, you know? Without constantly looking over my shoulder or jumping at every loud noise. I think I'm ready to put in the work to get there.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. Is there anything else on your mind?",
    "Client: I... I guess I'm wondering about the next steps. Like, how do I take what we're doing here and apply it to my daily life? Sometimes it feels like there's a disconnect between the progress I make here in our sessions and how I function out in the real world. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: It's very common. How might you bridge that gap?",
    "Client: Hmm... Maybe I could... I don't know, practice some of the coping strategies we've talked about in less stressful situations? Like, if I'm feeling anxious at the grocery store, I could try some of the breathing exercises or grounding techniques. And maybe I could gradually expose myself to some of the things I've been avoiding, but start small. Baby steps, right?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a solid plan. Anything else?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to be more open with my family about what I'm going through. They've been so supportive, but I've kept a lot of it bottled up. Maybe if I share more, they can help me practice some of these techniques in daily life. And it might help them understand why I react the way I do sometimes. It's scary to be that vulnerable, but... I think it might be necessary for my progress.",
    "Therapist: Opening up can be powerful. How do you feel as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I feel... tired, but in a good way. Like I've done some hard work today. And I feel... hopeful. More hopeful than I have in a long time. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know we have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I might actually get there.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today, Sarah. We'll continue next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm looking forward to it. And... I'm going to try to remember this feeling of hope when things get tough between now and then. It's a good feeling to hold onto."
