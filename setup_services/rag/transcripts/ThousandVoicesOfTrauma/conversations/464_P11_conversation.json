    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. Going through that memory of fleeing my home country... it brought up so many emotions. I felt scared, confused, and angry all at once. My heart was racing, and I could almost feel the heat of that day on my skin. It's like I was right back there, you know?",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sounds. The shouting, the chaos in the streets. I remember my mother's voice, telling me to hurry. And... (pauses) the feeling of helplessness. We had to leave everything behind, and I didn't know if we'd ever come back.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to share that now?",
    "Client: It's... surprisingly relieving. I've kept these memories bottled up for so long. Talking about them is hard, but it's like... like I'm finally acknowledging what happened to me. To us.",
    "Therapist: You're showing a lot of courage.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. But here I am, and... I'm okay. I mean, I'm not great, but I'm not falling apart either.",
    "Therapist: What do you make of that?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe I'm stronger than I thought? Or maybe it's just that talking about it here feels safe. I don't know. It's confusing.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your daily life?",
    "Client: Well, I've always struggled with trust issues and feeling on edge. Reliving this memory... it kind of explains why. We lost everything in an instant. No wonder I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop, you know?",
    "Therapist: I see. How might this insight help you?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I can start to separate my past experiences from my present reality? Like, understand that I'm safe now, even if I don't always feel that way. It's hard though.",
    "Therapist: It is hard. What else comes up for you?",
    "Client: I think about my chronic pain. I've always wondered if it's connected to the stress and trauma. Going through this memory, feeling all that tension... it's like my body remembers too, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful connection.",
    "Client: Yeah... (sighs) It's a lot to think about. But I feel like I'm starting to understand myself better. It's scary, but also... kind of empowering?",
    "Therapist: How so?",
    "Client: Well, if I can face these memories and not fall apart, maybe I can face other challenges too. Like, maybe I can push myself a bit more at work, or in my relationships. I've always held back because I was afraid of getting hurt.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization.",
    "Client: It is, isn't it? (pauses) You know, I've been thinking about my living situation too. I've always stayed in shared accommodations because it felt safer, less committed. But maybe... maybe I'm ready to consider living on my own?",
    "Therapist: How does that idea feel?",
    "Client: Scary. But also... exciting? Like, maybe it's time for me to take more control of my life. To stop letting my past dictate my future, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a big step. What support might you need?",
    "Client: I think... I might need help dealing with the anxiety that comes with change. And maybe some strategies for when the memories feel overwhelming. Do you think we could work on that?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll address that in our sessions.",
    "Client: Thank you. I know this process isn't easy, but I'm starting to see why it's important. It's like... by facing these memories, I'm reclaiming parts of myself I thought I'd lost.",
    "Therapist: That's a beautiful way to put it.",
    "Client: Yeah... (takes a deep breath) I'm grateful for this space to process all of this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm finally moving forward.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: I'm nervous, but I'm ready. I want to keep going. I want to understand myself better and learn how to live with these experiences without letting them control me. It's going to be tough, but... I think it'll be worth it.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is admirable. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that's a good idea. I have a lot to think about. Thank you for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't judge.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and we'll continue next week."
