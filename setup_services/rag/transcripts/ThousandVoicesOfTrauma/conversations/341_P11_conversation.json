    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sam?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. Reliving that moment in the hospital when my grandmother passed away... it's overwhelming. I can still hear the beeping of the machines, you know? And the smell of antiseptic... it's like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: What stood out most to you this time?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. Watching the doctors and nurses rushing around, knowing there was nothing I could do. I felt so small, so... useless. And guilty, because part of me just wanted it to be over, even though that meant losing her.",
    "Therapist: How did your body react during the exposure?",
    "Client: My heart was racing. I could feel my palms getting sweaty, and there was this tightness in my chest. It's like my body forgets it's not actually happening right now.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. How are those sensations now?",
    "Client: They're... fading, I guess. Slowly. But I still feel on edge, like I'm waiting for something bad to happen.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how I should have been there more often. Maybe if I'd visited more, talked to the doctors more... I don't know. It's irrational, but I can't shake the feeling that I let her down somehow.",
    "Therapist: How does that belief impact your daily life?",
    "Client: It... it makes me hesitant to get close to people. Like, if I care too much, I'll just end up failing them too. And hospitals... I can barely even look at one without feeling panicky.",
    "Therapist: What have you noticed about your reactions over the course of our sessions?",
    "Client: I... I think they're getting a bit easier to manage. The first time we did this, I felt like I couldn't breathe afterward. Now, it's still intense, but... I don't feel as out of control, if that makes sense?",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress, Sam. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: It's... encouraging, I guess. But also scary? Like, part of me feels like I shouldn't be getting better, like it's disrespectful to her memory or something.",
    "Therapist: Can you elaborate on that feeling?",
    "Client: It's... it's like if I move on, if I stop feeling this pain, then I'm forgetting her. And she deserves to be remembered, you know? But at the same time, I'm so tired of feeling this way. I want to be able to think about her and smile, not... not feel like this.",
    "Therapist: How might your grandmother feel about your healing?",
    "Client: I... I never thought about it that way. She always wanted me to be happy. She'd probably be upset to know how much this has affected me. But it's hard to let go of the guilt.",
    "Therapist: What small step could you take this week towards healing?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I could look at some old photos of her? The happy ones, from before she got sick. I've been avoiding them, but... maybe it would help to remember the good times.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful approach. How do you feel about trying that?",
    "Client: Nervous, but... I think I'm ready to try. It's time to start remembering her life, not just... not just how it ended.",
    "Therapist: That's a brave decision, Sam. Shall we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Thank you for... for guiding me through this. It's tough, but I think it's helping. I just hope I can keep making progress.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work, Sam. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, definitely. Thanks again, Dr. Thompson. I'll... I'll try to look at those photos before our next session."
