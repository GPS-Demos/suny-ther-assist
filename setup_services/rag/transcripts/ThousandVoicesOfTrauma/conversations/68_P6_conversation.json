    "Therapist: Alright, Amira. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's perfectly normal. Let's begin. Close your eyes and take us back to that night of the home invasion.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in my bed, it's late at night. The house is quiet, and I can hear the clock ticking in the hallway. Suddenly, there's a loud crash downstairs. My heart starts racing immediately. I... I can feel my hands shaking even now as I remember it.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 5. It's uncomfortable, but manageable.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: I get out of bed, my legs feel wobbly. As I approach the bedroom door, I hear footsteps coming up the stairs. They're heavy, unfamiliar. I'm frozen in place, my throat feels tight. I can't even call out for help.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Maybe a 7 now. My palms are sweating just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The footsteps are getting closer. I can hear them creaking on the floorboards right outside my door. My heart is pounding so hard, I'm sure they can hear it. I'm trembling all over, and I feel like I can't breathe properly. The doorknob starts to turn...",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Amira. Stay with it.",
    "Client: The door opens slowly, and I see a shadow. A tall figure enters the room. I can smell cigarette smoke. I want to scream, but no sound comes out. I'm paralyzed with fear. The intruder comes closer, and I can see the glint of something metallic in their hand...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm right back there. My chest feels so tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) The intruder reaches out towards me, and I finally find my voice. I scream as loud as I can. They startle and step back. I hear shouts from outside - my neighbors must have heard me. The intruder panics and runs out of the room. I hear them thundering down the stairs and then the sound of breaking glass as they escape through a window.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7 now. I still feel shaky, but the worst has passed.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Let's continue.",
    "Client: I'm sitting on my bed, trembling. I can hear sirens in the distance getting closer. My neighbor is calling my name from outside. I want to respond, but I'm still so scared. What if the intruder comes back? I wrap my arms around myself, trying to stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6. I'm starting to feel a little calmer, but still on edge.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this well.",
    "Client: The police arrive, and I hear them downstairs. A female officer comes to check on me. She's kind, asks if I'm hurt. I shake my head, unable to speak. She sits with me, tells me I'm safe now. I start crying, the shock and fear finally releasing.",
    "Therapist: How about now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's a 5 again. Remembering the officer's kindness helps.",
    "Therapist: You've done an excellent job, Amira. Let's start winding down.",
    "Client: Okay. As I open my eyes and come back to the present, I feel... drained, but also a bit relieved. It's like I've faced the memory and survived it all over again.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. How would you rate your SUDS now?",
    "Client: I'd say it's down to a 3. I feel much calmer now.",
    "Therapist: Wonderful. You've shown incredible strength today."
