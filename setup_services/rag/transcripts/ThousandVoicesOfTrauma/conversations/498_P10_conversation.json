    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is terrified. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: Uh, probably around a 60? Yeah, 60.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I guess so. Yeah, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see the refugee camp. It's crowded, noisy. I can smell sweat and dust in the air. I'm standing in line for food, my stomach growling. The sun is beating down, and I'm so thirsty.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: A man approaches me. He's tall, with a beard. He says he can help me get extra rations if I come with him. I'm hesitant, but... God, I'm so hungry.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Scared. Desperate. I... I follow him behind a tent. My heart's pounding.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe 75?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he grabs my arm. His grip is so tight. I can feel his breath on my neck. I try to pull away, but he's too strong. I'm frozen, I can't... I can't move.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're safe here.",
    "Client: He's... he's touching me. I want to scream, but no sound comes out. I feel... God, I feel so ashamed. Why can't I fight back?",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I hear people nearby, but they can't see us. I smell his sweat, it's making me nauseous. I close my eyes, trying to block it out.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's 90. I can't... I can't do this.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm... I'm trying. He's... he's hurting me. I feel pain, shame, disgust. I want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: It feels like forever, but finally, he lets go. I collapse to the ground. I can hear him zipping up his pants, laughing. He... he throws some extra food at me and walks away.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Dirty. Used. I... I can't stop shaking. I want to cry, but the tears won't come.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Let's take a moment. Breathe with me.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... I'm... I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I slowly get up. My body hurts. I grab the food and stumble back to my tent. I feel numb.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I can't believe this happened. I feel so stupid for trusting him. I want to tell someone, but who would believe me? Who would care?",
    "Therapist: Those are common thoughts. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 85?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going. What happens when you get back to your tent?",
    "Client: I... I curl up in the corner. I can still feel his hands on me. I want to scrub my skin off, but there's no water. I feel so alone, so trapped.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I hear children playing outside. It makes me feel even worse. I've lost something I can never get back. I feel... I feel broken.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My heart's racing. But... but I also feel a strange relief. Like I'm not carrying this alone anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe 70?",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's continue. What happens in the following days?",
    "Client: I... I avoid everyone. I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see his face. I'm constantly on edge, jumping at every sound.",
    "Therapist: How does this affect your daily life in the camp?",
    "Client: I... I stop going for food. I can't bear the thought of seeing him again. I'm hungry all the time, but the hunger feels better than the fear.",
    "Therapist: What do you tell yourself during this time?",
    "Client: That... that it's my fault. That I should have known better. That I'm weak, worthless. I... I start to think maybe I deserved it.",
    "Therapist: Those are common thoughts, but they're not true. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm angry. At him, at myself, at the whole situation. Why did this have to happen to me?",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel angry. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 65 now. The anger feels... safer than the fear.",
    "Therapist: Understood. Let's continue. How do you cope in the weeks that follow?",
    "Client: I... I start to withdraw more. I barely leave my tent. I lose weight, but I don't care. I feel... I feel like a ghost.",
    "Therapist: What do you wish you could have done differently?",
    "Client: I... I wish I had fought back. Screamed. Told someone. But... but I know now that it wasn't my fault. I was just trying to survive.",
    "Therapist: That's a very important realization. How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix. Part of me feels relieved, but another part still feels guilty. Like I'm making excuses.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 55. I feel drained, but... but also a little lighter.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's keep going. How does this experience affect your relationships with others in the camp?",
    "Client: I... I push everyone away. I can't trust anyone. Every time someone tries to help me, I see his face. I feel so isolated.",
    "Therapist: That must have been very difficult. What do you wish others knew?",
    "Client: I... I wish they knew how much I was hurting. How much I needed help, even though I couldn't ask for it. I wish someone had noticed.",
    "Therapist: Those are powerful feelings. How are you doing right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. But I also feel like I'm starting to understand myself better. It's... it's strange.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 50 now. I feel... I feel more in control.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's continue. How does this experience affect your plans for the future?",
    "Client: I... I stop hoping. Before, I had dreams of a better life, of escaping the camp. But after... after this, I feel stuck. Like I'll never be free.",
    "Therapist: That sounds very challenging. How do you see yourself now, compared to before the incident?",
    "Client: I... I feel older. Harder. Like I've lost something I can never get back. But... but also like I'm a survivor. I'm still here, despite everything.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's bittersweet. I'm proud of my strength, but sad for what I've lost. It's complicated.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 45. I feel... I feel more grounded.",
    "Therapist: You're doing very well. Let's wrap up the exposure. Take a few deep breaths and slowly bring yourself back to the present.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... I'm... I'm here.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. But also... also kind of relieved? Like I've let go of something heavy.",
    "Therapist: That's common after an exposure session. What's your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 40 now. I feel drained, but... but okay.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today, John. How do you feel about what we've accomplished?",
    "Client: I... I feel proud. It was hard, but... but I did it. I faced it. And I... I feel like I understand myself better now.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Remember to be kind to yourself for the rest of the day. Do you have any questions before we end?",
    "Client: No, I... I think I'm okay. Thank you for... for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, John. You've shown incredible strength today. We'll continue to work through this in our future sessions. Take care."
