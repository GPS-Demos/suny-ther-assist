    "Therapist: Welcome, Amir. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling a bit jittery, to be honest. It's not easy to talk about this stuff.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with your SUDS level.",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 5 or 6 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath and begin when you're ready.",
    "Client: Alright... So, I'm at the park near my house. It's a warm day, and I can feel the sun on my skin. I'm walking along the path, just trying to clear my head after another argument with my dad. The trees are rustling in the breeze, and I can hear kids playing in the distance. I'm... I'm not really paying attention to my surroundings, just lost in thought.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay in the moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear a growl. It's low, but close. I snap out of my daze and see this massive dog, maybe a Rottweiler or something, just a few feet away. Its teeth are bared, and it's staring right at me. My heart starts racing, and I can feel my palms getting sweaty. I... I don't know what to do. I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe a 7?",
    "Therapist: Okay. Keep going. You're doing well.",
    "Client: The dog lunges at me. I try to back away, but I stumble and fall. I can feel the rough gravel path scraping my hands. The dog's on top of me in seconds. I can smell its hot breath, feel its weight on my chest. I'm... I'm screaming, but it feels like no sound is coming out. Its jaws are snapping, getting closer to my face. I'm trying to push it off, but it's so strong. I can't... I can't breathe...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Amir. You're safe here. What's happening in your body?",
    "Client: My... my heart's pounding. I feel like I can't get enough air. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: Focus on your breath. In through your nose, out through your mouth. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. Someone hears me. An older man comes running. He's yelling at the dog, trying to pull it off me. But the dog's not letting go. It's teeth sink into my arm, and I feel this searing pain. I'm crying now, begging for help. The man finally manages to get the dog off me, but I'm... I'm just lying there, shaking. I can see blood on my arm, on my shirt. Everything feels hazy, like it's not real.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Amir. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. Maybe an 8 or 9.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here in this room. Feel your feet on the floor. What happens next?",
    "Client: People are gathering around. Someone's calling an ambulance. I can hear sirens in the distance. The man who helped me is trying to talk to me, but I can't focus on what he's saying. My arm is throbbing, and I feel nauseous. I'm... I'm scared I might pass out. I keep thinking about how my parents are going to react. They're always telling me to be more careful, and now this...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I... I feel so stupid. So helpless. Like a kid who can't take care of himself. I should've been paying attention. I should've been able to fight off the dog. But I just... froze. I couldn't do anything.",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault, Amir. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Still shaky. My heart's racing. But... maybe a little better. SUDS is probably back to a 7.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going. What happens when the ambulance arrives?",
    "Client: The paramedics are asking me questions, but I'm having trouble focusing. They're examining my arm, cleaning the wound. It stings, and I wince. They're saying something about stitches, about going to the hospital. I'm nodding, but I feel disconnected, like I'm watching this happen to someone else. They help me onto a stretcher, and as they're lifting me into the ambulance, I catch a glimpse of the park. It looks so normal, so peaceful. How could this have happened here?",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling as you're in the ambulance?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm scared. Embarrassed. I keep replaying the attack in my head, thinking of what I could've done differently. The paramedic is trying to distract me, asking about my family, but I can barely answer. I'm worried about how my parents will react. They're always criticizing me, and now I've given them another reason.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those thoughts. What else?",
    "Client: I... I feel so alone. Even with the paramedic there, I feel isolated. Like no one can really understand what just happened to me. I'm dreading having to explain this to everyone, having to relive it over and over. And... and I'm angry. At the dog, at its owner, at myself for not being more aware. It's all mixed up inside me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Amir. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still pretty high. Maybe an 8.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: We arrive at the hospital. Everything's a blur of bright lights and unfamiliar faces. They take me to a room, and a doctor comes in to examine me. He's talking about rabies shots, about the risk of infection. I'm only half-listening. I'm still in shock, I think. They clean the wound again, and it hurts even more this time. I grit my teeth, trying not to cry out. I don't want to seem weak, but I can feel tears in my eyes.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel pain, Amir. How are you coping?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm trying to stay calm, but it's hard. My mind keeps going back to the park, to the dog's teeth, to the feeling of helplessness. The doctor's asking if there's anyone they can call for me. I hesitate before giving them my parents' number. I'm dreading their reaction, but I also desperately want someone familiar here.",
    "Therapist: What happens when your parents arrive?",
    "Client: My mom rushes in first. She looks terrified. My dad follows, his face a mix of concern and... something else. Disappointment, maybe? Mom's hugging me, asking a million questions. Dad's talking to the doctor, his voice low and serious. I can see him shaking his head, and I feel this wave of shame wash over me. Even now, even after all this, I feel like I've let them down somehow.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: It... it hurts. More than the physical pain. I want them to just hold me, to tell me it's not my fault. But instead, I can see the judgment in my dad's eyes. Mom's fussing over me, but it feels suffocating. I just want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid, Amir. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe a 7 or 8.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The doctor comes back with the rabies shots. He explains the process, but I'm barely listening. I'm just nodding, wanting it to be over. The first shot stings, and I flinch. Mom squeezes my hand, but I can hear Dad sighing. It's like... like he thinks I should be tougher or something. I close my eyes, trying to block everything out. But all I can see is the dog, its teeth, the look in its eyes...",
    "Therapist: Stay present, Amir. Focus on your breath.",
    "Client: Right... okay. I'm trying. The doctor's finishing up, giving instructions for aftercare. Mom's taking notes, asking questions. Dad's just standing there, arms crossed. I feel so small, so vulnerable. I want to explain, to defend myself, but the words won't come. I'm exhausted, physically and emotionally.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: They discharge me. The car ride home is mostly silent. Mom keeps glancing back at me, worried. Dad's grip on the steering wheel is tight. I'm staring out the window, but I'm not really seeing anything. My arm throbs, a constant reminder. I keep thinking about how this will change things. Will I be afraid to go to the park now? Will I flinch every time I see a dog? It feels like something fundamental has shifted, and I don't know how to process it.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, Amir?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. Physically and emotionally. My SUDS is probably down to a 6, but I feel... hollow. Like this experience has carved something out of me.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You've been through a lot. How about we start wrapping up?",
    "Client: Yeah... okay. We get home, and I go straight to my room. I can hear my parents talking in low voices downstairs. I'm lying on my bed, staring at the ceiling. The attack keeps replaying in my mind, but it's starting to feel less vivid, more like a bad dream. I'm exhausted, but I'm afraid to close my eyes. Afraid of what I might see when I do.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today, Amir. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. But also a bit relieved, I guess. Talking about it... it's hard, but it helps somehow. My SUDS is probably down to a 5 now.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's take a few deep breaths together to close the session.",
    "Client: Okay... *takes deep breaths* Thank you. This... this helps.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Amir. We'll continue working through this together."

I grit my teeth, trying not to cry out. I don't want to seem weak, but I can feel tears in my eyes.",

The doctor's asking if there's anyone they can call for me. I hesitate before giving them my parents' number. I'm dreading their reaction, but I also desperately want someone familiar here."
