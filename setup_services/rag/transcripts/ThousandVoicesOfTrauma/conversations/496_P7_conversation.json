    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Can you describe the car accident for me?",
    "Client: Okay... I was driving home from a late-night study session at the library. It was dark, and I remember feeling tired. I was on the highway, and suddenly... I saw headlights coming straight at me in my lane. My heart started racing, and I...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I tried to swerve, but it all happened so fast. There was a loud crash, and I felt my car spinning. The airbag deployed, hitting me in the face. I couldn't breathe. I was so scared, thinking I was going to die. The car finally stopped, and I was just sitting there, shaking.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I smell gasoline. And there's this ringing in my ears. My chest hurts from the airbag, and I taste blood in my mouth. I'm trying to move, but my body feels heavy. I'm panicking, thinking the car might explode.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: I hear people shouting outside. Someone's asking if I'm okay, but I can't respond. I'm just frozen. Then I hear sirens in the distance, getting closer. I'm starting to feel dizzy, and my vision is blurry. I'm so scared and confused.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: The paramedics arrive, and they're trying to get me out of the car. They're asking me questions, but I can barely speak. I'm in so much pain. They put a neck brace on me and carefully move me onto a stretcher. I remember looking up at the night sky as they wheeled me to the ambulance, thinking how surreal it all felt.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: In the ambulance, everything's a blur. The lights are so bright, and there are so many noises. They're hooking me up to machines, and I hear them talking about my vitals. I keep thinking about my parents, how worried they'll be. I'm trying not to cry, but I can't help it. I feel so alone and scared.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. You're safe now.",
    "Client: At the hospital, it's all a rush of doctors and nurses. They're cutting off my clothes, doing scans, asking me questions. I'm in and out of consciousness. The pain is intense, and I'm terrified of what injuries I might have. I keep seeing flashes of the accident, the headlights coming at me. It's like it's happening all over again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job describing this. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I... I feel shaky. My heart's racing, just like it did that night. I can almost feel the pain again. It's hard to talk about this, but... I also feel a bit relieved. Like I'm finally letting it out.",
    "Therapist: That's completely normal. You're making great progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still so vivid in my mind. The aftermath was tough too. The physical recovery, the nightmares, the fear of getting back in a car. Sometimes I still have flashbacks when I'm driving, especially at night. But talking about it... it helps. It's like I'm starting to process it all.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: I think I can keep going. It's hard, but I want to work through this. I don't want this accident to control my life anymore. There's more I haven't talked about yet, like the guilt I feel...",
    "Therapist: Take your time. We're here to work through this together.",
    "Client: The guilt... it's because the other driver didn't make it. I survived, and they didn't. I know logically it wasn't my fault, but I can't help thinking about their family, their life cut short. It haunts me. Every time I drive past that stretch of highway, I think about them. I wonder if there was anything I could have done differently.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to have those feelings. You're being very courageous.",
    "Client: Sometimes I have these intrusive thoughts, like what if I had left the library five minutes later? Or what if I had taken a different route home? It's exhausting, constantly second-guessing everything. And then there's the anxiety about driving. I've become so hyper-vigilant on the road, always expecting the worst to happen.",
    "Therapist: You're doing a great job identifying these thoughts and feelings.",
    "Client: It's affected my studies too. I used to be able to focus easily, but now my mind wanders. I'll be in the middle of a lecture and suddenly I'm back in that car, reliving the accident. It's frustrating because I feel like I'm falling behind, but I don't want to explain to my professors what happened. I'm afraid they'll think I'm making excuses.",
    "Therapist: It's important to acknowledge these challenges. How else has this impacted you?",
    "Client: Well, it's changed my relationships. I've become more withdrawn. My friends don't really understand why I'm hesitant to go out, especially if it involves driving at night. I feel like I'm pushing people away, but at the same time, I'm scared of losing them. And dating? That feels impossible right now. How do I explain all of this to someone new?",
    "Therapist: You're showing great insight into how this has affected you. Keep going.",
    "Client: I guess... I'm just tired of feeling this way. Tired of being afraid, tired of the nightmares, tired of feeling like I'm not in control of my own life. But being here, talking about it... it gives me hope. Maybe I can work through this. Maybe I can feel normal again someday.",
    "Therapist: That hope is important. You're making significant progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. It means a lot to hear that. I know it's a long road ahead, but I'm committed to this process. I want to get better. I want to be able to drive without panic, to sleep without nightmares, to enjoy life again without this constant shadow hanging over me. It's hard work, but I'm starting to believe it's possible.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is admirable. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but in a good way. Like I've released something that's been bottled up for so long. There's still a lot to work through, but I feel a bit lighter. More hopeful. And grateful, really grateful for this space to talk about it all.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Let's wrap up and discuss how you're feeling."
