    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Carlos?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. It's a lot to process. Going back to that time when I was diagnosed with cancer, it's like I'm reliving all those emotions again. The fear, the uncertainty, it's all coming back.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The moment the doctor told me. I can still see his face, you know? He looked so serious, and I remember thinking, \"This is it. This is how it ends.\" It's like I could feel the floor disappearing beneath me.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was intense. I felt my heart racing, just like it did back then. But... it's strange. It wasn't as overwhelming as I thought it would be. I mean, it was still difficult, but I felt more... in control, I guess?",
    "Therapist: Interesting. Can you say more about that?",
    "Client: Well, I think... I think it's because I know how the story ends now, you know? I survived. I'm here. Back then, everything was unknown, and that was terrifying. But now, even though I'm remembering those feelings, there's a part of me that knows I made it through.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight, Carlos.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess it is. It's like... the memory still hurts, but it doesn't have the same power over me anymore. Is that... is that normal?",
    "Therapist: What do you think?",
    "Client: I think... maybe it's a good thing? Like, maybe it means I'm starting to process what happened instead of just trying to avoid thinking about it all the time.",
    "Therapist: How does that relate to your PTSD symptoms?",
    "Client: Oh, wow. I hadn't thought about that. I guess... maybe that's why I've been having fewer nightmares lately? And why I don't feel as jumpy when I go for my check-ups at the hospital. It's like, by facing the memory head-on, I'm taking some of its power away.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress, Carlos.",
    "Client: Thanks. It doesn't always feel like progress, you know? Sometimes it just feels hard. But I guess that's part of the process, right?",
    "Therapist: Indeed. What's helping you push through?",
    "Client: My family, definitely. Seeing how proud they are of me for doing this therapy... it keeps me going. And, I don't know, maybe I'm also doing it for myself? To prove that I can face this, that I'm stronger than my fears.",
    "Therapist: That's very courageous. How can we build on this?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I need to remind myself of this feeling more often. That even though remembering is hard, it's also helping me heal. And maybe... maybe I could try talking to my wife more about what I'm going through in therapy? I've been keeping a lot of it to myself.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great next step.",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so too. It's scary, but... I'm ready to try. This whole process is teaching me that I can handle more than I thought I could.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. This session was... intense, but in a good way. I feel drained, but also... lighter? If that makes sense. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Carlos. Take care."
