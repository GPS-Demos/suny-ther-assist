    "Therapist: Good morning, Mr. Johnson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Morning, Dr. Carter. I'm... well, I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. This whole imaginal exposure thing you mentioned last time has been on my mind all week. I've been tossing and turning at night, wondering what it'll be like to revisit that awful experience in the hospital.",
    "Therapist: I understand. It's natural to feel anxious. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: It's just... I've spent years trying to push those memories away. The idea of deliberately bringing them back feels... wrong, somehow. Like I'm inviting trouble. And at my age, haven't I been through enough already? I'm worried it might be too much for my heart to handle, you know?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How about we discuss the process briefly?",
    "Client: Alright, I suppose that might help. It's just that ever since my time in that hospital, when things went so terribly wrong with my surgery, I've felt like a prisoner in my own body. The fear, the helplessness... it's all still so vivid. And now, with my depression on top of everything else, I sometimes wonder if I'll ever feel truly free again.",
    "Therapist: I hear you. This exercise aims to help you process those memories safely.",
    "Client: Process them? I'm not sure I understand. How can reliving that nightmare possibly help me? I mean, I'm already dealing with so much - my divorce, retirement, moving into this shared living situation. It feels like I'm barely keeping my head above water as it is.",
    "Therapist: By facing the memory, we can reduce its power over you. How does that sound?",
    "Client: I... I suppose that makes some sense. But I'm still scared. What if I completely fall apart during this? I'm not as young as I used to be, and my emotions sometimes get the better of me these days. Plus, with my depression, I worry that diving into these traumatic memories might push me over the edge.",
    "Therapist: Your strength is evident. We'll go at your pace and pause if needed.",
    "Client: That's... reassuring, I guess. But what exactly will happen during this imaginal exposure? Will I have to act it out? Or will you hypnotize me or something? I've never done anything like this before, and to be honest, the unknown is pretty terrifying.",
    "Therapist: You'll simply describe the memory aloud. I'll guide you through it gently.",
    "Client: Oh, I see. That doesn't sound quite as scary as what I was imagining. But still, talking about it out loud... that's going to be tough. I've barely even allowed myself to think about it, let alone discuss it in detail. What if I can't find the words? Or what if I start and then can't stop crying?",
    "Therapist: It's okay to cry. Your emotions are welcome here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm ready. Or as ready as I'll ever be, anyway. Just... promise me you won't let me get too lost in there, okay? I'm trusting you with some pretty dark stuff here, Doc. It's not easy for a man my age to be this vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: I promise. Your trust means a lot. Let's start when you're comfortable.",
    "Client: Alright. Here goes nothing, I guess. Where should I start? The day of the surgery? Or when I first woke up and realized something had gone wrong?"
