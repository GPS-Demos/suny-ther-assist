    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. After last week's session, I found myself thinking about that day more often. It's like opening a door I've kept shut for years.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to work through this together. Are you ready to begin the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Though part of me wants to run out that door right now. (nervous chuckle)",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. We'll go at your pace. Can you describe where you were when the incident began?",
    "Client: Right, okay... (deep breath) I was at the corner of Main and Oak. It was a sunny afternoon, probably around 3 PM. I remember because I'd just finished a late lunch meeting.",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: There's a small caf\u00e9 on the corner, tables outside with colorful umbrellas. People are chatting, enjoying their coffee. The traffic light changes, and I start to cross the street.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear... I hear tires screeching. Loud, like a banshee wail. My head snaps towards the sound, and I see this red sports car barreling down the road. It's... it's not slowing down.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: My heart's racing. I'm frozen in place, can't move my legs. I... I see a woman pushing a stroller into the crosswalk. She doesn't see the car coming.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 60. My palms are sweating.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Remember, you're safe here. Take a deep breath. What happens next?",
    "Client: The car's getting closer. I want to shout, to warn her, but my voice is stuck. It's like I'm watching a movie in slow motion. The woman looks up, finally sees the car. Her eyes go wide with terror.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What do you see, hear, feel?",
    "Client: I hear people screaming. The woman tries to push the stroller out of the way, but it's too late. The car... oh God, the car hits them. There's a sickening thud, and the stroller goes flying. The woman... she's tossed like a rag doll.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. You're doing well. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 80. My chest feels tight. I can't... I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Let's pause for a moment. Focus on my voice. You're safe here in the office. Take slow, deep breaths.",
    "Client: (audible deep breaths) Okay... okay, I'm... I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue describing what you see.",
    "Client: The car... it keeps going. Doesn't even slow down. People are rushing to the woman and the stroller. I finally find my legs and run over. The woman... there's so much blood. Her leg is bent at an impossible angle.",
    "Therapist: What are you doing in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm kneeling beside her. My hands are shaking as I check for a pulse. Someone's shouting to call an ambulance. I hear a baby crying - thank God, the baby's alive.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, in this memory?",
    "Client: Helpless. Utterly helpless. I'm a professional, I'm supposed to know what to do, but I'm just... frozen. The woman's eyes are open, staring blankly. I... I think she's dead.",
    "Therapist: That's a heavy burden to carry. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's at 90. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. Remember, you're here in a safe place. Can you tell me three things you see in this room right now?",
    "Client: I... I see the green plant in the corner. The painting on the wall. Your blue tie.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, can you continue with what happened next?",
    "Client: The ambulance arrives. Paramedics push me aside. They're working on the woman, but I can tell from their faces it's... it's too late. One of them goes to the baby. There's a crowd gathering, people with phones out, filming. It makes me sick.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking at this moment?",
    "Client: I keep replaying it in my head. If I'd shouted sooner, moved faster... maybe I could have saved her. I feel... I feel responsible somehow.",
    "Therapist: It's common to feel that way, but remember, you weren't driving the car. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 85. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing well. What happens after the paramedics arrive?",
    "Client: The police show up. They're asking questions, taking statements. I tell them what I saw, but it feels... inadequate. Like I'm leaving something out. The baby's still crying. I can't get that sound out of my head.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What does it bring up for you?",
    "Client: Guilt. Overwhelming guilt. I... I lost my wife a few years back. Seeing that baby, knowing it'll grow up without its mother... it's tearing me apart.",
    "Therapist: That's a profound connection you're making. How does your body feel as you think about this?",
    "Client: Heavy. Like there's a weight on my chest. My throat feels tight, like I'm choking back tears.",
    "Therapist: Allow yourself to feel those emotions. They're a natural response to what you experienced.",
    "Client: (voice breaking) I... I can't stop thinking about that woman's face. Her eyes, just... blank. And the baby's cries. It's like they're echoing in my head, even now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. What's your distress level right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still around 80. It's not getting any easier.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. This is difficult material. Can you tell me what happens next?",
    "Client: The scene starts to clear. The woman's body is covered, taken away. Someone from child services arrives for the baby. I give my contact information to the police. They say they might need to follow up.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel as you're leaving the scene?",
    "Client: Numb. Like I'm walking through a fog. The world seems... muted somehow. Colors aren't as bright. Sounds are distant. I can't shake the feeling that I should have done more.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction to trauma. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I don't go home. Can't face being alone. I walk for hours, just... wandering. End up in a bar, trying to drown out the images, the sounds. But it doesn't work. Nothing works.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you remember this?",
    "Client: Tense. My shoulders are up to my ears. There's this knot in my stomach that won't go away.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to breathe and relax your shoulders. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe 70? My heart's not racing as much.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this well. What happens in the days following the incident?",
    "Client: I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see that woman's face. I hear the screech of tires, the thud of impact. I... I start drinking more. Calling in sick to work. I can't focus on anything.",
    "Therapist: How does this impact your daily life?",
    "Client: It... it derails everything. I'm irritable, snapping at colleagues. I avoid that intersection, take long detours. I flinch at every car horn, every screeching brake. It's like... like I'm not really living, just going through the motions.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly challenging. How long does this acute phase last?",
    "Client: Weeks. Maybe months. I'm not sure. Time sort of... blurs together. I start seeing a therapist, but it's hard to talk about it. Hard to admit how much it's affecting me.",
    "Therapist: You're showing a lot of strength by addressing it now. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually down to about 60. Talking about it... it's hard, but it feels like... like I'm letting something go.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress, John. As we near the end of our session, can you tell me how you're feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. But there's also this sense of... I don't know, relief? Like I've been carrying this weight for so long, and now I'm finally starting to put it down.",
    "Therapist: That's a very positive sign. You've done incredibly well today. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end.",
    "Client: (audible deep breaths) Thank you. This... this wasn't easy, but I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: You've made significant progress. We'll continue to work through this together. How do you feel about trying this again in our next session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm nervous about it. But I also feel like I need to. Like it's time to face this head-on.",
    "Therapist: That's a brave attitude, John. We'll take it one step at a time. For now, remember to use the coping strategies we've discussed if you feel overwhelmed. Do you have any questions before we wrap up?",
    "Client: No, I... I think I'm okay. Just tired. Really tired.",
    "Therapist: That's normal after an intense session like this. Make sure to be kind to yourself for the rest of the day. I'll see you next week, John.",
    "Client: Thank you. See you next week."
