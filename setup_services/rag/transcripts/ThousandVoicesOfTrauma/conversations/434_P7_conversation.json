    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Johnson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit anxious, to be honest. I know we're going to discuss my workplace trauma, and I'm not sure if I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We'll take it step by step.",
    "Client: Okay. I guess we should start. It was about three months ago. I was working late at the office, finishing up a project. Most of my colleagues had already left for the day. I remember feeling proud of myself for being so dedicated, you know? But then...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: My supervisor came in. He's always been a bit... inappropriate, but I never thought he'd... He closed the door behind him and started making comments about my appearance. I felt so uncomfortable, but I didn't know what to do. I was frozen.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) He... he came closer and started touching me. I wanted to scream, to push him away, but I couldn't move. I felt so powerless. I keep replaying that moment in my head, wondering why I didn't do anything.",
    "Therapist: Stay with the memory. You're handling this bravely.",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) I can still feel his hands on me. The smell of his cologne. It makes me sick. I finally managed to push him away and run out of the office. I drove home crying, feeling so ashamed and violated.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The next day, I couldn't bring myself to go to work. I called in sick. I was terrified of seeing him again, of what he might do or say. I felt like my whole career was in jeopardy. How could I continue working there? But I also felt like I couldn't tell anyone. Who would believe me over him?",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those thoughts. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (wiping tears) I've been having nightmares ever since. Sometimes I wake up feeling like I'm back in that office, trapped. It's affecting my relationship with my husband too. I can't bear to be touched sometimes, and I haven't told him why. I feel so alone in this.",
    "Therapist: You're not alone. I'm here, listening.",
    "Client: I've been thinking about quitting my job, but it's not that simple. I've worked so hard to get where I am. Why should I have to give up my career because of what he did? But every time I walk into that building, I feel like I can't breathe. I'm constantly on edge, wondering if he'll try something again.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Keep expressing them.",
    "Client: I feel so angry, not just at him, but at myself too. Why didn't I report it immediately? Why didn't I fight back harder? I keep thinking about all the \"what ifs\". What if I had left work earlier that day? What if I had told someone right away? Maybe I could have prevented this from happening to someone else.",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. Continue sharing.",
    "Client: (sighing) I've been having trouble concentrating at work. My performance is suffering, and I'm worried my colleagues are noticing. I feel like I'm carrying this heavy secret that's weighing me down. Some days, I just want to scream and tell everyone what happened. Other days, I want to disappear and never have to face anyone again.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Keep going.",
    "Client: The worst part is, he's acting like nothing happened. He still tries to engage me in casual conversation, assigns me projects. It's like he's taunting me, knowing I won't say anything. Every time I see him, I feel this mix of fear and rage. I'm afraid of what he might do, but I'm also furious that he gets to go on with his life while I'm suffering.",
    "Therapist: Your anger is justified. You're doing well.",
    "Client: I've been considering reporting him, but I'm scared. What if no one believes me? What if I lose my job? I've worked so hard to get to this position, and the thought of starting over terrifies me. But at the same time, I don't know how much longer I can keep going on like this. It's eating me up inside.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. You're very brave.",
    "Client: (voice breaking) Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel normal again. Will I always feel this way? Scared, angry, ashamed? I want my life back. I want to feel safe at work, to enjoy my job again. I want to be able to be close to my husband without flinching. I just want to be me again.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You will heal.",
    "Client: Thank you for listening. I've never said all of this out loud before. It's painful, but... I think I needed to get it out. I'm exhausted, but I also feel a tiny bit lighter. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's completely normal. You've done remarkably well today.",
    "Client: I'm glad to hear that. I was worried I wasn't doing this right. It's hard to talk about, but I think I want to keep working on this. Maybe... maybe it will help me move forward. Do you think there's hope for me to get past this?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You've shown incredible resilience.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think I need a moment to collect myself. This has been intense, but I'm grateful for the opportunity to share. I hope that with time and more sessions like this, I can start to feel more like myself again. It's a long road ahead, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: It is, but you're making progress. We'll end here for today."
