    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I'm back there, you know? In that hallway at school, with all those eyes on me. I can almost smell the musty lockers and hear the whispers.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Shame. Overwhelming shame. It's like a heavy blanket wrapped around me, suffocating me. I feel so small, so... insignificant. Like I don't belong anywhere.",
    "Therapist: Where do you feel that shame in your body?",
    "Client: It's in my chest, mostly. It's tight, like someone's squeezing my lungs. And my face feels hot, probably because I'm blushing. I always blushed so easily back then, which only made things worse.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep hearing their words... \"Go back to where you came from,\" \"ching chong,\" all those stupid, hurtful things. And I'm thinking... maybe they were right. Maybe I don't belong here. Even now, decades later, I sometimes feel like an outsider in my own country.",
    "Therapist: How does that belief impact you today?",
    "Client: It... it makes me hesitant to put myself out there. In my business, in relationships. I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop, you know? For someone to point out that I don't fit in. It's exhausting, always being on guard like that.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm angry. Not just at those kids from school, but at myself. Why didn't I stand up for myself? Why did I just take it? I wish I could go back and tell that young girl that she has value, that she deserves respect.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to acknowledge that anger?",
    "Client: It's... surprisingly empowering. Like maybe I'm finally giving myself permission to feel it. But it's also scary. I've spent so long trying to be the \"model minority,\" you know? Always polite, never rocking the boat. Feeling angry feels... dangerous somehow.",
    "Therapist: Can you say more about that?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... if I let myself be angry, I'm confirming their stereotypes. The \"angry Asian woman.\" But at the same time, I'm tired of swallowing my feelings to make others comfortable. It's a constant battle between wanting to stand up for myself and not wanting to draw attention.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your anxiety?",
    "Client: Oh, it's definitely connected. I'm always hypervigilant, always watching for signs that I'm not welcome or that someone's judging me. It's exhausting. And when my anxiety spikes, all those old feelings of shame and inadequacy come flooding back.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in those moments?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to hide away, to make myself invisible. But another part... another part wants to stand tall, to look people in the eye and dare them to say something. I guess I need to find a balance between those two extremes.",
    "Therapist: How might you start to find that balance?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe by acknowledging these feelings instead of pushing them down. By reminding myself that I have a right to be here, to take up space. And maybe by connecting more with my culture, finding pride in my heritage instead of shame.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a powerful shift. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also a bit lighter. Like I've set down a burden I've been carrying for a long time. It's scary, but also... freeing, in a way. I think I've spent so long trying to forget or minimize what happened, but maybe facing it head-on is the way forward.",
    "Therapist: What's one thing you can do this week to nurture that feeling?",
    "Client: I think... I might reach out to some other Asian American friends. Share some of these feelings. Maybe even look into some community groups. I've always avoided that, afraid it would make me stand out more. But maybe it's time to embrace that part of myself instead of hiding it.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great step. How does it feel to consider that?",
    "Client: It's nerve-wracking, to be honest. But also exciting. Like I'm reclaiming a part of myself that I've kept hidden for so long. And maybe... maybe by doing that, I can start to heal some of these old wounds. It won't erase what happened, but it might help me move forward.",
    "Therapist: You've shown a lot of courage today. How would you like to close our session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to take a moment to just breathe. To sit with these feelings without judgment. And maybe... maybe to say thank you to that young girl who endured so much. She was stronger than she knew, and I'm starting to see that now.",
    "Therapist: That's a beautiful way to end. Let's take that moment together."
