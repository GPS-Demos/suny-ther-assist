    "Therapist: Welcome, Fatima. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Oh, you know... I'm a bit on edge. These sessions always stir up so much. But I suppose that's the point, isn't it? (nervous chuckle)",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel that way. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's get on with it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I'm at the park. It's a beautiful spring day. The trees are in bloom, and there are children playing nearby. I can hear their laughter. My husband, Ahmed, is sitting on a bench reading his newspaper. Everything seems so... normal.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm walking along the path, enjoying the sunshine. Then I hear... oh, Allah... I hear growling. It's coming from behind some bushes. I freeze, my heart starting to race.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 6. I can feel my palms getting sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. What do you see next?",
    "Client: Suddenly, this massive dog bursts out of the bushes. It's snarling, foam at its mouth. And it's charging straight for a little girl who's playing nearby. Oh, ya Allah... (voice trembling)",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay in the moment.",
    "Client: The girl screams. Everyone's screaming. I can't move. I want to do something, but I'm paralyzed. The dog... it's on her in seconds. Teeth flashing, snarling... (starts breathing heavily)",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) Okay... okay. The girl's father comes running. He's yelling, trying to get the dog off. But it won't let go. There's blood... so much blood. I can smell it, metallic and sharp in the air.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe 9. Ya Allah, it's like I'm right there again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Fatima. Remember, you're here in my office. You're safe.",
    "Client: Right... safe. (takes another deep breath) The park keeper finally comes with a catch pole. He's struggling to control the dog. It's still snarling, snapping. The girl is just... lying there. So still. Her father is sobbing, holding her.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: Helpless. Terrified. Angry that I couldn't do anything. I keep thinking, \"What if that was my granddaughter?\" The guilt... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. You couldn't have known.",
    "Client: I know, but... (sighs) The ambulance arrives. The sirens are so loud, cutting through all the chaos. They're working on the girl, but there's so much blood. I can't look away. I should look away, but I can't.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: They load her into the ambulance. Her father goes with her. The dog is finally subdued, being taken away. And then... it's quiet. Too quiet. Like the whole world just stopped.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel in your body right now?",
    "Client: Tense. My shoulders are so tight they hurt. My stomach is in knots. I feel... I feel sick.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm here. I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Ahmed comes to me. He's talking, but I can't hear him. It's like I'm underwater. Everything's muffled. He leads me to a bench, and I just... collapse. I'm shaking. I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's still high... maybe an 8. But it feels different now. More... hollow.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Keep going.",
    "Client: We sit there for what feels like hours. People are talking, police are everywhere. But it all feels so distant. I keep seeing the girl's face, hearing her scream. It plays over and over in my mind.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Fatima. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: I... I start to cry. Not loudly, just... tears rolling down my face. I can't stop them. Ahmed holds me, but I feel so... disconnected. Like I'm watching myself from far away.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction to trauma. How does your body feel now?",
    "Client: Heavy. So heavy. Like I could sink right through this chair. And cold... I feel cold, even though it was warm that day.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to acknowledge those sensations. They're part of the memory, but they're not happening now.",
    "Client: (nods slowly) You're right. It's... it's just a memory. But it feels so real.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. What happens as you start to leave the park?",
    "Client: Ahmed helps me up. My legs are shaky. We walk slowly... so slowly. Every step feels like a mile. People are staring. I want to disappear. The park... it doesn't look the same anymore. It's like all the color has been drained out of it.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level as you're leaving?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe a 6 now. But I feel... hollow. Empty.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. Keep going.",
    "Client: We get to the car. Ahmed opens the door for me, but I just... stand there. I can't seem to make myself get in. It's like my body won't listen to my brain.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (inhales deeply) Okay... I finally get in. The car feels too small, too confined. I roll down the window, needing air. As we drive away, I keep looking back. Like... like I'm leaving something behind.",
    "Therapist: What do you think you're leaving behind?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. My sense of safety, maybe? The world just doesn't feel the same anymore. It's like a veil has been lifted, and now I see danger everywhere.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after trauma. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired. So, so tired. Like I could sleep for days. But also... wired. Like I need to be on alert all the time.",
    "Therapist: Your body is processing a lot. It's normal to feel that way.",
    "Client: We get home, and I just... sit. I can't move. Ahmed makes tea, but I can't drink it. The smell... it reminds me of the metallic scent of blood. I push it away.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 5. I'm starting to feel more... present. But also more sad.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Let yourself feel that sadness.",
    "Client: I start to cry again. Really cry this time. Deep, wracking sobs. Ahmed holds me, and I just... let it all out. All the fear, the helplessness, the anger. It's like a flood.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Fatima. This is all part of processing the trauma.",
    "Client: It feels... it feels good to let it out. But also terrifying. Like if I start, I'll never stop.",
    "Therapist: But you did stop. You're here now.",
    "Client: You're right. I am here. (takes a deep breath) I am here.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. But... lighter, somehow. Like I've set down a heavy burden, even if just for a moment.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 3 now. I'm surprised.",
    "Therapist: That's great work, Fatima. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Feel your feet on the floor...",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Yes... I can feel the carpet. The solidness of the chair. I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. You've done really well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's... it's still hard. But I feel like I can breathe a little easier now.",
    "Therapist: That's the goal. We'll continue working through this. How are you feeling about ending our session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. A bit shaky, but okay. I think I'll go home and have some tea with Ahmed. Maybe sit in the garden for a while.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Remember to be gentle with yourself.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you... for helping me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Fatima. I'll see you next week."
