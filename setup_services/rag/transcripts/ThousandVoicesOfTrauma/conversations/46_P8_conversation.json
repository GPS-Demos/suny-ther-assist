    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart's still racing, and I feel this tightness in my chest. The memory of that night, when the police stormed into our neighborhood... it's so vivid now. I can still hear the shouting, the sirens. I see the fear in my neighbors' eyes.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Anger. Definitely anger. But also... helplessness. I keep thinking about how powerless we all felt. We weren't doing anything wrong, just existing in our own homes. And suddenly, we were treated like criminals. It's... it's infuriating.",
    "Therapist: I see. Can you tell me more about that feeling of helplessness?",
    "Client: It's... it's like being trapped. I remember standing at my window, watching everything unfold. I wanted to do something, anything, to protect my community. But I knew if I stepped outside, I could be targeted too. I felt... I felt like a coward, you know? Like I was letting everyone down by not acting.",
    "Therapist: How does that belief impact you now?",
    "Client: It haunts me. Even now, years later, I question myself. Could I have done more? Should I have risked my safety to stand up for others? I know, logically, that it wasn't my fault. But emotionally... I still carry that guilt.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you noticing as you talk about this?",
    "Client: My hands are... they're shaking a bit. And there's this knot in my stomach. It's like my body is reliving that fear and tension. I can feel my jaw clenching too. It's strange how vivid these sensations are, even after all this time.",
    "Therapist: How do these sensations compare to what you felt during the actual event?",
    "Client: They're... they're not as intense, but they're similar. Back then, it felt like my whole body was on high alert. Every sound made me jump. Now, it's more... it's more contained, I guess? But it's still there, lurking under the surface.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... I'm thinking about how unfair it all was. How we were treated like we weren't even human. And I'm wondering... will it ever really change? Will my grandchildren have to live with this same fear? It makes me feel... hopeless sometimes.",
    "Therapist: How does that hopelessness sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... it's heavy. Like a weight on my chest. But there's also... I don't know, a spark of something else. Maybe determination? I don't want to just accept this as the way things are. I want to believe that sharing my story, speaking out, can make a difference.",
    "Therapist: What does that spark of determination feel like?",
    "Client: It feels... warm. Like a small flame in my chest. It's not big enough to overpower the anger or the fear, but it's there. It reminds me that I'm not just a victim. I'm a survivor. And maybe... maybe by working through this, by facing these memories, I can turn that spark into something more.",
    "Therapist: How does this realization affect your view of your recovery journey?",
    "Client: It's... it's complicated. On one hand, I feel more motivated to keep pushing forward, to keep confronting these painful memories. But on the other hand, it's exhausting. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever truly feel... whole again. Free from this weight.",
    "Therapist: What do you need to feel supported in this journey?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need patience. From myself, mostly. And maybe... maybe more connections with others who've been through similar experiences. It helps to know I'm not alone in this. And... and I need to keep reminding myself that it's okay to have good days and bad days. That healing isn't linear.",
    "Therapist: How can you show yourself that patience?",
    "Client: I suppose... I could try to be kinder to myself when I have setbacks. Maybe... maybe set smaller, more manageable goals for my recovery. And celebrate the small victories, you know? Like today, just being able to talk about this without completely breaking down... that's progress, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What else are you noticing as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also a bit lighter. Like I've set down a heavy load, even if just for a moment. My breathing is slower now, and that knot in my stomach has loosened a bit. It's... it's a strange mix of exhaustion and relief.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. How do you want to care for yourself for the rest of the day?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'll call my son. Hearing his voice always grounds me. And maybe take a long walk in the park. Being in nature helps clear my head. And... and I'll try to remind myself that I'm doing important work here, even when it's difficult.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. We'll continue next session."
