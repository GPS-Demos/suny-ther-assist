    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Can you describe the airplane crash scene?",
    "Client: Okay... I was on a business trip to Jakarta. The flight started normally, but about an hour in, there was sudden turbulence. The plane shook violently, and I heard a loud bang. Oxygen masks dropped, and people started panicking. I could smell something burning...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you experienced.",
    "Client: The plane was losing altitude rapidly. Flight attendants were shouting instructions, but it was chaos. I fumbled with my oxygen mask, my hands shaking. The man next to me was praying loudly in a language I didn't understand. I remember thinking about my ex-wife and our children, wondering if I'd ever see them again...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What were you feeling?",
    "Client: Terrified. Absolutely terrified. My heart was pounding so hard I thought it might burst. I felt helpless, like my life was completely out of my control. The plane was tilting, and I could see the ocean through the window. It was getting closer and closer...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: There was a deafening roar as we hit the water. The impact was brutal. My seatbelt dug into my waist, and I was thrown forward. Water started pouring in immediately. The cabin was filled with screams and the sound of twisting metal. I was disoriented, struggling to unbuckle my seatbelt...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (inhales sharply) The water was rising so fast. I managed to get my seatbelt off, but people were pushing and shoving to get to the emergency exits. I saw a young woman trapped in her seat, struggling with her belt. I wanted to help her, but the crowd was pushing me away. I... I left her there...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel distressed. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: (voice shaking) I made it to an exit and jumped into the ocean. The water was cold, and there were pieces of the plane everywhere. I could hear people screaming for help. I swam away from the sinking plane, terrified it would pull me down. I kept thinking about that woman I couldn't help...",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I treaded water for what felt like hours. My muscles were aching, and I was so cold. I saw other survivors clinging to debris. Some were injured, bleeding. I managed to grab onto a floating piece of the plane's wing. The wait for rescue was agonizing. I kept replaying the crash in my mind, wondering if I could have done something differently...",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) It's... it's overwhelming. I can still hear the screams, feel the cold water. I feel guilty for surviving when others didn't. And angry... angry that this happened at all. But also... relieved, I guess, to be talking about it. It's like a weight I've been carrying for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's completely understandable. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to talk about, but I think it helps. Sometimes I still have nightmares about the crash. I'll wake up in a cold sweat, feeling like I'm back in that water. And flying... I haven't been able to get on a plane since then. Just the thought of it makes me anxious.",
    "Therapist: Your reactions are normal. We'll address those fears.",
    "Client: I hope so. It's affected my work, my relationships. I feel like I'm not the same person I was before the crash. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel normal again. But being here, talking about it... it gives me some hope.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive outlook. Shall we continue?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I can. After we were rescued, I spent some time in a hospital in Indonesia. The shock hadn't fully set in yet. I remember seeing news reports about the crash, seeing the faces of those who didn't make it. That's when the guilt really hit me. Why did I survive when others didn't? Especially that woman I couldn't help...",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those thoughts. You're processing a lot.",
    "Client: I know, but it's hard. When I returned home, everyone treated me like I was fragile. My ex-wife was surprisingly supportive, but I couldn't open up to her or the kids. I felt so isolated, like no one could understand what I'd been through. I threw myself into work, trying to distract myself, but the memories would always creep back in.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... lighter, somehow. Talking about it is draining, but it also feels like I'm finally confronting something I've been running from. I still have a long way to go, I know that. But for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about the crash in such detail. It's still painful, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming as it used to. I'm starting to understand that my feelings are normal reactions to an abnormal situation. I just hope that with time, I can learn to cope better and maybe even help others who've been through similar experiences.",
    "Therapist: That's a commendable goal. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. This session has been intense, but also... helpful. I feel drained, but also a bit more at peace. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know we have more work to do, but for the first time in a long time, I feel like I'm making progress.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. We'll continue next session."
