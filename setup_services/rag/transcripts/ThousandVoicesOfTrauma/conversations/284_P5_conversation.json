    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Ahmadi. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. A bit anxious, I suppose. I've been thinking about this session all week, and I'm not entirely certain what to expect.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. Are you familiar with this?",
    "Client: Not really. I mean, I've heard the term, but I'm not sure what it entails. Is it... is it going to be difficult?",
    "Therapist: It can be challenging, but it's a crucial step in your recovery. Shall I explain further?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I'd like to know what I'm getting into.",
    "Therapist: Imaginal exposure involves revisiting your traumatic memory in a safe environment. We'll work through it together.",
    "Client: Revisit the home invasion? I... I don't know if I can do that. Just thinking about it makes my heart race.",
    "Therapist: Your reaction is normal. Remember, you're safe here. How else are you feeling?",
    "Client: Scared, honestly. And a bit angry too. Why do I have to go through this again? Hasn't once been enough?",
    "Therapist: I understand your frustration. This process helps reduce the memory's power over you. Ready to discuss what to expect?",
    "Client: I suppose so. But... what if I can't handle it? What if I completely fall apart?",
    "Therapist: That's a valid concern. I'll be here to support you throughout. We can pause anytime you need.",
    "Client: Okay, that's... that's reassuring. So, what exactly will we be doing?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the event in detail, in the present tense. I'll guide you through it.",
    "Client: In the present tense? As if it's happening now? That sounds terrifying.",
    "Therapist: It can be intense, but it's effective. Your feelings during this are important. Any questions?",
    "Client: Will this really help? I've tried so hard to forget that night. Won't this make things worse?",
    "Therapist: It's a common worry. But confronting the memory helps your brain process it, reducing its impact over time.",
    "Client: I see. I'm still scared, but I trust you. You really think I can do this?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Your courage in facing this is admirable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. Yes, let's do it. But please, if it gets too much, can we stop?",
    "Therapist: Of course. You're in control here. Ready to start?",
    "Client: As ready as I'll ever be, I suppose. Let's go ahead."
