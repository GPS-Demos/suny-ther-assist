    "Therapist: Alright, Priya. Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Just focus on the memory and describe it aloud.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in that small room. The walls are grey and cold. I can hear footsteps outside, and my heart is racing. I... I don't know why I'm here or for how long. The uncertainty is suffocating.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably a 6 out of 10. My palms are sweaty, and I feel tense all over.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The room is so small. I can barely stretch my arms out. There's a tiny window, but it's too high to see out of. I keep wondering if my family knows where I am. Do they even care? I feel so alone and forgotten.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's getting worse. Maybe an 8? My chest feels tight, and I'm having trouble breathing normally.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I can hear someone crying in another room. It makes me feel helpless. I want to help them, but I can't even help myself. The guard outside ignores my pleas for information. It's like I don't exist.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating at this moment?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm back there. My hands are shaking, and I feel dizzy.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're here with me. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *takes a shaky breath* Okay... The worst part is not knowing. Not knowing why I'm here, how long I'll be here, or if anyone cares. It reminds me of my childhood, feeling neglected and invisible.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: Still high, maybe 8.5. My heart is pounding, but I feel a bit more grounded.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're handling this bravely. Continue.",
    "Client: Time seems to stand still in there. I try to count the seconds, but I lose track. I start to wonder if I've done something wrong to deserve this. Maybe my family put me here because they don't want me anymore.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7? I feel exhausted, but the panic is subsiding.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Keep going with the memory.",
    "Client: I start to imagine my life outside. My job, my friends... will they forget about me? I feel so powerless. I try to distract myself by counting the cracks in the wall, but my mind keeps racing back to worst-case scenarios.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm at about a 6. I feel drained, but less panicky. It's like I'm watching it happen to someone else now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's continue for a few more minutes.",
    "Client: Okay. As time passes, I start to feel numb. The fear is still there, but it's duller. I begin to accept that this might be my new reality. I think about my husband and wonder if he's looking for me. Part of me hopes he is, but another part feels guilty for putting him through this.",
    "Therapist: What's your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: I'd say it's down to a 5 now. I feel... I don't know, kind of empty? But also relieved that it's over.",
    "Therapist: Thank you, Priya. You did very well. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves."
