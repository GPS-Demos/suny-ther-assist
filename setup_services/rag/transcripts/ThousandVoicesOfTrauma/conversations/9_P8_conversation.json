    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mr. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure, to be honest. It's like my mind is both racing and frozen at the same time. The memory of that day in the hospital, when I got the diagnosis... it's so vivid now. I can still smell the antiseptic, you know? And that sickening feeling in my stomach when the doctor walked in with that look on his face. God, I thought I was going to throw up right there.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you now as you reflect on that moment?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. I feel this tightness in my chest, like I can't breathe properly. And there's this... this anger, I guess. I'm angry that I had to go through that, angry that my body betrayed me. But mostly, I'm terrified. Even though I know I'm sitting here now, a part of me is still in that hospital room, hearing those words for the first time and feeling like my whole world was crumbling.",
    "Therapist: How does that fear manifest for you?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a cold hand gripping my heart. I start thinking about all the things I might miss out on, you know? My grandkids growing up, traveling with my wife... And then I start spiraling, wondering if the cancer might come back, if I'll have to go through it all again. It's exhausting, really. Sometimes I find myself avoiding check-ups or ignoring symptoms because I'm so afraid of ending up back in that room.",
    "Therapist: I see. How do these feelings connect to your earlier experiences?",
    "Client: I... I hadn't really thought about it before, but I suppose it does feel similar in some ways. That same feeling of helplessness, of having no control over what's happening to me. When I was abused as a child, I felt so powerless, so trapped. And getting that diagnosis... it brought all those feelings rushing back. It's like my body isn't my own again, like I'm at the mercy of something I can't fight or escape from.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I realize I'm holding my breath a lot. Like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop, you know? And there's this constant tension in my shoulders. I guess I'm always bracing for bad news. It's funny, in a sad way. I survived the abuse, I survived the cancer, but sometimes it feels like I'm still just... surviving, not really living. Always on edge, always waiting for the next blow.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization make you feel?",
    "Client: It makes me... sad. And tired. So incredibly tired. But also... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful? Because if I can see this pattern, maybe I can start to change it. I don't want to just be a survivor anymore. I want to live, really live, without this constant fear hanging over me. But I'm not sure how to even begin doing that.",
    "Therapist: What might a first step look like for you?",
    "Client: I... I think maybe it starts with acknowledging these feelings instead of trying to push them away. Maybe talking to my wife about it more, instead of pretending everything's fine. And... and maybe being more proactive about my health, instead of avoiding it out of fear. It's scary to think about, but the idea of taking some control back... it's appealing.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful approach. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, honestly. But also like something's shifted a bit. Like I've looked at something I've been avoiding for a long time. It's uncomfortable, but also... I don't know, maybe necessary? I'm not sure what comes next, but I think I'm ready to find out.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to explore more about how my past experiences are affecting my present. And maybe... maybe start looking at ways to manage this anxiety about my health. It's exhausting living in constant fear, and I'm ready to try something different. Is that... is that something we can work on?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll start there next time. How are you feeling about ending for today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I think. A bit raw, but also... lighter? Like I've put down a heavy bag I've been carrying for a while. Thank you for listening and guiding me through this. It means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and we'll continue next week."
