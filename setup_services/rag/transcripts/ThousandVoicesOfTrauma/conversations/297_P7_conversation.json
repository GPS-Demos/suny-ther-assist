    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the medical trauma you experienced?",
    "Client: Okay... I was deployed in Afghanistan, serving as a combat medic. It was a hot day, and we were on patrol. Suddenly, there was an explosion. I remember the sound, the dust, and then... chaos. My fellow soldiers were screaming. I rushed to help, but there was so much blood. One soldier, Private Johnson, had lost his leg. I applied a tourniquet, but his eyes... they were filled with so much fear. I kept telling him he'd be okay, but I wasn't sure if I believed it myself.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: The smell of blood and gunpowder was overwhelming. I was trying to stabilize Johnson while also assessing the other injured soldiers. My hands were shaking, but I couldn't let that stop me. I remember thinking, \"I can't let them die. I can't fail them.\" But there was so much damage... so many injuries. I felt completely overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I can still hear the helicopters coming in for evacuation. The sound of rotors mixed with the moans of the injured. As we loaded them onto the choppers, I kept checking vitals, trying to keep everyone stable. But Johnson... he flatlined just as we got him on board. I started CPR, desperately trying to bring him back. My arms were aching, my uniform was soaked in blood, but I couldn't stop. I couldn't let him die.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: We landed at the field hospital, and everything was a blur of activity. Doctors and nurses took over, but I couldn't leave. I stayed, helping where I could, praying that Johnson would make it. Hours passed, and finally, a doctor came to tell me... Johnson didn't survive. I felt like I had failed him, failed everyone. I couldn't stop shaking, and I felt this immense guilt washing over me. Why couldn't I save him? What if I had done something differently?",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. You're doing great expressing these emotions.",
    "Client: The days after were a haze. I had to write reports, attend debriefings, but all I could think about was Johnson's face. His family... how would they react? I started having nightmares, reliving that day over and over. Sometimes in my dreams, I save him, but then I wake up and the reality hits me all over again. I felt like I couldn't talk to anyone about it. Who would understand? I was supposed to be strong, to save lives, but I felt so broken inside.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength by sharing this. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. My heart is racing, and I can feel that tightness in my chest again. It's like I'm back there, covered in blood and dust. I can smell it, feel the heat... It's overwhelming. But at the same time, there's a small part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe a little relieved? Like I've been carrying this weight for so long, and now I'm finally setting it down. It's scary, but also... freeing, in a way.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're doing really well.",
    "Client: Thank you... I've never really talked about this in detail before. It's always been there, just under the surface, but actually saying it out loud... it's different. It's hard, but I think I needed this. I've been avoiding these memories for so long, trying to push them away. But now, facing them, it's like I'm finally acknowledging what happened. It doesn't change the past, but maybe... maybe it can help me move forward.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible courage. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: I... I think I can continue. It's difficult, but I feel like I'm finally confronting these memories instead of running from them. There's more to say about that day, about the aftermath. I remember the memorial service we held for Johnson and the others we lost. Standing there in my dress uniform, trying to maintain composure while inside I was falling apart. The way his family looked at me, seeking answers I couldn't give. It's all part of this experience, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it is. You're doing an amazing job. Keep going.",
    "Client: The memorial service was surreal. We were back on base, away from the danger, but the weight of what happened was so heavy. I remember Johnson's mother approaching me after the service. She hugged me and thanked me for trying to save her son. I felt like such a fraud. I wanted to tell her I failed, that I wasn't worthy of her gratitude, but I couldn't find the words. I just stood there, fighting back tears, feeling like I was suffocating in my own guilt.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: After that, I threw myself into my work. I took extra shifts, volunteered for the toughest assignments. I thought if I could just save enough lives, maybe it would balance out the ones I couldn't save. But it never did. Each life saved was a momentary relief, but the weight of those lost never lessened. I started having panic attacks during procedures, my hands would shake uncontrollably. I was terrified of making a mistake, of losing another patient. It got to the point where I couldn't function effectively anymore. That's when they decided to send me home.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Emotionally and physically. Talking about all of this, it's like I've run a marathon. But there's also this strange sense of... I don't know, maybe clarity? Like I'm seeing these experiences from a different perspective. I've carried this burden for so long, thinking I was alone in it. But sharing it, even though it's painful, it's like I'm finally allowing myself to process what happened. It's overwhelming, but I think... I think it might be necessary for me to heal.",
    "Therapist: That's a profound insight. You've done remarkably well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It still hurts, and I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in years, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can work through this. I'm scared of what other memories might surface, but I also feel a tiny bit hopeful. Is that normal? To feel both terrified and hopeful at the same time?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. It's a common and healthy response.",
    "Client: That's... that's good to know. I think I need some time to process everything we've talked about today. It's brought up so many emotions and memories. Some of them are painful, but others... I'm remembering the good times too. The camaraderie with my fellow soldiers, the lives we did save, the difference we made. It doesn't erase the trauma, but it helps to remember that it wasn't all bad. I'm feeling drained, but also like a weight has been lifted. Is it okay if we stop here for today?",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've done incredible work. How about we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. Thank you for guiding me through this. It was harder than I expected, but also... I don't know, maybe more helpful than I thought it would be. I'm nervous about our next session, but I also feel like I'm finally taking steps towards healing. Is it okay if I take a few minutes to just sit here and collect myself before I leave?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Take all the time you need."

      "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. Thank you for guiding me through this. It was harder than I expected, but also... I don't know, maybe more helpful than I thought it would be. I'm nervous about our next session, but I also feel like I'm finally taking steps towards healing. Is it okay if I take a few minutes to just sit here and collect myself before I leave?",
      "Therapist: Absolutely. Take all the time you need."
