    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Patel. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... a bit nervous, to be honest. My back pain has been acting up, and I didn't sleep well last night. The thought of discussing the home invasion again makes me anxious.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's talk about today's session.",
    "Client: Alright. What exactly are we going to do? You mentioned something called imaginal exposure last time, but I'm not sure I fully grasp what that means.",
    "Therapist: It's a technique to help process traumatic memories. We'll revisit the home invasion in detail.",
    "Client: Revisit it? I'm not sure I can handle that. Just thinking about it makes my heart race. Is this really necessary?",
    "Therapist: It can be challenging, but it's effective for reducing PTSD symptoms. How do you feel about trying?",
    "Client: I'm scared, but I trust you. I want to get better. Can you tell me more about what to expect during this... exposure?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the event in present tense. I'll guide you through it, offering support throughout.",
    "Client: Present tense? As if it's happening now? That sounds terrifying. Will I be able to stop if it becomes too much?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We can pause anytime. Your safety is paramount.",
    "Client: Okay, that's reassuring. I appreciate your patience with me. It's just... I've spent so long trying to forget that night. The idea of purposely remembering it in detail is daunting.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. This takes courage. How else can I support you?",
    "Client: Could we perhaps start with something less intense? Maybe talk about the days leading up to the invasion first? I'm worried about jumping straight into the worst part.",
    "Therapist: That's a great suggestion. We can ease into it gradually.",
    "Client: Thank you. That helps a lot. I'm still nervous, but I feel more prepared now. Can I ask - have you done this with other clients who've experienced home invasions?",
    "Therapist: Yes, I have. Many found it helpful in reducing their fear and anxiety over time.",
    "Client: That's good to know. It gives me hope. I've been living with this fear for so long, always looking over my shoulder, triple-checking the locks. If this can help me feel safe in my own home again, I'm willing to try.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is admirable. Shall we begin with some relaxation exercises?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think that would help calm my nerves. And... thank you for being so understanding. It means a lot to have someone who listens and doesn't judge me for being afraid.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Let's start with deep breathing..."
