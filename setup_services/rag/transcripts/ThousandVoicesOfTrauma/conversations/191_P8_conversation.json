    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart is still racing, and I feel this tightness in my chest. The memory of that day at the hospital, it's so vivid now. I can still smell the antiseptic and hear the beeping of the machines.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I think. No, not just fear. It's... it's terror. I feel like I'm right back there, helpless and alone. The doctors rushing around, alarms going off, and me... I couldn't do anything. I couldn't help my husband. I just stood there, frozen.",
    "Therapist: It sounds incredibly overwhelming. Can you tell me more about that feeling of helplessness?",
    "Client: It's... it's like being trapped in quicksand. The more I struggled to understand what was happening, to try and do something, anything, the more I felt myself sinking. I remember thinking, \"This can't be real. This isn't happening.\" But it was. And I couldn't stop it. I couldn't make it better. I've always been the one to fix things, you know? But not this time. This time, I was completely powerless.",
    "Therapist: How does that powerlessness affect you now?",
    "Client: It... it haunts me. Even now, months later, I find myself constantly on edge. I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop, for something terrible to happen that I can't control. It's exhausting. And it makes me angry too. Angry at myself for not being able to do more, angry at the world for being so unpredictable and cruel.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you noticing as you talk about this?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking. I can feel this knot in my stomach, like it's twisting tighter and tighter. And my breathing... it's shallow. I have to remind myself to take deep breaths. It's like my body is still in that hospital room, still in that moment of panic.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when the event first happened?",
    "Client: They're... they're not as intense now. When it first happened, it was like being hit by a tidal wave. I couldn't think, couldn't breathe. Now, it's more like... like standing in the surf. The waves still come, but they don't knock me over completely. But the fear of another big wave is always there.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... what if I had noticed something earlier? What if I had insisted on going to the hospital sooner? Maybe things would have been different. And then I think about how fragile life is, how everything can change in an instant. It makes me want to hold onto everything tighter, but at the same time, I'm terrified of losing it all.",
    "Therapist: How does this experience connect to other parts of your life?",
    "Client: It's... it's changed everything. I used to be so confident, so sure of myself. Now, I second-guess every decision. I worry constantly about my husband, about my children. I find myself planning for every possible disaster. It's like I'm trying to control everything because I'm so afraid of being caught off guard again.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about how you're coping with these feelings?",
    "Client: I... I guess I'm doing better than I thought. Talking about it, really facing those memories... it's hard. So hard. But I'm doing it. And I'm still here. I'm still fighting. Sometimes I try to push the memories away, to pretend it never happened. But that doesn't really work. Facing it head-on, as terrifying as it is, feels... I don't know... maybe a little empowering?",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to acknowledge that strength?",
    "Client: It's... it's strange. Part of me wants to deny it, to say that I'm not strong at all. But another part... another part feels a glimmer of hope. Like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this. That I'm not as helpless as I felt in that hospital room. It's a small feeling, but it's there.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to explore that feeling of hope more. And maybe... maybe talk about how I can start to feel more in control without trying to control everything. Is that possible? To feel secure without constantly being on guard?",
    "Therapist: That's a great direction. We'll work on that next time.",
    "Client: Thank you. This was... it was hard, but I think it was good. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've set down a heavy bag I've been carrying. Not completely, but... a little.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. How will you take care of yourself for the rest of the day?",
    "Client: I think I'll take a long walk in the park near our house. The fresh air always helps. And maybe call my daughter. Just hearing her voice... it reminds me that there's still good in the world, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a wonderful plan. Remember to be gentle with yourself.",
    "Client: I'll try. It's not easy, but I'm learning. Thank you for... for helping me face this. For helping me see that maybe I'm stronger than I thought.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. I'll see you next week."
