    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart's still racing, and I feel a bit shaky. That memory of the accident, it's so vivid. I can still hear the screeching tires and smell the burning rubber.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: It's like I'm right back there, you know? I keep seeing the police lights flashing, hearing the sirens. I remember feeling so helpless, so scared. And then there was all this commotion, people shouting. I... I didn't understand what was happening at first.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are you experiencing as you recall this?",
    "Client: Fear, definitely fear. But also... anger? Yeah, I'm angry. The way the police handled it, it was so... brutal. They didn't need to use that much force. I keep thinking, what if they had just talked to us first? Maybe things wouldn't have escalated.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like a knot in my stomach, and my jaw is clenched. I notice I'm balling my fists too. It's frustrating because I feel like I should be over this by now, you know? But every time I think about it, these feelings just come rushing back.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. What thoughts are accompanying these feelings?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why us? Why did this have to happen to us?\" We weren't doing anything wrong. And then I start doubting myself, wondering if maybe we did something to provoke them without realizing it. But that doesn't make sense either. It's just... it's not fair.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts impact you?",
    "Client: They make me feel... powerless, I guess. Like I can't trust the people who are supposed to protect us. And it's affecting my daily life too. I get anxious when I see police cars now, even though I know logically that not all police officers are like that.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about how you're coping with these feelings?",
    "Client: Well, I've been trying to avoid situations that might trigger these memories. I've changed my route to work to avoid passing by where it happened. And I've been having trouble sleeping, often waking up in a cold sweat. I guess I'm not coping as well as I thought I was.",
    "Therapist: How does recognizing this make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a bit of a relief, to be honest. I've been trying so hard to act like everything's fine, but admitting that I'm struggling feels like a weight off my shoulders. I just want to feel normal again, you know?",
    "Therapist: What does \"normal\" mean to you in this context?",
    "Client: I suppose it means not being constantly on edge, not feeling like I have to look over my shoulder all the time. Being able to trust that I'm safe when I go out. And maybe... maybe not feeling so angry all the time. It's exhausting, carrying all this around.",
    "Therapist: How do you see these experiences shaping your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I think... I think they're forcing me to confront things I've been trying to avoid. It's painful, but maybe it's necessary? I want to get to a place where I can think about what happened without feeling overwhelmed. And maybe even use this experience to help others who've been through similar things.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What strengths do you see in yourself as you work through this?",
    "Client: I guess I'm resilient. I mean, I'm here, right? Talking about it, trying to work through it. And I'm starting to realize that asking for help isn't a weakness. It takes courage to face these memories and emotions head-on. I'm also becoming more aware of social issues I hadn't really thought about before.",
    "Therapist: How has this awareness affected you?",
    "Client: It's... it's opened my eyes, honestly. I find myself paying more attention to news about police brutality, trying to understand the broader context. It's made me want to get involved, to do something. But it's also scary, because it makes the world feel less safe than I thought it was.",
    "Therapist: What helps you feel grounded when these fears come up?",
    "Client: Talking to my partner helps a lot. They've been so supportive through all of this. And I've started doing yoga and meditation, which helps calm my mind when it starts racing. Sometimes just taking a walk in nature helps me feel more centered and reminds me that there's still beauty in the world.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent coping strategies. How else has this experience changed you?",
    "Client: I think I'm more empathetic now. I find myself really listening when others talk about their struggles, trying to understand their perspectives. And I'm learning to be more patient with myself, to accept that healing isn't linear. Some days are harder than others, and that's okay.",
    "Therapist: That's a profound realization. What do you hope to gain from our sessions moving forward?",
    "Client: I want to be able to process this trauma without it controlling my life. I hope to find ways to manage my anxiety and anger better. And maybe... maybe find a way to use this experience positively, to contribute to change somehow. I don't want to be defined by what happened, but I also don't want to pretend it didn't affect me.",
    "Therapist: Those are meaningful goals. How are you feeling now, after sharing all of this?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense? Like I've released something that's been bottled up. There's still a lot to work through, but I feel a bit lighter. And hopeful, I think. Like maybe I can get through this and come out stronger on the other side.",
    "Therapist: That's a great note to end on. We'll continue exploring these themes in our next session."
