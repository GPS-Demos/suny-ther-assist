    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) It's... it's intense. I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. Reliving that moment in the prison cell, it brought back so many vivid details I thought I'd forgotten. The cold concrete, the smell of damp, the constant noise from other prisoners... It's like I was right back there.",
    "Therapist: What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The feeling of helplessness, I think. Being trapped in that small space, not knowing when or if I'd ever get out. It's funny, you know, I've always considered myself a strong person, but in there... I felt so vulnerable, so powerless. It's hard to reconcile that with how I see myself now.",
    "Therapist: How does that vulnerability connect to your current experiences?",
    "Client: Well... (pauses) I guess it explains why I still struggle with feeling safe sometimes. Even in my shared accommodation, I often feel on edge, like I need to be ready to protect myself at any moment. It's exhausting, really.",
    "Therapist: That makes sense. How did it feel to revisit the memory today?",
    "Client: It was tough, but... different from how I expected. Usually, when these memories come up, I try to push them away as quickly as possible. But going through it slowly, step by step, it's like... I could see it more clearly. It still hurts, but it feels less overwhelming somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant observation. What do you think has changed?",
    "Client: I'm not sure, exactly. Maybe... maybe it's because I'm not alone with it anymore? Sharing it with you, even though it's difficult, makes me feel less isolated. And I'm starting to see that while it was a terrible experience, it doesn't define who I am now.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How might this insight help you moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I can start being a little kinder to myself? I've been so angry at myself for still being affected by this, but now I can see why it's had such a lasting impact. And if I can face it here, in this room, maybe I can start facing other things I've been avoiding too.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent goal. What's one small step you could take this week?",
    "Client: Hmm... (thinks for a moment) Maybe I could try talking to one of my housemates a bit more? I've been pretty isolated, but I think connecting with others might help me feel safer in my living space.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great idea. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Still a bit shaky, but... lighter, I think. Like I've put down a heavy weight I didn't even realize I was carrying. It's strange, but I feel a little proud of myself for getting through this session.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think I'd like to explore more about how this experience has affected my relationships. I've always struggled with trust since the imprisonment, and I'd like to work on that.",
    "Therapist: That's a valuable area to explore. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I guess. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I think it's helping. I'm starting to see a glimmer of hope that things can get better.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your courage is admirable. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, definitely. I'll be here. Thanks again."
