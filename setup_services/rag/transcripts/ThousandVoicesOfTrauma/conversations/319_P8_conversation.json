    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I'm right back there, you know? I can still hear the sound of glass breaking downstairs. It's so vivid.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you noticing right now?",
    "Client: My hands are clammy, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's hard to take a deep breath. I feel like I'm on high alert, like I need to be ready to run or fight at any moment.",
    "Therapist: And what thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. I was frozen, just listening to them ransack our home. I should have done something, anything. But I couldn't move. I feel... I feel ashamed that I didn't protect my family better.",
    "Therapist: How do those thoughts make you feel emotionally?",
    "Client: Angry. Frustrated. Scared, still. It's been years, but in moments like this, it feels like it just happened yesterday. I'm angry at myself for not being stronger, for still being affected by this after all this time.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's like this cold pit in my stomach. I know logically that I'm safe here, but my body doesn't seem to believe it. I keep glancing at the door, half-expecting someone to burst in.",
    "Therapist: How does this fear compare to what you felt during the actual event?",
    "Client: It's... it's not as intense, I guess. During the invasion, I felt like I was going to die. My heart was pounding so hard I thought it might explode. Now, it's more like... like an echo of that fear. It's there, but I can recognize it for what it is.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about that difference?",
    "Client: I... I suppose it means I've made some progress. Back then, I couldn't function at all when these memories came up. Now, it's uncomfortable, but I can still talk about it. That's... that's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How does recognizing that progress make you feel?",
    "Client: A little relieved, actually. Maybe even a bit proud? It's easy to focus on how far I still have to go, but you're right, I have made progress. It gives me hope that maybe one day, this won't control my life anymore.",
    "Therapist: What other emotions are you experiencing as you reflect on this?",
    "Client: There's a sadness there too. For the person I was before this happened. For the sense of safety I lost. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel completely secure in my own home again. And there's... there's a bit of anger too. At the people who did this, who violated our space and our sense of peace.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with these complex emotions?",
    "Client: It's not easy. Sometimes I try to distract myself, but I know that's not always healthy. Talking about it, like we're doing now, helps. And I've been trying to practice those grounding techniques you taught me. Focusing on my breath, on the present moment. It doesn't always work, but when it does, it helps me remember that I'm here now, not back in that moment.",
    "Therapist: What aspects of the memory feel most challenging to process?",
    "Client: The sounds, definitely. The crash of the window breaking, their footsteps on the stairs. And the helplessness. Feeling trapped in my own bedroom, hearing them moving around downstairs. I keep thinking about what could have happened if they'd come upstairs, if they'd found us. It's the 'what ifs' that really get to me sometimes.",
    "Therapist: How do those 'what ifs' affect you in your daily life?",
    "Client: They make me overly cautious, I think. I'm always double-checking locks, installing new security systems. I have trouble sleeping some nights, always listening for any unusual sounds. It's exhausting, honestly. And it affects my family too. I can see the worry in my wife's eyes sometimes, when I'm checking the windows for the third time in an evening.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to you to feel safe again?",
    "Client: God, it would mean everything. To be able to relax in my own home, to sleep through the night without waking up in a panic. To not flinch at every unexpected noise. To be present with my family without part of my mind always being on guard. It would be... it would be like getting my life back, I guess.",
    "Therapist: How does talking about this now make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of things. There's still that undercurrent of anxiety, but there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe relief? Like I'm letting out a breath I've been holding for a long time. It's painful to talk about, but there's also something freeing about it. Like I'm taking some of the power back from this memory.",
    "Therapist: What do you think has allowed you to share so openly today?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's knowing that this is a safe space. That you're not judging me, that we're working through this together. And maybe it's also because I'm starting to believe that I can get through this. That talking about it, facing it head-on, is how I start to take control back. It's not easy, but it feels... necessary. Like I'm finally confronting something I've been running from for too long.",
    "Therapist: How would you like to use this insight moving forward?",
    "Client: I want to keep pushing myself, I think. To face these memories and feelings instead of trying to bury them. Maybe... maybe talk to my wife more about what I'm going through. She's always said she's there for me, but I've been afraid of burdening her. But I'm starting to see that shutting her out might be hurting us more. And I want to keep practicing those coping techniques, to get better at grounding myself when the memories hit.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, honestly. But also a little lighter? Like I've set down a heavy weight I've been carrying. I'm still anxious, but it feels more manageable now. And there's this tiny spark of hope that wasn't there before. It's small, but it's there.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to delve deeper into how this is affecting my relationships, especially with my wife. And maybe explore more strategies for managing the anxiety when it spikes. Is that... is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll pick up there next time. How would you like to close today?",
    "Client: Could we... could we do that grounding exercise again? The one where we focus on the present moment? I think that might help me transition back into the rest of my day.",
