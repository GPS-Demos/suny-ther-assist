    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's begin when you're comfortable.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in the hospital waiting room. The fluorescent lights are harsh, and there's that antiseptic smell. I'm waiting for my test results, and my heart is racing. The clock on the wall seems to be moving so slowly.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10. It's uncomfortable, but manageable.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The nurse calls my name, and I follow her down the long corridor. My legs feel heavy, and there's a knot in my stomach. We enter a small office, and the doctor is there, looking serious. He starts talking, but his words become muffled. I catch phrases like \"abnormal growth\" and \"further tests needed.\" My vision starts to blur, and I feel dizzy.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's higher now. Maybe a 7? My palms are sweating, and I can feel my heart pounding in my chest.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm trying to focus on what the doctor is saying, but panic is setting in. I feel trapped in this tiny room, like the walls are closing in. I want to run, but I'm frozen in place. The doctor keeps talking, but all I can think is, \"This can't be happening to me.\" I'm struggling to breathe...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel overwhelmed, like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Remember, this is just a memory.",
    "Client: Right, right... I'm trying to calm down. In the memory, I finally manage to ask, \"What does this mean?\" The doctor explains that they need to do a biopsy. The word 'cancer' hangs in the air, unspoken but heavy. I feel like I'm in a bubble, disconnected from reality.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Still pretty high, maybe an 8. My chest feels tight, and I'm a bit shaky.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're handling this well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I nod mechanically as the doctor explains the procedure. Inside, I'm screaming. I think about my family, my job, my life. Everything seems uncertain now. As I leave the office, the hallway stretches endlessly before me. Each step feels like I'm wading through quicksand.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's coming down a bit, maybe a 6. I'm starting to feel more present in the room with you.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I make it to my car, but I can't drive yet. I sit there, gripping the steering wheel, trying to process what just happened. Tears start flowing, and I can't stop them. I feel so alone, so scared. But there's also this tiny voice inside saying, \"You can get through this.\" I take a deep breath, wipe my eyes, and start the car. I know I need to be strong for what's coming.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 4 again. I feel drained, but also a bit relieved. Talking about it... it's hard, but it helps.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. How do you feel about the exercise?",
    "Client: It was tough, but I feel like I faced something important. I'm exhausted, but there's a sense of accomplishment too.",
    "Therapist: That's great. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves before we end the session."
