    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. I can still see those images, you know? The accident... it's like I'm right back there again.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: My heart is pounding. I can feel this tightness in my chest, like I can't breathe properly. And my hands are shaking. It's... it's overwhelming. I keep thinking about how helpless I felt, watching those people being loaded into that truck. I couldn't do anything to stop it.",
    "Therapist: You're experiencing some intense physical sensations. How are you managing them?",
    "Client: I'm trying to focus on my breathing, like we practiced. In through the nose, out through the mouth. It helps a little, but... Dios m\u00edo, it's hard. I feel guilty, you know? Like I should have done more, said something, anything.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why didn't I do more?\" I was just frozen, paralyzed with fear. And now, years later, I wonder how many lives were ruined because I couldn't speak up. It's... it's eating me up inside.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt affect you in your daily life?",
    "Client: It's always there, like a weight on my shoulders. Some days, it's harder to get out of bed. I find myself avoiding certain parts of town, certain types of vehicles. And my chronic pain... it seems to flare up more when these memories surface. It's like my body is remembering too, you know?",
    "Therapist: Can you tell me more about how your body responds?",
    "Client: Well, aside from the increased pain, I notice I'm more jumpy. Loud noises startle me easily. Sometimes, I catch myself scanning crowds, looking for... I don't know, signs of danger? It's exhausting. And it affects my sleep too. I have nightmares, wake up in cold sweats.",
    "Therapist: How do these experiences impact your relationships?",
    "Client: Ay, it's not easy. My wife, she's patient, but I know it's hard for her too. Sometimes I snap at her for no reason, or I withdraw. I don't go out as much as I used to. It's like... like I'm not the same person anymore. I miss the old me, you know?",
    "Therapist: What do you miss most about your old self?",
    "Client: I miss feeling carefree, I guess. Being able to enjoy life without this constant... vigilance. I used to love socializing, telling jokes, being the life of the party. Now, I'm always on edge, always waiting for something bad to happen. It's like I've lost a part of myself.",
    "Therapist: How does that loss make you feel?",
    "Client: Angry. Sad. Frustrated. It's not fair, you know? I didn't ask for this. I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, and now my whole life has changed. But then I feel guilty for feeling angry because I know others have suffered so much more.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to acknowledge your own pain.",
    "Client: I know, I know. It's just... hard. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel normal again. Will I always be looking over my shoulder? Will I always feel this... this heaviness in my chest?",
    "Therapist: What gives you hope in your recovery journey?",
    "Client: Well, I suppose... these sessions help. Talking about it, facing it head-on. It's terrifying, but I feel a little lighter afterward. And my family, they're my rock. My grandkids, they make me smile even on the darkest days. I want to get better for them, you know?",
    "Therapist: How do you see your future now?",
    "Client: Hmm... I'm not sure. Some days, I can see a future where this doesn't control me anymore. Where I can go out without fear, enjoy life again. Other days, it feels impossible. But I'm trying to hold onto hope. I want to believe that I can heal, that I can find peace.",
    "Therapist: What small steps can you take towards that future?",
    "Client: I guess... continuing these sessions, for one. Maybe trying to be more open with my wife about what I'm feeling. And perhaps... perhaps reaching out to some old friends. Baby steps, right?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. Small steps can lead to big changes.",
    "Client: Yeah, you're right. It's just... it's a long road, you know? But I'm here, I'm trying. That has to count for something, right?",
    "Therapist: It absolutely does. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, to be honest. But also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've set down a heavy load, even if just for a moment. It's still there, but talking about it... it helps. It's hard, but it helps.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. This was... intense. But thank you, doc. I appreciate your patience with me.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
