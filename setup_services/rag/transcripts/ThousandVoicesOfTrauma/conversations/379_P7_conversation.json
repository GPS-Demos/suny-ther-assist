    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. I know we're going to be talking about the cyclone, and it still makes me anxious just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We'll take it step by step.",
    "Client: Okay, I'll try. Where should I start?",
    "Therapist: Begin with the day of the cyclone. What do you remember?",
    "Client: It was early morning. The wind had been picking up all night. I remember waking up to the sound of trees creaking and things hitting the roof. I got up and looked out the window, and it was like the world had gone mad. The sky was this sickly greenish-gray color, and the rain was coming down in sheets.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: I tried to stay calm, but I could feel my heart racing. I kept thinking about my ex-husband and how he used to tell me I was useless in emergencies. I wanted to prove him wrong, even though he wasn't there. I started gathering important documents and putting them in waterproof bags, but my hands were shaking so much I could barely zip them up.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The power went out suddenly, and that's when I really started to panic. The house was creaking and groaning, and I was sure it was going to come down around me. I wanted to run, but I didn't know where to go. I ended up huddling in the hallway, away from the windows. I could hear things smashing outside, and every crash made me jump.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I don't know how long I sat there. It felt like hours. The noise was deafening - wind howling, things breaking. At one point, I heard a massive crack and a crash. I found out later it was my neighbor's huge gum tree falling. I thought it was my roof caving in, and I just... I lost it. I started sobbing and couldn't stop. I felt so alone and helpless, just like when...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Just like when my ex used to... to hurt me. I felt that same paralyzing fear, that feeling of having no control. I wanted to call someone, anyone, but the phone lines were down. I just sat there, crying and shaking, praying for it to be over.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're strong for sharing this.",
    "Client: When the wind finally started to die down, I was almost afraid to believe it. I remember crawling to the window and peeking out. The street was unrecognizable. Trees down everywhere, debris scattered all over. My garden was destroyed. But my house was still standing. I felt this weird mix of relief and guilt - relief that I was okay, but guilt because I knew others probably weren't.",
    "Therapist: You survived a terrifying experience. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Shaky. Talking about it brings it all back. But... also a little proud, I guess. I made it through, even though I was terrified. I just wish I could shake this fear that it'll happen again.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. We'll work on that together.",
    "Client: Thank you. It helps to talk about it, even though it's hard. I've never really told anyone the full story before. I always tried to act like it wasn't a big deal, you know? Like I was fine. But I wasn't fine. I'm still not fine.",
    "Therapist: It's brave of you to open up. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: A bit drained, to be honest. But also... lighter? Like I've put down a heavy bag I've been carrying. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. That's a common feeling after sharing.",
    "Client: I think I need a moment. This has been more intense than I expected. Can we take a short break?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's pause here and resume when you're ready."
