    "Therapist: Good morning, Maria. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Buenos d\u00edas, Dr. Thompson. I'm... I'm okay, I suppose. My hip is acting up again, but I'm managing. I've been thinking a lot about our last session and what you mentioned about this imaginal exposure thing. I'm not sure I understand it completely.",
    "Therapist: I see. Let's discuss that. What are your thoughts?",
    "Client: Well, to be honest, I'm a bit scared. The idea of reliving that terrible day... the crash that took my Carlos... it's overwhelming. I've spent years trying to forget, and now you want me to remember? It doesn't make sense to me.",
    "Therapist: I understand your concerns. Shall we explore why this might help?",
    "Client: S\u00ed, por favor. I want to understand. It's just... every time I think about that day, I feel like I can't breathe. My heart races, and I feel like I'm right back there, helpless and terrified. How can putting myself through that again possibly help?",
    "Therapist: Those reactions are normal. This process aims to reduce those symptoms over time.",
    "Client: Reduce them? How? It seems counterintuitive to me. And what if I can't handle it? What if I break down completely? I'm not as young as I used to be, doctor. My nerves aren't what they were.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace and can stop anytime. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's... reassuring, I suppose. But I still don't quite understand what I'm supposed to do. Am I just supposed to talk about it? Or do you want me to close my eyes and pretend I'm there again? The very thought makes me shudder.",
    "Therapist: We'll start with you describing the event in present tense. I'll guide you through it.",
    "Client: Present tense? As if it's happening now? Oh, Dios m\u00edo... I... I'm not sure I can do that. The last time I tried to tell someone about it in detail, I ended up having a panic attack. My daughter had to take me to the emergency room. What if that happens again?",
    "Therapist: I appreciate you sharing that. We have strategies to manage anxiety if it arises.",
    "Client: Strategies? Like what? I've tried deep breathing before, but sometimes it feels like it's not enough. And with my chronic pain, it's hard to focus on anything else when I get upset. How can you be sure this won't make everything worse?",
    "Therapist: We'll use grounding techniques and take breaks as needed. Your safety is my priority.",
    "Client: I see. That does make me feel a bit better. But... how long will this process take? And will I have to do this multiple times? The thought of reliving it once is scary enough, but repeatedly? I'm not sure I have the strength for that.",
    "Therapist: It's a gradual process. We'll work at your comfort level, session by session.",
    "Client: Okay... I think I understand a little better now. It's still frightening, but I want to get better. For my family, for myself. Carlos would have wanted me to move forward. I just... I miss him so much. Even after all these years, the pain is still so raw.",
    "Therapist: Your love for Carlos is evident. This process honors his memory by helping you heal.",
    "Client: You're right. He always encouraged me to be brave. Maybe... maybe this is my way of honoring that. I'm still scared, but I'm willing to try. Can you tell me more about what exactly we'll do in our next session?",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll start slowly, focusing on less distressing parts first. Ready to proceed?",
    "Client: I... I think so. Yes, I'm ready. It won't be easy, but nothing worthwhile ever is, right? Thank you for your patience with me, Dr. Thompson. I appreciate your gentleness in explaining all of this. It means a lot to have someone who understands.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable, Maria. Let's take this journey together, step by step."
