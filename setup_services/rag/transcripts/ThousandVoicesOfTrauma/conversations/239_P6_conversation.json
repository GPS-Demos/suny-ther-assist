    "Therapist: Welcome back, Amir. Today we'll continue with our imaginal exposure exercise. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so... I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control. Let's start with your SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10 right now. Just thinking about revisiting the memory is making me anxious.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day. Describe what you see.",
    "Client: I... I see the dimly lit room. The air is stuffy, and there's a musty smell. I'm huddled in the corner, trying to make myself as small as possible. My heart is racing, and I can hear footsteps approaching.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Fear... overwhelming fear. My palms are sweaty, and I'm trembling. I want to run, but I'm frozen in place. The footsteps are getting louder, and I know what's coming next.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 7. My chest feels tight, and I'm starting to breathe faster.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The door opens, and I see him. He's tall, intimidating. His eyes... they're cold, devoid of any empathy. He reaches for me, and I flinch. I want to scream, but no sound comes out. I feel so helpless, so trapped.",
    "Therapist: What's happening in your body right now?",
    "Client: My stomach is in knots. I feel nauseous, and there's this pressure in my head. It's like I'm reliving it all over again.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's an 8 now. God, this is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Keep breathing. What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he grabs my arm, pulls me up roughly. I can smell alcohol on his breath. He's saying something, but I can't make out the words. Everything feels hazy, like I'm detached from my body. I just want it to be over.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm starting to feel angry. Why did this happen to me? Why couldn't I fight back? My fists are clenched, and I'm grinding my teeth.",
    "Therapist: That anger is a natural response. SUDS?",
    "Client: Still an 8, but it feels different now. More intense, but not just fear anymore.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: He's dragging me out of the room. I can see other kids, their eyes vacant, hopeless. I want to help them, but I can't even help myself. The guilt is overwhelming. I should've done something, anything.",
    "Therapist: Remember, it wasn't your fault. SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually gone down to a 6. Talking about it... it's hard, but I feel less trapped in the memory now.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. How does your body feel?",
    "Client: My breathing is steadier. The knot in my stomach is loosening a bit. I still feel tense, but not as much as before.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's continue for a few more minutes.",
    "Client: Okay. We're outside now. The sunlight is blinding after being in that dark room. I can hear traffic, people going about their day. It's surreal. How can the world just go on when this is happening?",
    "Therapist: What emotions are coming up?",
    "Client: Sadness, mostly. A deep, aching sadness. But also a glimmer of hope. Being outside, seeing normal life... it reminds me that there's a world beyond this nightmare.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5 now. Talking about it... it's helping. It doesn't feel as overwhelming as it did at the start.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well. Let's start wrapping up. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Exhales deeply) That was intense, but... I feel lighter somehow. Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's often how it feels. Final SUDS?",
    "Client: I'd say a 3 now. I'm tired, but it's a good kind of tired. Like I've accomplished something important.",
    "Therapist: You have. We'll end here for today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Drained, but also... hopeful? I didn't think I could face these memories, but I did. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You did all the hard work. We'll continue next session. Take care of yourself this week."
