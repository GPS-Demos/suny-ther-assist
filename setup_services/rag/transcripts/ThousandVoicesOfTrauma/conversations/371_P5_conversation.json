    "Therapist: Welcome, James. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more flashbacks lately, especially at night. It's been affecting my sleep and my work.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Ready to learn more?",
    "Client: I think so. I've heard about it, but I'm not entirely sure what it involves. Can you explain it to me? I'm a bit apprehensive about revisiting the accident.",
    "Therapist: Of course. It's a technique to process traumatic memories. We'll revisit the car accident in a safe space.",
    "Client: Revisit it? I'm not sure I can handle that. I've been trying so hard to avoid thinking about it. The idea of deliberately bringing it up... it's frightening.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. It may be challenging, but it's a crucial step in healing.",
    "Client: I understand, but... what if I completely fall apart? I'm worried about losing control of my emotions, especially given my depression. It's been a struggle lately.",
    "Therapist: I'll be here to support you throughout. We'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: Okay, that's somewhat reassuring. Can you tell me more about what exactly we'll be doing? What should I expect?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the accident in detail. I'll guide you through it, focusing on sensory experiences.",
    "Client: Sensory experiences? You mean like what I saw, heard, and felt? That's... intense. I can already feel my heart racing just thinking about it. How long will this take?",
    "Therapist: We'll start with about 30 minutes today. We can pause if needed.",
    "Client: Thirty minutes feels like an eternity. But I trust you. I'm just worried about how I'll feel afterwards. Will I be able to function normally after the session?",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel emotional. We'll end with grounding exercises to help you transition.",
    "Client: Alright, that sounds helpful. I appreciate your guidance through this. It's not easy, but I'm willing to try. I want to get better, for myself and my family. Is there anything I should do to prepare myself?",
    "Therapist: Just be open and honest. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: I'm as ready as I'll ever be, I suppose. Thank you for your patience and support. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage. Let's start by taking a few deep breaths together."
