    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. I can still feel my heart racing a bit. Going through that memory of being bullied at work, it just brought everything back so vividly. The way my coworkers would whisper and laugh when I walked by, how my supervisor would constantly criticize my work... It's like I was right back there, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most?",
    "Client: The feeling of isolation, I think. Even though I was surrounded by people, I felt so alone. And the shame... God, the shame was overwhelming. I kept thinking, \"What's wrong with me? Why can't I fit in?\" It's like I was back in school all over again, being the odd one out.",
    "Therapist: How does that compare to now?",
    "Client: Well, it's... it's different, but some of those feelings are still there. I mean, I'm in a better place now, studying something I love, but sometimes I still catch myself wondering if I belong. The chronic pain doesn't help either. It's like a constant reminder that I'm different.",
    "Therapist: What helped you get through it then?",
    "Client: I... I guess I just kept pushing through. I'd remind myself that I had value, even if others couldn't see it. And I'd focus on my work, trying to prove myself. But honestly, some days were just about survival.",
    "Therapist: How does revisiting this affect you now?",
    "Client: It's strange. Part of me feels stronger, like I've survived something really tough. But another part feels vulnerable, like that scared person is still inside me. I worry about facing similar situations in the future, especially when I finish my studies and re-enter the workforce.",
    "Therapist: What might help with those worries?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe reminding myself of how far I've come? Or focusing on the support I have now - my family, my spouse. And maybe... maybe being more open about my experiences and needs, instead of trying to hide them like I did before.",
    "Therapist: That's insightful. How else has this process been for you?",
    "Client: It's been harder than I expected, but also... liberating, in a way? Like, facing these memories head-on is terrifying, but it's also making them lose some of their power over me. And talking about it here, in a safe space, it's helping me see things from a different perspective.",
    "Therapist: What's one thing you're learning about yourself?",
    "Client: I think... I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. And maybe my experiences, even the painful ones, have given me a unique perspective that could be valuable. I'm starting to see that my differences aren't necessarily weaknesses.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How will you carry this forward?",
    "Client: I want to work on being kinder to myself, for starters. And maybe find ways to use my experiences to help others who might be going through similar things. I'm thinking about maybe getting involved in advocacy work for workplace inclusivity once I finish my studies.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a positive direction. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. This isn't easy, but I feel like I'm finally starting to process things I've been carrying for years. It's painful, but I think it's necessary. And I'm grateful to have this space to do it in.",
    "Therapist: You're doing important work. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: I'm nervous, but committed. I know it's going to be challenging, but I also feel like I'm finally on a path towards healing. It's like I can see a light at the end of the tunnel, even if it's still far away. I'm ready to keep going.",
    "Therapist: That's great. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... maybe we could delve into how my experiences with bullying have affected my relationships? Especially with my spouse and family. I've noticed I sometimes struggle with trust and vulnerability, and I wonder if that's connected.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a good plan. Anything else?",
    "Client: Not really. Just... I appreciate your patience and guidance through this process. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't judge. I'm looking forward to our next session, even though I know it won't be easy.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue at your pace. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, definitely. Thank you again. I'll try to practice some of the coping strategies we've discussed between now and then. It's a journey, but I'm starting to feel like it's one worth taking."
