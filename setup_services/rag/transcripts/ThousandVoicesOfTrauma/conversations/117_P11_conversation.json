    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like I can still hear the growling and feel the pain in my leg. It's not as intense as when it first happened, but it's definitely there. I keep seeing flashes of the dog's teeth and feeling that moment of panic when I realized I couldn't outrun it.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. I'm usually so in control, you know? But in that moment, I was completely at the mercy of this animal. It's... it's humbling and terrifying at the same time. And the pain... God, the pain was excruciating. I remember thinking, \"This is how I die,\" and feeling so angry that it was happening in such a stupid, random way.",
    "Therapist: How does recalling that anger feel now?",
    "Client: It's still there, but it's different. I'm angry at the situation, at the owner who let their dog off-leash, but I'm also angry at myself for how much this has affected me. I'm a successful professional, for crying out loud! I shouldn't be derailed by a dog bite. But here I am, jumping at every little noise and avoiding parks like the plague.",
    "Therapist: What do you make of that self-judgment?",
    "Client: (sighs) I guess... I guess I'm being too hard on myself. This wasn't just a little nip, it was a serious attack. And with my chronic pain condition, it's made everything so much worse. It's like my body betrayed me twice - once with the chronic pain, and now with this. I feel so vulnerable all the time.",
    "Therapist: How does that vulnerability connect to your PTSD symptoms?",
    "Client: Well, I'm hypervigilant now. Always scanning for potential threats. I have nightmares about being chased or attacked, not just by dogs but by all sorts of things. And the flashbacks... they can be triggered by the smallest things. A dog barking in the distance, the sight of a leash, even the sound of teeth clicking together. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: What have you learned about managing these reactions?",
    "Client: The breathing exercises help, especially when I feel a panic attack coming on. And I've been trying to challenge my thoughts more. Like, when I see a dog and immediately think \"danger,\" I try to remind myself that most dogs are friendly and that I've had positive experiences with them before. It doesn't always work, but... I'm trying.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Sarah. How else has this experience changed you?",
    "Client: (pauses) It's made me realize how fragile life can be, but also how resilient we are. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart, but here I am. And in some ways, it's made me more empathetic. I understand now what it's like to live with constant fear and pain. It's changed how I interact with people, especially at work. I'm more patient, more understanding of people's unseen struggles.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What's your next step?",
    "Client: I want to keep working on this. Maybe... maybe even work up to being around dogs again someday. Not big ones, not yet, but maybe starting with a friend's small, calm dog. And I want to find better ways to manage my chronic pain alongside the PTSD symptoms. They feed into each other, and I need to break that cycle.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a good plan. How can we support that?",
    "Client: Could we maybe focus on more specific coping strategies for when I'm out in public? And perhaps work on some positive visualizations? I'd like to be able to imagine myself feeling safe and calm in situations that currently terrify me.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll start next session. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Drained, but... okay. Better than I expected, actually. Thank you for guiding me through this. It's tough, but I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work, Sarah. See you next week."
