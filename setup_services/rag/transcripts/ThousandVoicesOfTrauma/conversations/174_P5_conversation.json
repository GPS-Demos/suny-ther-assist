    "Therapist: Hello, John. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi, Dr. Thompson. I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. A bit nervous, I guess. I know we've been working up to this, but now that we're here, I'm feeling quite anxious about what's to come.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you ready?",
    "Client: I think so... but can you remind me what exactly we'll be doing? I mean, I know we've talked about it before, but I'm feeling a bit foggy right now.",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll revisit your trauma memory through guided imagery. It helps process emotions and reduce symptoms.",
    "Client: Right, right. And we're focusing on... on the time I was imprisoned as a child, correct? Just thinking about it makes my heart race. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's normal. Your body is reacting to the memory. We'll work through it together.",
    "Client: Okay. I trust you, Dr. Thompson. It's just... it's been so long since I've allowed myself to really think about it. I've spent years trying to push it away, you know?",
    "Therapist: I understand. Avoidance is common, but confronting memories can lead to healing. How do you feel about starting?",
    "Client: I'm scared, but I want to get better. This... this constant fear and these nightmares, they're exhausting. I'm ready to try anything that might help. What should I expect during the session?",
    "Therapist: You'll describe the event in detail. It may be distressing, but I'll guide you through. We'll take breaks if needed.",
    "Client: Alright. And you'll be here the whole time, right? I don't think I could do this alone.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'll be here throughout. Your safety and comfort are my priority. Any other concerns?",
    "Client: I guess I'm worried about... losing control. What if I can't handle it? What if I completely fall apart?",
    "Therapist: That's a valid concern. Remember, you're in control. We can stop anytime. Your resilience may surprise you.",
    "Client: Thank you, that helps. I suppose I'm as ready as I'll ever be. How do we start?",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes, get comfortable. We'll begin with a relaxation exercise, then slowly approach the memory.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm taking a deep breath. It's strange, I feel scared but also... hopeful? Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. Hope is powerful. Your courage is admirable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do this. I want to face this and move forward with my life. I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Remember, you're safe here. Let's start with some deep breaths..."
