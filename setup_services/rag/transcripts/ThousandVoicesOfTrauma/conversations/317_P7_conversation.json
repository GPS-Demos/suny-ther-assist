    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. I know we're going to be talking about some difficult stuff.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We're here to support you.",
    "Client: Thanks. I guess we're going to talk about the cyber bullying, right? It's been on my mind a lot lately.",
    "Therapist: Yes, if you're ready. Take a deep breath and describe the experience.",
    "Client: Okay... It started about a year ago. I was active on this online forum for students. At first, it was great, you know? Sharing ideas, getting help with assignments. But then this group of users started targeting me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: They'd mock everything I posted. They'd twist my words, make fun of my opinions. It got to the point where I'd spend hours agonizing over every comment I made, trying to make it \"bully-proof.\"",
    "Therapist: That must have been exhausting. What else do you remember?",
    "Client: I remember this one night... I had posted about struggling with a particularly difficult assignment. Instead of help, I got a barrage of comments calling me stupid, saying I didn't belong in college. Someone even said... they said I should just give up and drop out.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What were you feeling?",
    "Client: I felt... God, I felt so small. So worthless. My chest felt tight, and I couldn't breathe properly. I remember staring at my screen, reading those comments over and over, my vision blurring with tears.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. These feelings are valid.",
    "Client: It's hard to talk about. I... I started to believe them, you know? Maybe I really wasn't smart enough. Maybe I didn't belong. I stopped participating in class, stopped reaching out to classmates. I was so afraid of being judged or mocked.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How did it affect your daily life?",
    "Client: It affected everything. I'd wake up dreading to check my phone or laptop. Every notification made my heart race. I'd imagine more cruel comments waiting for me. I started isolating myself, even from my roommates. I was always on edge, always anxious.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's still hard to talk about. The worst part was feeling so alone. I didn't want to tell anyone because I felt ashamed. Like somehow it was my fault, you know?",
    "Therapist: It's important to remember it wasn't your fault. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Talking about it... it's bringing back a lot of those feelings. The anxiety, the shame. But also... I don't know, maybe a bit of relief? Like I'm finally letting it out.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're doing really well.",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how it changed me. I used to be outgoing, confident in my abilities. But after months of this, I became a shell of myself. I was constantly second-guessing everything I said or did, online and in real life.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to acknowledge how it affected you. Keep going.",
    "Client: There was this one comment that really got to me. Someone said I was \"a waste of space\" and that \"the world would be better off without people like me.\" That... that really messed me up. I couldn't shake it off.",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly painful. How did you cope?",
    "Client: Not well, honestly. I started having trouble sleeping. When I did sleep, I'd have nightmares about being chased or attacked. I'd wake up in cold sweats. During the day, I was constantly exhausted and on edge.",
    "Therapist: You've been through a lot. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. Talking about it is bringing back a lot of those feelings. My heart's racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. But also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I'm finally letting some of this out.",
    "Therapist: That's completely normal. You're doing great, John.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's weird, you know? These people I never met in real life had such a huge impact on me. They made me doubt everything about myself. My intelligence, my worth, my right to even exist. How messed up is that?",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to feel that way. You're very strong for sharing this.",
    "Client: I guess... I guess I'm still trying to undo the damage. Some days are better than others. I still struggle with self-doubt, especially in academic settings. But I'm trying to remind myself that those bullies were wrong about me.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it feel to say that?",
    "Client: It feels... good, actually. A bit scary, but good. Like I'm taking back some control. I know logically that they were wrong, but emotionally... it's still a work in progress.",
    "Therapist: That's perfectly okay. You're making great progress.",
    "Client: Thanks. I think... I think talking about it like this is helping. It's hard, and it brings up a lot of emotions, but it also feels like I'm finally confronting it instead of trying to bury it.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent observation, John. We're almost out of time. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm feeling drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a bit stronger? Like I've faced something I've been avoiding for a long time. It's overwhelming, but I think it's good.",
    "Therapist: That's a very positive outlook. We'll continue next session. Well done today."
