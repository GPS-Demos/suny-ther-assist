    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the scene?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in my home country. It's night, and I can hear gunshots in the distance. I'm huddled in a corner of our small apartment with my family. We're trying to stay quiet, but my heart is racing so fast I feel like they might hear it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: The room is dark, but I can see the fear in my mother's eyes. She's holding my little brother, trying to keep him calm. I can smell the sweat and fear. My father is by the window, peeking through a small gap in the curtains. Every time there's a loud noise, we all flinch.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I can feel my legs cramping from sitting in the same position for so long. My mouth is dry, and I'm so thirsty, but we're afraid to move. The air feels thick and heavy. I'm terrified that at any moment, the door might burst open and...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. It's okay to feel these emotions.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) I... I don't know if I can continue. It's too much.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a deep breath. Can you stay with it a little longer?",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay... I'll try. As we sit there, I can hear my mother whispering prayers. Her voice is barely audible, but it's somehow comforting. I'm trying to focus on her words, but my mind keeps racing, thinking about what might happen if we're discovered.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud crash nearby. It sounds like it's just down the street. My little brother starts to cry, and my mother quickly puts her hand over his mouth. I can see tears streaming down her face. I want to comfort them, but I'm frozen in fear.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel scared. You're doing an excellent job describing this.",
    "Client: The sounds of chaos outside are getting louder. People are screaming, and I can hear vehicles screeching. My father turns to us and whispers that we need to leave. We've been preparing for this moment, but now that it's here, I'm paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I... I feel like I'm there again. My heart is pounding, and my hands are shaking. But I also feel a strange sense of relief, like I'm finally letting this out after keeping it bottled up for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're doing incredibly well.",
    "Client: We quickly gather our pre-packed bags. They're small - just essentials. As we prepare to leave, I look around our home, knowing we might never see it again. I grab a family photo from the shelf, my hands trembling as I stuff it into my bag.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel emotional. You're safe here, remembering.",
    "Client: As we step outside, the cool night air hits my face. The street is chaotic - people running, crying, shouting. We join the stream of people fleeing, holding onto each other tightly. I keep looking back, watching our home, our life, disappear into the distance.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. I feel a mix of sadness, fear, and anger. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe resilience? We survived that night. We made it out.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. You've done exceptionally well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to talk about, but I feel like I'm starting to process it better. Is it normal to feel both drained and somewhat relieved after talking about this?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Those feelings are common. How would you like to end our session?",
    "Client: I think I need a moment to just sit quietly and ground myself. Can we do that breathing exercise we practiced last time?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's begin with a deep breath..."
