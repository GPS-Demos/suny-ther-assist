    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like my whole body is vibrating. The memory of that day in Afghanistan, it's so vivid now. I can still hear the explosions, smell the dust and gunpowder. It's like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Overwhelming fear. It's like a cold fist gripping my heart. I know I'm safe here, but my body doesn't seem to believe it. I keep expecting to hear gunfire or feel the ground shake from another IED.",
    "Therapist: How does that fear manifest in your body?",
    "Client: My hands are clammy, and my heart's racing. I feel this tightness in my chest, like I can't get enough air. And my muscles are so tense, especially in my shoulders and jaw. It's like I'm ready to run or fight at any moment.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"I shouldn't be here. I don't deserve to be safe when others didn't make it.\" And then there's this voice saying, \"You should have done more. You could have saved them.\" It's irrational, I know, but it feels so real.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts relate to your childhood experiences?",
    "Client: I... I never thought about it that way before. But now that you mention it, it's similar to how I felt when my dad would drink. I always thought I should be able to stop him, to protect my mum and siblings. It's that same feeling of responsibility, of not being enough.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: There's this... guilt. It's heavy, like a weight on my chest. I feel guilty for surviving when others didn't. And... I feel guilty for feeling scared now, like I'm betraying my training or something. It's all mixed up with anger too - at the situation, at myself.",
    "Therapist: How does this compare to previous exposures?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a bit easier this time. Don't get me wrong, it's still intense, but I feel like I can breathe through it a bit better. The first few times we did this, I felt like I was drowning in the memories. Now, it's more like... I'm watching them from the shore. Still scary, but I feel a bit more in control.",
    "Therapist: What's helping you feel more in control?",
    "Client: I think... it's the grounding techniques we've practiced. Focusing on my breath, feeling my feet on the floor. And reminding myself that I'm here, in this room, not back there. It's like... I can acknowledge the memory without getting completely lost in it.",
    "Therapist: How does that feel?",
    "Client: It feels... empowering, I guess? Like I'm taking back some control. But it's also scary in a different way. If I'm not defined by this trauma, by being a soldier... who am I? It's opening up all these questions about my identity.",
    "Therapist: What do you mean by that?",
    "Client: Well, for so long, being a soldier was everything. It was how I defined myself, how I made sense of the world. Now, as I'm processing all this, I'm realizing there's more to me. But that's terrifying too. It's like... I'm shedding an old skin, but I don't know what's underneath yet.",
    "Therapist: How does this relate to your current life?",
    "Client: It's affecting everything. My relationship, my work, how I see myself. I've been pushing people away, afraid to get close. And work... I struggle to focus sometimes, get easily startled. But there are good changes too. I'm starting to imagine a future that isn't dominated by this trauma. It's scary, but also... hopeful?",
    "Therapist: What does that hope feel like?",
    "Client: It's... warm. Like a small flame in my chest. It's fragile, and sometimes I'm afraid to acknowledge it in case it goes out. But it's there. Hope that maybe I can have a life that isn't defined by what happened. That I can be more than my trauma.",
    "Therapist: How can you nurture that hope?",
    "Client: I think... by continuing this work, as hard as it is. By being honest with myself and others about what I'm going through. Maybe by reconnecting with some of the things I used to enjoy before all this. And by reminding myself that healing isn't linear. It's okay to have bad days.",
    "Therapist: What's your biggest takeaway from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... it's that I'm stronger than I thought. That I can face these memories and not be completely overwhelmed by them. And that there's more to me than just my trauma. It's a lot to process, but it feels like a step forward.",
