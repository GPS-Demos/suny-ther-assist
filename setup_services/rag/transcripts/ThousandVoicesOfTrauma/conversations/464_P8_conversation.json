    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also kind of foggy. I can still see flashes of that day, you know? The crowded boat, the smell of saltwater mixed with sweat and fear. My heart's still pounding a bit.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Guilt, I think. It's overwhelming. I keep thinking about the people we left behind. My cousin... he couldn't make it onto the boat. I see his face, the desperation in his eyes as we pulled away from the shore. I should have done more to help him.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really difficult. How does that guilt feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like a heavy weight on my chest. My shoulders feel tense, and there's this knot in my stomach that won't go away. I feel... I feel like I can't breathe properly. It's like I'm back on that boat, gasping for air in the cramped space.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep hearing the screams, the crying children. I think... I think I'm a coward for leaving. Maybe if I'd stayed, I could have made a difference. But then I remember the violence, the constant fear, and I know we had no choice. It's just... it's all so confusing.",
    "Therapist: How do these memories connect to your current experiences?",
    "Client: I guess... well, I still feel like I'm running sometimes. Like I don't deserve to be safe when others aren't. It affects my relationships, you know? I find it hard to get close to people here. Part of me is always waiting for everything to fall apart again.",
    "Therapist: I see. What else comes up for you?",
    "Client: There's this... anger. Not just at the situation, but at myself. I was so helpless, so powerless. I couldn't protect anyone, not even myself. And now, even though I'm here, I still feel that way sometimes. Like I'm not in control of my own life.",
    "Therapist: How does acknowledging that anger feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a bit liberating. I've been trying to push it down for so long, telling myself I should just be grateful. But it's there, you know? The anger, the frustration, the fear. It's all tangled up together.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your body now?",
    "Client: My breathing's a bit easier. The knot in my stomach is still there, but it's not as tight. My hands are shaking a little, though. It's like my body doesn't know whether to relax or stay on high alert.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What else are you aware of?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm actually feeling a bit proud, I think. Not of what happened, but of surviving it. Of making it here, of sitting in this room and facing these memories. It's hard, but I'm doing it. That's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How does that pride sit with the other emotions?",
    "Client: It's strange. It's like they're all competing for space. The guilt is still there, and the fear, but this little spark of pride is there too. It's confusing, but... maybe it's okay to feel all of these things at once?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What do you make of that?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe it means I'm more complex than I thought. That my experiences don't fit into neat little boxes. It's uncomfortable, but also kind of freeing. Like I don't have to be just one thing - a victim, a survivor, a refugee. I can be all of those things and more.",
    "Therapist: How does this realization affect your view of yourself?",
    "Client: It's... it's challenging what I thought I knew about myself. I've been so focused on the negative, on what I've lost or what I think I did wrong. But maybe there's more to me than that. Maybe I'm stronger than I give myself credit for.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful shift. What feelings come up as you consider this?",
    "Client: Hope, I think. And a bit of fear too. It's like... if I accept that I'm more than just my trauma, then I have to face the future. I have to think about who I want to be, not just who my experiences have made me. It's exciting, but also terrifying.",
    "Therapist: How might this new perspective influence your daily life?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe I could start small. Like, allowing myself to enjoy things without feeling guilty. Or reaching out to people more, even if it's scary. Maybe I could even think about my future here, about building a life, not just surviving.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like meaningful steps. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: It's overwhelming, but in a different way than before. It's like... like I'm standing at the edge of something new. I'm scared, but there's a part of me that wants to take that step forward. To see what I could become if I'm not held back by the past.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful image. What supports do you need to take that step?",
    "Client: I think... I need to keep doing this work, facing these memories. But I also need to start building a life here. Maybe join some community groups, meet other people who've been through similar experiences. And... I think I need to be kinder to myself. To remember that healing isn't linear.",
    "Therapist: Those are insightful reflections. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... lighter, somehow. Like I've put down a weight I didn't even know I was carrying. There's still so much to process, but for the first time in a long while, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can handle it.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to explore more about building a life here. How to balance honoring my past with creating a future. And maybe... maybe we could talk more about self-compassion. I think I need to work on that.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How do you want to close today's session?",
    "Client: Could we... could we just sit in silence for a moment? I need to let all of this settle. And maybe... maybe end with a grounding exercise? I want to leave feeling centered, you know?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's do that."
