    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Um, honestly? I'm a bit on edge. This whole process of talking about... you know, everything that happened... it's still pretty overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I guess so. Yeah, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I'm in the camp. It's early morning, and the air is thick with fog. I can smell damp earth and woodsmoke. There's a constant low hum of voices, people stirring, getting ready for another day of... of just existing, I guess.",
    "Therapist: Good. What are you doing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm helping my little sister get dressed. She's only six, and she's shivering. Our tent doesn't keep out much of the cold. I'm trying to be quiet because Mom is still asleep. She was up all night, coughing again.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Worried. Always worried. About Mom, about my sister, about... everything. My stomach is in knots, and I feel this heaviness in my chest.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you?",
    "Client: Maybe... 60? It's not great, but I can handle it.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I step outside the tent. The ground is muddy, and it squelches under my shoes. I see the long lines already forming at the food distribution point. God, I hate those lines. The pushing, the desperation...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I can hear people arguing. There's never enough food, you know? I see this old man, he's yelling at one of the aid workers. His face is red, and he's gesturing wildly. I feel... I feel so angry. We shouldn't have to live like this.",
    "Therapist: Your anger is valid. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's climbing. Maybe 75? My hands are starting to shake a little.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm in line now. It's moving so slowly. I can feel the sun starting to beat down, and the air is getting thick and heavy. Someone bumps into me from behind, and I stumble. I turn around, ready to snap at them, but it's just a little kid. He looks up at me with these huge, scared eyes, and suddenly I feel... I feel so ashamed.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I'm thinking about how I used to be back home. I was never angry like this. I was... I was kind. Patient. Now I'm just... always on edge. Always ready to fight. I hate what this place is turning me into.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it make you feel?",
    "Client: It... it hurts. Like, physically hurts. My chest feels tight, and I want to cry, but I can't. Not here, not in front of everyone.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's pretty high. Maybe 85? I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Let's take a moment. Focus on your breath. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... okay. I'm... I'm still in line. The sun is getting hotter. I can feel sweat trickling down my back. I'm... I'm thinking about home. About my school, my friends. It feels like a different life, you know? Like it happened to someone else.",
    "Therapist: That disconnection is common. Keep going.",
    "Client: I finally get to the front of the line. The aid worker looks tired. He barely looks at me as he hands me our rations. It's... it's not enough. It's never enough. I want to beg for more, but I know it won't make a difference. I... I feel so powerless.",
    "Therapist: How's your body feeling?",
    "Client: Tense. My shoulders are up around my ears, and my jaw hurts from clenching it. I... I want to scream, or hit something, but I just... I just take the food and walk away.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still pretty high. Maybe 80? I'm feeling a bit dizzy.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I'm walking back to our tent. The camp is fully awake now. I can hear children crying, people arguing. There's this... this oppressive feeling in the air. Like hope is something that doesn't exist here.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. Describe it more.",
    "Client: It's... it's like a weight. Like I'm carrying this massive boulder on my shoulders. Every step is a struggle. I... I start to feel angry again. At the people who did this to us, at the world for not caring enough. I... I want to lash out, but I know I can't.",
    "Therapist: How are you coping with these feelings?",
    "Client: I... I'm trying to focus on my breathing. On putting one foot in front of the other. I'm... I'm thinking about my sister. How I need to be strong for her. But it's... it's so hard.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. How's your distress?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 75? My heart is racing, but I feel a little more in control.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens when you get back to the tent?",
    "Client: I... I duck inside. It's dark and stuffy. Mom is awake now, sitting up on her cot. She looks... she looks so tired. So defeated. I hand her the rations, and she just... she just starts to cry. Silently. And I... I don't know what to do.",
    "Therapist: What do you want to do in that moment?",
    "Client: I... I want to comfort her. To tell her everything will be okay. But I can't. Because I don't believe it myself. So I just... I just sit next to her and hold her hand. And we cry together.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful moment. How does it make you feel?",
    "Client: It... it breaks my heart. But at the same time, there's this... this tiny spark of warmth. Like, even in this horrible place, we still have each other. It's... it's not much, but it's something.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually gone down a bit. Maybe 65? I feel sad, but also... I don't know. Maybe a little hopeful?",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing these emotions well. What happens next?",
    "Client: The rest of the day is... it's just a blur of monotony. Trying to keep my sister entertained. Helping Mom. Fetching water. It's... it's exhausting. By the time night falls, I'm... I'm completely drained.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel at the end of the day?",
    "Client: Heavy. Like every muscle is made of lead. My head is pounding, and my eyes are gritty from the dust. I... I just want to sleep, but I know I can't. Not really.",
    "Therapist: Why can't you sleep?",
    "Client: The nightmares. They... they come every night. Sometimes it's memories of the journey here. Sometimes it's... it's worse. Imagining what could happen. I... I wake up screaming sometimes.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. How do you cope?",
    "Client: I... I try to stay awake as long as I can. I count the stars through the holes in the tent. I... I make up stories in my head. About a different life, a better future. It... it helps, sometimes.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually not too bad. Maybe 50? Talking about it... it helps. Makes it feel less overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's start wrapping up. Can you bring yourself back to the present moment?",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, I can. I'm... I'm here. In your office. It's... it's over.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. But also... I don't know. Maybe a little lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after these sessions. You've done excellent work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's... it's still hard. But I think it's getting easier.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. We'll end here for today. Remember to practice your coping strategies, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Okay. Thanks, doc. See you then."
