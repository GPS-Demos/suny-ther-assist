    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Rahul?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken up, to be honest. It's like I was right back there in that moment, you know? My heart's still racing a bit. It's strange how vivid it all becomes when I close my eyes and really focus on the memory.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you this time?",
    "Client: The sounds, I think. The crash of the window breaking, their footsteps on the stairs. It's like I could hear it all happening again. And the fear... that paralyzing fear when I realized what was happening. I felt so helpless, just like I did that night.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that helplessness?",
    "Client: It was... intense. Really uncomfortable. But, you know, it wasn't as overwhelming as I thought it would be. I mean, don't get me wrong, it was still difficult, but I felt like I could handle it better this time. Maybe because I knew I was safe here, with you.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Rahul. What do you think helped?",
    "Client: I think... well, remembering the breathing exercises we practiced helped a lot. When I felt my heart racing, I tried to focus on my breath, just like we've been working on. It didn't make the fear go away completely, but it helped me stay present, if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: It does. How else has this affected you?",
    "Client: Well, I've noticed that I'm not as jumpy at night anymore. Before, every little sound would set me off, thinking it was another break-in. But now, I can rationalize better. I still check the locks, but I'm not constantly on edge like I used to be.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. How does that feel?",
    "Client: It feels... liberating, actually. Like I'm slowly taking back control of my life. I mean, I still have moments where the fear creeps in, especially when I'm alone at night. But it's not consuming me like it used to.",
    "Therapist: What's helped with those moments?",
    "Client: The grounding techniques we've practiced have been really helpful. When I start to feel panicky, I try to focus on my surroundings, name things I can see, touch, hear. It helps bring me back to the present.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Any challenges you're still facing?",
    "Client: Yeah, I still struggle with trusting people. Especially new people in my shared accommodation. I know it's not rational, but there's always this nagging fear that they might... you know, hurt me or break in.",
    "Therapist: How have you been managing that?",
    "Client: I've been trying to challenge those thoughts, like we discussed. Reminding myself that not everyone is a threat. It's hard, but I'm working on it. I've even started having short conversations with my housemates, which is a big step for me.",
    "Therapist: That's commendable, Rahul. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I think... I want to work on feeling more comfortable being alone at night. Maybe gradually reducing my checking behaviors? I know it won't be easy, but I feel ready to try.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a good goal. How can we support that?",
    "Client: Could we maybe come up with a plan? Like, steps to reduce my checking without increasing my anxiety too much? I think having a structured approach would help me feel more in control.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's work on that next session.",
    "Client: Great, thank you. You know, going through this process... it's tough, but I'm starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel. I didn't think that was possible when we first started.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad you're feeling hopeful. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For guiding me through this. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I might actually be able to move past this trauma.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work, Rahul. We'll continue next week."
