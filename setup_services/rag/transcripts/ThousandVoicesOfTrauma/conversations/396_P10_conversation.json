    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. T\u0101ne. How are you feeling about our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to face this, but another part is terrified. My hands are already shaking a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0-100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 60. My heart's racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Remember, we can pause anytime. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Yes, I think so.",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day in the refugee camp. Describe what you see and feel.",
    "Client: I... I'm in the tent. It's hot, so bloody hot. The air is thick with dust and sweat. I can hear children crying in the distance. My wife, Aroha, she's sitting next to me, holding our grandson. Her face is... it's drawn, tired. We've been here for weeks now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: There's shouting outside. Men's voices, angry. I tell Aroha to stay inside with the little one. I... I step out of the tent. The sun is blinding. I see a group of men, they're not from our camp. They're armed.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My stomach's in knots. I feel... I feel helpless. Scared.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember, you're safe here. Take a deep breath. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I try to reason with them. I hold up my hands, tell them we have nothing of value. But they're not listening. One of them, he's young, maybe 20, he pushes me. Hard. I fall.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What sensations do you feel?",
    "Client: The ground is hard, rocky. It scrapes my palms. I taste dust in my mouth. And then... oh god...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Mr. T\u0101ne. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 80. This is when it gets bad.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here in a safe place. Can you feel the chair beneath you?",
    "Client: Yes... yes, I can.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: The young one, he starts kicking me. I curl up, trying to protect myself. I can hear Aroha screaming from inside the tent. The other men, they're ransacking our few belongings. I... I feel so powerless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: It feels like forever, but it probably only lasts a few minutes. They leave, taking what little food we had. I'm lying there, everything hurts. Aroha rushes out, she's crying. Our grandson is wailing. I... I couldn't protect them.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Ashamed. Angry. I was supposed to be the protector, but I couldn't do anything.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are valid. Remember, you survived. What do you do after they leave?",
    "Client: I... I struggle to my feet. Aroha helps me back into the tent. She's trying to be strong, but I can see the fear in her eyes. Our grandson, he's too young to understand, but he's upset by all the commotion.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... we can't stay here. It's not safe. But where can we go? We've already lost so much. I feel... lost. Hopeless.",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly difficult. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 85. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Let's take a moment. Focus on your breath. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: (Breathing deeply) Okay... okay. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: The next few days are a blur. We're all on edge, jumping at every sound. I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see those men. I feel the kicks. The shame... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: How does that shame manifest in your body?",
    "Client: It's like a weight on my chest. My shoulders are hunched. I can't look Aroha in the eye. I've failed her, failed our family.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens in the following days?",
    "Client: We... we make the decision to leave. It's risky, but staying feels riskier. We gather what little we have left. Aroha, she's so strong. She keeps us going. We join a group heading towards the border.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling as you leave?",
    "Client: Fear. Hope. Guilt for leaving others behind. The journey is... it's grueling. The heat, the dust, the constant fear of being turned back or attacked again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 75. My heart's still racing, but I feel... I feel a bit more in control.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Take another deep breath. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: We walk for days. Our grandson, he's so brave, but I can see the toll it's taking. We run out of water at one point. I... I give my share to Aroha and the little one. I feel dizzy, weak.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in that moment?",
    "Client: My throat is parched. My feet are blistered and bleeding. Every step is agony. But I keep going. I have to.",
    "Therapist: You showed incredible strength. What happens next?",
    "Client: We reach a border crossing. There are so many people. We wait for hours in the blistering sun. I'm terrified they'll turn us away. When it's our turn, I... I beg the officials. I show them our grandson, tell them our story.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel in that moment of uncertainty?",
    "Client: Desperate. Helpless again. But also... determined. I won't let my family be turned away. I can't.",
    "Therapist: And what happens?",
    "Client: They... they let us through. I can hardly believe it. Aroha, she starts crying. I do too. It's not the end of our journey, but it feels like... like a new beginning.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful moment. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 65. I feel... I feel drained, but also relieved.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Feel your feet on the floor, your back against the chair.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Thank you. This... this was hard, but I feel like I've faced something important.",
    "Therapist: You have. How are you feeling overall now?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... lighter somehow. Like I've shed a weight I've been carrying for years.",
    "Therapist: That's common after these sessions. Remember to be kind to yourself this week. We'll process this more next time.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think this is helping. It's hard, but I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. Let's end our session here. Well done, Mr. T\u0101ne."
