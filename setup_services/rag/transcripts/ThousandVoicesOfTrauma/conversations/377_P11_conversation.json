    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving that hostage situation, it brings back so many memories and emotions I've tried to push away for years. I can still feel the tension in my body, you know? Like I'm still there, waiting for something terrible to happen.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The silence. It was deafening. I remember thinking, \"Is this how it ends?\" Every little sound made me jump. I kept imagining my family, wondering if I'd ever see them again. It's... it's hard to shake that feeling of helplessness.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to share that now?",
    "Client: It's... strange. Part of me feels relieved, like I'm finally letting it out. But another part feels vulnerable, exposed. I've spent so long trying to be strong for everyone else, you know? Especially after the divorce. My kids, they rely on me. But going through this, it's like I'm that scared person again.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does this connect to your daily life?",
    "Client: Well, I... I guess I'm always on edge. Even at my part-time job or when I'm with my family, I'm constantly scanning for threats. It's exhausting. And the nightmares... they've gotten worse since we started these sessions. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: It can be. How are you coping?",
    "Client: I've been trying those breathing exercises you taught me. They help sometimes, but other times... I just feel so alone. Like no one can understand what I went through. Being South Asian, there's this expectation to just... get over it, you know? But I can't. It's like that experience is etched into my very being.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage. What's helping you continue?",
    "Client: I... I want to be better for my family. And for myself. I'm tired of feeling like a victim. Every time we do these sessions, it's hard, but... I also feel like I'm reclaiming a part of myself. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What else have you noticed?",
    "Client: I've started writing again. Just little things, but it helps. And I'm trying to be more open with my kids about how I'm feeling. It's not easy, but... it feels right. Like I'm finally acknowledging this part of me instead of hiding it.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. How can we build on this?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe we could work on ways for me to feel safer in public? And... I think I want to try connecting with other survivors. Is that something you could help with?",
    "Therapist: Certainly. Any other thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in years, I feel like there might be a light at the end of this very dark tunnel. It's scary, but... I'm ready to keep going.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've done something important today. I'm nervous about what comes next, but also... hopeful? It's a strange mix of emotions.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Take care, see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'll keep working on those exercises we discussed. And... I'll try to be kinder to myself. Baby steps, right? See you next week."
