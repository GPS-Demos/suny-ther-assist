    "Therapist: Welcome, James. Today we'll be doing an imaginal exposure exercise. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm a bit nervous, to be honest.",
    "Therapist: That's completely normal. Remember, you're in control. Let's start with your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10 right now. Just thinking about it makes me a bit anxious.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and bring up the memory. Describe what you see.",
    "Client: I'm... I'm sitting at my computer. It's late, maybe around midnight. I've just gotten a notification on my social media. My heart is starting to race a bit as I click on it.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going.",
    "Client: It's... it's another message. From them. The group that's been harassing me online. They've posted more... more private photos. Photos from when... when the abuse happened. I feel sick to my stomach. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Maybe a 7? I can feel my chest tightening.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: I... I want to cry. I feel so exposed, so violated. Again. It's like I'm reliving the abuse all over again, but now everyone can see it. I'm scrolling through the comments. People are laughing, making jokes. I feel so alone.",
    "Therapist: What are you noticing in your body?",
    "Client: My throat feels tight. I'm having trouble swallowing. My palms are sweaty, and I feel like I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. God, this is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I close the laptop. I can't look anymore. But I know it's still there. I can't escape it. I curl up on my bed, hugging my knees to my chest. I feel so small, so powerless. I want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking, \"Why me? Why is this happening again?\" I feel so ashamed, even though I know it's not my fault. I'm angry too, at the people who are sharing these photos, at the person who abused me in the first place. But mostly, I just feel... broken.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still an 8. Maybe even a 9. I'm shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: I... I remember calling my partner. They came over right away. Just hearing their voice made me feel a little less alone. They held me while I cried. I felt so vulnerable, but also... loved. Protected.",
    "Therapist: How does that change your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7 now. I can breathe a little easier.",
    "Therapist: That's good. What happened next?",
    "Client: We... we reported the posts. Blocked the accounts. My partner helped me contact a lawyer. I felt like I was taking back some control. But I was still scared. Anxious about what might happen next.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. My SUDS is probably around a 5 now. Talking about it... it's hard, but it also feels like I'm facing it. Not running away.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How do you want to close this exercise?",
    "Client: I think... I want to remind myself that I'm not alone. That what happened wasn't my fault. And that I'm taking steps to heal.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's take a few deep breaths together."
