    "Therapist: How are you feeling after going through that memory today?",
    "Client: (sighs deeply) It's... it's intense. I can still feel my heart racing a bit. That moment when the dog lunged at me, it's like I was right back there in our neighbor's yard. I could smell the grass, feel the summer heat. It's strange how vivid it all becomes.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The fear. It was overwhelming. I remember freezing, not being able to move or scream. And then the pain when its teeth sank into my arm. (voice trembles) I felt so helpless, so small. It's like... like I was that scared little boy all over again.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for facing this. How does it compare to your day-to-day experiences?",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) It's... it's similar, in a way. That feeling of helplessness, it creeps up on me sometimes. Like when I'm at work and feel overwhelmed, or when I argue with my wife. I just... shut down. But reliving it here, it's more intense, more raw.",
    "Therapist: I see. How do you think this connects to your recovery?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe understanding where these feelings come from might help me deal with them better? (pauses) It's hard to admit, but sometimes I use alcohol to numb these feelings. Maybe if I can face them head-on, I won't need to do that as much.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. What else did you notice?",
    "Client: I realized how much anger I still carry. Not just towards the dog, but towards my parents for not protecting me, for brushing it off like it wasn't a big deal. (voice rises) They told me to \"man up,\" can you believe that? I was just a kid!",
    "Therapist: It sounds like you're connecting with some important emotions. How does that feel?",
    "Client: It's... liberating, in a way. Scary, but also like a weight is lifting. I've never really allowed myself to be angry about it before. Always thought I was being silly for letting it affect me so much. But now I see it wasn't just about the dog attack, it was about feeling unprotected, invalidated.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What do you think you need moving forward?",
    "Client: (thoughtfully) I think... I need to learn how to comfort that scared little boy inside me. To tell him it's okay to be afraid, that it doesn't make him weak. And maybe... maybe I need to have an honest conversation with my parents about how their reaction affected me.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like important steps. How can we support you in this process?",
    "Client: I'd like to keep working on processing these memories, as hard as it is. And maybe... maybe we could explore some strategies for managing my anxiety and urge to drink when these feelings come up? I want to be stronger for my family, to break this cycle.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll continue to work on that. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted, honestly. But also... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful? Like I'm finally starting to understand myself better. It's tough, but I think it's worth it.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. What's one thing you'd like to remember from today's session?",
    "Client: (pauses, then speaks slowly) That my feelings are valid. That what happened to me was significant, and it's okay that it affected me deeply. I don't need to keep minimizing it or pushing it away.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful takeaway. How will you care for yourself today?",
    "Client: I think I'll call my sponsor when I get home. Maybe go for a walk with my wife, if she's up for it. Just... try to be gentle with myself.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a good plan. Remember, you're making progress. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yeah, definitely. Thank you for... for helping me through this. It means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and we'll continue this work in our next session."
