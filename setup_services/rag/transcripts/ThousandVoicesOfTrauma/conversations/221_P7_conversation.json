    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure exercise. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the incident with the police?",
    "Client: Okay... I was at a protest against the war. It was supposed to be peaceful, but things got out of hand. I saw the police approaching, and suddenly I was back in the war zone. My heart started racing...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The sound of their boots on the pavement... it was just like the sound of soldiers marching. I froze, I couldn't move. Then I heard shouting, and saw batons raised. It was like watching my fellow soldiers being attacked all over again.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that memory. What happened next?",
    "Client: I... I panicked. I tried to run, but someone grabbed me from behind. I felt hands on my arms, rough and strong. I started struggling, screaming. In my mind, I was back in combat, fighting for my life.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep describing what you experienced.",
    "Client: The grip on my arms tightened. I heard someone yelling, \"Stop resisting!\" But all I could hear was the sound of gunfire and explosions from my time in the war. I felt so helpless, so scared...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I was thrown to the ground, hard. The impact knocked the wind out of me. I felt a knee on my back, pressing down. I couldn't breathe. It was like being trapped under rubble after an explosion all over again.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: I... I started crying. Begging them to stop. But they didn't listen. They put handcuffs on me, so tight they cut into my wrists. The cold metal... it reminded me of the time I was captured during the war.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. Continue.",
    "Client: They lifted me up roughly and started dragging me away. I was disoriented, scared. People were shouting all around me. It felt like I was being taken prisoner again. I kept thinking, \"This can't be happening. Not here. Not in my own country.\"",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job. How did you feel then?",
    "Client: I felt betrayed. Angry. Terrified. These were supposed to be the people protecting us, but they were acting just like the enemy I fought against. I couldn't understand why they were treating me like this. I hadn't done anything wrong.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those feelings. Keep going.",
    "Client: They threw me into the back of a police van. The doors slammed shut, and I was in darkness. The van started moving, and I could hear the engine rumbling. It was just like being transported in a military vehicle, not knowing where I was going or what would happen to me.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. What happened next?",
    "Client: I... I started hyperventilating. My chest felt tight, and I couldn't catch my breath. I was sure I was going to die in that van. All I could think about were the horrors I'd seen in war, and now it felt like I was reliving them all over again.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I don't know how long I was in there. It felt like hours. When they finally let me out, I was at the police station. The bright lights, the noise, the people... it was overwhelming. I couldn't stop shaking. I kept looking for ways to escape, just like I did when I was in enemy territory.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. How did you feel then?",
    "Client: I felt... broken. Like everything I'd fought for, everything I'd believed in, was a lie. I'd come home from war thinking I was safe, but now I felt just as threatened here as I did on the battlefield. It was like my world had shattered all over again.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. You're very strong.",
    "Client: The worst part was feeling so powerless. In combat, at least I had my training, my weapon. But here, I had nothing. I was at their mercy, just like when I was a prisoner of war. It brought back all those feelings of helplessness and fear.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory courageously. Continue.",
    "Client: They eventually released me without charges, but the damage was done. For weeks after, I couldn't sleep. Every time I heard a siren or saw a police officer, I'd have a panic attack. I felt like I was constantly on high alert, just like in the war zone.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Reliving that memory is exhausting. But there's also a small part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I survived it once, and I can survive talking about it now.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It's still hard, and I still feel the fear and anger, but... maybe it's a little less overwhelming now?",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: My heart is still racing a bit, and my palms are sweaty. But I don't feel like I'm about to have a panic attack anymore. It's like... the memory is still there, but I'm not completely lost in it now.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. You've done very well today.",
    "Client: I... I think I need a break now. This has been intense. But... I'm glad we did this. I feel like maybe, just maybe, I'm starting to process what happened instead of just reliving it.",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've made significant progress today."
