    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is terrified. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I guess so. Yeah, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in the prison cell. It's dark, and the air feels heavy. The concrete walls are closing in on me. I can hear distant shouting in a language I don't understand.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's happening now?",
    "Client: My wrists hurt from the restraints. They're too tight. I'm trying to adjust them, but it's useless. The guard outside is pacing... his footsteps echo down the hall.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm scared. So scared. My heart is racing, and I can't catch my breath. I keep thinking about my family... wondering if I'll ever see them again.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about an 80. It's really intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember to breathe. What happens next?",
    "Client: The cell door opens suddenly. Two men enter... they're speaking harshly. One of them grabs my arm and... and... I can't...",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Sarah. Take a deep breath. Can you describe what you see?",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... They're dragging me out of the cell. The hallway is dimly lit. Other prisoners are watching... their faces blur as we pass. I'm trying to resist, but I'm so weak...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My legs are shaking. I feel nauseous... like I might throw up. My chest is so tight.",
    "Therapist: Focus on those sensations. Let them be there. What's happening as they take you down the hall?",
    "Client: We're... we're entering a room. It's brighter here. There's a table... and some equipment. I don't know what it's for, but I'm terrified. They're forcing me onto the table...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're doing great. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 90. Maybe higher. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Feel your feet on the floor. You're here, in this room, safe with me.",
    "Client: *shaky breath* Okay... okay. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: They're... they're strapping me down. I can't move. Someone's asking me questions, but I don't understand. I keep saying I don't know anything, but they won't listen. Then... then there's pain. So much pain...",
    "Therapist: You're very brave, Sarah. Remember, this is a memory. You survived this.",
    "Client: It hurts so much. I'm screaming, but no one cares. I can taste blood in my mouth. I want it to stop... please make it stop...",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. Take a deep breath. Can you tell me something you see in this room right now?",
    "Client: I... I see the blue chair in the corner. Your bookshelf...",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, can you continue? What happens next in your memory?",
    "Client: They... they finally stop. I'm barely conscious. They're talking among themselves. I'm being unstrapped, but I can't move. My whole body feels like it's on fire.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. Angry. Scared. It's like I'm reliving it all over again.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're processing these memories. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's around 85 now. Still high, but... I can breathe a little easier.",
    "Therapist: You're doing very well. What happens after they unstrap you?",
    "Client: They're... they're dragging me back to my cell. I can't walk on my own. Everything hurts. They throw me onto the floor and lock the door. I'm alone again.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can survive this. I'm thinking about my family, wondering if they know where I am. I feel so helpless... so alone.",
    "Therapist: Those are very difficult feelings. How does your body feel?",
    "Client: It's like I'm made of lead. Every movement is agony. I'm curled up on the floor, trying to make myself as small as possible.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Can you describe the cell around you?",
    "Client: It's... it's dark. Cold. The floor is rough concrete. There's a small window high up, but I can't see out of it. The air smells musty and... and like blood. My blood.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I try to sit up, but it hurts too much. I'm so thirsty, but there's no water. I'm crying, but no sound comes out. I'm afraid they'll come back if they hear me.",
    "Therapist: How long does this go on?",
    "Client: It feels like forever. Hours pass... maybe days. I drift in and out of consciousness. Sometimes guards come by, but they ignore me. I'm losing hope...",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 75. I feel exhausted just talking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You're processing a lot. What happens next in your memory?",
    "Client: I... I hear commotion outside. Gunfire. Shouting. I don't know what's happening, but I'm terrified they're coming for me again. I try to hide in the corner, but I can barely move.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Pure terror. My heart is pounding so hard I think it might burst. I'm praying, begging for it to be over, one way or another.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Sarah. Take a deep breath. What happens next?",
    "Client: The door... the door bursts open. But it's not my captors. It's... it's American soldiers. They're speaking English. I can't believe it. I think I'm hallucinating at first.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. Relief floods through me, but I'm also scared to hope. What if it's not real? What if they leave me here?",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly intense. What do the soldiers do?",
    "Client: They're... they're coming towards me. One of them kneels down, asks if I can walk. I try to speak, but no words come out. I'm shaking uncontrollably.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: It's like every emotion is hitting me at once. I'm trembling, crying. My chest feels tight, but also like a weight has been lifted. I'm in pain, but the adrenaline is making it feel distant.",
    "Therapist: You're doing very well, Sarah. What happens as they try to help you?",
    "Client: They're... they're so gentle. One of them picks me up, and I flinch at first. But then I realize I'm safe. They're carrying me out of the cell. The sunlight... it's so bright it hurts my eyes.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to feel that sunlight. What do you notice?",
    "Client: It's... it's warm on my skin. After so long in that dark cell, it feels like life itself. I can smell fresh air. I hear helicopters...",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 60. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe relieved?",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Sarah. Can you tell me what happens as they evacuate you?",
    "Client: They're loading me onto a helicopter. There's a medic checking me over. I'm still scared it's not real, that I'll wake up back in that cell. But the noise, the vibrations... it's too real to be a dream.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel as the helicopter takes off?",
    "Client: It's... it's surreal. I'm watching the prison get smaller and smaller. Part of me is elated, but another part is numb. I can't quite believe it's over.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to process. How are you feeling right now, in this room?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. Tired. My hands are shaking a bit, but I feel... I don't know, maybe stronger? Like I survived talking about it.",
    "Therapist: You did survive, Sarah. Both then and now. How would you rate your distress?",
    "Client: It's down to about 50 now. It's still there, but it feels more manageable.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Is there anything else about that day you want to share?",
    "Client: I... I remember landing at a base. There were more doctors, more questions. But mostly, I remember feeling safe for the first time in so long. It was over. I was free.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today, Sarah. How are you feeling as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted, but... I feel like I've faced something I've been running from for a long time. It's hard, but maybe... maybe it's helping?",
    "Therapist: It is helping. You're processing these memories, which is a crucial part of healing. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we end?",
    "Client: No, I... I think I'm good. Thank you for guiding me through this. It's tough, but I'm glad I did it.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself, Sarah. We'll continue to work through this together. Remember to use the coping strategies we've discussed if you feel overwhelmed later. Do you have any questions?",
    "Client: No, I think I'm okay. Just... tired.",
    "Therapist: That's completely normal. Take care of yourself today, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. See you then."
