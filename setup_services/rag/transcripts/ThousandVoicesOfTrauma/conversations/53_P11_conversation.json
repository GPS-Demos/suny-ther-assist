    "Therapist: How are you feeling after going through that memory today, Mrs. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's like I was right back there, you know? I could feel the rough pavement under my knees, smell the diesel from the police car. It's all so vivid, even after all these years.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. I've always prided myself on being strong, on standing up for what's right. But in that moment, pinned to the ground by that officer... I felt so powerless. It's not just the physical pain, you know? It's the humiliation, the injustice of it all.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How does that feeling of helplessness affect you now?",
    "Client: Well, it's... it's like a shadow that follows me. Even now, at my age, when I see a police car, my heart starts racing. I find myself planning escape routes whenever I'm out, always on edge. It's exhausting, really.",
    "Therapist: I can imagine. How did it feel to share that memory today?",
    "Client: It was hard, really hard. But... there's also a part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I'm not carrying this burden all alone anymore. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Can you tell me more about that?",
    "Client: Well, for years, I've kept this bottled up inside. My husband knows, of course, but we don't really talk about it. Reliving it here, with you... it's painful, but it's also like I'm finally acknowledging what happened to me. I'm not just pushing it down and pretending it didn't happen.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How might this relate to your recovery goals?",
    "Client: I suppose... I want to feel safe again. To walk down the street without constantly looking over my shoulder. To not have my day ruined by a random siren in the distance. And maybe... maybe to feel like I have some control over my life again.",
    "Therapist: Those are important goals. What's one small step you could take towards them?",
    "Client: Hmm... Maybe I could try that breathing exercise you taught me when I start feeling anxious? Instead of just letting the panic take over, I could try to ground myself.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent idea. How else has this experience impacted you?",
    "Client: It's... it's made me withdraw a bit, I think. I used to be more outgoing, involved in my community. Now, I tend to stay home more. And when I do go out, I'm always on guard. It's affected my relationships too. Sometimes I snap at my husband for no reason, just because I'm so tense all the time.",
    "Therapist: I see. How do you think addressing this trauma might change those patterns?",
    "Client: I... I hadn't really thought about it that way. But I suppose if I could manage my anxiety better, maybe I'd be more willing to go out, to reconnect with old friends. And maybe I wouldn't be so quick to anger with my husband. That would be nice...",
    "Therapist: Those sound like positive changes. What's been most helpful in our sessions so far?",
    "Client: Just being able to talk about it, I think. And... and knowing that my reactions are normal, that I'm not crazy for feeling this way. It helps to understand why my body and mind react the way they do.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad that's been helpful. What's been challenging?",
    "Client: Oh, reliving it all, definitely. Sometimes I leave here and I'm just exhausted. And... and sometimes I wonder if it's worth it, you know? If I'll ever really feel better.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. How do you push through those doubts?",
    "Client: I remind myself of why I'm doing this. For my family, for myself. I want to be present for my grandkids, not constantly lost in my own fears. And... and I think about all the others who've gone through similar experiences. If I can heal, maybe it means they can too.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful motivation. How can we build on that for next time?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe we could talk more about how to apply these coping skills in real-life situations? Like, what do I do if I'm out and I start having a flashback?",
    "Therapist: Excellent suggestion. We'll focus on that next session. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... okay. Better than I expected, actually. Thank you for listening, for helping me make sense of all this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your courage is admirable. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, I'll be here. Thank you again."
