    "Therapist: Good morning, Mr. Ramirez. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Buenos d\u00edas, Dr. Thompson. I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. You mentioned last time we'd be trying something new?",
    "Therapist: Yes, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. Are you ready to discuss it?",
    "Client: I think so. To be honest, I'm not sure what to expect. Is this going to be like reliving my combat experiences? Because I'm not sure I can handle that right now.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel apprehensive. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I've spent years trying to forget those memories. The idea of purposely bringing them up... it scares me. What if I lose control? What if I can't handle it and break down right here in your office?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How about we start by explaining the process?",
    "Client: Okay, that sounds good. I think understanding what's going to happen might help me feel a bit more in control. So, what exactly is imaginal exposure?",
    "Therapist: It's a technique where you'll recount your traumatic experience in detail. We'll work through it together.",
    "Client: That sounds... intense. Will it be like watching a movie of my memories? Because sometimes, when I have flashbacks, it feels that way, and it's terrifying.",
    "Therapist: It may feel similar, but you'll be in control. We'll go at your pace. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It's a little reassuring to know I'll have some control. But I'm still worried about how I'll react. What if I can't handle it and have to stop?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. We can pause anytime. Your safety and comfort are priority. Any other concerns?",
    "Client: I guess I'm wondering why we need to do this at all. I've been managing okay by avoiding these memories. Why do we need to bring them up now?",
    "Therapist: Avoidance can maintain PTSD symptoms. Facing memories can reduce their power over you. What do you think?",
    "Client: I see... I never thought about it that way. It's like the memories have been controlling me all this time, haven't they? Maybe facing them head-on is what I need to do to finally move past this.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. Your willingness to try is courageous. Shall we set some expectations for today?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think knowing what to expect will help me feel more prepared. What should I be ready for?",
    "Therapist: You may experience strong emotions. We'll work through them together. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It sounds challenging, but I appreciate knowing you'll be there with me. I'm still nervous, but I think I'm ready to give it a try. Is there anything I should do to prepare myself?",
    "Therapist: Just be open and honest. Remember, you're in control. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Okay, I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Thank you for explaining everything and being patient with my questions. It means a lot to have your support through this. Let's do it.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your courage is admirable. Let's start when you're comfortable."
