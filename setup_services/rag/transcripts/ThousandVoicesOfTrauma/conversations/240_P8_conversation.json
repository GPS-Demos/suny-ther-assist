    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I'm back there, you know? The sound of metal creaking, the smell of jet fuel... It's all so vivid. I can feel the seat beneath me, the way it shook as we hit turbulence. God, I thought we were going to die.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... guilt? I remember looking at the flight attendant's face. She was trying to stay calm, but her eyes... They were so wide, so scared. I keep thinking I should have done something to help her, to help others. But I just sat there, frozen.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt manifest for you physically?",
    "Client: It's like a weight on my chest. Heavy, you know? And my stomach feels tight, like it's in knots. I can feel my jaw clenching too. It's... it's exhausting, carrying this around.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind as you sit with these feelings?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why did I survive when others didn't?\" It doesn't make sense. And then I wonder if I'm overreacting. I mean, we didn't actually crash, right? We made it. But... but it felt so real, so close. I can't shake the feeling that I cheated death, and now I'm just waiting for it to catch up with me.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts impact your daily life?",
    "Client: They're... they're always there, lurking in the background. I avoid flying now, obviously. But it's more than that. I find myself being overly cautious about everything. Checking locks multiple times, avoiding crowded places. It's like I'm always on edge, waiting for the next disaster. And I feel... I feel disconnected from people who haven't experienced something like this. How can they understand?",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your body right now as you share this?",
    "Client: I... I hadn't realized, but my hands are shaking a bit. And I'm sitting really stiffly, like I'm bracing for impact or something. My breathing feels shallow too. It's like my body is still in that moment, you know? Still anticipating the crash.",
    "Therapist: How does noticing these physical sensations affect you?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a bit grounding, in a weird way. Like, I can recognize that I'm here, now, not on that plane. But it's also frustrating. Why can't I just let this go? Why does my body keep reacting like this? I want to move on, but it's like I'm stuck in a loop.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to you to \"move on\" from this experience?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. I guess it would mean being able to fly again without panic. Being able to watch a movie with a plane scene without my heart racing. Not feeling guilty for surviving. Just... being normal again. But I don't know if that's possible. This experience, it's changed me. I'm not the same person I was before that flight.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that change in yourself?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. Part of me resents it. I miss the carefree person I used to be. But another part... I don't know, maybe I appreciate life more now? Every day feels like a gift in a way it didn't before. But that appreciation comes with a cost. It's exhausting being this vigilant all the time.",
    "Therapist: What helps you cope with these feelings day to day?",
    "Client: Honestly? Routine helps. Having a structured day gives me some sense of control. And... talking about it, like this. It's hard, but it helps to put words to these feelings. Sometimes I write too, just to get the thoughts out of my head. And being around my kids... that reminds me why I need to keep pushing through this.",
    "Therapist: How does sharing this experience make you feel right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix. Part of me feels exposed, vulnerable. But there's also a sense of relief. Like I'm not carrying this burden alone anymore. And maybe... maybe a little hopeful? That by facing this head-on, I might eventually find some peace with it all.",
    "Therapist: What do you think is the next step in your healing journey?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to keep doing this. Talking about it, facing the memories. It's hard, and part of me wants to run away from it all. But I know that won't help in the long run. Maybe... maybe I need to start challenging some of my avoidance behaviors too. Not flying yet, but... maybe start with watching some plane-related content without panicking. Baby steps, you know?",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that idea?",
    "Client: Scared, honestly. The thought of deliberately exposing myself to anything related to planes or crashes... it makes my palms sweat just thinking about it. But there's a small part of me that feels... I don't know, brave maybe? Like I'm taking control back from this fear. It's a tiny spark, but it's there.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to work on some of those avoidance behaviors. Maybe we could make a plan? Start small, you know? And... and maybe talk more about the guilt. I feel like that's a big part of what's holding me back. Is that... is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll work on that together. How are you feeling as we wrap up?",
    "Client: Drained, but... okay, I think. It's always hard to dig into this stuff, but I feel like I've made some progress today. Like I understand myself a little better. Thank you for... for creating a safe space for me to talk about this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
