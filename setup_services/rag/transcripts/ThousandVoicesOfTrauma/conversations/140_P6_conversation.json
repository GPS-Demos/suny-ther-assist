    "Therapist: Welcome, John. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure exercise today?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. But I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Can you start by describing the memory?",
    "Client: Okay... It was during my second tour in Afghanistan. We were on patrol, and... and my best friend, Mike, he was right next to me. We were joking about something stupid, I can't even remember what now. Then suddenly, there was this loud explosion. Everything went dark for a moment, and when I could see again... Mike was... he was just... gone.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably about a 6... maybe 7.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I couldn't process what had happened. There was smoke everywhere, and this ringing in my ears. I started yelling for Mike, but... but I knew. Deep down, I knew he was gone. My hands were shaking so bad I could barely hold my weapon.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My heart's racing. I can almost smell the smoke again. It's... it's tough.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Maybe an 8.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Right... safe. It's just... I keep seeing his face. We had plans, you know? We were gonna start a business together when we got back. And now... now he's just gone. And I'm here, living with my parents at 49, feeling like a failure.",
    "Therapist: You're not a failure, John. You're working through this. SUDS?",
    "Client: Still an 8... maybe edging towards 9. My palms are sweating.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Stay with the memory if you can.",
    "Client: I... I remember the silence after the explosion. It was so... wrong. Usually, there's shouting, orders being given, but for a moment, it was just... quiet. Then the screaming started. Not Mike... he was already... but others. And I couldn't move. I just stood there, useless.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. It feels so real. Like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. Maybe even... even a 10.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Take another deep breath.",
    "Client: (Breathing deeply) I... I can't shake this feeling of guilt. Why him? Why not me? We were standing right next to each other. It should have been me.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are common. SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe an 8 again.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're processing this. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: After... after the initial shock, I remember trying to find... pieces of him. God, that sounds awful. But I thought... maybe if I could just find something to send home to his family. But there was nothing. Nothing left of my best friend.",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly difficult. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... hollow. Like there's this huge empty space inside me.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually down to about a 6, I think. I feel drained.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've done really well today, John.",
    "Client: Thanks. I... I never thought I'd be able to talk about this. It's always been locked away, you know?",
    "Therapist: You've shown great courage. How do you feel about ending here for today?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think that's good. I'm exhausted, but... I feel like maybe I've taken a step forward.",
    "Therapist: You absolutely have. We'll continue working through this together."
