    "Therapist: Mrs. Rodriguez, today we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, Dr. Thompson. To be honest, I'm a bit nervous. The idea of revisiting that terrible night... it makes my heart race. I've spent years trying to forget it all. Why do we need to bring it up now?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. This exercise helps process the trauma. Ready to learn more?",
    "Client: I suppose so. But please, explain it to me slowly. My English isn't perfect, and I want to understand everything clearly. This is all so overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll go at your pace. Imaginal exposure involves recounting the traumatic event. How does that sound?",
    "Client: Recounting it? You mean... I have to talk about what those policemen did to me? I... I don't know if I can. Just thinking about it makes me feel like I'm back there, helpless and scared. Will you be with me the whole time?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'll guide you through it. It may be difficult, but it's a step towards healing.",
    "Client: Healing... that sounds nice. I've carried this burden for so long. My husband, he tries to understand, but he wasn't there. He didn't see how they treated me, an old woman, like I was some kind of criminal. It's affected our relationship, you know? I find it hard to trust anyone in uniform now.",
    "Therapist: I understand. This process can help rebuild trust and reduce PTSD symptoms. Shall we discuss what to expect?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I need to know what I'm getting into. Will it be like reliving it all over again? I'm afraid I might fall apart completely.",
    "Therapist: It may feel intense, but you're safe here. We'll go slowly, and you can pause anytime.",
    "Client: Okay... I appreciate that. It's just... I've never talked about this in detail before. Not even to my family. They know something happened, but I've kept the worst parts to myself. I'm worried about how I'll react. What if I can't stop crying? Or what if I get angry? I don't want to lose control.",
    "Therapist: All reactions are normal. We'll manage them together. Your strength in facing this is admirable.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Thompson. That means a lot. I've always tried to be strong for my family. But inside, I feel so broken sometimes. Will this really help me put the pieces back together?",
    "Therapist: Many find it helpful. It's a proven method for processing trauma and reducing symptoms.",
    "Client: I see. Well, I trust you, doctor. You've been so patient with me these past few weeks. I just hope I can do this. I want to be free from these nightmares, the constant fear. I want to be able to walk down the street without flinching every time I see a police car.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. Shall we begin? Remember, we can stop anytime you need.",
    "Client: Alright. I'm ready. Or as ready as I'll ever be. Please, just... stay close, okay? I might need to hold your hand if that's alright. It helps me feel grounded when the memories get too intense.",
    "Therapist: Of course. I'm here to support you. Let's start whenever you're comfortable."
