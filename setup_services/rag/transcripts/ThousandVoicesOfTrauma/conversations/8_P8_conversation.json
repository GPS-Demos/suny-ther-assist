    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Maria?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like my whole body is vibrating. That memory of the earthquake, it just... it brings everything back so vividly. I can still hear the rumbling, feel the ground moving beneath my feet. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But it's mixed with this... this intense sadness. I remember feeling so helpless, you know? Like the world was literally crumbling around me, and there was nothing I could do to stop it. It reminds me of how I felt when I was bullied as a kid \u2013 that same sense of powerlessness.",
    "Therapist: How does that powerlessness manifest for you physically?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, like I can't breathe properly. My hands are clammy, and I have this knot in my stomach. It's like my body is preparing for something terrible to happen, even though I know I'm safe here. I... I think I need a moment.",
    "Therapist: Take all the time you need. We're in a safe space.",
    "Client: (After a pause) Thank you. I just needed to ground myself a bit. It's strange, you know? Even though it's been years since the earthquake, reliving it through this exercise makes it feel like it just happened yesterday. I can smell the dust in the air, hear the screams of people around me. It's so vivid.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind as you recall these details?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why couldn't I do more?\" I know it's irrational, but part of me feels guilty for surviving when others didn't. And then there's this voice in my head saying, \"You're weak for still being affected by this.\" It's the same voice I heard when I was being bullied \u2013 always criticizing, always making me feel small.",
    "Therapist: How do those thoughts impact you?",
    "Client: They... they make me want to retreat. To numb myself. I guess that's partly why I turned to substances after the earthquake. It was easier to drink or get high than to face these feelings of guilt and inadequacy. But I know that's not the answer. It's just... it's hard to face all of this.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your ability to sit with these feelings now?",
    "Client: It's... it's challenging, but I'm doing it. I'm here, I'm talking about it. That's something, right? I think... I think I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. Maybe surviving isn't something to feel guilty about, but something to be proud of?",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. How does that shift in perspective feel?",
    "Client: It feels... liberating, in a way. Like a weight being lifted. Don't get me wrong, the memories are still painful, but looking at it this way gives me a sense of... I don't know, maybe hope? It's like I'm reclaiming some of the power I felt I'd lost.",
    "Therapist: Can you elaborate on that feeling of reclaiming power?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... for so long, I've been a victim. A victim of bullying, a victim of the earthquake, a victim of my own addictions. But by facing these memories, by talking about them, I'm making a choice. I'm choosing to confront my fears instead of running from them. That feels powerful.",
    "Therapist: How might this impact your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I think... I think it gives me more motivation to stay sober. Every time I face these memories without turning to substances, it's like I'm proving to myself that I can handle it. That I'm resilient. It's hard, and it hurts, but it's also... empowering, I guess?",
    "Therapist: What do you want to remember from this session?",
    "Client: That I'm stronger than I thought. That facing my fears doesn't break me \u2013 it makes me stronger. And that... that it's okay to feel vulnerable. It doesn't make me weak. It makes me human.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing, Maria. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired, but in a good way. Like I've done something important. My body feels calmer now, less shaky. And my mind... it feels clearer. Like I've sorted through some of the clutter in there. It's not all resolved, of course, but I feel like I've made progress. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Everyone's experience is unique. What matters is how you feel.",
    "Client: I feel... I feel okay. Better than I expected, actually. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know we have more work to do, but for the first time in a long while, I feel like I might actually be able to get through this. To come out the other side stronger.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Shall we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. I have a lot to process, but I'm feeling... I'm feeling hopeful. Thank you, doctor. I'll see you next week.",
    "Therapist: Take care, Maria. Remember to use your coping strategies if you need them."
