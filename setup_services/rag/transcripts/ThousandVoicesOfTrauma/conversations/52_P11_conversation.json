    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Singh?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's not easy to go back to those moments in the cult. The physical abuse... it's like I can still feel the pain sometimes. But there's also this strange sense of... I don't know, maybe relief? Like I'm finally facing it head-on.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The fear. It was so overwhelming. I remember the leader's face, his eyes... they were so cold. And the way he'd justify the beatings as \"cleansing our souls.\" It's absurd now, but back then, I believed it. I actually thought I deserved it. God, how could I have been so blind?",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. My heart was racing, and I felt that familiar tightness in my chest. But something was different this time. I felt... stronger, somehow. Like I was observing it from a distance, not completely trapped in it. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How do you think this relates to your recovery?",
    "Client: Well, I suppose it shows I'm making progress, doesn't it? I mean, I used to avoid thinking about this at all costs. Now, I can face it without completely falling apart. It's still painful, but... manageable. I think I'm starting to see that these memories don't have to control me anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What else?",
    "Client: I... I realized something during the exposure. The shame I've carried all these years... it's not mine to bear. It belongs to them, the abusers. They're the ones who should be ashamed, not me. I was just trying to find meaning, to belong somewhere. They took advantage of that.",
    "Therapist: How does this realization affect you?",
    "Client: It's... liberating, in a way. But also overwhelming. I've spent so long blaming myself, it's hard to let that go. But I want to. I want to move forward, to reclaim the years I've lost to this trauma. I just... I'm not always sure how to do that.",
    "Therapist: What strategies have helped so far?",
    "Client: The breathing exercises have been surprisingly helpful. And writing about my experiences... it's painful, but it helps me process things. Oh, and reaching out to my daughter more often. That connection... it reminds me there's more to my life than just this trauma.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent steps. Anything else you'd like to share?",
    "Client: I... I'm proud of myself, I think. For doing this, for not giving up. There are still days when it feels impossible, when the memories are too much. But I'm here, I'm trying. And for the first time in years, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can overcome this.",
    "Therapist: That's incredible progress. How can we build on this?",
    "Client: I want to keep pushing forward. Maybe... maybe we could work on how I can share some of this with my daughter? I've kept her at arm's length for so long, afraid of burdening her. But I think opening up might help both of us heal. And... I'd like to explore more ways to manage the flashbacks when they come. They're less frequent now, but when they hit, they're still intense.",
    "Therapist: Those are great goals. Shall we focus on those next time?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. Thank you for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but... I'm starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel. I just hope I can keep this momentum going.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, healing isn't linear.",
    "Client: Right, yes. I need to remind myself of that. There will be good days and bad days, but overall, I'm moving forward. It's just... sometimes it feels like two steps forward, one step back, you know? But I'm committed to this process. I want to reclaim my life, to find joy again. It's been so long since I've felt truly at peace.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful motivation. Anything else before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. I know I'm not an easy case, with my age and the complexity of my trauma. But you've never made me feel judged or rushed. I appreciate that more than I can express. I'm actually looking forward to our next session, which is something I never thought I'd say about therapy.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. I'll see you next week, Mr. Singh.",
    "Client: Yes, see you then. Take care."
