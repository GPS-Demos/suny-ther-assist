    "Therapist: Alright, Mr. Farooq, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's begin. Close your eyes and recall the incident.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm at the protest. It's a warm day, and there are so many people around me. I can hear chanting, smell sweat and... tear gas. The police are advancing, and I'm suddenly pushed to the ground. I feel the rough asphalt against my cheek, and there's a heavy weight on my back. I can't breathe...",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Um... I'd say about a 6 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue.",
    "Client: The officer is yelling at me, but I can't understand what he's saying. My heart is racing, and I'm gasping for air. I try to explain that I'm just a bystander, but he won't listen. I feel so helpless, so... humiliated.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My palms are sweating, and my chest feels tight. It's like I'm back there again.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to an 8.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Stay with it.",
    "Client: I... I can feel the handcuffs digging into my wrists. They're so tight. I'm thinking about my wife, wondering if she knows what's happening. I'm scared they'll hurt me... or worse. The officer is still shouting, and I can smell his breath. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. I feel like I can't breathe again.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* I... I remember being dragged to the police van. My shoulder hurts from being yanked so hard. I can hear other people crying and shouting. I feel so ashamed, like I've done something wrong even though I know I haven't.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: Still a 9. My heart is pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Keep going.",
    "Client: The ride to the station is bumpy. I'm thrown around in the back of the van. I can taste blood in my mouth \u2013 I must have bitten my lip. When we arrive, I'm roughly pulled out. The bright lights of the station hurt my eyes. I'm fingerprinted, photographed... treated like a criminal. I keep trying to explain, but no one listens.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel angry. So angry and powerless. But also... scared. I'm trembling.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe a 7 now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's continue.",
    "Client: I'm in a holding cell now. It's cold and smells of disinfectant and... other things I don't want to think about. I can hear other people crying, arguing. I'm worried about my wife, wondering if she knows where I am. I feel so alone, so... violated. This isn't right. I've lived in this country for decades, I'm a citizen, but suddenly I feel like an outsider again.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's back up to an 8. My stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: Hours pass. I'm exhausted, but I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see the officer's face, feel the weight on my back. Finally, they tell me I'm free to go. No charges. No explanation. No apology. I walk out into the morning light, feeling... broken. Changed.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Sad. Angry. But also... relieved it's over.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6 now.",
    "Therapist: Well done. Let's end here.",
    "Client: *opens eyes, takes deep breath* That was... intense. But I got through it.",
    "Therapist: You did excellently. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Tired, but... okay. Better than I expected, actually.",
