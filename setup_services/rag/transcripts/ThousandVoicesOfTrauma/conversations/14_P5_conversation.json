    "Therapist: Hello, Carlos. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hola, Dr. Martinez. I'm... I'm not great, to be honest. Been having trouble sleeping lately. Every little noise in the house makes me jump. It's like I'm constantly on edge, you know?",
    "Therapist: I understand. That sounds challenging. Today, we'll work on that.",
    "Client: Okay... What exactly are we going to do? I'm feeling a bit nervous about this whole thing.",
    "Therapist: We'll do an imaginal exposure exercise. It's designed to help with your PTSD symptoms.",
    "Client: Imaginal exposure? That sounds... intense. Do I have to relive the home invasion? I'm not sure I'm ready for that.",
    "Therapist: It can be intense, but I'll guide you through it. What concerns do you have?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about losing control. What if I panic? Or what if it makes everything worse instead of better? I've been trying so hard to keep it together for my family.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. We'll go at your pace, and I'll be here to support you.",
    "Client: Okay... I appreciate that. Can you tell me more about what to expect? How exactly does this help?",
    "Therapist: The exercise helps process the trauma memory. You may feel anxious, but it typically decreases over time.",
    "Client: I see. So, it's like facing my fears head-on? That's... that's pretty scary, doc. But I guess if it helps in the long run, I'm willing to try.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. Your willingness shows courage. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. Just promise me you won't let things get out of hand, okay? My anxiety is already through the roof.",
    "Therapist: I promise. We'll stop if it becomes too overwhelming. Shall we start?",
    "Client: Alright, let's do this. I trust you, Dr. Martinez. Just... just bear with me if I struggle a bit, okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's begin. Close your eyes and take a deep breath..."
