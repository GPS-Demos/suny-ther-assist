    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Singh. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a part of me that wants to get this over with, but another part that's... hesitant, I suppose. It's not easy thinking about that day in the hospital.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to help you process this experience. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in the emergency room. The lights are so bright, almost harsh. There's a constant beeping from machines nearby. I can smell antiseptic, it's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: A doctor approaches me. He's wearing a white coat, but it's... it's stained. There's a smear of something red on the sleeve. Blood? I don't know. He looks tired, his eyes are... they're bloodshot.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My heart's racing. I can feel it pounding in my chest. My mouth is dry.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you?",
    "Client: I'd say... about 60.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The doctor... he's telling me something. His voice sounds muffled, like I'm underwater. But I can make out a few words: \"severe,\" \"immediate surgery,\" \"risk.\" I'm... I'm trying to focus, but it's like my mind is shutting down.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. I keep thinking, \"This can't be happening. Not to me.\" I want to run, but my body won't move. It's like I'm paralyzed.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's higher. Maybe 75?",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're here, in a safe place. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: They're... they're wheeling me into the operating room now. The ceiling lights are flashing by overhead. It's cold, so cold. I can hear the wheels squeaking on the floor. There's a nurse beside me, she's saying something, but I can't... I can't focus on her words.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My... my hands are shaking. I can feel sweat on my forehead. My stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What happens next?",
    "Client: They're transferring me to the operating table. It's hard, uncomfortable. The lights above are so bright, I have to squint. Someone's putting a mask over my face. The smell... it's sharp, chemical. I'm trying to breathe, but it feels like I can't get enough air.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. Maybe 85.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here with me, safe in this room.",
    "Client: I... I know. It just feels so real.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. It's part of the process. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The anesthesiologist is counting down. \"10... 9... 8...\" My vision is starting to blur. I'm fighting to stay awake, but I can feel myself slipping. There's this... this overwhelming fear that I might not wake up. That this could be... the end.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about my life. All the things I haven't done, the people I haven't spoken to in years. I'm regretting... so much. And I'm angry. Angry that this is happening to me, angry that I didn't take better care of myself.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's at 90 now. It's really intense.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you survived this. You're here now.",
    "Client: Yes... yes, I did survive.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next in your memory?",
    "Client: Everything goes black. And then... then I'm waking up. The room is different. It's dimmer, quieter. There's a steady beeping sound. My throat... it feels raw, like I've swallowed sandpaper. I'm trying to move, but my body feels heavy, sluggish.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling emotionally?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm confused. Scared. But also... relieved? I'm alive. I made it through.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down. Maybe 70?",
    "Therapist: That's good. Keep going.",
    "Client: A nurse comes in. She's smiling, but I can see the tiredness in her eyes. She's checking my vitals, adjusting something on the IV. She tells me the surgery was successful, but... but there's a long recovery ahead.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel hearing that?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of emotions. Relief, gratitude, but also... dread? The idea of a long recovery is overwhelming. I'm wondering how I'll manage, if I'll ever be the same.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm trying to speak, but my voice is barely a whisper. I'm asking about my prognosis, about what happens next. The nurse is patient, explaining things, but it's... it's hard to take it all in. My mind keeps drifting to the future, to all the challenges ahead.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 60 now. Still there, but not as intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The next few days are a blur. Doctors coming and going, more tests, physical therapy starting. It's... it's painful, exhausting. But there's also this... this growing determination. Each small progress feels like a victory.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind during this time?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about how close I came to dying. About how I want to make changes in my life. I'm scared about the future, but also... hopeful? It's like I've been given a second chance.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. Scary, but also inspiring. I'm realizing how much I took for granted before.",
    "Therapist: And how's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 40. Talking about it... it's helping.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's continue.",
    "Client: As the days pass, I'm getting stronger. The pain is still there, but it's... it's manageable now. I'm starting to think about going home, about facing the world outside the hospital. It's... it's daunting.",
    "Therapist: What concerns do you have about going home?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm worried about managing on my own. About the lifestyle changes I'll need to make. And... and I'm afraid of having another health crisis. What if it happens again?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How are you coping with these thoughts?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm trying to focus on what I can control. On following the doctor's advice, on making healthier choices. But it's... it's not easy. Sometimes the fear creeps in, especially at night.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 30. Talking about it like this, it's... it's helping me process it all.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's continue with the day you were discharged.",
    "Client: The day I left the hospital was... was a mix of emotions. I was happy to be going home, but also... nervous. The world seemed different somehow. As I was wheeled out, I remember looking back at the hospital, thinking about how much had changed in such a short time.",
    "Therapist: What were you feeling physically at that moment?",
    "Client: I was... I was weak. My body felt like it had aged years in just a few weeks. But there was also this... this energy, a determination to get better.",
    "Therapist: And emotionally?",
    "Client: Grateful. Scared. Hopeful. It was... it was all mixed up together.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 20. Remembering that moment, it's... it's actually empowering in a way.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How do you feel about the experience now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still difficult to think about. But I can see how it changed me, how it made me appreciate life more. I'm... I'm grateful for the second chance, even if it came with such a difficult experience.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired, but in a good way. Like I've accomplished something. And I feel... lighter? Like talking about it has lifted some of the weight I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 10 now. It's amazing how much it's decreased just by talking it through.",
    "Therapist: You've made remarkable progress today. We'll end our session here. Well done."
