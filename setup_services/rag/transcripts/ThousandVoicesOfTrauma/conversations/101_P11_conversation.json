    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Tom?",
    "Client: I... I'm not really sure. It's a lot to process, you know? Going through that memory of the cyclone again, it's... intense. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sound. The roaring of the wind, it was deafening. And the crashing... I keep hearing the trees snapping and debris hitting our house. It's like it's happening all over again. I can feel the fear rising in my chest, just like it did that night.",
    "Therapist: How does that fear feel in your body right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's tight. Like there's a vice around my chest. My hands are clammy, and I feel restless, like I need to run or do something. It's hard to sit still.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. How does this compare to your day-to-day experiences?",
    "Client: Well, it's... it's similar, I guess. I've been having trouble sleeping lately because every time the wind picks up outside, I start panicking. And during the day, if I hear a loud noise or see trees swaying too much, I get that same tightness in my chest. It's exhausting, always being on edge like this.",
    "Therapist: I see. How do you think this relates to your recovery goals?",
    "Client: I... I want to be able to live normally again, you know? To not be afraid of the weather or jump at every loud noise. I want to be able to focus on my studies without constantly worrying about another disaster. This exposure thing, it's tough, but I think... I think it might be helping me face these fears head-on.",
    "Therapist: That's a great insight, Tom. How do you feel about continuing with the exposures?",
    "Client: It's scary, honestly. Part of me wants to run away from it all. But... I also feel a bit stronger after each session. Like I'm slowly taking back control. It's hard to explain, but I feel like I'm making progress, even if it's small steps.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. What strategies have you found helpful so far?",
    "Client: The breathing exercises you taught me have been a lifesaver. When I start feeling overwhelmed, I try to focus on my breath, and it helps ground me. And... talking about it, like we're doing now, it helps make the memory feel less powerful, if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: It absolutely does. How else has this process affected you?",
    "Client: I've noticed I'm a bit more open with my girlfriend about what I'm going through. Before, I'd just shut down when I was struggling. Now, I'm trying to explain my feelings to her. It's not easy, but it feels... good, I guess. Less isolating.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant change. How do you think this might impact your relationships moving forward?",
    "Client: I... I hadn't really thought about that. I suppose it could bring us closer? And maybe I'll be able to talk to my parents more too. They've been worried, but I've been pushing them away. Maybe being more open could help us all heal together.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization, Tom. Is there anything else you'd like to share about today's session?",
    "Client: Just that... it's tough, but I'm glad I'm doing this. For the first time in a while, I feel like there might be light at the end of the tunnel. I'm scared, but I'm also... hopeful? Yeah, hopeful. That's new.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for your courage today, Tom. How would you like to proceed?",
    "Client: I think... I think I want to keep going with the exposures. It's hard, but I can see how it's helping. And maybe we could talk more about how to communicate with my family and girlfriend? I want to get better at that.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll focus on that next time. Well done today, Tom."
