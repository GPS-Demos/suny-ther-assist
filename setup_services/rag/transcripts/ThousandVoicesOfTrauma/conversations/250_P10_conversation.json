    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to dive into some heavy stuff, and part of me wants to just run away. But I'm here, so I guess that's something, right?",
    "Therapist: That's absolutely something. Your courage is admirable. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Yeah, I think so. Let's do this before I change my mind.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in the hospital waiting room. The lights are so bright, it's making my head hurt. There's this antiseptic smell that's making me feel nauseous. I can hear the receptionist typing away, and there's a TV playing some daytime show, but it's all just background noise. I'm... I'm terrified.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's happening now?",
    "Client: A nurse calls my name. My legs feel like lead as I stand up. I follow her down this long corridor. The walls are this sickly pale green color. I keep thinking, \"This can't be happening. Not to me. I'm only 25.\" We reach a small room, and she tells me to sit down. The doctor will be in soon, she says. But soon feels like an eternity.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Um... probably around a 70. My heart's racing just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Remember to breathe. What happens next?",
    "Client: The doctor comes in. He's got this serious look on his face, and I just know. I know before he even opens his mouth. He starts talking about test results and treatment options, but all I can hear is \"cancer.\" It's like the word fills the entire room, suffocating me. I want to scream, to run, but I'm frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My... my chest feels tight. Like there's this massive weight pressing down on it. My hands are shaking, and I can feel this cold sweat breaking out all over. I'm trying to focus on what the doctor's saying, but it's like I'm underwater. Everything sounds muffled and distant.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I manage to ask about prognosis. The doctor hesitates, and that pause... it's the longest moment of my life. He starts talking about stages and percentages, but all I can think is, \"I might die. I might actually die.\" And then I think about my mom, how I'll have to tell her. Oh god, how am I going to tell her?",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 85. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: I know it is. You're doing great. Take a deep breath. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) Okay... okay. The doctor's still talking, but I'm not really listening anymore. I'm thinking about all the things I haven't done yet. I haven't finished my degree. I haven't fallen in love. I haven't traveled. It's like my whole future is suddenly uncertain, and I'm terrified.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I start to cry. Not just cry, but really sob. The doctor stops talking and just hands me a box of tissues. I'm embarrassed, but I can't stop. It's like all the fear and anger and confusion is just pouring out of me. The doctor puts his hand on my shoulder, trying to comfort me, but it just makes me cry harder.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: I feel drained. Completely and utterly drained. My eyes are burning from crying, and my throat feels raw. My whole body is trembling, and I feel... small. Like I'm shrinking into myself.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Eventually, I manage to pull myself together enough to listen. The doctor's talking about next steps, about scheduling more tests and meeting with specialists. It's all so overwhelming. I nod along, but I'm not really processing anything. I just want to go home and hide under my blankets.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually down to about 75. I think I'm starting to feel a bit numb.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. What happens as you leave the doctor's office?",
    "Client: I walk out in a daze. The corridor seems even longer now. People pass by, but they all look blurry. I make it to the elevator and press the button for the ground floor. As the doors close, I catch a glimpse of my reflection. I look... different. Older, somehow. Like I've aged years in just an hour.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that image. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... I'm thinking that this is the moment everything changes. That from now on, my life will be divided into before and after this diagnosis. And I'm scared. I'm so scared of what comes next.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm actually feeling a bit lighter. Like talking about it is helping somehow. My distress level is probably around 60 now.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Let's continue. What happens when you leave the hospital?",
    "Client: I step outside, and it's like the world is too bright, too loud. Cars honking, people chatting, birds singing - it all seems so... normal. And I want to scream at them all, \"Don't you know? Don't you know what just happened?\" But I don't. I just stand there, trying to figure out what to do next.",
    "Therapist: What do you decide to do?",
    "Client: I... I call my best friend, Emma. My hands are shaking so much I can barely dial. When she answers, I just start crying again. She doesn't even know what's wrong yet, but she immediately says she's coming to get me. I feel so grateful in that moment, but also so, so alone.",
    "Therapist: How does that loneliness feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's like this hollow ache in my chest. Even though I know Emma's on her way, I feel isolated. Like I'm suddenly living in a different world than everyone else. A world where I have cancer, and they don't.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: I sit on a bench outside the hospital, waiting for Emma. People walk by, going about their day, and I keep thinking, \"They have no idea.\" It's surreal. Emma arrives, and as soon as I see her face, I start crying again. She just hugs me, right there on the sidewalk, and lets me cry.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually down to about 50. Remembering Emma being there... it helps.",
    "Therapist: That's good. What happens after Emma arrives?",
    "Client: She takes me back to her place. I can't face going home yet, can't face being alone. We sit on her couch, and I tell her everything. She listens, she cries with me, she holds my hand. And then she says, \"We'll get through this. Together.\" And for the first time since hearing the diagnosis, I feel a tiny spark of hope.",
    "Therapist: How does that hope feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's small, but it's there. Like a tiny flame in a dark room. It doesn't make the fear go away, but it makes it feel... manageable, somehow.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Emotionally drained. But also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like, I've faced this memory, and I'm still here. My distress level is probably around 40 now.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, open your eyes.",
    "Client: (Opens eyes slowly) Wow. That was... intense.",
    "Therapist: You did very well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... okay, actually. Tired, but okay. It's strange, but talking through it like that... it feels like it's taken some of the power out of the memory.",
    "Therapist: That's often the case. You've shown great courage today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I'm starting to understand how this process works now. It's hard, but I can see how it might help.",
    "Therapist: That's right. We'll continue to work through this. Do you have any questions or concerns?",
    "Client: No, I don't think so. I'm just... I'm glad I did this today.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad too. Remember to practice your breathing exercises this week. We'll pick up here next session.",
    "Client: Okay. Thanks, doctor. I'll see you next week.",
    "Therapist: Take care, Sarah. See you next week."
