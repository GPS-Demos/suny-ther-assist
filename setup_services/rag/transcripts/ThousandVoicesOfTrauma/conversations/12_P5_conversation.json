    "Therapist: Welcome back, John. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been thinking a lot about our last session and the idea of this imaginal exposure thing. It's been making me anxious.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... the idea of reliving that moment when I found out about my brother's death, it's terrifying. I've spent so much time trying to avoid thinking about it. And now, with all this cyberbullying stuff happening at work, it feels like I'm being attacked from all sides. I'm not sure I can handle bringing up those old memories too.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How about we discuss the process?",
    "Client: Yeah, that would help. I mean, I get that it's supposed to help me process everything, but I'm scared it'll make things worse. Like, what if I can't stop crying? Or what if I have a panic attack? I already feel like I'm barely holding it together most days.",
    "Therapist: Those are normal fears. We'll go at your pace. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: I guess... how exactly does this work? Do I just start talking about what happened? And how long does it last? I'm worried about getting overwhelmed and not being able to function at work afterward. My job's already stressful enough with all the online harassment I've been dealing with lately.",
    "Therapist: We'll start slowly, focusing on one memory. I'll guide you through it.",
    "Client: Okay, that sounds a bit less daunting. But what if I freeze up? Or if I start feeling really anxious? I've been having more panic attacks lately, especially after some particularly nasty comments online. I'm worried this might trigger another one.",
    "Therapist: I'll be here to support you. We can pause anytime you need.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I appreciate that. I guess I'm just scared of facing all those emotions again. It's been easier to just... not think about it, you know? But at the same time, I know I can't keep living like this. The nightmares, the constant anxiety, it's affecting everything in my life.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. This process can significantly reduce PTSD symptoms.",
    "Client: Really? That would be... amazing. I'm so tired of feeling this way. It's like I'm constantly on edge, waiting for the next bad thing to happen. And with all this cyberbullying at work, it's like I'm reliving that helplessness I felt when my brother died. I just want to feel normal again.",
    "Therapist: That's our goal. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: I... yeah, I think I'm ready. Or as ready as I'll ever be. Just... promise you'll stop if it gets too much? I'm still scared, but I trust you. And I want to get better. For myself, for my relationship, for my future. I can't keep letting the past control me like this.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll take it step by step. You're in control here.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you. I really appreciate your patience and support with all of this. It means a lot to know I'm not facing this alone. So... what do we do first?"
