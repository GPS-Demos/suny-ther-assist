    "Therapist: Welcome back. Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. To be honest, I'm a bit anxious. The idea of revisiting those combat experiences... it's daunting. I've spent so long trying to push those memories away.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I worry that reliving those moments might trigger a panic attack or make my depression worse. I've worked hard to maintain some stability in my life, and I'm afraid this might upset that balance. Plus, as someone who's dealt with sexual abuse in the past, I'm concerned about how this might intersect with those traumas.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How can I support you through this process?",
    "Client: I appreciate you asking. I think I need reassurance that we can stop if it becomes too overwhelming. And maybe some guidance on grounding techniques I can use if I start to feel too anxious or disconnected.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll go at your pace and can pause anytime. Shall I explain the purpose of this exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think understanding the 'why' behind it might help ease some of my anxiety.",
    "Therapist: Imaginal exposure helps process traumatic memories, reducing their emotional impact over time.",
    "Client: That makes sense, but it's still scary. How exactly will this help with my PTSD symptoms?",
    "Therapist: By confronting memories in a safe environment, we can reduce their power to trigger distress in daily life.",
    "Client: I see. So, it's like facing my fears head-on? That's... intimidating, but I can see how it could be beneficial. What should I expect during the session?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the traumatic event in detail. It may be distressing, but I'll guide you through it.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm worried about getting too emotional or losing control. What if I can't handle it?",
    "Therapist: Your reactions are normal. We'll take breaks if needed, and I'll help you stay grounded throughout.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I guess I'm also concerned about how this might affect me after the session. Will I be okay to go about my day, or should I plan for some downtime?",
    "Therapist: It's wise to plan for self-care after. How might you comfort yourself post-session?",
    "Client: I think I might need some quiet time alone, maybe do some meditation or take a long walk. Is it normal to feel drained or emotional afterward?",
    "Therapist: Yes, feeling drained is common. Your self-care plan sounds perfect. Any other questions?",
    "Client: I'm curious about how many sessions of this we'll need to do. And... I know this might sound silly, but will revisiting these memories make them more vivid or frequent in my daily life?",
    "Therapist: We'll do several sessions, adjusting as needed. Initially, memories may feel more present but will fade with time.",
    "Client: I see. That's both reassuring and a bit scary. I appreciate your patience with all my questions. I think... I think I'm ready to try this. It won't be easy, but if it can help me move forward, I'm willing to give it a shot.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Remember, we're in this together. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do it. I'm nervous, but I trust you, and I'm hopeful this will help. Thank you for guiding me through this process and being so understanding of my concerns."
