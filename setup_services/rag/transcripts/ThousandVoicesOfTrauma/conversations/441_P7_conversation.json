    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure exercise. Can you describe the event related to human trafficking?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure where to start. It's hard to talk about.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay... It was about two years ago. I was working late at my shop, and a young woman came in. She looked scared and exhausted. She asked for help, saying she had escaped from a group that was forcing her to work... you know, in the sex trade. I was shocked. I didn't know what to do.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: I offered her some water and a place to sit. She was shaking. She told me her name was Mai, and she was from Vietnam. She said she had been promised a job in a restaurant, but when she arrived in the country, they took her passport and forced her into prostitution. I felt sick hearing her story.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I... I wanted to help her, but I was also scared. What if the traffickers came looking for her? I have a family to protect. But I couldn't just turn her away. I called the police, but while we were waiting, I saw a car slow down outside the shop. Mai panicked and hid behind the counter.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The men in the car looked threatening. They came into the shop, asking if I'd seen a young woman. I lied and said no. My heart was pounding so hard, I thought they could hear it. They looked around suspiciously, but eventually left. I was terrified they'd hurt Mai... or my family if they found out I helped her.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're here now.",
    "Client: When the police finally arrived, Mai was reluctant to go with them. She was scared of being deported. I felt helpless. I wanted to do more, but I didn't know how. The police took her away, and I never found out what happened to her. I keep thinking about her, wondering if she's safe, if I did enough...",
    "Therapist: You handled a difficult situation bravely.",
    "Client: But did I? I feel guilty for being scared, for not doing more. What if they found her again? What if she was deported back to danger? I can't shake the image of her terrified face. It haunts me.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have these thoughts. You're processing it well.",
    "Client: Sometimes I dream about it. In my dreams, the traffickers come back, but this time they find Mai, and they hurt my family too. I wake up in a cold sweat, feeling like I failed everyone. I wish I could forget, but I can't.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Keep going.",
    "Client: The worst part is feeling so powerless. Human trafficking is such a huge problem, and I couldn't even help one person effectively. It makes me angry and sad. I want to do something, but I don't know what. And I'm scared of putting my family at risk if I get involved. How can I live with this knowledge and do nothing?",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: I've never told anyone the full story before. My wife knows something happened, but I didn't want to burden her with the details. I feel isolated, carrying this secret. Sometimes I wonder if Mai is out there somewhere, still in danger, and if there was something more I could have done to help her.",
    "Therapist: Sharing this takes courage. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Thank you... It's hard to talk about, but somehow it feels a little better to share it. I just wish I knew what happened to Mai. I hope she's safe now. I hope she found help. But not knowing... it's like an open wound that won't heal.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable resilience. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also a bit lighter. Talking about it brought back all those intense emotions, but somehow they feel less overwhelming now. I still feel guilty and worried, but maybe... maybe I did the best I could in that situation.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you for listening. I've carried this for so long... I think I need to find a way to make peace with it, maybe even find a way to help others in similar situations. But I'm not sure how to start.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive direction. We'll work on that.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I know it won't be easy, but I think I'm ready to start processing this properly and finding a way forward. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You've made significant progress today. We'll continue next session."
