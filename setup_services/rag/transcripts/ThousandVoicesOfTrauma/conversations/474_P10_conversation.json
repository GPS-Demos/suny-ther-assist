    "Therapist: Welcome, Amira. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about the animal attack, and just thinking about it makes my heart race a little.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm at the park near my apartment. It's a sunny afternoon, and I decided to take a walk to clear my head after a stressful day at work. The grass is really green, and there are a few people around, mostly joggers and families with kids.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm walking along the path, and I hear... I hear a commotion. There's shouting, and then I see it. Oh God, there's a large dog, maybe a Rottweiler or something, and it's... it's attacking a smaller dog. The owner is screaming, trying to pull them apart.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm frozen. My heart is pounding, and I can't look away. The smaller dog is yelping in pain, and there's... there's blood. I want to help, but I'm terrified.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 70. I can feel my palms getting sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... The owner of the smaller dog is crying now, begging for help. Someone else runs over - a man in a red shirt. He's trying to separate the dogs, but the bigger one won't let go. I can hear the bones crunching... oh God, I feel sick.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay present. What are you doing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm still just standing there. I feel so useless. I should be doing something, but I can't move. My legs feel like they're made of lead.",
    "Therapist: It's okay. You're not responsible for what happened. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe 80? My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. Focus on the present moment. You're here, you're safe.",
    "Client: Right, okay... The man in the red shirt finally manages to pull the big dog off. The smaller dog is... it's not moving. There's so much blood on the grass. The owner is sobbing, cradling her dog. I feel like I'm going to throw up.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Amira. Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: Someone's called animal control. I can hear sirens in the distance. The owner of the big dog is trying to restrain it, but he looks shocked too. People are gathering around, some are trying to help the injured dog, others are just staring. I still can't move.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My whole body is trembling. I feel so guilty for not helping, but I was so scared. The sirens are getting louder, and I just want to run away.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel scared in a situation like that. You're not to blame. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 85? I can feel my heart racing.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor. You're here, in this room, safe.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm trying. The animal control van arrives, and they're approaching the big dog. The owner is crying now too, saying it's never done anything like this before. The paramedics are checking the smaller dog, but... but I think it's too late. The owner is inconsolable.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with the memory. What are you experiencing?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel helpless. And angry. Why didn't I do something? Why couldn't I move? I keep replaying it in my head, thinking of what I could have done differently. Maybe if I had acted faster...",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault, Amira. You were in shock. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm starting to feel a bit numb. Like it's all too much to process. The crowd is starting to disperse, but I'm still rooted to the spot. I can't stop staring at the blood on the grass.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response to trauma. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe 75? I feel exhausted.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: A police officer approaches me. He's asking if I saw what happened. I nod, but I can barely speak. My voice is shaky when I try to explain. I feel like I'm watching myself from outside my body.",
    "Therapist: That's called dissociation. It's a common response to trauma. Stay with the memory. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I can smell the grass, and something metallic - probably the blood. There's a breeze, but I feel cold and clammy. The officer is writing in his notebook, but I can barely focus on his questions. I keep glancing over at the owner of the smaller dog. She's sitting on the ground, looking shell-shocked.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Amira. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling a mix of things. Sad, angry, guilty. But also... relieved that it's over? Is that wrong?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. Those are all normal reactions. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 65 now. I'm starting to feel a bit more present.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's continue. What happens after you talk to the police?",
    "Client: I... I finally manage to move. I'm walking home, but everything feels surreal. The park looks the same, but it feels different now. Tainted. I keep looking over my shoulder, half expecting to see another dog attack. My hands are still shaking.",
    "Therapist: That hypervigilance is common after traumatic events. How do you feel as you're walking home?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel vulnerable. Like the world isn't as safe as I thought it was. I'm angry at the owner of the big dog, but also... I don't know, sad for them too? It's all so confusing.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have conflicting emotions. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 60. I'm feeling drained, but a bit calmer.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Amira. Let's continue. What do you do when you get home?",
    "Client: I... I lock the door behind me and just... collapse on the couch. I'm shaking again, and I can't stop replaying the scene in my head. I feel like I should call someone, but I don't know who. I don't want to be alone, but I also can't bear the thought of talking to anyone.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. How do you cope with those feelings?",
    "Client: I... I try to distract myself. I turn on the TV, but I'm not really watching it. I keep seeing flashes of the attack. I feel nauseous, so I go to the bathroom, but I don't actually throw up. I splash water on my face, trying to snap out of it.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 55. I'm feeling a bit more grounded, but still shaky.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I end up curled up in bed, even though it's still early. I can't stop thinking about the smaller dog, about how quickly everything happened. I keep wondering if I'll ever feel safe in the park again. I try to sleep, but every time I close my eyes, I see the attack.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response to trauma. How do you manage to get through the night?",
    "Client: I... I don't sleep much. I toss and turn, having fragmented nightmares. When I finally do fall into a deeper sleep, I'm startled awake by the sound of a dog barking outside. My heart is racing again, and I'm covered in sweat.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, as you remember that night?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling sad. And tired. So tired. It's like the exhaustion from that night is hitting me all over again. But... I also feel a little stronger? Like, I survived that night, and all the nights since then.",
    "Therapist: That's a great observation, Amira. You are stronger than you realize. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 45. I'm feeling more in control.",
    "Therapist: You've done an excellent job today. How are you feeling overall about this session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm surprised. It was hard, really hard, but I feel like I understand my reactions better now. And... and maybe I'm not as helpless as I thought I was.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. You've shown incredible strength today. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay... *takes deep breaths* Thank you. This was... intense, but I think it helped.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Amira. Remember to be kind to yourself for the rest of the day. We'll continue working through this in our next session."
