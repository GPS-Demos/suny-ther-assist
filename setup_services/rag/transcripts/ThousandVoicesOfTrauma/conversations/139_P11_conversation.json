    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, James?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. Going through that memory of the cyber bullying incident... it brought back so many emotions I thought I'd buried.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. Watching those messages flood in, seeing my private photos shared without my consent... I felt so powerless, you know? It was like being violated all over again, but this time in front of everyone I knew. I couldn't stop it, couldn't take it back. It was just... there, for everyone to see.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How did reliving that feel different from your usual memories of it?",
    "Client: It was more... intense, I guess. Usually, when I think about it, I try to push it away quickly. But going through it step-by-step like that, I noticed things I hadn't before. Like how my body tensed up, how my breathing changed. And the shame... God, the shame was overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're showing a lot of courage facing this. How does this connect to your day-to-day experiences now?",
    "Client: I... I think it explains a lot, actually. Why I'm always so anxious about my phone, why I flinch when it buzzes. And maybe... maybe it's why I have such a hard time trusting people, even my wife sometimes. It's like I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful connection. What else?",
    "Client: I guess it also explains why I avoid social media like the plague. I mean, I know it's important for networking and stuff, especially in my line of work, but... the thought of putting myself out there again, even in the most innocent way, it terrifies me.",
    "Therapist: How do you think addressing this might impact your goals?",
    "Client: I... I want to feel normal again, you know? To use technology without panic, to trust people. Maybe if I can process this, I can start to do that. Maybe I can stop letting this control my life.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's one small step you might take?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Maybe... maybe I could try looking at my social media accounts again? Not posting anything, just... looking. With my wife there for support. Baby steps, right?",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a thoughtful approach. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired. Really tired. But also... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful? Like maybe there's a way through this. It's scary as hell, but... maybe it's worth it.",
    "Therapist: Your resilience is admirable. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. This was... intense. But thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. I know I've got a long way to go, but... I think I'm starting to see a path forward, you know?",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, James. We'll continue next week. Take care."
