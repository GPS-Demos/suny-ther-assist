    "Therapist: Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: I'm not sure, to be honest. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of reliving those experiences... it's scary. I mean, I understand why we're doing it, but I can't help feeling anxious about it.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I worry that once I start talking about it, I won't be able to stop. What if I completely fall apart? And... I'm embarrassed about some of the things that happened. It's hard to talk about them, especially the racial aspects. I've never really discussed that with anyone before.",
    "Therapist: I understand. How can I support you today?",
    "Client: I think I just need reassurance that you'll be here with me through it all. And maybe some guidance on what to do if it gets too overwhelming? I don't want to panic or shut down completely.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll go at your pace, and I'll guide you throughout. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: How long will this take? And will we have to do this multiple times? I'm worried about how I'll feel afterwards, especially since I have classes to attend and roommates to deal with.",
    "Therapist: It typically takes 30-45 minutes. We'll do it weekly. How do you think you'll manage afterwards?",
    "Client: That's longer than I expected. I'm not sure how I'll manage. Maybe I should clear my schedule for the rest of the day after our sessions? I could let my roommates know I might need some alone time. Do you think that would be a good idea?",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent plan. Self-care after sessions is crucial. Anything else you'd like to know?",
    "Client: Yes, actually. Will this really help? I mean, I've spent so long trying to avoid thinking about these experiences. It's hard to believe that deliberately remembering them could be beneficial. And... I'm worried about how it might affect my current relationship. What if it brings up issues I thought I'd dealt with?",
    "Therapist: It's proven effective for many. Your concerns are normal. Shall we discuss coping strategies?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think having some concrete strategies would help me feel more prepared. And... I appreciate your patience with all my questions. This is just really new and intimidating for me.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Your courage is admirable. Let's go over some grounding techniques first.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm trying to be brave, but it's not easy. Grounding techniques sound good. I've heard a bit about those, but I've never really used them effectively. Do you think they'll help even with really intense memories?",
    "Therapist: Yes, they can be very effective. Ready to learn a few?",
    "Client: Definitely. I'm willing to try anything that might help. And... thank you for being so understanding. It means a lot to have someone who listens without judgment, especially when it comes to the racial aspects of my experiences. That's always been the hardest part to talk about."
