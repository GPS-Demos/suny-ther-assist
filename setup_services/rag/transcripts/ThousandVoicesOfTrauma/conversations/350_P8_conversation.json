    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. My heart is still racing a bit. It's like I'm back there, you know? The sound of the engines, the sudden drop... I can feel the fear rising in my chest all over again.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Panic, I think. It's like a wave washing over me. My palms are sweaty, and I feel this tightness in my throat. I keep thinking about how helpless I felt in that moment, how I thought it was the end.",
    "Therapist: And what thoughts are accompanying that panic?",
    "Client: I keep hearing the screams of the other passengers. It's so vivid. I'm thinking, \"This is it. I'm going to die.\" And then... then I feel guilty. Because I survived, and others didn't. Why did I get to live?",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt manifest for you?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a weight on my chest. Sometimes I find it hard to breathe when I think about it. I wonder if I could have done more to help others. Maybe if I hadn't frozen in fear, I could have saved someone else.",
    "Therapist: What else comes up for you as you reflect on this memory?",
    "Client: I... I remember the smell. The acrid scent of smoke and fuel. It makes me nauseous even now. And I can't shake this feeling of vulnerability. Like at any moment, everything could be taken away from me. It's affecting my daily life, you know? I struggle to get on planes, obviously, but even driving or being in tall buildings makes me anxious now.",
    "Therapist: How does this vulnerability compare to your feelings about the sexual abuse you experienced?",
    "Client: Oh... I hadn't made that connection before. But now that you mention it, there are similarities. That same feeling of helplessness, of having no control over what's happening to me. With the abuse, it was more of a slow, creeping dread. With the plane crash, it was sudden and intense. But both left me feeling... broken, I guess. Like I can't trust the world to be safe anymore.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your body as you make this connection?",
    "Client: I... I feel a tension in my shoulders. They're hunched up, like I'm trying to protect myself. And my breathing is shallow. It's like my body is preparing for something bad to happen, even though I'm safe here. It's exhausting, always being on guard like this.",
    "Therapist: How do these physical sensations relate to your anxiety?",
    "Client: They're... they're pretty much constant companions now. The tension, the shallow breathing, the racing heart. It's like my body is stuck in fight-or-flight mode. I'm always scanning for danger, always ready to react. It's affecting my sleep, my relationships, my work. I feel like I'm not fully present in my own life anymore.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to you to feel safe again?",
    "Client: God, I... I can barely imagine it. To be able to relax, to not constantly be on edge. To be able to enjoy life again without this cloud of fear hanging over me. To be able to fly without panicking, or to be intimate without flashbacks. It would be like... like being reborn, I guess. Like reclaiming my life.",
    "Therapist: How does talking about this now compare to when we first started therapy?",
    "Client: It's... it's still hard. Really hard. But I think I'm able to articulate it better now. Before, it was just this overwhelming mass of fear and pain that I couldn't even begin to untangle. Now, I can at least identify different aspects of it. The guilt, the vulnerability, the physical sensations. It doesn't make it go away, but it makes it feel... I don't know, more manageable somehow?",
    "Therapist: What's giving you hope in your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I... I guess the fact that I can talk about it at all is progress. And there are moments, brief ones, where I feel okay. Where I can enjoy time with my family without the anxiety overwhelming me. Those moments are becoming more frequent. It's slow, and sometimes I get frustrated with the pace, but... I'm starting to believe that maybe, just maybe, I can get through this.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's scary, to be honest. Facing these memories, these feelings... it's like reopening old wounds. But I also feel a sense of... determination, I guess? Like, I've survived the actual events. I can survive remembering them too. And if there's a chance it'll help me reclaim my life, then I want to keep trying. It's hard, but... I think it's worth it.",
    "Therapist: What support do you need moving forward?",
    "Client: I... I think I need patience. From myself, from my family, from you. This isn't a quick fix, and sometimes I get discouraged when I have setbacks. And maybe... maybe some tools to help me ground myself when the memories and anxiety get overwhelming? And just... someone to listen, to validate that what I'm feeling is real and that it's okay to struggle with this.",
    "Therapist: How would you like to close our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to take a few deep breaths together. To remind myself that I'm here, in the present, and that I'm safe. And maybe... maybe to acknowledge that even though this was hard, I did it. I faced those memories and I'm still here. That feels important somehow.",
    "Therapist: Let's do that. You've shown immense courage today."
