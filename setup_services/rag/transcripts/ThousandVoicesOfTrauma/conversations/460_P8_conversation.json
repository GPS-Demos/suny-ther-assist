    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is buzzing, you know? My hands are a bit shaky, and there's this tightness in my chest. The memory of my father's funeral... it's so vivid now. I can still smell the incense from the mosque, hear the quiet sobs of my family. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how young I was when he passed. I was only twelve, and suddenly, the world felt so big and scary. I remember standing there, looking at his casket, and feeling completely lost. Like, how am I supposed to navigate life without him? And now, even though it's been over 20 years, I still feel that same sense of abandonment sometimes.",
    "Therapist: How does that feeling of abandonment show up for you today?",
    "Client: It's... it's like this constant fear that everyone I love will leave me. With my wife, I sometimes get overly anxious if she's late coming home or doesn't answer her phone. And in my business, I struggle to delegate because I'm afraid of relying on others. It's exhausting, always waiting for the other shoe to drop.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing about your emotions right now?",
    "Client: There's anger, definitely. Anger at the universe for taking him away so soon. Sadness, of course - this deep, aching sadness that never really goes away. But also... guilt? I feel guilty for still struggling with this after so many years. Shouldn't I be over it by now? And then there's this weird sense of relief, which makes me feel even more guilty. Relief that I can finally talk about this without completely falling apart.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to share these emotions out loud?",
    "Client: It's... liberating, in a way. Scary, but liberating. I've kept so much of this bottled up for years. In our culture, men aren't really supposed to show vulnerability, you know? So talking about it feels like I'm breaking some unspoken rule. But at the same time, it's like this weight is lifting off my shoulders. I can actually feel the tension in my body starting to release a bit.",
    "Therapist: What do you make of that physical release?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe it's okay to feel these things? To let them out? It's strange because for so long, I've associated these memories and feelings with pain and anxiety. But now, talking about it, it's like I'm reconnecting with my dad in a way. I'm remembering the good times too, not just the loss. His laugh, the way he'd ruffle my hair when he was proud of me. It hurts, but it's a different kind of hurt. More... bittersweet, I suppose.",
    "Therapist: How might this new perspective impact your daily life?",
    "Client: I... I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I could be more open with my wife about these feelings? I've always tried to be the strong one, you know? But perhaps sharing this vulnerability could bring us closer. And with my anxiety... maybe recognizing where it comes from could help me manage it better. Like, when I start to feel that fear of abandonment, I could remind myself that it's rooted in this old pain, not necessarily in reality.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you could take this week?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I could start by showing my wife a photo of my dad. I've kept them all hidden away, but sharing that with her, telling her a story about him... that could be a start. It's scary, but I think it might be good. For both of us.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that idea?",
    "Client: Nervous, definitely. There's this fear that I'll break down, that I won't be able to control my emotions. But there's also a sense of... hope? Like maybe this could be the beginning of something healing. And honestly, there's a part of me that's excited to share that part of my life with her. To let her see this side of me that I've kept hidden for so long.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, I think. Like I've set down a heavy backpack I've been carrying for years. My breathing feels easier, and the tightness in my chest has eased up a bit. There's still sadness there, and probably always will be, but it doesn't feel as suffocating as it did before. And I feel... I don't know, maybe a bit proud of myself? For facing this, for talking about it. It's not easy, but I'm doing it.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. How would you like to close our session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to take a moment of silence. To honor my dad's memory, but also to acknowledge this step I've taken today. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's do that.",
    "Client: Thank you. This... this has been really powerful. I'm nervous about what comes next, but I also feel more ready to face it. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. We'll continue next week."
