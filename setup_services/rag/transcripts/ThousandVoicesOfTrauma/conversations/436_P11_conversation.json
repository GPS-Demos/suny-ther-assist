    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Thompson?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure, to be honest. It's a lot to process. Going through that memory of my brother's funeral again, it's... it's intense. I can still see the flowers, smell the incense. It's like I was right back there.",
    "Therapist: What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The silence. It was so... oppressive. Everyone trying to be respectful, but it felt suffocating. And then, later that night, when I went online and saw all those horrible comments about him... God, it was like losing him all over again.",
    "Therapist: How did reliving that feel today?",
    "Client: It was tough. Really tough. My heart was racing, and I felt this tightness in my chest. But... it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I mean, it was awful, but I got through it.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. What do you make of that?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe I'm getting stronger? Or the memory is losing some of its power? I don't know. It still hurts, but I didn't feel like I was drowning this time.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your day-to-day experiences?",
    "Client: Well, I've been avoiding social media since it happened. But going through this... maybe I can start to face it again? I miss connecting with people online for my business, but I've been so afraid of seeing something triggering.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. How might you approach that?",
    "Client: Um, maybe I could start small? Like, check my business page for a few minutes each day? And have a plan for what to do if I see something upsetting?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful approach. How are you feeling about trying that?",
    "Client: Nervous, definitely. But also... kind of hopeful? Like, maybe I can take back some control.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What else came up for you during the exposure?",
    "Client: I... I realized I've been angry at my brother. For leaving me to deal with all this alone. And then I feel guilty for being angry. It's such a mess of emotions.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have complex feelings. How does recognizing that affect you?",
    "Client: It's a relief, actually. To know it's okay to feel all these things. I've been bottling it up, trying to be strong for everyone else.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. Where do you want to go from here?",
    "Client: I think... I want to work on accepting these feelings. And maybe find ways to honor my brother's memory that don't involve getting caught up in the online negativity.",
    "Therapist: That's a meaningful goal. How do you feel about our session today?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... good. Like I've made some progress. It's hard work, but I think it's worth it.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is commendable. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm starting to see a way forward.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: Maybe we could work more on strategies for dealing with social media? And... I think I'm ready to talk about some of the good memories of my brother too.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How will you take care of yourself this week?",
    "Client: I'll try that gradual approach to social media we talked about. And maybe I'll look at some old photos of my brother... the happy ones.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Remember to use your coping strategies if things get overwhelming.",
    "Client: I will. Thanks again, Doc. See you next week.",
    "Therapist: Take care, Mr. Thompson. You've done well today."
