    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the moment you felt most hurt during your divorce?",
    "Client: It was when I found out my ex-wife had been lying about her feelings for months. We were sitting in our living room, and she just blurted out that she hadn't loved me for a long time. I felt like the ground disappeared beneath me. My chest tightened, and I couldn't breathe properly. I remember looking at the family photos on the wall and feeling like my whole life was a lie.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: It's hard to think about. I felt so betrayed and foolish. I started questioning every moment we'd shared in the past year. Was she faking her smiles? Her affection? I remember my hands shaking as I tried to process what she was saying. I wanted to yell, to demand answers, but I just sat there, stunned.",
    "Therapist: That's it. Keep going. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I remember the silence that followed. It was deafening. I could hear the clock ticking on the mantle, and it felt like each second was stretching into eternity. I looked at her, searching for any sign of the woman I married, but all I saw was a stranger. My throat felt dry, and when I finally spoke, my voice cracked. I asked her, \"How long?\" And her answer... God, her answer broke me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. It's okay to feel these emotions.",
    "Client: She said, \"Almost a year.\" A year! We'd celebrated our anniversary, gone on vacations, made plans for the future... all while she knew she didn't love me anymore. I felt so stupid, so utterly blind. I started to hyperventilate. The room seemed to spin, and I gripped the armrests of my chair to steady myself. I wanted to run, to escape, but I was frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: I... I'm trying. It's just... the memory is so vivid. I can still smell her perfume, see the way she avoided eye contact. I remember feeling this overwhelming sense of loss, not just of her, but of my future, my identity as a husband. Everything I thought I knew about my life suddenly felt like a lie. I started to cry, and I hated myself for it. I didn't want her to see me weak, but I couldn't stop the tears.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel vulnerable. You're showing strength by facing this.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard not to feel ashamed. After she told me, I just sat there in silence for what felt like hours. My mind was racing, trying to piece together where it all went wrong. I thought about all the times she seemed distant, all the little signs I'd ignored. I felt like such a fool for not seeing it sooner. The worst part was realizing that our entire relationship for the past year had been built on her lie. Every kiss, every \"I love you,\" it was all fake.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job staying with the memory.",
    "Client: It's painful, but I'm trying. As the reality of what she was saying sank in, I felt this intense anger building up inside me. I wanted to lash out, to hurt her like she hurt me. But instead, I just felt... hollow. Empty. Like everything that made me who I was had been stripped away. I remember looking down at my wedding ring and feeling physically ill. I took it off and placed it on the coffee table. The sound it made as it hit the glass seemed to echo through the room, finalizing the end of our marriage.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible courage. Keep going.",
    "Client: After I took off the ring, I finally found my voice. I asked her why she waited so long to tell me, why she let me believe everything was okay. Her answer was so... clinical. She said she was trying to find the right time, that she didn't want to hurt me. But all I could think was that every day she stayed silent was another day she was lying to me. I felt so betrayed, so utterly alone in that moment. It was like the person I trusted most in the world had stabbed me in the back, and I never saw it coming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. It's normal to feel these intense emotions.",
    "Client: I... I think I need a moment. This is harder than I expected. Reliving it... it's bringing back all those feelings of inadequacy and betrayal. I remember leaving the house that night, just walking aimlessly through the neighborhood. It was raining, but I didn't care. I was soaked to the bone, but the cold and wet felt fitting, like the world was reflecting how I felt inside. I kept replaying her words in my head, wondering how I could have been so blind, so stupid. I felt like a failure as a husband, as a man. Like I wasn't enough to keep her love.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. You're handling this remarkably well.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still so raw, even after all this time. That night changed everything for me. I couldn't go back to the house for days. I stayed with a friend, but I barely slept or ate. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw her face as she told me she didn't love me anymore. I kept wondering what I did wrong, what I could have done differently. The self-doubt was overwhelming. I questioned every decision I'd ever made, every aspect of my personality. Was I too boring? Too predictable? Not successful enough? The questions haunted me, day and night.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Keep going at your own pace.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's hard not to fall back into those negative thought patterns. The divorce process itself was a nightmare. Dividing up our life, our possessions... each item was a reminder of the future we'd planned together, now shattered. The worst was when we had to sell the house. Standing in those empty rooms, remembering all the happy moments we'd shared there... it felt like I was burying a part of myself. I broke down in the kitchen, the place where we used to cook together, laugh together. It hit me then that I wasn't just losing my wife, but my best friend, my partner in everything.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an amazing job processing these difficult memories.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to talk about, but I know it's important. The aftermath of the divorce was... challenging. I threw myself into work, trying to distract myself from the pain. But everywhere I went, there were reminders. Couples holding hands in the park, love songs on the radio, even seeing wedding rings in jewelry store windows... it all felt like salt in the wound. I started avoiding social situations, especially with our mutual friends. I couldn't bear the pitying looks, the awkward conversations. I felt so alone, so isolated. It was like I was carrying this heavy secret, this shame, even though I knew logically that her choices weren't my fault.",
    "Therapist: You're navigating these memories with great courage. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, to be honest. Reliving all of this is draining, but there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe relief? Like I'm finally letting out all these feelings I've been bottling up. It's still painful, but talking about it, really facing it head-on... it feels like I'm taking back some control. I've spent so long trying to avoid these memories, these feelings, but maybe confronting them is the first step to truly moving on. It's hard, and it hurts, but I think I need this. I need to process what happened to move forward with my life.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. You've done incredibly well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It still hurts, and I still have a lot of anger and sadness to work through, but I feel like I've taken a step forward today. I want to keep working on this, to understand my feelings better and learn how to trust again. I don't want this experience to define the rest of my life. I want to find a way to move past it, to be open to love again someday, even if that seems impossible right now.",
    "Therapist: You've made significant progress. We'll continue this work in our next session."

Like I'm finally letting out all these feelings I've been bottling up. It's still painful, but talking about it, really facing it head-on... it feels like I'm taking back some control. I've spent so long trying to avoid these memories, these feelings, but maybe confronting them is the first step to truly moving on. It's hard, and it hurts, but I think I need this. I need to process what happened to move forward with my life.",
      "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. You've done incredibly well today.",
      "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It still hurts, and I still have a lot of anger and sadness to work through, but I feel like I've taken a step forward today. I want to keep working on this, to understand my feelings better and learn how to trust again. I don't want this experience to define the rest of my life. I want to find a way to move past it, to be open to love again someday, even if that seems impossible right now."
