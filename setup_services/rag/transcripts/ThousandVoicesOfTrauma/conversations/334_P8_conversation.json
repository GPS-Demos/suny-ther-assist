    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also frozen at the same time. I can still see the images so vividly, you know? My father's angry face, his raised hand... I can almost feel the sting on my cheek again. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What physical sensations are you noticing right now?",
    "Client: My heart is pounding, and my palms are sweaty. I feel this tightness in my chest, like I can't take a full breath. And my muscles are so tense, especially in my shoulders and jaw. It's like... like my body is preparing for something bad to happen, even though I know I'm safe here.",
    "Therapist: You're very aware of your body's responses. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"Why me? Why did I have to go through this?\" And then I feel guilty for even asking that because I know others have had it worse. But then I get angry, you know? I think about how unfair it all was, how I was just a kid who didn't deserve any of that. And then... then I wonder if I'll ever really be okay, if I'll always carry this weight with me.",
    "Therapist: Those are heavy thoughts. How do you feel as you express them?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of relief and fear, I guess. Relief because it feels good to finally say these things out loud, to acknowledge them. But there's also this fear that by talking about it, I'm making it more real somehow. And there's shame too, like maybe I should be over this by now. I mean, I'm a grown man, successful in my work, but here I am, still affected by things that happened decades ago.",
    "Therapist: It's common to have those conflicting feelings. What else comes up for you?",
    "Client: I... I find myself thinking about my relationships, or lack thereof. I've always struggled to get close to people, you know? It's like there's this wall I've built, and I don't know how to take it down. And now I'm wondering if it's all connected to this, to what happened when I was a kid. Maybe that's why I've never been able to maintain a long-term relationship. It's... it's scary to think about.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful connection. How does making that link feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a bit of a revelation, actually. I've never really put it together like that before. It's sad, you know? To think about all the connections I might have missed out on because of this. But it's also... I don't know, maybe hopeful? Like, now that I can see it, maybe I can work on changing it. But then I wonder, is it too late? Have I missed my chance at having a normal life, a family of my own?",
    "Therapist: It's never too late for change. What do you think about that?",
    "Client: I... I want to believe that. It's just... it feels like such a long journey ahead, you know? But I guess I've already come this far. I mean, a few months ago, I couldn't even talk about this stuff without turning to alcohol to numb myself. And now here I am, facing it head-on. It's terrifying, but also... empowering, I guess? Like, if I can do this, maybe I can do anything.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm noticing that as we talk, some of that physical tension is starting to ease up a bit. My breathing feels a little easier. And while the memories are still there, they don't feel quite as overwhelming as they did right after the exercise. It's like... like I'm starting to see them as just memories, not something that's happening right now. Is that... is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's a common experience. How does that shift feel?",
    "Client: It feels... good, I think. Like I'm regaining some control. But there's also this weird sense of loss, you know? Like, as painful as these memories are, they've been a part of me for so long. It's almost like I'm afraid of who I'll be without them defining me. Does that make any sense?",
    "Therapist: It makes perfect sense. Can you tell me more about that fear?",
    "Client: I guess... I guess I'm afraid of the unknown. For so long, I've been the guy with the troubled past, the one who keeps people at arm's length. It's not great, but it's familiar, you know? If I let go of that, who am I? What if I open myself up and get hurt again? What if I'm not strong enough to handle it? But then again, what if I am? What if there's this whole other life waiting for me on the other side of all this? It's... it's both exciting and terrifying.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How do you feel about exploring them further?",
    "Client: I... I think I want to. It's scary, but I also feel like I've come too far to turn back now. And honestly, for the first time in a long time, I feel like there might be hope for something better. It's a small feeling, but it's there. And that... that feels pretty amazing.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to explore more about how my past is affecting my relationships. Maybe we could talk about ways to start opening up to people, or how to recognize when I'm putting up those walls. And... and maybe we could do another exposure exercise? As tough as it was, I feel like it really helped me process things in a new way.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've done some hard work, but it was worth it. I'm a little anxious about what's to come, but I'm also feeling more... I don't know, more grounded? More present? Yeah, that's it. I feel more present than I have in a long time. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Take care of yourself until next time.",
    "Client: Thank you, I will. See you next week."
