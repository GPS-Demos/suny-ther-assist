    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sam?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Going through that memory of being trapped in that clinic, it just... it brought everything back so vividly. The smells, the sounds, the fear... it's like I was right there again.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. Being strapped to that bed, not knowing what they were going to do to me next. I kept thinking about how I ended up there, you know? How I trusted those people who said they'd help me find a job here, and instead... (voice breaks) I'm sorry, it's just hard to talk about.",
    "Therapist: It's okay. Take your time.",
    "Client: (deep breath) Right. Well, I remember the constant fear. Every time the door opened, my heart would race. I didn't know if it would be someone coming to hurt me or... or harvest my organs. That's what they threatened, you know? They said if I didn't cooperate, they'd take my kidneys and leave me for dead. I felt so... so powerless.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that today?",
    "Client: It was... tough. Really tough. But also... different? I mean, I was scared, but I knew I was here, in your office. Safe. It's like... I could observe the memory without being completely consumed by it. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What else did you notice?",
    "Client: I realized how much anger I've been carrying. Not just at the traffickers, but at myself. For being naive, for not seeing the signs. But going through it again, I can see that I was just trying to make a better life for myself. I couldn't have known.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight, Sam.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess it is. It's just... it's still hard, you know? I have nightmares almost every night. I'm constantly on edge, especially in crowded places or when I hear certain accents. It's like... like I can't escape it, even though I'm free now.",
    "Therapist: How do you think this relates to your recovery?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. I mean, I know facing these memories is supposed to help, but sometimes it feels like I'm just reopening old wounds. But then again, talking about it here, it does feel a bit less... overwhelming? Like, maybe I can start to process it instead of just trying to push it away all the time.",
    "Therapist: That's a great observation. How else has this impacted you?",
    "Client: Well, it's affected everything, really. My studies - I can't concentrate like I used to. Relationships - I find it hard to trust anyone. And then there's the anxiety... it's constant. But I think... I think maybe going through this memory today, as hard as it was, it's helping me see that I'm not there anymore. I'm here, I'm safe, and maybe... maybe I can start to move forward.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization, Sam.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's... it's still scary, you know? The idea of facing more of these memories. But I think I'm starting to see why it's important. I don't want to be controlled by this fear anymore. I want to be able to live my life, to finish my degree, to maybe even have a relationship someday without all this... baggage.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: I'm... cautiously optimistic, I guess? It's hard, really hard. But for the first time in a long time, I feel like maybe there's a light at the end of the tunnel. I'm willing to keep trying if you think it'll help.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable, Sam.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I appreciate that. It doesn't always feel like courage, you know? Sometimes it just feels like survival. But I'm starting to see that maybe it can be more than that. Maybe I can actually heal, not just survive. It's a scary thought, but also... kind of exciting?",
    "Therapist: That's a great perspective. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling pretty drained, to be honest. But also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've put down a bit of the weight I've been carrying. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know we have a long way to go, but... I think I'm ready to keep moving forward.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today, Sam. Take care."
