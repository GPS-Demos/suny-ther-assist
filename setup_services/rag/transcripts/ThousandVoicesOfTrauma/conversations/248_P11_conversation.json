    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. That memory of the animal attack during my deployment... it's just so vivid, you know? I can still hear the growling, feel the fear...",
    "Therapist: Understandable. What stood out most?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. I was trained for combat, but not for a wild animal. I felt so... unprepared. And the pain, oh God, the pain was excruciating. It's like I can still feel it sometimes, especially when my chronic pain flares up. It's like my body remembers, even when I try to forget.",
    "Therapist: How does reliving it affect you now?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. On one hand, it's terrifying to go back there. But on the other, it feels... I don't know, maybe a little empowering? Like, I survived that. I'm here. But then I feel guilty for feeling okay about it when others weren't as lucky.",
    "Therapist: Guilt is common. How else has this impacted you?",
    "Client: It's affected everything. My sleep, my relationships, my work. I'm always on edge, especially in crowded places. And living with roommates is... challenging. They don't understand why I sometimes react so strongly to sudden noises or movements. It's isolating.",
    "Therapist: That sounds difficult. Any positive changes?",
    "Client: Well... I guess I've become more aware of my surroundings. And I've started to appreciate the little moments of peace more. Oh, and I've been trying some breathing exercises you taught me. They help sometimes, especially with the pain.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How's your support system?",
    "Client: It's... okay. My family tries, but they're back home in the Middle East. They don't really get it. My coworkers are nice, but I keep them at arm's length. I'm afraid of getting too close, you know? But I've been thinking about joining that support group you mentioned.",
    "Therapist: That could be helpful. Any other insights?",
    "Client: I've realized that... maybe I'm stronger than I thought. Going through this memory again and again, it's tough, but I'm doing it. And each time, it gets a tiny bit easier. It's like... I'm reclaiming that part of my life, bit by bit.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How will you use it?",
    "Client: I think... I want to start challenging myself more. Maybe try to go out more, or talk to my roommates about what I'm going through. And definitely keep up with these sessions. They're hard, but I can see how they're helping.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a good plan. Anything else?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't judge. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Ready to wrap up?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I feel drained, but also... lighter? Is that weird? Like I've put down a heavy backpack I've been carrying. I know I'll have to pick it up again, but now I know I can set it down sometimes. That's... that's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. It's significant progress.",
    "Client: Okay. Yeah. I can do this. One step at a time, right? Same time next week?",
    "Therapist: Yes, see you then. Take care."
