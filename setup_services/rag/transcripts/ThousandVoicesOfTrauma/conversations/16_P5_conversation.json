    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Johnson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... a bit nervous, to be honest. This whole process has been challenging, and I'm not sure what to expect from today's session.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We'll take it step by step.",
    "Client: Okay. I appreciate that. It's just... ever since that incident with the police, I've been struggling to feel safe. Even coming here today, I found myself constantly looking over my shoulder. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Your reactions are valid. Today, we'll explore those feelings through imaginal exposure.",
    "Client: Imaginal exposure? That sounds... intense. What exactly does that involve?",
    "Therapist: It's revisiting the traumatic memory in a safe environment.",
    "Client: Oh God, I don't know if I can do that. Just thinking about it makes my heart race. What if I panic?",
    "Therapist: I'll be here to support you throughout. We'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: I appreciate that, but... I've been trying so hard to forget. Won't this make things worse? I mean, I'm already having trouble sleeping and concentrating at work. My husband is worried sick about me.",
    "Therapist: Facing the memory can actually reduce its power over you.",
    "Client: Really? That seems counterintuitive. How does that work exactly?",
    "Therapist: It helps your brain process the event differently, reducing fear responses.",
    "Client: I see. So, it's like... rewiring my brain? That makes sense, I suppose. But what if I get overwhelmed? I've had anxiety attacks before, and they're terrifying.",
    "Therapist: We'll use grounding techniques if needed. Your safety is paramount.",
    "Client: Okay, that's reassuring. I trust you, but I'm still scared. Will this help with the nightmares too? They've been getting worse lately.",
    "Therapist: Yes, it often helps reduce nightmares and other PTSD symptoms.",
    "Client: That would be such a relief. I'm tired of feeling like this... always on edge, unable to relax. Do you really think this will help?",
    "Therapist: Many clients find it very effective. Your courage is admirable.",
    "Client: Thank you. I guess I'm ready to try. Can you walk me through what we'll be doing exactly? I like to be prepared.",
    "Therapist: Certainly. We'll revisit the memory, and you'll describe it out loud.",
    "Client: Out loud? Oh my... that's going to be hard. But I understand why it might help. Will you be guiding me through it?",
    "Therapist: Yes, I'll guide you. We can pause anytime you need to.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm nervous, but I'm willing to try. How long will this process take? And will we do this every session?",
    "Therapist: It varies, but typically 30-45 minutes. We'll do it regularly.",
    "Client: Alright. I'm going to try my best. I really want to get better, for myself and my family. Is there anything I should do to prepare before we start?",
    "Therapist: Just focus on your breathing. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay, I can do that. Deep breaths. I'm ready. Let's do this."
