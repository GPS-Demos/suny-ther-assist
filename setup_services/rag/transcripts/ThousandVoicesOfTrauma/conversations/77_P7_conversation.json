    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the incident with the police?",
    "Client: Okay... I was walking home late one night after closing my shop. It was dark, and I saw a police car approaching. Suddenly, they stopped and two officers got out. They started yelling at me to stop and put my hands up. I was confused and scared...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I tried to explain that I was just walking home, but they wouldn't listen. One officer grabbed my arm roughly and slammed me against the car. I felt so helpless... The other officer started patting me down aggressively. I was trembling, thinking they might hurt me...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I can feel my heart racing just like it did that night. They kept accusing me of being drunk or on drugs, but I hadn't had anything. I tried to stay calm, but I was terrified. The officer holding me pushed me harder against the car, and I felt pain in my chest...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Continue.",
    "Client: I started crying, begging them to let me go. They laughed and called me names. I felt so humiliated and angry, but I was too scared to do anything. They finally let me go after what felt like hours, but it was probably only about 20 minutes. I stumbled home, shaking and sobbing...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: When I got home, I couldn't sleep. I kept replaying the incident in my head, feeling angry and powerless. I was afraid to go out at night for weeks after that. Even now, when I see a police car, I feel my chest tighten and my palms get sweaty...",
    "Therapist: You're showing strength by sharing this. Keep going.",
    "Client: I feel so ashamed that I couldn't stand up for myself. I know I didn't do anything wrong, but I still feel guilty somehow. Like maybe if I had dressed differently or taken a different route home, it wouldn't have happened. I hate feeling this way...",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. You're processing this well.",
    "Client: Sometimes I have nightmares about it. In my dreams, they actually arrest me or hurt me physically. I wake up in a cold sweat, feeling like I can't breathe. It's affected my work too. I'm always looking over my shoulder, afraid it might happen again...",
    "Therapist: You're confronting these fears. That takes courage.",
    "Client: I've thought about filing a complaint, but I'm scared of retaliation. What if they come after me? What if they make my life even worse? I feel so powerless and angry. I just want to feel safe in my own neighborhood again...",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. You're doing well expressing them.",
    "Client: I've started avoiding certain areas of town, even if it means taking longer routes. I don't go out at night anymore if I can help it. My friends have noticed I'm more withdrawn, but I'm embarrassed to tell them what happened. I feel so alone in this...",
    "Therapist: You're not alone. We're here together in this process.",
    "Client: Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel normal again. Will I always be looking over my shoulder? Will I ever trust the police? I want to move past this, but it feels impossible. Every time I think I'm making progress, something triggers the memories and I'm right back there...",
    "Therapist: It's a process. You're making important steps.",
    "Client: I've tried to distract myself with work, but it's always there in the back of my mind. I feel like I've lost a part of myself. My confidence, my sense of security... It's like they took that from me that night. How do I get it back?",
    "Therapist: You're working on reclaiming those parts. Keep going.",
    "Client: I just want to feel safe again. I want to be able to walk down the street without my heart racing. I want to see a police officer and not immediately feel panic. Is that even possible? Will I ever get there?",
    "Therapist: It is possible. You're taking important steps now.",
    "Client: I hope so. This whole experience has made me realize how vulnerable we all are. It's changed how I see the world. I want to heal, to move forward, but it's so hard. Every day feels like a struggle...",
    "Therapist: You're showing resilience. Let's continue working through this together."
