    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Can you describe the scene where you witnessed violence?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in our family home. It's evening, and I can hear raised voices from the living room. My parents are arguing again. I'm upstairs in my bedroom, but the shouting is getting louder. I'm feeling scared and anxious.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: I can hear footsteps on the stairs. They're heavy and fast. My heart is racing. I know something bad is about to happen. I want to hide, but I'm frozen in place. The door bursts open, and my father storms in. He's red-faced and shouting. My mother is right behind him, pleading for him to calm down.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you see and feel?",
    "Client: I see the rage in my father's eyes. He's towering over me, and I feel so small and helpless. My mother is crying now, begging him to leave me alone. I'm shaking uncontrollably. I want to run, but there's nowhere to go. The air feels thick, and it's hard to breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: Suddenly, my father grabs a lamp from my bedside table. He's screaming incoherently now. I can smell alcohol on his breath. In a split second, he hurls the lamp across the room. It shatters against the wall, missing my mother by inches. The sound is deafening, and I flinch. Shards of ceramic and glass are everywhere.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: My mother lets out a strangled sob. She's pressed against the wall, her eyes wide with fear. I want to help her, but I'm paralyzed. My father is breathing heavily, his fists clenched. He turns to me, and I see a flicker of... something in his eyes. Regret? Shame? But it's quickly replaced by more anger. He storms out of the room, slamming the door so hard the walls shake.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm overwhelmed. My heart is pounding, and I feel nauseous. It's like I'm right back there, reliving it all over again. I can still hear the crash of the lamp, see the fear in my mother's eyes. I feel so helpless and angry. Why didn't I do something? Why couldn't I protect her?",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I know, but it feels so real. After my father left, my mother just... crumpled. She slid down the wall and started sobbing quietly. I wanted to comfort her, but I was too scared to move. I just sat there, staring at the broken lamp, listening to her cry. The room felt so cold and empty. I remember thinking, \"This is my fault. If I were better, this wouldn't happen.\"",
    "Therapist: Remember, you weren't responsible. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Right... After what felt like hours, my mother finally got up. She came over to me, her face streaked with tears. She hugged me tightly and whispered, \"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.\" I couldn't speak. I just held onto her, feeling her body shake with silent sobs. The room was a mess - broken glass everywhere, the lampshade torn. It was like the physical manifestation of our broken family.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. Reliving this is exhausting. But there's also a part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe relieved? Like I'm finally acknowledging how bad it really was. For so long, I tried to pretend it wasn't that bad, that other families had it worse. But this... this was not okay.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. Can you describe what happened next?",
    "Client: After a while, my mother started cleaning up the mess. I wanted to help, but I was still frozen. She kept apologizing as she picked up the broken pieces. I remember thinking how unfair it was that she was apologizing when she didn't do anything wrong. Eventually, I found the strength to move. I helped her clean up in silence. We never talked about it afterwards. The next day, it was like nothing had happened. But something had changed inside me. I felt... older, somehow. Like a part of my childhood had been shattered along with that lamp.",
    "Therapist: You've done an excellent job. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... a mix of things. There's sadness, of course, and anger. But there's also a strange sense of... I don't know, maybe strength? Like by facing this memory, I'm taking some of its power away. It's still painful, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming as it used to. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: That's a common and positive response. Would you like to continue?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. After we cleaned up, I remember lying in bed, unable to sleep. Every little sound made me jump. I kept replaying the scene in my mind, thinking of all the things I could have or should have done differently. I felt so guilty for not protecting my mother, even though logically I know there wasn't much a child could do. I think that's when I started developing my anxiety. From that night on, I was always on edge, always waiting for the next explosion.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage. How does revisiting this affect you now?",
    "Client: It's... intense. But also, in a way, liberating? For so long, I've carried this memory like a heavy secret. Talking about it, really delving into the details, it's like I'm finally unpacking this burden I've been carrying. I can see now how much it's affected me - my relationships, my anxiety, my self-worth. But I also feel a glimmer of hope. Like maybe by confronting this, I can start to heal some of those old wounds.",
    "Therapist: That's a very insightful observation. Let's pause here for today.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you. This was hard, but... I think it was important. I feel drained, but also somewhat lighter. Is that strange?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a common response. How would you like to end our session?",
    "Client: I think I need a moment to just... breathe. To remind myself that I'm here, in the present, and that I'm safe now. Maybe we could do a quick grounding exercise?",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent idea. Let's do that."
