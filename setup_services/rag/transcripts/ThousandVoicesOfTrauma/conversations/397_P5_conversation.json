    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been thinking about it all week, and I'm not sure I'm ready for this.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... the idea of reliving that moment when I saw the violence happen... it's terrifying. I've spent so long trying to push it out of my mind, and now you're asking me to bring it all back. I'm worried I might fall apart or have a panic attack.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How can I help?",
    "Client: I don't know... maybe explain why we need to do this? I mean, I trust you, but I'm struggling to see how this could be helpful when it feels like it might make things worse.",
    "Therapist: Certainly. Imaginal exposure helps process trauma memories. It can reduce PTSD symptoms over time.",
    "Client: I understand that in theory, but... it's so hard to imagine that reliving it could actually help. Won't it just make me more anxious? I've been having nightmares about it already, and those certainly don't seem to be helping.",
    "Therapist: Nightmares are different. This is controlled, supported exposure. We'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: Okay... I appreciate that. Can you tell me more about what to expect during the session? What exactly will I need to do?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the event in present tense. I'll guide you through it, offering support throughout.",
    "Client: That sounds intense. Will I have to describe everything in detail? There are parts that are still so vivid, and others that are a blur. I'm worried I might get overwhelmed or stuck.",
    "Therapist: Share what you remember. It's okay if some parts are unclear. We can pause anytime.",
    "Client: Alright, that's somewhat reassuring. I'm still nervous, but I think I can try. How long will this process take? And what happens if I can't get through it all in one session?",
    "Therapist: Sessions typically last 30-45 minutes. We can continue next time if needed. Your comfort is priority.",
    "Client: Okay, I think I'm starting to understand better now. I appreciate your patience with all my questions. I guess I'm just scared of facing these memories head-on, but I also want to get better. It's been affecting my relationship with my husband and kids, and I'm tired of feeling this way.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. This is a big step towards healing.",
    "Client: Thank you, that means a lot. I'm still nervous, but I think I'm ready to give it a try. Can you just... stay close by during the process? Knowing you're there to guide me through it helps.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'll be right here, supporting you every step of the way.",
    "Client: Okay, thank you. I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Let's do this."
