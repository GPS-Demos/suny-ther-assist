    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling about our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: Ay, doctor... I'm... I'm not sure. My hands are a little shaky. It's been so long since I've talked about this, you know? Part of me wants to just forget it all happened.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: S\u00ed, okay. I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: Good. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: (deep breath) I'm... I'm in the village. It's hot, so hot. The sun is beating down, and I can smell the dust in the air. I'm walking down the main street, carrying a basket of fruit I just bought from the market.",
    "Therapist: Good. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: There's... there's a tension in the air. People are moving quickly, not stopping to chat like they usually do. I can hear children playing in the distance, but it feels... wrong somehow.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed do you feel right now?",
    "Client: Maybe... 40? I'm nervous, but I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: Suddenly, I hear a loud explosion. The ground shakes beneath my feet, and I drop my basket. Mangoes roll everywhere. People start screaming and running. I... I don't know what to do. My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. I keep thinking, \"This can't be happening. Not here. Not to us.\" I see smoke rising from the other end of the village. Oh Dios m\u00edo, it's coming from near the school!",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's higher. Maybe 60 or 65?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Maria. Take a deep breath. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I start running towards the school. My niece, she's there. I have to find her. The streets are chaos. People are pushing past me, running the other way. I can hear more explosions in the distance.",
    "Therapist: What do you see around you?",
    "Client: There's... there's debris everywhere. A building nearby is on fire. I see a man lying on the ground, not moving. I want to help him, but I can't stop. I have to get to the school.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. It's hard to breathe. My legs feel heavy, but I keep pushing forward. I'm... I'm so scared.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Maria. Remember, this is a memory. Take another deep breath.",
    "Client: (inhales shakily) Okay... okay. I reach the school, and it's... it's terrible. Part of the building has collapsed. There are children crying, teachers trying to organize everyone. I'm calling out for my niece, but I can't see her.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. Maybe 80?",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Maria. Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: I start helping to move rubble, searching for trapped children. My hands are bleeding, but I don't care. I just keep digging. Then... then I hear a small voice. It's my niece! She's trapped under a fallen beam.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel in that moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm relieved, but also terrified. What if I can't get her out? What if she's hurt? I call for help, and a few men come over. We start trying to lift the beam.",
    "Therapist: Focus on your senses. What do you hear, smell?",
    "Client: I hear... I hear my niece whimpering. The men grunting as we try to lift the beam. In the distance, there's still chaos - more explosions, screaming. The air smells like smoke and... and blood.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens as you try to free your niece?",
    "Client: We're struggling with the beam. It's so heavy. My arms are shaking, but I can't give up. Finally, we manage to lift it enough. Someone pulls my niece out. She's covered in dust, crying, but she seems okay. I hug her so tight.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm overwhelmed. Relieved, scared, angry... it's all mixed up. My heart is still pounding.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 75?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Take a moment. What happens after you find your niece?",
    "Client: I... I pick her up and start running. We need to get out of the village. As we're leaving, I see soldiers entering. They're shouting, pointing guns. I hide behind a wall, covering my niece's mouth so she doesn't make a sound.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in that moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified they'll find us. I keep thinking, \"Please, God, don't let them see us. Don't let them hurt my niece.\" I can feel her trembling against me.",
    "Therapist: How's your body reacting?",
    "Client: My whole body is tense. I'm trying not to shake. I can feel my heart pounding so hard, I'm afraid they'll hear it.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now, Maria. This is just a memory. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (inhales deeply) Yes... yes, I know. It just feels so real.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: We... we wait for what feels like hours. Finally, when it seems quieter, we make a run for it. We head into the jungle, away from the village. I can still hear gunfire in the distance. My niece is crying softly, and I'm trying to comfort her while we run.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind as you're running?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"We have to survive. We have to get help.\" But I also feel... guilty. There were so many others I couldn't help. What about their families? What about my neighbors?",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe 65?",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Maria. Keep going.",
    "Client: We... we walk for hours. My niece gets tired, so I carry her. My arms and legs are aching, but I can't stop. Finally, we reach another village. People there help us, give us water and food. That's when I break down. I just start sobbing.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are you feeling in that moment?",
    "Client: Relief... exhaustion... grief. I'm so grateful we're alive, but I can't stop thinking about everyone we left behind. The village... our home... it's all gone.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. How do you feel now, remembering all this?",
    "Client: It's... it's still painful. But... I feel stronger too. We survived. My niece is safe because of what I did.",
    "Therapist: That's right, Maria. You showed incredible strength and courage. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's lower. Maybe... 50?",
    "Therapist: That's good. You've done excellent work today. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Take a few deep breaths.",
    "Client: (breathes deeply) Okay... I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Slowly open your eyes when you're ready. How do you feel?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also... lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after these sessions. You've shown great courage today, Maria.",
    "Client: Gracias, doctor. It wasn't easy, but... I think it helps to talk about it.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. We'll end our session here. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you for your help.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Maria. I'll see you next week."
