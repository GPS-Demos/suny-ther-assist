    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the animal attack you witnessed?",
    "Client: Okay... I was at the beach with my family. It was a beautiful day, the sun was shining, and the water was crystal clear. We were having a picnic when suddenly we heard screams coming from the water. I looked up and saw a man thrashing in the waves. At first, I thought he was just playing around, but then I saw the fin. It was a shark attack.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you saw.",
    "Client: The water around him started turning red. People were yelling and running out of the ocean. I felt frozen, unable to move. My husband grabbed our kids and pulled them away from the water's edge. I just stood there, watching in horror as the shark attacked the man again and again. I could hear his screams... they were so loud and full of pain. I wanted to help, but I was paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I can still see the man's face. He was looking right at me, pleading for help. But there was nothing I could do. The lifeguards were trying to reach him, but it was too late. The shark dragged him under, and he didn't come back up. The beach was chaos - people crying, children screaming, everyone running away. But I couldn't move. I just stood there, staring at the spot where he disappeared.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What were you feeling?",
    "Client: I felt... guilty. Helpless. Terrified. My heart was pounding so hard I thought it might burst out of my chest. I couldn't breathe properly. I kept thinking, \"What if that was one of my children?\" The fear was overwhelming. I felt like I was going to pass out.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: After what felt like an eternity, my husband came back and shook me out of my trance. He was yelling at me to help him with the kids, but I couldn't hear him properly. Everything sounded muffled, like I was underwater. I remember looking down at my hands and they were shaking uncontrollably. I felt sick to my stomach. We gathered our things and left the beach, but I couldn't stop looking back at the water. It was so calm now, as if nothing had happened. But I knew that man was still out there, somewhere beneath the surface.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. How do you feel now, recalling this?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. My heart is racing again, and I feel that same nausea. I can smell the salt in the air, hear the seagulls crying overhead. It's like I'm right back there on that beach. I keep seeing the man's face, hearing his screams. I feel so guilty for not doing anything to help him. I know logically there was nothing I could have done, but emotionally... I feel like a coward.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I haven't been able to go to the beach since then. Just the thought of it makes me panic. I have nightmares about being in the water and feeling something brush against my leg. I wake up in a cold sweat, convinced I'm about to be attacked. It's affecting my whole family - we used to love going to the beach together, and now we can't. I feel like I've let them down, like I've let that poor man down. I can't shake the feeling that I should have done something, anything, to try and save him.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage facing this memory.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's... it's not easy. Sometimes I feel like I'll never be able to enjoy the ocean again. I used to love swimming, but now the thought of it terrifies me. I keep replaying that day over and over in my mind, wondering if there was something I could have done differently. Maybe if I had yelled a warning sooner, or if I had tried to distract the shark somehow... I know it's irrational, but I can't help thinking about it. The guilt is overwhelming sometimes.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're processing the trauma.",
    "Client: I suppose so. It's just... it's hard to accept that something so terrible can happen so quickly, out of nowhere. One moment everything was perfect, and the next... It makes me feel like nowhere is safe. I worry constantly about my family now, always imagining worst-case scenarios. I know it's not healthy, but I can't seem to stop. That day changed everything for me. I feel like a different person now, always on edge, always waiting for the next disaster to strike.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also a little lighter. Talking about it is hard, but I think it helps. The memory doesn't feel quite as overwhelming as it did before. I still feel the fear and the guilt, but maybe not as intensely. It's like... like I'm starting to see it from a slight distance, if that makes sense. I'm not right there on the beach anymore, I'm here in this room, safe. It's still painful, but maybe... maybe I can learn to live with it.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It's still difficult, and I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time since it happened, I feel a tiny glimmer of hope. Maybe someday I'll be able to go back to the beach, to enjoy the ocean again. I'm not there yet, not even close, but I can see the possibility now. And that... that means a lot to me.",
    "Therapist: You've done very well today. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... tired, but also relieved in a way. It's like I've been carrying this heavy weight around, and now I've set it down for a moment. I know I'll have to pick it up again, but just having this brief respite feels good. I'm surprised at how much I was able to say, how clearly I could remember everything. It's still painful, but talking about it... it makes it feel more manageable somehow. Less like this huge, overwhelming thing and more like something I might eventually be able to cope with. I'm grateful for this session, even though it was hard.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive outlook. Shall we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. I feel like I've confronted a lot today, and I need some time to process it all. Thank you for guiding me through this. It wasn't easy, but I feel like I've taken a small step forward. I'm nervous about our next session, but also... kind of looking forward to it? Is that strange?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a sign of progress. Take care, and we'll continue next time."
