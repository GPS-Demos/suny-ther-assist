    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the hostage situation at the hospital?",
    "Client: Okay... I was working a night shift at the hospital. It was around 2 AM, and I was just finishing up some paperwork at the nurse's station. Suddenly, I heard shouting coming from the ER. At first, I thought it was just another rowdy patient, but then I heard a loud bang. My heart started racing immediately.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I froze for a moment, not sure what to do. Then I saw him - a man with a gun, waving it around wildly. He was screaming about wanting drugs. I ducked behind the desk, my hands shaking uncontrollably. I could hear other nurses and patients crying and screaming. The smell of antiseptic seemed overwhelming all of a sudden.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that memory. What happened next?",
    "Client: He... he saw me. The gunman. He pointed the gun right at me and told me to stand up. I felt like I couldn't breathe. My legs were so weak, I wasn't sure I could even stand. But I did. I stood up, holding my hands in the air. He grabbed me by the arm, his grip so tight it hurt. He dragged me towards the pharmacy, using me as a shield.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: I can still feel his grip on my arm. He was sweating, I could smell it. His eyes were wild, dilated. He kept the gun pressed against my temple as we walked. I thought I was going to die. I kept thinking about my parents, how they'd react if I didn't come home. The hallway seemed so long, like it was stretching out forever.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: When we got to the pharmacy, he demanded that I open it. My hands were shaking so badly, I could barely use the keycard. He kept screaming at me to hurry up. I finally got the door open, and he shoved me inside. The pharmacist was there, looking terrified. The gunman started shouting at her to give him oxycodone and other painkillers.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job describing this. How were you feeling?",
    "Client: I was terrified. My heart was pounding so hard I thought it might burst out of my chest. I couldn't stop trembling. I kept thinking about all the patients on the floor, hoping they were okay. I felt so helpless, like I had failed them somehow by not being able to protect them.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: The pharmacist was trying to reason with him, telling him we needed to check the system for his prescription. He got angrier, waving the gun around. I thought he was going to shoot her. I closed my eyes, waiting for the bang. But then I heard sirens. The police had arrived. The gunman panicked. He grabbed me again, using me as a hostage to try to escape.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Keep going.",
    "Client: He dragged me back through the hallways. My feet kept stumbling, and he'd jerk me roughly to keep me upright. We could hear the police shouting, telling him to surrender. When we got to the ER entrance, there were police everywhere. Guns pointed at us. I've never been so scared in my life. I thought I was going to die right there, either shot by the gunman or accidentally by the police.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you survived this. You're here now, safe.",
    "Client: The negotiator started talking to the gunman. It felt like hours, standing there, the gun pressed against my head. My legs were shaking so badly, I wasn't sure how I was still standing. I kept thinking about my patients, my family, all the things I'd never get to do. Then, suddenly, I heard a loud pop and felt something warm spray across my face. The gunman's grip loosened, and I fell to the ground. They had shot him. It was over.",
    "Therapist: You've done an amazing job recounting this. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Shaky. It's like I'm right back there again. My heart is racing, and I can almost smell the gunpowder and antiseptic. But... I also feel a little relieved. Like talking about it has lifted some weight off me.",
    "Therapist: That's completely normal. You've shown incredible strength today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to believe I survived that. Sometimes I wonder why I was the one he chose as a hostage. What if I had done something differently? Maybe I could have prevented it somehow.",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. You did the best you could in a terrifying situation.",
    "Client: I know that logically, but emotionally... it's harder to accept. I still have nightmares about it. Sometimes I wake up feeling that gun against my head. And going back to work at the hospital... it's been so difficult. Every loud noise makes me jump. I feel on edge all the time.",
    "Therapist: Your reactions are understandable. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: I hope so. I want to feel normal again. I want to be able to do my job without constantly looking over my shoulder or flinching at every sudden movement. I miss feeling safe.",
    "Therapist: You've taken an important step today. We'll continue to work on this.",
    "Client: Thank you. It helps to talk about it, even though it's hard. I just want to move past this and not let it control my life anymore. Do you think that's possible?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You've shown remarkable resilience already.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's been a long journey, and I know I have a way to go still. But being able to talk about it like this... it gives me hope that I can overcome this trauma. Thank you for listening and guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. You should be proud of your progress today."
