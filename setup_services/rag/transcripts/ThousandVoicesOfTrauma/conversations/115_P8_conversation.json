    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not really sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart's still racing, and I feel... I don't know, kind of numb but also on edge, if that makes sense?",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about what you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Well, physically, I'm sweating a bit. My hands are clammy, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's like I can't quite catch my breath. In my mind, it's... it's chaotic. I keep seeing flashes of that day, the explosions, the dust, the... the bodies. It's like I'm there again, you know? And then I remember where I am, and I feel guilty for being safe when so many others weren't.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind as you reflect on this?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking about how unfair it all is. Why did I survive when others didn't? I should have done more, should have been faster, should have... I don't know. And then I feel angry. Angry at the people who put us in that situation, angry at myself for not being able to let it go. And beneath all that, there's this... this deep sadness. For the lives lost, for the person I used to be before all this.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when you first started therapy?",
    "Client: It's... it's different now. Before, I couldn't even talk about it without having a full-blown panic attack. Now, it's still intense, but... I can sit with it a bit more, if that makes sense? It's like, I'm starting to see that these memories don't have to control me completely. But it's still hard, you know? Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever really be okay.",
    "Therapist: What do you mean by \"okay\"?",
    "Client: I guess... being able to live without this constant weight on my chest. To be able to sleep through the night without nightmares. To not flinch at loud noises or feel like I need to be on guard all the time. To be able to connect with people again, without this... this wall between us. I want to feel joy again, real joy, not just moments of relief when the anxiety eases up.",
    "Therapist: How do you think today's session has contributed to that goal?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard to say. Part of me feels worse, you know? Like I've opened up this wound again. But another part... I don't know, maybe there's a bit of relief in finally talking about it? Like, maybe if I can face it here, in this room with you, then maybe I can start to face it out there in the world too. It's terrifying, but also... maybe a little hopeful? I'm not sure if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: It makes perfect sense. What's giving you that sense of hope?",
    "Client: I think... it's the fact that I'm still here, still trying. That even though it hurts like hell to remember, I'm doing it anyway. And each time, it gets a tiny bit easier to talk about. Don't get me wrong, it's still awful. But I'm starting to see that maybe, just maybe, I'm stronger than I thought. And maybe, if I keep at this, I might actually get to a place where the memories don't have so much power over me.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it feel to acknowledge your strength?",
    "Client: It's... strange. Good, but strange. For so long, I've felt weak, you know? Like I was failing because I couldn't just \"get over it.\" But now, I'm starting to see that maybe it takes strength to face this stuff head-on. It's not easy, and there are days when I want to give up. But I'm still here, still fighting. And that... that has to count for something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What else are you noticing about yourself right now?",
    "Client: I'm noticing that... well, my breathing has slowed down a bit. The tightness in my chest isn't as bad. I'm still anxious, but it's not as overwhelming as it was a few minutes ago. And I'm... I'm actually able to look at you while we're talking. Before, I would have been staring at the floor, trying to disappear. So that's... that's something, I guess.",
    "Therapist: How do you make sense of these changes?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe it's that I'm learning to trust the process a bit more? Or maybe it's that I'm starting to trust myself more? It's like, each time we do this, I prove to myself that I can face these memories and survive. It's still scary as hell, but... I don't know, maybe I'm building some kind of resilience? It's hard to explain.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. What else comes to mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about my wife. She... she always believed in me, even when I couldn't believe in myself. And now that she's gone, it's like... I don't know, maybe I'm trying to see myself through her eyes? She always said I was stronger than I knew. Maybe she was right. And maybe, by doing this work, I'm honoring her memory somehow. God, I miss her so much. But I think... I think she'd be proud of me for trying to get better.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to connect this work to your wife's memory?",
    "Client: It's... it's bittersweet. There's a deep sadness, of course. I wish she was here to see this progress, to help me through it. But there's also this... warmth, I guess? Like, even though she's gone, her belief in me is still helping me move forward. It's giving me strength when I feel like I can't go on. And that... that means everything to me.",
    "Therapist: That's beautiful. What do you want to remember from today's session?",
    "Client: I want to remember that I'm capable of facing these memories, even when it feels impossible. That each time I do this, I'm proving to myself that I'm stronger than my trauma. And I want to remember that feeling of hope - that tiny glimmer that says maybe, just maybe, things can get better. It's not much, but it's something to hold onto when things get dark.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful takeaway. How are you feeling as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. Emotionally drained. But there's also this weird sense of... I don't know, accomplishment? Like I've climbed a mountain or something. I'm still anxious, still sad, but it doesn't feel as crushing as it did at the start. And I'm... I'm actually looking forward to our next session. Is that crazy?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It shows your commitment to healing. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I guess. For listening, for pushing me when I need it, for... for helping me see that maybe there's a way through this after all. I know we've got a long way to go, but... I'm starting to believe that maybe, just maybe, I can do this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. I'm proud of the work you've done today. Take care of yourself this week, and I'll see you next time.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'll try. See you next week."
