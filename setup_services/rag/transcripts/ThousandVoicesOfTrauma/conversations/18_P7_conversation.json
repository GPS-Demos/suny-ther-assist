    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the scene?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in Afghanistan. It's hot, dusty. I can feel sweat trickling down my back. We're on patrol in a small village. The streets are narrow, buildings close together. It's quiet... too quiet.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Continue.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's shouting. A woman runs out of a nearby house, screaming. Her face is bruised, and she's crying. Behind her, a man appears in the doorway. He's yelling at her in their language. I can't understand the words, but his tone... it's so angry, so threatening.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you feel?",
    "Client: I feel... helpless. Angry. My heart's racing. I want to intervene, but we're not supposed to get involved in domestic disputes. It's not our mission. But seeing her face, the terror in her eyes... it reminds me of...",
    "Therapist: It's okay. You're safe here.",
    "Client: It reminds me of my childhood. Watching my father... I can't... I can't do this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Okay. The woman is looking at us, pleading with her eyes. The man grabs her arm, roughly pulling her back inside. I can hear her sobbing. My hands are shaking on my rifle. I look at my squad leader, silently asking what to do.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel right now?",
    "Client: Tense. My jaw is clenched. My stomach feels like it's in knots. I'm breathing fast, like I can't get enough air.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Keep going.",
    "Client: My squad leader shakes his head. We can't interfere. We continue our patrol, but I can't stop thinking about that woman. What's happening to her now? Why couldn't we help? I feel... I feel like a coward.",
    "Therapist: You're not a coward. You're very brave for sharing this.",
    "Client: But I should have done something! I... I know what it's like to be that scared, to feel that helpless. And I just walked away. How can I live with that?",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. What happened next?",
    "Client: We finished our patrol. I couldn't focus. Every sound made me jump. When we got back to base, I couldn't sleep. I kept seeing her face, hearing her cries. I... I started having nightmares after that. Not just about the war, but about my childhood too. It all got mixed up in my head.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Drained. Guilty. But... also a little relieved? Like maybe talking about it is helping, even though it hurts.",
    "Therapist: That's good. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I've never told anyone about this before. Not even my partner. I've always been afraid of seeming weak or... or not living up to what people expect of me as a soldier.",
    "Therapist: Sharing takes strength. You're very courageous.",
    "Client: It doesn't feel that way. I feel like I've been running from this for so long. But maybe... maybe it's time to face it. I'm tired of the nightmares, the guilt, the constant feeling of being on edge.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... lighter? Like I've put down a heavy backpack I've been carrying for years. It's still there, but I'm not holding it all by myself anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent metaphor. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. This was... intense. But thank you. I think I needed this, even if it was hard.",
    "Therapist: You did very well. We'll continue next session.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you again. I... I'm glad I finally talked about this. It's scary, but I think it might be the right path forward.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. Take care until next time."
