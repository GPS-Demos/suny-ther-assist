    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling about our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to do this, but another part is terrified. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably around 60? My hands are a bit shaky.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we can pause anytime. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm walking down the street. It's a warm day, the sun is beating down. I can hear cars passing by, people chatting. I'm on my way to meet a friend for coffee. Everything seems normal, but then...",
    "Therapist: Go on. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear shouting. Angry voices. I turn the corner and I see... I see a group of police officers. They're surrounding someone. A young man. He's on the ground and they're... they're hitting him. Oh God...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it, Maria. What are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. My heart is racing. I can't believe what I'm seeing. It's so violent. The young man is crying out for help, but no one's doing anything. I... I want to help him, but I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 80. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a deep breath. What do you notice around you?",
    "Client: I hear more sirens. More police are arriving. People are starting to gather, some are filming with their phones. The air feels thick, tense. I can smell exhaust from the cars, hear the crackle of police radios.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: One of the officers notices me watching. He... he looks right at me. His eyes are cold, angry. I feel like he's daring me to say something. I want to scream, to tell them to stop, but... but I can't. I'm remembering my own childhood, how no one ever stood up for me when...",
    "Therapist: Stay in the present moment, Maria. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I turn away. I start walking faster, almost running. I can still hear the young man's cries behind me. I feel sick, ashamed. Why didn't I do something? Why am I always so powerless?",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe now. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's at 90. I can barely breathe.",
    "Therapist: Let's take a moment. Focus on your breath. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... okay. I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: I... I keep walking. I'm shaking all over. I make it to the coffee shop, but I can't go in. I just stand there, staring at my reflection in the window. I look pale, scared. I feel like everyone can see my shame.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about how I've always been a coward. How I never stood up to my parents when they neglected me, how I never fight back. And now, I've let down that young man too. I'm worthless.",
    "Therapist: Remember, these are just thoughts. They're not facts. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I see my friend arriving. She looks worried when she sees me. She asks what's wrong, but I can't speak. I just start crying. She hugs me, and I feel... I feel safe for a moment, but also so, so guilty.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 85?",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Maria. Keep going.",
    "Client: We go into the coffee shop. I can't stop shaking. My friend orders for me, but I can't drink anything. I keep seeing that officer's eyes, hearing the young man's cries. I feel like I'm going to be sick.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you experiencing?",
    "Client: My stomach is in knots. My hands are clammy. I feel hot and cold at the same time. It's like... like I'm not really there. Like I'm watching myself from outside my body.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I finally tell my friend what happened. She's horrified. She wants to go back, to see if we can help. But I... I can't. I'm too scared. I feel like such a coward. We end up leaving the coffee shop. I just want to go home, to hide.",
    "Therapist: And how do you feel as you're heading home?",
    "Client: I feel... numb. Disconnected. But also, there's this rage building inside me. At the police, at myself, at the world. Why is everything so unfair? Why am I always so helpless?",
    "Therapist: Those are powerful emotions. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 75 now. I'm feeling drained.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Maria. Let's continue.",
    "Client: I get home and... and I just collapse on the couch. I can't stop replaying everything in my mind. I keep thinking about what I could have done differently. Should I have yelled? Should I have filmed it? Should I have... I don't know, thrown myself in front of the officers?",
    "Therapist: Remember, hindsight is 20/20. What else are you experiencing?",
    "Client: I... I start searching online. Looking for news about what happened. But there's nothing. It's like it never happened at all. And that makes me feel even worse. Like, does anyone care? Does it even matter?",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Angry. So, so angry. But also... helpless. Like nothing I do will ever make a difference. I think about my childhood, how no one ever helped me. And now, I've become just like them. Someone who stands by and does nothing.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's back up to 85. I feel so ashamed.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Maria. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens as the day goes on?",
    "Client: I... I can't eat. Can't sleep. I keep checking my phone, hoping to see some news about what happened. But there's nothing. My husband comes home and asks what's wrong, but I can't tell him. I feel so alone.",
    "Therapist: What do you do to cope with these feelings?",
    "Client: I... I take a long, hot shower. I scrub my skin until it's red, like I'm trying to wash away the guilt. But it doesn't help. I end up curled up in bed, crying. I feel so useless, so weak.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 70. I'm feeling exhausted.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Maria. Let's continue a bit more.",
    "Client: The next day, I... I can't bring myself to leave the house. I call in sick to work. I keep replaying everything in my mind. I start wondering if I imagined it all. Maybe it wasn't as bad as I thought? But no, I can still hear those cries, see that officer's cold eyes.",
    "Therapist: What do you do throughout the day?",
    "Client: I... I spend hours online, searching for any information. I join some local community groups, looking for anyone else who might have seen something. But there's nothing. It's like it never happened. And that makes me feel even crazier.",
    "Therapist: How does that affect you?",
    "Client: It... it makes me doubt myself. Makes me feel even more isolated. But also, it makes me angry. Like, how many times does this happen and just get swept under the rug? How many people are suffering in silence?",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 60. I'm feeling more... I don't know, determined maybe?",
    "Therapist: That's progress. How does the memory end for you?",
    "Client: I... I decide to write everything down. Every detail I can remember. It feels important, even if I'm the only one who ever sees it. And I make a promise to myself. That next time, I won't be silent. I'll do something, anything. Even if I'm scared.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful resolution. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. But also, maybe a little bit stronger? Like I've faced something I've been running from.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well, Maria. What's your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 50 now. I'm exhausted, but I feel like I've accomplished something.",
    "Therapist: You absolutely have. Let's take a few deep breaths together to close out the session.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Thank you. This was hard, but... I think it was important.",
    "Therapist: It was. You showed great courage today, Maria. We'll pick this up in our next session."
