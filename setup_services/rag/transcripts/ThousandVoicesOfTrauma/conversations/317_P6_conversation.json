    "Therapist: Alright, let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Can you describe the cyberbullying incident and give me your initial SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Okay, um... I remember sitting in my dorm room, scrolling through social media. Suddenly, I saw this post about me. It was... it was awful. They were calling me names, saying I was worthless, that no one liked me. I felt my stomach drop, and my hands started shaking. I... I couldn't breathe. It felt like the walls were closing in on me. I'd say my SUDS is about an 8 right now, just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. Let's continue. What happened next?",
    "Client: I... I couldn't look away from the screen. More comments kept popping up, each one worse than the last. People I thought were my friends were joining in, laughing at me. I felt so alone, so exposed. It was like everyone could see all my insecurities, all my flaws. I wanted to disappear, to just... not exist anymore.",
    "Therapist: I see. How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's probably a 9. My heart is racing, and I feel nauseous. It's like I'm right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I remember closing my laptop and curling up on my bed. I was crying so hard I could barely breathe. I felt so helpless, so powerless. I kept thinking about what I did wrong, why they hated me so much. I couldn't sleep that night, or the next. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw those comments, those hateful words.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. SUDS check?",
    "Client: It's... it's still a 9. My hands are shaking, and I feel dizzy. It's like I can hear their laughter, their cruel words echoing in my head.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when ready.",
    "Client: I... I stopped going to classes. I was too afraid to face anyone. I thought everyone was talking about me, judging me. I lost weight because I couldn't eat. I couldn't focus on anything. It felt like my whole world had shattered, and I didn't know how to put it back together.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. My breathing is a little easier, but I still feel this heavy weight on my chest. It's like... like I'm carrying all that pain and shame with me, even now.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I finally told my roommate what was happening. He was shocked and angry on my behalf. He helped me report it to the university, and they took action. The posts were taken down, and some of the main instigators were disciplined. But... but the damage was already done. I felt like I could never trust anyone again, never feel safe online or in person.",
    "Therapist: I understand. SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 7. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved? Talking about it... it's hard, but it's like I'm letting some of that pain out.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're making progress. How did things change after that?",
    "Client: Slowly... very slowly. I started seeing a counselor on campus. I learned to be more careful online, but also to value myself more. I made new friends who were supportive and kind. But... but I still struggle sometimes. I still have moments where I doubt myself, where I feel that old fear creeping back in.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Final SUDS check?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 6 now. I feel exhausted, but also... lighter somehow. Like I've set down a heavy burden, even if just for a moment.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well. Let's take a moment to breathe and ground ourselves."
