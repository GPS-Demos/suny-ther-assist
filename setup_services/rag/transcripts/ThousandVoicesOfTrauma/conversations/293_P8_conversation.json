    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken up, to be honest. My heart's still racing, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's like I'm right back there, you know? Watching that poor dog being attacked by that larger animal. I can still hear the yelps, the growling... It's all so vivid.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. I wanted to do something, anything to stop it, but I was frozen. I... I feel guilty, like I should have done more. And then I think about how that violence just came out of nowhere. It makes me feel like the world is unpredictable and dangerous. Like at any moment, something terrible could happen.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does that belief impact you?",
    "Client: It makes me constantly on edge. I'm always looking over my shoulder, expecting the worst. I've been avoiding parks and open spaces where I used to love spending time. It's affecting my sleep too. I keep having nightmares about being attacked myself. It's exhausting, living like this.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing in your body?",
    "Client: My muscles are so tense, especially in my shoulders and jaw. I realize I'm clenching my fists too. There's this knot in my stomach that won't go away. And I feel... cold? Even though it's not really cold in here. It's like I'm reliving that fear all over again.",
    "Therapist: How does sharing this make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. Part of me wants to just forget it ever happened, to push it all away. But another part of me feels a bit relieved to finally talk about it. I've been holding this in for so long, trying to act like everything's fine. But it's not fine. I'm not fine.",
    "Therapist: What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Maybe just to feel safe again? To believe that the world isn't always out to get me? I want to be able to go for a walk without constantly looking over my shoulder. I want to sleep through the night without waking up in a cold sweat. I just want to feel normal again.",
    "Therapist: How does that desire for normalcy sit with you?",
    "Client: It's frustrating. I feel angry that this happened to me, that I can't just snap out of it. But there's also a glimmer of hope. Being here, talking about it... it makes me think that maybe, just maybe, I can work through this. That I don't have to be stuck in this fear forever.",
    "Therapist: What's giving you that hope?",
    "Client: I guess... the fact that I made it through the exposure exercise. It was tough, really tough, but I did it. And even though I'm shaken up, I'm still here. I'm still talking. Maybe that means I'm stronger than I thought. And maybe, if I keep working at it, I can reclaim the parts of my life that this fear has taken away.",
    "Therapist: How does that strength feel?",
    "Client: It feels... surprising. And a little bit empowering. Like maybe I'm not just a victim of circumstances. I've been so focused on feeling weak and helpless, I didn't even consider that getting through each day, facing these fears, might actually be a sign of strength. It's a new perspective for me.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm noticing that as we talk, my breathing is slowing down a bit. The knot in my stomach is still there, but it's not as intense. And I'm realizing that even though I'm talking about this traumatic event, I'm safe here in this room. It's like... I can separate the memory from the present moment, even if just a little bit.",
    "Therapist: How might you use this awareness moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I can try to remind myself of this feeling when I start to panic. That even when I remember the trauma, I'm not actually in danger. It's just a memory. And maybe I can practice some of the breathing exercises we've talked about to help ground myself. It's not going to fix everything overnight, but it feels like a start.",
    "Therapist: What else comes to mind?",
    "Client: I'm thinking about how this experience has changed me. Not just in the negative ways, but... I find myself being more empathetic to others who might be struggling. I've become more aware of the suffering around me. And while that can be overwhelming sometimes, it also makes me want to find ways to help, to make a difference. Maybe that's something positive I can focus on.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea resonate with you?",
    "Client: It feels... meaningful. Like maybe I can turn this painful experience into something good. I've been so focused on what I've lost, but maybe there's something to gain too. A deeper understanding of others, a desire to contribute positively to the world around me. It doesn't erase what happened, but it gives it a purpose, you know?",
    "Therapist: What feelings come up as you consider this?",
    "Client: There's a mix of emotions. Sadness, for sure, because I'm acknowledging the pain I've been through. But also a sense of... I don't know, maybe hope? Or determination? Like I'm not just a passive victim of my circumstances, but I can actively shape how this experience affects me and others. It's scary, but also kind of exciting.",
    "Therapist: How might this shift your daily life?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I could start small. Like, instead of completely avoiding parks, I could try going for a short walk in a quiet area. Or I could look into volunteer opportunities at an animal shelter. Baby steps, you know? And each time I face my fear, even a little bit, I can remind myself that I'm reclaiming my life, bit by bit.",
    "Therapist: What support do you need for this journey?",
    "Client: I definitely need to keep coming to therapy. These sessions... they're hard, but they're helping. I think I might also need to open up to some close friends about what I'm going through. I've been isolating myself, and that's not helping. Maybe... maybe I could even look into a support group for trauma survivors. Just knowing I'm not alone in this could make a big difference.",
    "Therapist: How does this plan feel to you?",
    "Client: It feels... challenging, but possible. Like I'm standing at the bottom of a mountain, and the climb looks daunting, but I can see a path. It's not going to be easy, and I know there will be setbacks, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I have a direction. Like I'm not just stuck in this trauma, but actively working towards healing.",
    "Therapist: What's your next step?",
    "Client: I think... I want to start with that short walk in the park. Maybe this weekend. I'll bring a friend for support, and we'll just take it slow. And I'll use the grounding techniques we've practiced if I start to feel overwhelmed. It's a small step, but it feels like an important one.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel as we wrap up today?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but in a good way? Like I've done some hard but necessary work. There's still fear and anxiety, but also a glimmer of hope. And I feel grateful, honestly. For this space, for the opportunity to work through this. It's tough, but I think I'm on the right path.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for your openness today. We'll continue next week."
