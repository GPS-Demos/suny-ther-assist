    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and take us back to that day.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm at my office. It's a normal day, busy with work. Suddenly, I hear shouting and commotion outside.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: The door bursts open. Two men with masks and guns storm in. My heart starts racing. They're yelling at everyone to get down on the floor. I'm frozen, I can't move.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: One of them grabs me by the collar and drags me to the center of the room. He's screaming in my face, asking where the safe is. I can smell his breath, it's awful. My legs are shaking so badly.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I try to speak, but nothing comes out. He slaps me hard across the face. The pain is sharp, and I taste blood in my mouth. I'm so scared, I think I might pass out.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: They force me to my knees. One of them presses a gun to the back of my head. I can feel the cold metal. I'm sure I'm going to die. My whole body is trembling, and I can't stop the tears.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: Hours pass. They're getting more agitated. I hear sirens outside. The one holding me tightens his grip. I can barely breathe. Suddenly, there's a loud bang, and smoke fills the room. Everything becomes chaotic.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I feel someone grab me and pull me away. It's a police officer. I'm safe, but I can't stop shaking. The relief is overwhelming, but so is the fear. I break down sobbing.",
    "Therapist: You've done an excellent job. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. My heart is still racing, and I feel a bit nauseous. But also... I feel like I got through it. Like I survived it again.",
    "Therapist: That's completely normal. You did very well.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to talk about, but it feels a little easier each time. I just wish the fear would go away completely.",
    "Therapist: It's a process. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I guess so. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel truly safe again. Those moments of terror... they're so vivid. But being able to talk about it here, it helps.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage.",
    "Client: Thank you. It means a lot to hear that. Sometimes I feel weak for still being affected by this, but I'm trying to be kinder to myself.",
    "Therapist: That's an important step. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel drained, but also... lighter? Like I've released some of the tension I've been carrying. It's exhausting, but I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Shall we end here?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. Thank you for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm moving forward.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue next session."
