    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Rashid. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is terrified. It's been years since I've talked about this in detail.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay, yes. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm at the airport. It's bustling with people, but I feel so alone. My husband is next to me, but he seems distant. We're about to board our flight to visit our son in London.",
    "Therapist: Good. What time of day is it?",
    "Client: It's early morning. The sun is just starting to rise. I can see it through the large windows, casting an orange glow on everything.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: Anxious. My stomach is in knots. I've always hated flying, but this time feels different. There's a heaviness in the air.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you?",
    "Client: About... 60, I'd say.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: We board the plane. I'm gripping my husband's hand so tightly, but he doesn't seem to notice. He's engrossed in his book. I wish he'd comfort me, tell me everything will be okay.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I feel so alone. Like I'm the only one who senses something's wrong. The plane takes off, and for a moment, I start to relax. Maybe I was worried for nothing.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's dropped a bit. Maybe 50?",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens after takeoff?",
    "Client: We're in the air for about an hour when... (voice starts to tremble) when the plane suddenly lurches. There's a loud bang. People start screaming.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're doing well. What do you see?",
    "Client: Oxygen masks drop from the ceiling. My husband is fumbling with his, but I can't move. I'm frozen. The plane is tilting, and I can see... oh God, I can see the ocean getting closer through the window.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: (Breathing heavily) It's... it's up to 85, maybe 90.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The flight attendants are trying to keep everyone calm, but I can see the panic in their eyes. My husband finally notices me. He's saying something, but I can't hear him over the roar of the engines and the screaming.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I feel like I can't breathe. My hands are clammy, and I'm gripping the armrests so hard my knuckles are white.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're here, in my office. You're safe.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) Right. Safe. I'm safe. (Pauses) The plane is losing altitude fast. People are praying, crying. I close my eyes, thinking about my son, wondering if I'll ever see him again.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that thought. What comes up for you?",
    "Client: Regret. So much regret. For all the times I was too busy to call him, for the arguments we had. I wish I could tell him I love him one more time.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 80?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's another jolt. The plane levels out slightly. The pilot's voice comes over the intercom, saying they're attempting an emergency landing. For a moment, there's hope.",
    "Therapist: What do you feel in that moment of hope?",
    "Client: Relief, but it's mixed with dread. I don't dare believe we might survive this. I look at my husband, and for the first time, I see fear in his eyes too.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What happens next?",
    "Client: We're descending rapidly. I can see land approaching through the window. It's an island, I think. The plane is shaking violently. I close my eyes and brace for impact.",
    "Therapist: And then?",
    "Client: There's a deafening crash. I'm thrown forward, my seatbelt digging into my waist. Everything goes black for a moment. When I open my eyes, there's smoke everywhere. People are screaming, trying to get out.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level right now?",
    "Client: (Voice shaking) It's... it's at 95. I can almost smell the smoke.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a deep breath. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay. I... I unbuckle my seatbelt. My husband is unconscious next to me. I'm calling his name, shaking him, but he's not responding. I'm panicking, but I know we need to get out.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I manage to wake him up. We stumble out of our seats. The plane is broken in half. We have to climb over seats, past people who are... who didn't make it. (Starts to cry)",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel emotional. You're doing great. How high is your distress?",
    "Client: It's... it's maxed out. 100.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe with me. In... and out.",
    "Client: (Breathes with the therapist) Okay. We... we make it out of the plane. We're on a beach. There's wreckage everywhere. People are stumbling around, injured and in shock. I can't believe we survived.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: Guilt. Relief. Confusion. It's all mixed together. I'm grateful to be alive, but I feel terrible for those who didn't make it.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. What happens after you're on the beach?",
    "Client: It's chaos. Some people are trying to help the injured. Others are just sitting, staring at the wreckage. I remember thinking, \"What now?\" We're alive, but we're stranded on this island.",
    "Therapist: How does your husband react?",
    "Client: He's... he's different. For the first time, I see vulnerability in him. He holds me tight, and I can feel him shaking. We don't say anything. We just hold each other.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Conflicted. I'm glad he's there, that we're both alive. But I'm angry too. Why did it take something like this for him to show he cared?",
    "Therapist: That's a valid feeling. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's come down a bit. Maybe 75?",
    "Therapist: Good. You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: We spend hours on that beach. Rescue doesn't come until the next day. We huddle together with other survivors, sharing what little food and water we could salvage from the plane.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel during that wait?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Numb. I keep replaying the crash in my mind. Every time I close my eyes, I see the ocean getting closer, hear the screams.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response to trauma. How does your body feel?",
    "Client: Sore. Every muscle aches. I have cuts and bruises I don't even remember getting. But mostly, I feel... hollow. Like part of me was left behind in that crash.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful description. What happens when rescue arrives?",
    "Client: It's... anticlimactic, almost. A helicopter appears on the horizon. People start waving, crying. I just sit there, watching. It doesn't feel real.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel as you're being rescued?",
    "Client: Relieved, but also... scared? The idea of getting on another aircraft terrifies me. But I know it's the only way off the island.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's around 60. I'm calmer, but still shaken.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay.",
    "Therapist: Slowly open your eyes. You're here, in my office. You're safe.",
    "Client: (Opens eyes, looks around) I... I made it through. I didn't think I could talk about it like that.",
    "Therapist: You did incredibly well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. But also... lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's often how people feel after processing trauma. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's down to about 40 now.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I understand now why we needed to do this. It's still hard, but it feels less overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's the goal. We'll continue to work through this in our future sessions. For now, let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves before we end.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's start by focusing on five things you can see in this room..."
