    "Therapist: Welcome, Mark. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Thompson. I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit nervous about today's session, to be honest.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We're here to support you.",
    "Client: Thanks. I've been thinking a lot about what we discussed last time, about my experiences in school. It's been bringing up a lot of memories I've tried to forget.",
    "Therapist: You're brave for facing this. Are you ready to explore one of those memories today?",
    "Client: I think so. There's one that keeps coming back to me. It happened when I was about 10 years old, during lunch break at school.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take your time and describe it to me.",
    "Client: Well, I was sitting alone at a table in the cafeteria. I always sat alone because I was the only non-white kid in my class. I remember looking down at my lunch, some leftover curry my mom had packed for me. The smell was strong, and I felt embarrassed about it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: A group of older boys walked by. One of them stopped and wrinkled his nose. He said loudly, \"Ew, what's that smell? It stinks!\" The others laughed. I felt my face getting hot, and I wanted to disappear.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I can feel my heart racing, just like it did then. One of the boys, the tallest one, he came closer and looked in my lunchbox. He made a gagging sound and said, \"God, how can you eat that stuff? It looks like vomit!\" They all laughed again, louder this time.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. What happened next?",
    "Client: I didn't know what to do. I just sat there, frozen. I could feel tears starting to form in my eyes, but I was determined not to cry in front of them. The tall boy reached out and knocked my lunchbox off the table. The curry spilled all over the floor.",
    "Therapist: That must have been difficult. How did you feel?",
    "Client: I felt... humiliated. Angry. Scared. But mostly, I felt so alone. I looked around, hoping a teacher would come, but no one did. The boys just walked away, still laughing. I was left there with my lunch all over the floor, and this overwhelming feeling of not belonging.",
    "Therapist: You're incredibly brave for sharing this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's hard. My chest feels tight, and I can feel that same sense of shame creeping back. But... I also feel a bit relieved to finally talk about it.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're doing great.",
    "Client: After that day, I begged my mom to pack me sandwiches instead. I didn't want to eat Indian food at school anymore. I started trying to act more \"white,\" you know? I felt like I had to hide who I was to fit in.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel emotional. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I know, it's just... it's bringing back so many feelings. I remember going home that day and not telling my parents what happened. I felt like I couldn't talk to them about it because they wouldn't understand. They were so proud of our culture, and I felt like I was betraying them by being ashamed of it.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Keep going.",
    "Client: It wasn't just that one incident. It was like a constant undercurrent in my life at school. Always feeling different, always feeling like I had to prove myself. I started to hate my skin color, my name, everything that made me stand out. I wanted so badly to just blend in.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How do you feel about that now?",
    "Client: It's still painful to think about. But I also feel angry now. Angry that I had to go through that, that those boys made me feel ashamed of who I was. And I'm sad for that little boy who just wanted to belong.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are valid. You're processing this well.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to talk about, but I think it's helping. I've carried this for so long, and it's affected so much of my life. My anxiety, my relationships, even my career choices. I've always played it safe, tried not to stand out.",
    "Therapist: You're making great progress. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling drained, but also... lighter? Like I've put down a heavy weight I've been carrying. It still hurts, but it feels different now that I've shared it.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. Well done today.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Thompson. I appreciate your support through this. It's not easy, but I think it's important for me to work through these memories.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable courage. We'll continue next week.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm nervous about what else might come up, but I'm also feeling more ready to face it. Thank you again for your help.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Mark. Take care until next time."
