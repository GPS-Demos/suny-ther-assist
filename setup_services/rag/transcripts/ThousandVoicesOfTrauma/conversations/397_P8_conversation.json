    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Maria?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like my whole body is trembling on the inside. Remembering that day, seeing the violence unfold right in front of me... it's bringing back all these intense emotions. I can still hear the shouting, the sound of glass breaking. My heart is racing just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's like I'm right back there, frozen in place, unable to move or help. I feel so helpless and vulnerable. But there's also this overwhelming sadness that comes with it. I keep thinking about my brother and how he... how he didn't make it. It's like I'm losing him all over again.",
    "Therapist: How does that fear and sadness feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's heavy. Like there's this weight pressing down on my chest. My throat feels tight, and I'm having trouble swallowing. My hands are clammy, and I notice I'm clenching my jaw. It's like my body is preparing for something terrible to happen again, even though I know I'm safe here.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why didn't I do something? Why couldn't I save him?\" I know logically that there was nothing I could have done, but this guilt... it's eating me up inside. And then I start wondering, what if it happens again? What if I lose someone else I love? It's like this constant fear that's always lurking in the background.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts relate to your daily life?",
    "Client: They... they affect everything. I'm always on edge, always watching for potential danger. I struggle to relax or enjoy time with my family because I'm so worried about something bad happening. It's exhausting, really. And I feel like I'm not fully present for my kids or my husband because part of me is always stuck in that moment, reliving the trauma.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice changing as we talk about this?",
    "Client: I... I actually feel my breathing slowing down a bit. Talking about it, putting words to these feelings... it's hard, but it's also like releasing some of the pressure. The heaviness in my chest is still there, but it's not as crushing. And I'm realizing that even though I'm remembering these terrible things, I'm still here, still safe. It's... it's a strange mix of pain and... I don't know, maybe a tiny bit of relief?",
    "Therapist: How does that tiny bit of relief feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a small ray of light breaking through dark clouds. For a moment, I can see beyond the fear and guilt. I feel a glimmer of hope that maybe, just maybe, I can learn to live with this pain without it consuming me. It's not much, but it feels significant somehow.",
    "Therapist: What does that glimmer of hope mean to you?",
    "Client: It means... it means that maybe I'm stronger than I thought. That even though I've been through something horrific, I'm still here, still fighting. It makes me think of my brother and how he always believed in me. Maybe... maybe I can honor his memory by finding a way to move forward, to live the life he'd want for me. It's scary to think about, but also... I don't know, empowering in a way?",
    "Therapist: How might you carry this feeling forward?",
    "Client: I... I think I want to try and be more present with my family. To really focus on the moments we have together instead of always worrying about what might happen. And maybe... maybe I can start talking to them more about my brother, sharing happy memories instead of just the painful ones. It's going to be hard, but I want to try. For them, for my brother, and for myself.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you consider these changes?",
    "Client: There's a mix of emotions, to be honest. Part of me feels excited, like I'm finally seeing a path forward. But there's also fear. What if I can't do it? What if the memories and the pain are too strong? And there's this... this guilt, I guess. Like, do I deserve to move on and be happy when my brother can't? It's all tangled up inside me.",
    "Therapist: How might you respond to those doubts?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to remind myself that healing doesn't mean forgetting. That moving forward doesn't dishonor my brother's memory. Maybe... maybe it's actually a way of honoring him, by living the kind of life he'd want for me. And I suppose... I suppose it's okay if it's not perfect. If some days are harder than others. The important thing is that I'm trying, right?",
    "Therapist: What strength do you see in yourself right now?",
    "Client: I... I never thought of myself as strong before. But looking back at everything I've been through, the fact that I'm here, talking about it, trying to heal... that takes strength, doesn't it? I've survived something terrible, and I'm still here, still fighting. Maybe that resilience is my strength. And maybe... maybe I can build on that, use it to face the challenges ahead.",
    "Therapist: How does recognizing that strength feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's empowering. Like I'm reclaiming a part of myself that I thought I'd lost. There's still fear and pain, but underneath it all, there's this core of... I don't know, determination maybe? It feels like I'm standing a little taller, breathing a little easier. Like maybe, just maybe, I can face this and come out the other side.",
    "Therapist: What's the next step for you?",
    "Client: I think... I think I want to start small. Maybe share a happy memory of my brother with my family at dinner tonight. And then... maybe I can work on being more present, really focusing on the good moments when they happen instead of always worrying about the bad. It's going to be hard, but I want to try. I owe it to myself, and to my brother's memory, to try and live fully again.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel as we wrap up today?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've let out some of the poison that's been festering inside me. There's still a lot of work to do, and I know it won't be easy, but for the first time in a long while, I feel... hopeful. Like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this and find some peace. Thank you for guiding me through this. It means more than I can express.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible courage today, Maria. Take care."
