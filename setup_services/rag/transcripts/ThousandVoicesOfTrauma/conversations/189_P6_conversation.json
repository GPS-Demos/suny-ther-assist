    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Johnson. Today we'll be doing an imaginal exposure exercise. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so... I'm a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Let's start with your SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 right now. Just thinking about it makes me a bit anxious.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and describe the scene when you witnessed the violence.",
    "Client: (taking a deep breath) I... I was at the grocery store. It was a sunny afternoon. I remember the smell of fresh bread from the bakery section. Then suddenly, there was shouting...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: Two men arguing... their voices getting louder. One of them reaches into his jacket... Oh God, he's pulling out a gun! My heart is racing now, just like it did then.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to a 7. I can feel my palms getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The man with the gun, he... he fired. The other man fell. There was so much blood... (voice shaking) People were screaming, running. I couldn't move. I just stood there, frozen.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. It's hard to breathe. I feel like I'm right back there again.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. (starting to cry) I can't... I can't do this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing it right now. You're incredibly brave.",
    "Client: (sobbing) I keep seeing his face... the man who was shot. He looked so surprised, then... just empty.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that image. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The silence after the gunshot. It was so loud, then everything went quiet for a moment. Like time stopped.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: Still a 9... but... it's not getting worse.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're handling this well. What happened next?",
    "Client: Someone started screaming for help. I snapped out of it and called 911. My hands were shaking so badly I could barely hold the phone.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about your actions in that moment?",
    "Client: I... I guess I did what I could. But I still feel guilty. Like I should've done more somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... coming down a bit. Maybe a 7 or 8.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. Let's stay with the memory a bit longer.",
    "Client: (nodding) The police arrived. They were asking questions, but I felt so dazed. Like I was watching everything from outside my body.",
    "Therapist: How does that feeling compare to now?",
    "Client: It's... different. I'm here, but the memory feels so vivid. Like I can reach out and touch it.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6 now. I'm starting to feel a bit calmer.",
    "Therapist: You're doing excellent work. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: I think... I think I can keep going. It's hard, but I want to get through this.",
    "Therapist: I'm proud of you. Let's focus on leaving the scene.",
    "Client: (nodding) I remember walking to my car. My legs felt like jelly. The sunlight seemed too bright, almost harsh.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts were going through your mind?",
    "Client: I kept thinking, \"Is this real? Did that really happen?\" It felt like a terrible dream.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's about a 5. I'm feeling more in control.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How does it feel to have talked through this?",
    "Client: It's... relieving, in a way. Like I'm not carrying it all alone anymore.",

    "Client: Thank you. It was tough, but... I'm glad we did this.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad too. Let's end here and discuss how you're feeling."
