    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your current SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10. My heart's beating a little faster than usual.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and describe the airplane crash scene.",
    "Client: I'm boarding the plane. It's a sunny day, but I have this uneasy feeling. The cabin crew seems tense. We take off, and everything's fine for about 20 minutes. Then, suddenly, there's a loud bang. The plane starts shaking violently. People are screaming. I can smell something burning. The oxygen masks drop down. I'm fumbling with mine, my hands are shaking so much. The plane is losing altitude fast. I can see the ground coming up through the window. Oh god, we're going to crash.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to a 7. My palms are sweating, and I feel like I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: The impact is deafening. Metal screeching, glass shattering. I'm thrown forward, my seatbelt cutting into me. There's smoke everywhere. I can hear people crying, calling for help. I'm disoriented, trying to unbuckle my seatbelt. The smoke is getting thicker. I can barely see. I'm coughing, struggling to breathe. I manage to get up, but I stumble over something... someone. Oh god, I think they're not moving.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. My heart's racing. I feel like I'm back there.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep going if you can.",
    "Client: I'm crawling towards where I think the exit is. The heat is intense. I can hear the crackling of flames. I reach the emergency exit, but it's jammed. I'm pushing with all my strength, panic rising. Finally, it gives way. The rush of fresh air is overwhelming. I tumble out onto the wing. The ground is so far down. I can hear sirens in the distance. I jump, hit the ground hard. My ankle twists, but adrenaline keeps me moving. I'm stumbling away from the wreckage, coughing, gasping. I collapse on the grass, watching as the plane is engulfed in flames. The heat on my face, the screams... I can't... I can't help them.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's still a 9. I feel shaky, like I might be sick.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: I'm lying there, watching helplessly as firefighters arrive. The guilt is overwhelming. Why did I survive when others didn't? The smell of smoke and jet fuel is so strong. I can't stop shaking. Someone's putting a blanket around me, asking if I'm hurt. But all I can think about are the people still trapped inside. The roar of the fire, the wail of sirens, it's all so loud. I feel numb, disconnected, like this can't be real. But it is. It's all too real.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to an 8. I'm still shaky, but talking about it... it helps, somehow.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves."
