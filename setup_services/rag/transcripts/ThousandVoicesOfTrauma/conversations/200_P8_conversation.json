    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mrs. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like I'm right back there in that cell, you know? The walls feel like they're closing in on me, even though I know I'm here in your office. My heart's racing, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's hard to shake off the feeling of helplessness that comes with remembering those days.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how unfair it all was. I was innocent, but nobody believed me. I spent years in that place, away from my family, my life... It's like a part of me is still there, trapped. I'm angry, so angry at the system that failed me. But there's also this... this shame. Like maybe I deserved it somehow, even though I know that's not true. It's confusing, you know?",
    "Therapist: I hear you. How do these feelings compare to when you first started therapy?",
    "Client: Well, it's... it's different now. Before, I couldn't even talk about it without breaking down completely. Now, it's still painful, but I can put it into words. The emotions aren't as overwhelming as they used to be. I guess that's progress, right? But sometimes I wonder if I'll ever truly be free from these memories.",
    "Therapist: That's a very insightful observation. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm noticing that... well, my hands are trembling a bit. And there's this knot in my stomach that won't go away. But I'm also aware that I'm here, in this room, and that I'm safe now. It's like I'm straddling two worlds - the past and the present. And I'm realizing that maybe I'm stronger than I thought. I survived that, didn't I? Maybe I can survive the memories too.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it feel to acknowledge your strength?",
    "Client: It's... it's strange, actually. Part of me wants to deny it, to say that I'm not strong at all. But another part feels a glimmer of hope. Like maybe I can reclaim the years I lost, you know? I've been carrying this burden for so long, and it's exhausting. But if I'm strong enough to have survived that, maybe I'm strong enough to heal too. It's scary to think about, but also... kind of exciting?",
    "Therapist: Mm. What do you mean by exciting?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... for the first time in a long time, I can see a future that isn't completely overshadowed by my past. Don't get me wrong, it's still there, and it still hurts. But maybe it doesn't have to define everything about me anymore. I'm 80 years old, and I've spent so much of my life trapped in those memories. But what if I could spend whatever time I have left actually living? It's a big 'what if', but it feels... possible now.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant shift. How does your body feel as you consider this possibility?",
    "Client: You know, it's funny you should ask that. I just noticed that my breathing has slowed down a bit. The tightness in my chest isn't as bad. I still feel shaky, but it's not as intense. It's like... it's like my body is slowly catching up to what my mind is realizing. That I'm here, I'm safe, and maybe... maybe I can heal.",
    "Therapist: I see. What would healing look like for you?",
    "Client: Healing... (long pause) I think healing would be waking up in the morning and not having my first thought be about my time in prison. It would be being able to talk about my experiences without feeling like I'm going to fall apart. Maybe it would be forgiving myself, even though I know logically I didn't do anything wrong. And... and maybe it would be allowing myself to feel joy again, without feeling guilty about it. Is that too much to hope for?",
    "Therapist: There's no such thing as too much hope. How does it feel to voice these desires?",
    "Client: It feels... liberating, in a way. Like I'm finally giving myself permission to want more than just survival. But it's also terrifying. What if I can't do it? What if I'm too old, or too damaged? I've lived with this for so long, I'm not sure I know how to be any other way. But at the same time, I want to try. I want to see if I can reclaim some of what was taken from me. Does that make any sense?",
    "Therapist: It makes perfect sense. What do you think might be a first step?",
    "Client: A first step... (sighs) I suppose talking about it like this is already a step, isn't it? Maybe... maybe I could try to reconnect with some old friends. I've been so isolated, so afraid of people seeing the pain I carry. But I miss having connections. Or perhaps I could try to do something I enjoyed before all this happened. I used to love gardening. I haven't touched a plant in years, but maybe... maybe I could start small. A little potted herb or something. It's not much, but it's a start, right?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a wonderful idea. How do you feel about these potential steps?",
    "Client: I feel... nervous, definitely. But there's also a tiny spark of excitement. Like I'm standing on the edge of something new. It's scary, but it's also... hopeful? I didn't think I'd ever feel hopeful again. It's fragile, this feeling. I'm afraid it might shatter if I look at it too closely. But it's there, and that's... that's something, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: It absolutely is. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to explore this idea of healing more. Maybe we could talk about other small steps I could take. And... and maybe we could discuss how to handle the setbacks. Because I know there will be days when it all feels too much again. I want to be prepared for those, you know? But mostly, I want to keep this little spark of hope alive. Can we work on that?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Is there anything else you'd like to add before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a long time, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can do this. It's terrifying and overwhelming, but also... kind of beautiful. Is that weird to say?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. Thank you for sharing your journey with me. We'll continue next week."
