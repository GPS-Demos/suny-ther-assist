    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I'm back there, you know? The sounds of the gunshots, the screams... they're so vivid in my mind. I can feel the fear in my chest, like it's happening all over again.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Helplessness, I think. When I remember hiding behind that wall, watching everything unfold... I felt so powerless. I wanted to do something, anything, but I was frozen. And now, sitting here, I still feel that way. Like I should have done more, but I couldn't.",
    "Therapist: How does that helplessness manifest in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a weight on my chest. My shoulders feel heavy, and there's this knot in my stomach. I'm clenching my fists without even realizing it. It's hard to breathe normally.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why didn't I do something?\" Even though I know logically there was nothing I could've done. I was just a kid. But then I think about the people who got hurt, and I feel guilty. Like, maybe if I'd been braver or smarter, I could've helped somehow.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts impact you now?",
    "Client: They... they make me doubt myself a lot. In my studies, in my relationships. I second-guess every decision. It's like I'm always waiting for something bad to happen, you know? And when things go well, I feel like I don't deserve it because I didn't do enough back then.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your anxiety in this moment?",
    "Client: It's definitely there. My palms are sweaty, and I'm having trouble sitting still. There's this urge to just... run away or hide. But at the same time, talking about it... it's hard, but it feels important. Like I'm finally facing it instead of pushing it down.",
    "Therapist: How does this compare to when you first arrived as a refugee?",
    "Client: Oh, it's... it's different. When I first got here, I was just numb. I didn't want to think about any of it. I threw myself into school, into making new friends, anything to avoid dealing with what happened. But now, it's like I'm finally letting myself feel it all. It's overwhelming, but also... I don't know, maybe necessary?",
    "Therapist: What's giving you strength in this process?",
    "Client: I guess... the fact that I'm here, doing this. That I'm facing it. And... my friends here, my roommates. They don't know everything, but they're supportive. And... maybe this sounds weird, but the memory itself? Like, remembering that I survived, that I made it here... it's painful, but it's also proof that I'm stronger than I thought.",
    "Therapist: How do you see this affecting your future?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me hopes that by working through this, I'll feel more... whole? Like I won't be carrying this secret weight around anymore. Maybe I'll be able to trust myself more, to believe that I can handle things. But it's also scary. What if I can't move past it? What if it always defines me?",
    "Therapist: What would moving forward look like to you?",
    "Client: I think... being able to talk about my experiences without feeling overwhelmed. Being able to watch the news without panicking. Maybe even... using what I've been through to help others somehow? I don't know if that's possible, but... I'd like to think that something good could come from all this pain.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix. I'm exhausted, emotionally drained. But there's also this weird sense of... I don't know, accomplishment? Like I've faced something I've been running from for so long. I'm shaky, but I also feel a bit lighter. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: What do you need right now to feel grounded?",
    "Client: I think... just a moment to breathe. To remind myself that I'm here, in this room, safe. Maybe... could I have some water? And... is it okay if we just sit quietly for a minute before we end? I need to collect myself a bit.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take all the time you need.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I know this is hard work, but I think it's important. I'm glad I'm doing this, even if it doesn't always feel good in the moment.",
    "Therapist: How would you like to close our session today?",
    "Client: Could we... maybe end with something positive? Like, could you remind me of something I've accomplished since starting therapy? I think I need to hear that right now.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You've shown incredible courage today.",
    "Client: Thank you. That... that means a lot. I'm going to try to hold onto that feeling as I leave. Is it okay if I call you if things get overwhelming between now and our next session?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
