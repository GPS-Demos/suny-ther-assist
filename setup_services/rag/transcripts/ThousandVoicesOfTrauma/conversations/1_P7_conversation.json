    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Are you ready to revisit the memory of the airplane crash?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay. Well, I was on my way to visit my daughter in Australia. The flight had been smooth for the first few hours. I remember looking out the window, admiring the clouds, when suddenly there was a loud bang. The plane shook violently, and oxygen masks dropped from the ceiling. People started screaming, and I could see the panic in their eyes. I fumbled with my mask, my hands shaking...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The plane started to descend rapidly. I could feel my stomach lurch. The flight attendants were trying to keep everyone calm, but I could see the fear in their faces too. I thought about my wife, my children, my grandchildren. I was convinced I was going to die. The memories of being bullied as a child flashed through my mind, and I felt so helpless, just like back then.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. You're safe now.",
    "Client: It's hard... I can still hear the alarms blaring, the crying children. The captain's voice came over the intercom, but I couldn't make out what he was saying over all the noise. The oxygen wasn't enough, I felt like I couldn't breathe. My chest was so tight...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: Thank you. As we got closer to the ground, I closed my eyes and gripped the armrests. The impact was brutal. I was thrown forward, my seatbelt cutting into my waist. There was a deafening crash, and then everything went silent for a moment. When I opened my eyes, the cabin was filled with smoke. People were crying, screaming for help. I was in shock, but somehow I managed to unbuckle my seatbelt and stand up.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I helped the elderly woman next to me with her seatbelt. We made our way to the emergency exit. The slide had deployed, but people were pushing and shoving. It reminded me of the school bullies, always pushing me around. But this time, I found strength. I helped others onto the slide before going down myself. When I reached the ground, I saw the plane engulfed in flames. The heat was intense, and the smoke was thick. I couldn't believe I had survived.",
    "Therapist: You showed incredible courage.",
    "Client: It's still hard to believe sometimes. In the aftermath, as we waited for rescue, I kept thinking about how close I came to never seeing my family again. The guilt of surviving when others didn't... it's overwhelming at times. And now, every time I hear a loud noise or see a plane in the sky, I'm right back there in that moment of terror.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You've been through a lot.",
    "Client: I have, haven't I? It's strange, but talking about it now, I feel a mix of emotions. There's still fear and sadness, but also a sense of... I don't know, maybe pride? That I managed to help others despite my own terror. It's conflicting.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are all valid.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think I need a moment. This is more draining than I expected.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take your time. You're doing excellent work.",
    "Client: (After a pause) I'm ready to continue. After the rescue teams arrived, everything became a blur. The medical checks, the debriefings, the calls to family. I remember my wife's voice when I finally got to speak to her. She was crying, relieved. I was too. But in the weeks that followed, I couldn't shake off the experience. Nightmares, flashbacks, constant anxiety. It was like being trapped in that moment over and over again.",
    "Therapist: You're very resilient. Keep going.",
    "Client: The worst part was how it affected my daily life. I couldn't even drive past the airport without having a panic attack. Loud noises would make me jump. I started avoiding social gatherings because I couldn't bear to talk about it. My grandchildren wanted to visit, but I was afraid my anxiety would scare them. It was like the bullying all over again - feeling isolated, different, afraid.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress by talking about this.",
    "Client: I hope so. It's been a long journey. Some days are better than others. I've started to reconnect with friends and family, but there's always this underlying fear. Will I ever feel normal again? Will I ever be able to fly to see my daughter in Australia? I miss her so much, but the thought of getting on a plane... it terrifies me.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have these concerns. We'll work through them.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. You know, talking about it now, I realize how far I've come. A few months ago, I couldn't even say the word 'airplane' without breaking into a cold sweat. Now, I can at least discuss it, even if it's still difficult. Maybe there's hope after all.",
    "Therapist: There absolutely is. You've shown tremendous strength.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think I'd like to stop here for today if that's alright. This has been intense, but... oddly helpful. I feel drained, but also a bit lighter, if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've done excellent work today. We'll end here."
