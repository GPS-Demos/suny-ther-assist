    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure exercise. Can you describe what you witnessed?",
    "Client: Okay... I was walking home from the library late one night. As I turned the corner onto my street, I saw a van parked near an alley. There were two men forcibly pushing a young woman into the back of the van. She was struggling and trying to scream, but one of the men had his hand over her mouth. I froze, not knowing what to do.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I wanted to help her, but I was terrified. The men looked dangerous, and I thought they might have weapons. I felt so helpless watching her being taken. Her eyes were wide with fear, and she was reaching out towards me as if begging for help. I can still see her face so clearly...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice shaking) The van door slammed shut, and they drove off quickly. I stood there for what felt like hours, shaking and trying to process what I'd just seen. I couldn't believe it happened right in front of me. I... I should have done something. Called for help, yelled at them, anything...",
    "Therapist: Stay with the memory. What happened next?",
    "Client: I finally snapped out of it and called the police. They arrived quickly, but the van was long gone. I gave them my statement, but I felt so useless. I couldn't provide much information beyond a vague description of the van and the men. I keep thinking about that woman, wondering what happened to her. Did she survive? Is she okay? The guilt... it's overwhelming sometimes.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: (taking a deep breath) After that night, I couldn't sleep properly for weeks. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw her face. I started avoiding that street altogether, taking longer routes home. I became hyper-vigilant, always looking over my shoulder, expecting to see something terrible happening again. It's affected my studies too. I have trouble concentrating, and sometimes I get panic attacks in crowded places, thinking everyone around me could be a potential victim or trafficker.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How do you feel right now?",
    "Client: I feel... anxious. My heart is racing, and my palms are sweaty. Talking about it brings back all those feelings of fear and helplessness. But also... I feel angry. Angry at those men, angry at myself for not doing more. And I feel so sad for that woman and all the others who might be going through similar ordeals right now.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (nodding) I know I'm safe here, but it's hard to shake off these feelings. I keep wondering if I'll ever feel completely safe again. Every time I see a van similar to the one from that night, I tense up. I've become paranoid about human trafficking, constantly reading news articles about it and warning my friends to be careful. It's like that one moment has completely changed how I see the world.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Continue.",
    "Client: Sometimes I have nightmares about it. In the dreams, I'm there again, but this time I try to help. I run towards the van, shouting for them to stop, but my feet feel like they're stuck in mud. I can never reach her in time. I wake up in a cold sweat, feeling just as helpless as I did that night. It's frustrating because logically, I know there wasn't much I could have done without putting myself in danger, but emotionally... I can't shake the feeling that I failed her.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling drained, to be honest. Talking about it is exhausting, but... I also feel a bit lighter. Like I'm not carrying this burden alone anymore. I've never really talked about it in this much detail before. I've always been afraid that people would judge me for not doing more, or that they wouldn't understand how much it affected me. But being able to share it here, it feels... I don't know, validating somehow?",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. You're making progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. I guess I didn't realize how much I needed to talk about this. It's still painful to think about, but maybe... maybe by working through it, I can start to move forward. I don't want this experience to define me or control my life anymore. I want to feel safe again, to be able to walk down the street without constantly looking over my shoulder. And maybe... maybe I can find a way to help others, to turn this terrible experience into something positive.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great strength. How do you feel about ending here?",
    "Client: I think that would be good. I feel emotionally drained, but also... hopeful? Like maybe there's a light at the end of this tunnel. Thank you for listening and guiding me through this. It wasn't easy, but I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. We'll continue next session."
