    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the event?",
    "Client: It's hard to talk about... My husband, he... he came home drunk that night. I was in the kitchen, preparing dinner. I could hear him stumbling in the hallway. My heart started racing...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Take your time.",
    "Client: He entered the kitchen, yelling about something... I can't even remember what. His face was red with anger. I tried to calm him down, but he just got more agitated. He... he grabbed my arm so hard...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I can feel his grip on my arm... it hurts. I'm scared. I don't know what he'll do next. I try to pull away, but he's too strong. He's shouting in my face, his breath reeks of alcohol. I feel so small, so helpless...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Keep going.",
    "Client: He pushes me against the counter. The edge digs into my back. I'm crying now, begging him to stop. But he doesn't listen. He never listens when he's like this. I'm trembling all over. I want to run, but there's nowhere to go...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (voice breaking) He... he slaps me across the face. The pain is sharp, stinging. My cheek feels hot. I'm in shock. I can't believe this is happening again. I slide down to the floor, trying to make myself as small as possible...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: I'm curled up on the cold kitchen tiles. He's still yelling, but his words are a blur. All I can focus on is the throbbing in my cheek and the ache in my arm. I feel so ashamed, so worthless. Why does this keep happening to me? What did I do wrong?",
    "Therapist: Remember, it's not your fault.",
    "Client: (sobbing) I just want it to stop. I want him to be the man I married, not this... monster. But I'm too afraid to leave. Where would I go? What would people say? I feel so trapped, so alone...",
    "Therapist: You're not alone now. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Eventually, he storms out of the kitchen. I hear the front door slam. I'm left there on the floor, shaking and crying. The dinner I was preparing is forgotten. I don't move for what feels like hours. I'm too scared he might come back...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're here now, safe.",
    "Client: (taking a shaky breath) It's hard to believe I'm safe now. Even after all these years, I can still feel the fear, the helplessness. It's like it's etched into my bones. How do I ever move past this?",
    "Therapist: You're already taking steps. This is progress.",
    "Client: I suppose you're right. It's just... it's overwhelming sometimes. The memories, the emotions... they come flooding back so vividly. But I'm here now, talking about it. That's something, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're showing great courage.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's not easy, but... I want to heal. I want to stop letting these memories control me. I want to feel strong again, like I did before all of this started. It's a long road, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: It is, but you're not walking it alone.",
    "Client: That's comforting to hear. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever fully recover. If I'll ever stop feeling afraid or ashamed. But being here, talking about it... it helps. Even if it's painful, it feels like I'm finally facing it head-on.",
    "Therapist: That's exactly what you're doing. Well done.",
    "Client: (sighs) I feel drained after reliving that, but also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've released some of the weight I've been carrying. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's a common experience. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... okay, I think. It's strange. Talking about it is exhausting, but there's also a sense of relief. Like I'm finally acknowledging what happened instead of trying to bury it. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: It makes perfect sense. You've done well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I know we still have a long way to go, but I feel like I've taken a step forward. It's scary, but also... empowering, in a way. I'm facing my fears instead of running from them.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. Shall we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. This session has been intense, but I'm glad we did it. Thank you for your support and patience. I'll see you next week?",
    "Therapist: Yes, same time next week. Take care of yourself."
