    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Lee?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Revisiting that moment when my ex-wife told me she wanted a divorce... it's bringing up a lot of emotions I thought I had buried.",
    "Therapist: What stood out to you about that experience?",
    "Client: The look in her eyes. It was so... cold. After 30 years of marriage, I never thought she could look at me that way. I felt like I was suddenly worthless, like everything we had built together meant nothing. It's... it's hard to shake that feeling.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was intense. My heart was racing, and I felt that same knot in my stomach that I had back then. But... I guess it wasn't as overwhelming as I expected. I mean, I'm still here, right? I survived it once, and I survived reliving it just now.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful observation. How does this connect to your recovery?",
    "Client: Well, I suppose it shows that I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. For years, I've been avoiding anything that reminded me of that day. But facing it head-on... it's not easy, but it's not impossible either.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your courage. What else did you notice?",
    "Client: I realized that a lot of the shame I've been carrying... it's not really mine to bear. I always thought I must have done something terribly wrong for her to leave, but revisiting that moment, I can see that it wasn't all on me. Relationships are complex, and sometimes they just... end.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful reflection. How might this shift your perspective?",
    "Client: I think... I think it might help me be kinder to myself. I've spent so long beating myself up, thinking I wasn't good enough. But maybe it's time to let some of that go. It's not going to be easy, but I feel like I can breathe a little easier now.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. What's next for you in this journey?",
    "Client: I want to work on rebuilding my self-esteem. I've let this divorce define me for too long. Maybe it's time to focus on the relationships I still have - with my children, my friends. And... maybe even consider dating again? I don't know if I'm ready for that, but for the first time in years, it doesn't seem impossible.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like positive goals. How can we support that in our sessions?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to keep facing these memories. As painful as it is, I can see how it's helping. And maybe we could work on some strategies for when I start feeling worthless again? I want to be able to challenge those thoughts when they come up.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll continue this work together. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... hopeful? It's strange. I came in dreading this session, but I'm leaving feeling like I've lifted a weight off my shoulders. It's not gone completely, but it's... lighter.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. What will you focus on until next time?",
    "Client: I think I'll try to be more aware of my negative self-talk. And maybe... maybe I'll reach out to my son. We haven't talked much since the divorce, and I've been avoiding it. But I think I'm ready to try rebuilding that relationship.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great plan. Remember to be patient with yourself.",
    "Client: Thank you. I will. This isn't easy, but... I'm starting to believe it's worth it. I'm grateful for your guidance through this process.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work. I'll see you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, I'll be here. Thank you again."
