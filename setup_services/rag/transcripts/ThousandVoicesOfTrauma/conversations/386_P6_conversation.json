    "Therapist: Welcome, Priya. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the bullying incident.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in the school hallway. It's crowded, and I can smell the musty scent of old books. I see Megan and her friends approaching. My heart starts racing...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: Um, about a 4 out of 10. I'm tense, but manageable.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue.",
    "Client: Megan starts taunting me about my accent. She's mimicking the way I speak, and everyone's laughing. I feel my face getting hot, and my palms are sweaty. I want to disappear...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: She's getting closer, poking my shoulder. I can feel her breath on my face as she sneers at me. The laughter around us is deafening. I'm frozen, can't move...",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *inhales shakily* I... I remember wishing someone would help me. A teacher, anyone. But nobody came. Megan grabs my backpack, dumping my books on the floor. I'm on my knees, scrambling to pick them up, and she's kicking them away...",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's still an 8. My hands are shaking. I feel so helpless and angry.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I... I can hear them calling me names. \"Curry breath,\" \"FOB\"... It hurts so much. I'm trying not to cry, but I can feel tears starting...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 9. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take another deep breath.",
    "Client: *breathes deeply* The bell rings, and they finally leave. I'm alone in the hallway, surrounded by my scattered books. I feel so small, so worthless...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: The SUDS is coming down a bit. Maybe a 7? I feel drained.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've done really well.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's... it's hard to revisit that.",
    "Therapist: I know. You're very brave. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves."
