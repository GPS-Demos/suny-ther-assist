    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is dreading it. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. How would you rate your distress from 0 to 100?",
    "Client: Uh... probably around a 60 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Yeah, I think so. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day in combat. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in the Humvee. We're on patrol in Fallujah. It's hot, so damn hot. The air feels thick with dust. I can smell diesel fuel and sweat. My uniform is sticking to my skin.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: We're driving slowly, eyes scanning the streets. Everything looks normal, but there's this... tension. Like the air could shatter at any moment. I'm gripping my rifle tightly.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My heart's racing. My palms are sweaty on the rifle. I can feel every bump in the road.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that. What do you hear?",
    "Client: The engine rumbling. Occasional radio chatter. Then... oh God. (voice shaking) There's a loud crack. An explosion. The Humvee lurches.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, John. Remember, you're safe here. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) It's... it's up to 75.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. Can you continue?",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah. (pause) The Humvee's stopped. There's smoke everywhere. I can hear screaming. I'm trying to get out, but my door is jammed.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in that moment?",
    "Client: I... I need to help. My team is out there. But I'm trapped. I'm useless. (voice breaking) I can hear them dying and I can't do anything.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings, John. You're doing great.",
    "Client: (sobbing) I finally get the door open. The heat hits me like a wall. I stumble out, coughing. There's blood everywhere. I see Martinez... oh God, Martinez. He's not moving.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: (struggling to speak) It's... it's 90. I can't...",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, John. This is just a memory. Can you feel the chair you're sitting in?",
    "Client: (deep breaths) Yeah... yeah, I can.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: I... I move towards Martinez. There's so much blood. I try to apply pressure, but... (choking up) I know it's too late. I failed him.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Guilt. Overwhelming guilt. And anger. Why couldn't I save him? Why was I trapped in that damn Humvee?",
    "Therapist: Those are natural feelings, John. Stay with them. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear more gunfire. I grab my rifle and take cover. My training kicks in, but I feel numb. Like I'm watching myself from outside my body.",
    "Therapist: What do you see around you?",
    "Client: Chaos. Smoke. Flashes of gunfire. I see our medic working on someone, but I can't tell who it is. I'm returning fire, but I don't even know if I'm hitting anything.",
    "Therapist: How long does this go on?",
    "Client: It feels like hours, but it's probably only minutes. Reinforcements arrive. The shooting dies down. Then it's just... quiet. This eerie quiet.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind in that quiet?",
    "Client: I... I can't believe what just happened. I'm looking at the bodies... our guys, their guys. It doesn't matter. They all look the same in death.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, John?",
    "Client: Empty. Just... empty. And guilty. Why did I survive when others didn't?",
    "Therapist: That's a heavy burden to carry. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 80. Still high, but... I can breathe a little easier.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. Let's continue. What happens after the quiet?",
    "Client: We... we start the grim task of accounting for everyone. Calling in medevacs for the wounded. I'm moving on autopilot. I help load Martinez onto a helicopter. I can't look at his face.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling as you do this?",
    "Client: Numb. Like I'm not really there. But underneath, there's this... rage. At the enemy, at myself, at the whole damn war.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. How does your body feel?",
    "Client: Tense. Every muscle is tight. My jaw is clenched so hard it hurts. I feel like I might snap at any moment.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, John. Keep going.",
    "Client: We... we finish up. Head back to base. The ride is silent. No one talks. I keep replaying it in my head. What if I'd gotten out faster? What if I'd seen the IED?",
    "Therapist: How do those thoughts make you feel?",
    "Client: Helpless. Angry at myself. I know logically there's nothing I could've done, but... (voice breaking) it doesn't stop the guilt.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction, John. What happens when you get back to base?",
    "Client: We debrief. It's all very clinical. Numbers, facts. But I can see it in everyone's eyes. We're all broken. After, I go to my bunk. I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see Martinez's face.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, John?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Drained. But also... I don't know. There's a part of me that feels relieved to have talked about this.",
    "Therapist: That's good, John. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 65. Still there, but... manageable.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today, John. How do you feel about the session?",
    "Client: It was tough. Really tough. But... I think it helped. It's like... I've been carrying this weight for so long, and now I've set some of it down.",
    "Therapist: That's a great way to look at it. We'll end here for today. Remember to practice your breathing exercises. Is there anything else you'd like to add before we finish?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening. For not judging. It means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, John. I'm here to support you. We'll continue this work in our next session. Take care of yourself this week."
