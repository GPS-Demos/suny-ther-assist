    "Therapist: Welcome back, James. Are you ready to continue our imaginal exposure work today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with your baseline SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10. My stomach feels a bit tight, but I'm managing.",
    "Therapist: Okay. When you're ready, close your eyes and bring up that memory.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Alright... I'm back in the hospital room. The beeping of the machines is so loud. I can smell the antiseptic... it's overwhelming. My daughter, she's lying there, so small in that big bed. The tubes... there are so many tubes...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe a 6? My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: Keep going. You're doing well.",
    "Client: The doctor comes in. His face is so serious. I can feel my wife's hand gripping mine tightly. The doctor starts talking about organ failure, about how her little body is shutting down. I... I can't breathe. It feels like the room is closing in on me.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: (Voice shaking) It's an 8. God, it feels so real. I can hear my wife sobbing next to me.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I remember looking at my daughter's face. She looks so pale, so lifeless. I keep thinking, \"This can't be happening. Not to my baby girl.\" I feel so helpless, so angry at the world. Why her? Why couldn't it be me instead?",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: (Breathing heavily) It's... it's a 9. My chest feels so tight. I can feel the tears on my face, just like that day.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it.",
    "Client: The doctor is telling us we need to make a decision. Do we keep her on life support or... or do we let her go? I can't... I can't make that choice. How can a parent make that choice? I feel like I'm drowning in guilt and fear.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: (Choked up) It's... it's still a 9. My hands are shaking. I feel like I'm right back there, having to face this impossible decision.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: We... we decided to let her go. I remember holding her hand as they turned off the machines. The room got so quiet. I could hear my wife's muffled sobs. I felt... I felt like I was breaking into a million pieces.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) It's... it's an 8. The pain is still there, but... but I can feel it's not as sharp as before.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Let's stay with it a bit longer.",
    "Client: I remember kissing her forehead. Her skin was so cool. I whispered that I loved her, that I was sorry I couldn't protect her. The nurse came in, so gentle, and asked if we wanted more time. I couldn't speak. I just nodded.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 7. I still feel the sadness, the loss, but... but I can breathe a little easier now.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're processing this well.",
    "Client: We stayed there for hours, just holding her. I remember thinking about all the things she'd never get to do, all the moments we'd miss. But I also... I also felt grateful for the time we had with her.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's a 6 now. I feel drained, but... but also a little lighter, if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: It does. You've done great work today.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Thank you. It's still hard, but... but I think it's getting easier to face.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. Let's end here for today."
