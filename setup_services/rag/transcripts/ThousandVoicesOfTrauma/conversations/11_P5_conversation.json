    "Therapist: Hello, Mrs. Johnson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Oh, hello Dr. Adams. I'm... well, I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this session all week. The idea of reliving that night... it's terrifying.",
    "Therapist: I understand. It's normal to feel anxious. Can you tell me more?",
    "Client: It's just... ever since that home invasion, I've tried so hard to push those memories away. The thought of deliberately bringing them up makes my heart race. I'm worried I might fall apart or have a panic attack right here in your office.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How can I support you today?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. Maybe... could you explain again why we need to do this? And what exactly will happen? I know you've told me before, but I think I was too scared to really listen.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Imaginal exposure helps process trauma memories. Shall I explain further?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I need to understand why I'm putting myself through this.",
    "Therapist: By revisiting memories safely, we reduce their power over you. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Will it be like reliving it all over again? I'm afraid I'll get stuck in those feelings and won't be able to come back to the present.",
    "Therapist: It may feel intense, but you're safe here. We'll go at your pace. How does that sound?",
    "Client: A little better, I suppose. But what if I can't handle it? What if I completely break down?",
    "Therapist: I'll be here to guide you. We can pause anytime. How else can I reassure you?",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I guess I'm just worried about losing control. In my day-to-day life, I work so hard to keep everything together. The thought of deliberately letting that facade crack is... well, it's terrifying.",
    "Therapist: Your strength is admirable. This process takes courage. What else concerns you?",
    "Client: I'm worried about what might come up. There are parts of that night that are still hazy. What if I remember something even worse?",
    "Therapist: That's a common fear. We'll handle new memories together. How does that feel?",
    "Client: A little overwhelming, but I suppose it's better than not knowing. I've carried this weight for so long... part of me is almost desperate to let it go, even if the process is difficult.",
    "Therapist: Your readiness is a big step. How can we make you more comfortable?",
    "Client: Maybe... could we have a signal if I need to stop? And could you remind me where I am if I seem too caught up in the memory?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll use hand signals and grounding techniques. Anything else?",
    "Client: I think that helps. I'm still scared, but I feel a bit more prepared now. Thank you for being so patient with me, Dr. Adams.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your courage is commendable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: I... yes. I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Let's do this before I lose my nerve.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Take a deep breath. We'll start slowly. You're safe here."
