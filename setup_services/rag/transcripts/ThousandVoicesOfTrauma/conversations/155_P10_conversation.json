    "Therapist: Welcome, Amir. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a part of me that wants to get this over with, but another part that's dreading it. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start by taking a few deep breaths together.",
    "Client: (inhales deeply, then exhales) Okay... that helps a little.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, can you tell me about the medical trauma we'll be focusing on today?",
    "Client: It was about two years ago. I... I had a heart attack while I was at work. It came out of nowhere, and I thought I was going to die right there in my office.",
    "Therapist: I see. Before we begin the exposure, what's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um... probably around a 5 or 6. Just talking about it makes me feel tense.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Remember, you're safe here. Let's begin. Close your eyes and describe that day.",
    "Client: Alright... (takes a deep breath) It's a Tuesday morning. I'm at my office, sitting at my desk. I've got a stack of paperwork in front of me, and I'm feeling stressed about a big deadline coming up. The office is quiet, just the sound of typing and phones ringing occasionally.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I start to feel... off. There's this pressure in my chest, and I'm thinking it's just stress. But then it gets worse. I'm sweating, and my left arm starts to feel numb. I... I remember thinking, \"This can't be happening. Not now, not to me.\"",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm terrified. My heart is racing, and I can't catch my breath. I try to stand up, but I'm dizzy. I... I call out for help, but my voice is weak. I'm thinking about my wife, my kids... oh God, I don't want to die.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Amir. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to an 8. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: I know it's difficult. You're safe here. Take a deep breath and continue.",
    "Client: (breathes deeply) Someone from the office next door hears me and rushes in. They're asking me what's wrong, but I can barely speak. I manage to say \"heart\" and they immediately call for an ambulance. I'm on the floor now, clutching my chest. The pain is... it's excruciating.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What do you see, hear, feel?",
    "Client: I see faces hovering over me, looking worried. I hear panicked voices, someone saying \"Stay with us, Amir.\" The carpet is rough against my back. I'm gasping for air, and there's this crushing weight on my chest. I'm... I'm so scared.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The paramedics arrive. They're asking me questions, but everything's a blur. I feel them cutting open my shirt, attaching things to my chest. There's a prick in my arm - an IV, I think. They're moving me onto a stretcher, and I'm being rushed out of the office.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking at this moment?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking about my family. Will I see them again? Did I tell my wife I loved her this morning? What if I die and leave them alone? The guilt, the fear... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those emotions. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. This is really intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Amir. Remember, you're here now, safe.",
    "Client: (nods, takes a shaky breath) In the ambulance, everything's chaotic. The sirens are blaring, and I can feel every bump in the road. The paramedic is talking to me, telling me to hang on, but I'm fading in and out. I remember thinking, \"This is it. This is how I die.\"",
    "Therapist: What do you feel in your body?",
    "Client: My chest feels like it's being crushed. I can't breathe properly. My left arm is completely numb now. I'm cold, so cold, and I'm shaking. I can hear my heartbeat in my ears, and it's irregular, skipping beats.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: We arrive at the hospital. Everything's a blur of bright lights and urgent voices. I'm wheeled into the ER, and there's a flurry of activity around me. Doctors, nurses, machines beeping... I'm trying to focus, but the pain is unbearable.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking now?",
    "Client: I... I'm thinking about all the things I haven't done. All the moments I'll miss with my kids. I'm angry at myself for not taking better care of my health. And I'm... I'm praying. Begging for more time.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's still at a 9. My hands are shaking just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Take a deep breath and continue.",
    "Client: (inhales deeply) They're prepping me for surgery. A doctor is explaining something about a blockage, about needing to put in a stent. I'm nodding, but I barely understand. I'm just focusing on staying alive. They're about to put me under, and I... I ask them to call my wife. I need her to know I love her, just in case...",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: The anesthesia kicks in, and everything goes black. The next thing I know, I'm waking up in the ICU. The pain in my chest is duller now, but I'm groggy and disoriented. There are tubes and wires everywhere. I... I realize I'm alive, but I'm terrified it could happen again at any moment.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm relieved, but also... vulnerable. Like my body has betrayed me. I see my wife by the bed, and she's been crying. I feel guilty for putting her through this. And I'm scared... so scared that this is my new reality.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Amir. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 7. Talking about waking up, knowing I survived... it helps a little.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Can you tell me about the days following?",
    "Client: The next few days are a blur of tests, doctors, and visitors. I'm exhausted, both physically and emotionally. Every twinge in my chest sends me into a panic. I can't sleep without nightmares about dying. The doctors talk about lifestyle changes, medication, cardiac rehab... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: How does this impact your daily life moving forward?",
    "Client: It changes everything. I'm constantly anxious about my health. I check my pulse obsessively. I'm afraid to exert myself, to eat certain foods, to be alone. My work suffers because I can't focus. I... I feel like I'm not the same person anymore. Like I can't trust my own body.",
    "Therapist: That must be very difficult. How has this affected your relationships?",
    "Client: It's strained things with my wife. She's supportive, but I can see the worry in her eyes all the time. I feel like a burden. With my kids, I'm overprotective now, always fearing something might happen to them too. And work... I've had to step back from some responsibilities. I feel... diminished.",
    "Therapist: You've been through a lot. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6. Talking about it... it's hard, but it also feels like I'm letting some of it out.",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. How do you see this experience affecting you now?",
    "Client: It's still with me every day. I'm more health-conscious now, which is good, but the fear never really goes away. Sometimes, when I'm stressed or tired, I feel phantom pains in my chest and I panic. I've lost some of my confidence, my sense of invincibility. But... I'm also more appreciative of life, of my family. It's a constant struggle between gratitude and fear.",
    "Therapist: You've shown a lot of strength. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained, but there's a sense of relief too. Like I've confronted this monster that's been living in my head. It's still scary, but maybe... maybe a little less so.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress, Amir. What's your final SUDS level?",
    "Client: I'd say it's around a 4 now. Still there, but not as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You've done very well today. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay... (takes a deep breath) Thank you. This was tough, but... I think it helped.",
    "Therapist: You've made significant progress. We'll continue working on this in our next session."
