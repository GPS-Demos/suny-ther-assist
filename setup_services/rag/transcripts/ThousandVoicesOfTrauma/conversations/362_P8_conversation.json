    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling pretty shaken up, to be honest. It's like I was right back there in that moment, you know? My heart's still racing a bit, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's hard to shake off the images and sensations.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What specific thoughts or images are coming up for you now?",
    "Client: The most vivid thing is the sound of the gunshots. They were so loud, echoing off the walls of that small room. I keep hearing them, even though I know I'm safe here. And I can't stop thinking about the faces of the other hostages. They looked so terrified, and I felt so helpless. I remember thinking, \"This is it. We're not getting out of here alive.\" It's like my brain is stuck in that moment of pure fear and hopelessness.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does your body feel as you recall these memories?",
    "Client: It's like my body's on high alert. My muscles are tense, especially in my shoulders and jaw. I notice I'm breathing faster, and my palms are sweaty. There's this knot in my stomach that won't go away. It's almost like my body is preparing to fight or run, even though the danger is long past. It's exhausting, really.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. What emotions are you experiencing right now?",
    "Client: It's a mix of things. There's still fear, definitely. But also... anger. I'm angry that this happened to us, that someone could do this to innocent people. And there's guilt too. I made it out, but not everyone did. Sometimes I wonder why I survived when others didn't. And underneath it all, there's this deep sadness. It's like mourning for the person I was before this happened, you know? I feel like I lost a part of myself that day.",
    "Therapist: Mm. How do these feelings compare to when you first experienced the trauma?",
    "Client: They're... less intense now, I guess. When it first happened, these feelings were overwhelming. I couldn't function. Now, they're still strong, but I can at least recognize them for what they are. It's like... before, I was drowning in these emotions. Now, I'm treading water. It's still hard, but I can keep my head above water most of the time. The guilt is probably the biggest difference. That's grown over time as I've had more chance to think about everything.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts do you have about your response to the memory today?",
    "Client: I'm... surprised, actually. I thought I'd gotten better at dealing with these memories, but they still hit me hard. Part of me feels frustrated that I'm not 'over it' yet. But another part recognizes that I didn't completely fall apart this time. I was able to stay present and work through the exercise, even though it was difficult. I guess that's progress, right? It's just... it's hard to feel like I'm making progress when the memories still feel so raw.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How do you think this experience relates to your overall recovery journey?",
    "Client: I think... it's showing me that recovery isn't linear. There are good days and bad days, and that's okay. This experience today, as hard as it was, is giving me a chance to practice dealing with these memories in a safe environment. It's like... building a muscle, I suppose. Each time I face these memories, I get a little stronger, a little more resilient. But it also reminds me how far I still have to go. It's humbling, in a way. And it makes me realize how important it is to keep working on this, even when it's tough.",
    "Therapist: Mm. What strengths have you noticed in yourself during this process?",
    "Client: I guess... my persistence, for one. The fact that I'm here, doing this work, even though it's painful. That takes strength, right? And I've noticed I'm getting better at grounding myself when the memories become overwhelming. I'm more aware of my surroundings, able to remind myself that I'm safe now. I think I'm also becoming more compassionate towards myself. Before, I'd beat myself up for having these reactions. Now, I'm trying to be gentler with myself, to recognize that this is a normal response to an abnormal situation. It's a work in progress, but I'm trying.",
    "Therapist: That's insightful. How might you use what you've learned today moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I need to keep reminding myself that healing takes time. Today showed me that I'm still affected by what happened, but also that I can face these memories and come out the other side. Maybe I can try to apply some of the grounding techniques we've practiced when I have flashbacks in daily life. And I want to work on that self-compassion more. It's easy to fall into self-criticism, but that doesn't help. I'm also realizing how important it is to have support. Talking through this with you helps me process it better than when I try to deal with it alone. So maybe I need to reach out more to my support network when I'm struggling.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like valuable insights. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I just... I want to thank you. This isn't easy, but I know it's important. And having a safe space to work through this stuff... it means a lot. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel 'normal' again, you know? But sessions like this, as hard as they are, give me hope that I'm moving in the right direction. It's slow, and it's painful, but I'm starting to believe that maybe, just maybe, I can get through this and come out stronger on the other side.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for your courage today. We'll continue this work next session."
