    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit anxious, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about my experience with human trafficking, and it's making me nervous.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'll try to keep that in mind. Where should I start?",
    "Therapist: Begin with the moment you first realized you were in danger.",
    "Client: Okay... I was in a small, dimly lit room. The air was thick and musty. I remember feeling disoriented, like I had just woken up from a deep sleep. As my eyes adjusted, I saw other people around me, all looking scared and confused. That's when it hit me - we were trapped.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: I tried to stand up, but my legs felt weak. My head was pounding. I could hear muffled voices outside the room, speaking in a language I didn't understand. The fear started to build in my chest. I looked around frantically, searching for a way out, but there were no windows, just one heavy metal door.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The smell... it was awful. A mix of sweat, dirt, and something metallic. I think it might have been blood. Oh God, I'm starting to feel sick just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... As I became more alert, I noticed some of the people around me were injured. Bruises, cuts... One woman was silently crying in the corner. I wanted to help, but I was paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Suddenly, the door burst open. Two large men entered, shouting in a foreign language. They grabbed one of the women and started dragging her out. She was screaming, begging for help. I... I just sat there, frozen. I couldn't do anything to help her.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I feel so ashamed. I should have done something, anything. But I was terrified. After they took her, the room fell silent except for muffled sobs. I remember thinking, \"I'm next. This is how I die.\" The waiting was excruciating.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I can almost smell that room again. It's like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here now. You're safe.",
    "Client: Right, I'm safe. It's just... it's so vivid. Hours passed, maybe days. Time lost all meaning. We were given small amounts of water and stale bread. The door would open periodically, and someone else would be taken. Each time, I thought it would be me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an incredible job. Keep going.",
    "Client: One day - or night, I couldn't tell - I heard commotion outside. There was shouting, then gunfire. The door flew open, and I saw men in uniforms. For a moment, I thought we were being moved to another location. But then I realized... they were police. We were being rescued.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel, recalling that moment?",
    "Client: Relief, but also... disbelief? It was hard to trust that it was real. Even as they led us out, I kept expecting it to be a cruel joke. The sunlight hurt my eyes. I remember stumbling, feeling weak. A paramedic helped me into an ambulance. That's when I finally broke down and cried.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Drained. But also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Talking about it... it's hard, but it feels like I'm taking some of its power away.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive perspective. Well done today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I didn't think I could do this, but... I did. It's still painful, but maybe it's getting a little easier to face.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself. We'll end here for today."
