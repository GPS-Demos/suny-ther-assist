    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Can you describe the refugee experience you mentioned?",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. It was about 30 years ago. We were fleeing our village due to political unrest. I remember the chaos, people running, screaming. There was smoke everywhere.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you saw and felt.",
    "Client: I... I saw a group of armed men enter our neighbor's house. We could hear shouting, then gunshots. I froze, my heart was pounding so hard. I wanted to help, but I was paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) I saw them drag out my neighbor's son. He was just a teenager. They... they shot him right there in the street. I can still hear his mother's screams.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that memory. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The smell... there was a strong smell of smoke and... something else. Maybe gunpowder? I remember feeling so helpless, so angry. Why couldn't I do anything?",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: My wife was pulling on my arm, begging me to run. But I couldn't move. I just stood there, watching. I should have done something, anything...",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. Remember, you're safe now.",
    "Client: (taking a deep breath) We finally started running. I could hear more gunshots behind us. People were pushing, shoving. I lost sight of my wife for a moment and panicked. When I found her again, I grabbed her hand so tightly...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How were you feeling at that moment?",
    "Client: Terrified. Guilty. I kept thinking about our neighbors, about all the people we were leaving behind. We ran for what felt like hours. My legs were burning, my lungs were on fire. But we couldn't stop.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those sensations. You're here now, and you're safe.",
    "Client: (voice breaking) We made it to a refugee camp, but the images... they never left me. I still see that boy's face, hear his mother's cries. I should have done more...",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to feel that way. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: (wiping tears) Sometimes I wake up at night, thinking I'm back there. The guilt, the fear... it's overwhelming. How do I live with this?",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength by facing these memories.",
    "Client: I've never talked about this in detail before. It's... it's hard. But somehow, it feels important to remember, to honor those we left behind.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Drained, but... also a bit lighter? Like I've been carrying this weight for so long, and now I'm finally setting it down, even if just for a moment.",
    "Therapist: That's a common and positive response. We'll end here for today.",
    "Client: Thank you. This wasn't easy, but I think... I think it might be helping.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. We'll continue in our next session."
