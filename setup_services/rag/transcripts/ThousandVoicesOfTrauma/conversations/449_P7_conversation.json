    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Can you describe the home invasion incident?",
    "Client: Okay... It was late at night, around 11 PM. I was alone in my apartment, watching TV in the living room. Suddenly, I heard a loud crash from the kitchen. My heart started racing immediately. I froze, unable to move.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I heard footsteps. They were heavy, definitely a man's. I wanted to run, but I was paralyzed with fear. The footsteps got closer, and then I saw him. A tall figure, dressed in black, with a mask covering his face. He had a knife in his hand.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What did you feel?",
    "Client: Terrified. Absolutely terrified. I couldn't breathe. My chest felt so tight, and I thought I was going to die right there. The man approached me, waving the knife. He demanded money and jewelry. I couldn't speak, I just pointed towards my bedroom.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Continue.",
    "Client: He... he grabbed my arm and pulled me up roughly. I stumbled, nearly falling. He dragged me to my bedroom, still holding the knife to my side. I could feel the cold metal through my thin nightgown. I was shaking uncontrollably.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: In the bedroom, he ordered me to open my jewelry box. My hands were trembling so much, I could barely do it. He started grabbing everything, stuffing it into his pockets. Then he turned to me and... and...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great.",
    "Client: He pushed me onto the bed. I thought... I thought he was going to rape me. I closed my eyes, waiting for the worst. But instead, he just tied my hands with a scarf from my dresser. He warned me not to move or call for help, or he'd come back and kill me.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How do you feel right now?",
    "Client: I feel... scared. My heart is racing just like it did that night. But I also feel angry. Angry that he violated my home, my safe space. And I feel ashamed that I couldn't do anything to stop him.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are all valid. You're processing this well.",
    "Client: After he left, I lay there for what felt like hours, too afraid to move. Every little sound made me think he was coming back. When I finally got the courage to free myself and call the police, it was nearly dawn. I've never felt so helpless and vulnerable in my life.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Drained. But also... a little relieved? Like talking about it has lifted some weight off my chest. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: That's completely normal. You did exceptionally well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to talk about, but I think it's getting a little easier each time. I just wish I could feel safe in my own home again.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. We'll work on that together.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever fully recover from this. The nightmares are still so vivid, and I'm constantly on edge, especially at night.",
    "Therapist: Recovery is a process. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I hope so. It's just... everything reminds me of that night. The sound of footsteps in the hallway, unexpected noises, even shadows moving across the wall. It's like I'm constantly reliving it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's focus on coping strategies.",
    "Client: Okay. I've been trying some of the breathing exercises we talked about. They help sometimes, but other times it feels like nothing can calm me down. Especially when I'm alone at night.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the right things. Keep practicing.",
    "Client: I will. It's just so frustrating. Before this happened, I was independent and confident. Now I feel like a scared child. I hate feeling this way.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm trying to stay positive, but some days are harder than others. I miss feeling carefree and safe in my own space. Will I ever feel that way again?",
    "Therapist: With time and work, yes. You're making progress already.",
    "Client: I hope you're right. I want to reclaim my life, my home. I don't want this incident to define me forever. But it's so hard to shake off the fear and anxiety.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is admirable. Let's end here for today.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you for listening and guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't judge me for my fears.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue this work next session."
