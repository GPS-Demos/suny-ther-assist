    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here together. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 6 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath, and when you're ready, describe the scene.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Alright. I'm... I'm in our old house. The living room. It's evening, and the lights are dim. I can hear raised voices from the kitchen.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see the worn-out couch, the coffee table with rings from countless mugs. There's a flicker from the TV, but it's on mute. The shouting is getting louder.",

    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're safe here. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to an 8 now. *voice shaking*",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *breathes* Okay. I... I force myself to stand up. My legs feel like jelly. I'm inching towards the kitchen door, and I can hear my father's voice, slurred and angry.",
    "Therapist: What are you seeing and hearing?",
    "Client: I peek around the doorframe. There's broken glass on the floor. Mom's backed up against the counter, her face... God, her face is so scared. Dad's looming over her, fists clenched.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Terrified. Helpless. I want to do something, but I'm just a kid. I can't... *starts breathing heavily*",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a moment. Breathe with me.",
    "Client: *takes several deep breaths* Okay... okay. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I step into the kitchen. My voice comes out as a squeak, \"Dad?\" He whirls around, his eyes... they're not my dad's eyes. They're glazed, unfocused.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he lunges towards me. Mom screams, \"No!\" She grabs his arm. I stumble backwards, tripping over my own feet. I fall, and I can feel the sting of glass cutting into my palms.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My hands hurt. I can almost feel the cuts. *voice trembling* SUDS is... is probably a 9 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here with me, safe in this room.",
    "Client: *nods* Right. Safe. Okay... Dad's yelling at me now. \"Get out! This isn't your business!\" Mom's crying, begging him to calm down. I'm scrambling backwards, leaving smears of blood on the linoleum.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I... I hate him. I hate that he's doing this. I hate that I can't stop it. I'm useless, pathetic. *starts crying*",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're not there now. You're safe.",
    "Client: *sniffles* Yeah... safe. Okay. I... I manage to get to my feet. I'm standing in the doorway, torn between running and trying to help Mom.",
    "Therapist: What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I can't leave her. I grab a pan from the counter and yell, \"Stop it! Leave her alone!\" My voice cracks, but I hold the pan up like a shield.",
    "Therapist: How does your father react?",
    "Client: He... he looks shocked for a moment. Then he laughs. It's a horrible, mocking sound. \"What are you gonna do, kid? Hit me?\" He takes a step towards me.",
    "Therapist: What's happening in your body right now?",
    "Client: I'm trembling all over. My grip on the pan is so tight it hurts. I can feel sweat trickling down my back.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS level?",
    "Client: Still... still a 9. Maybe higher. I feel like I might throw up.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here with me. You're safe.",
    "Client: *breathes deeply* Right. Safe. Okay... Mom uses this distraction to edge away from Dad. She's inching towards me, her eyes pleading.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: Dad notices. He growls, \"Where do you think you're going?\" He grabs her arm, yanking her back. I... I scream. I actually swing the pan at him.",
    "Therapist: How does that feel?",
    "Client: Terrifying. Exhilarating. For a split second, I feel powerful. Then... *voice breaks* then he knocks the pan away. It clatters to the floor, and I'm just a scared kid again.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What are you experiencing?",
    "Client: Despair. Hopelessness. I've failed. I couldn't protect her. I'm worthless. *starts sobbing*",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Remember, you're safe now. This is in the past.",
    "Client: *continues crying for a moment, then takes a shaky breath* Yeah... it's in the past. Okay. Dad... he's furious now. He lets go of Mom and turns to me. His hand raises, and I flinch, waiting for the blow.",
    "Therapist: What happens?",
    "Client: It... it doesn't come. There's a loud banging on the front door. A voice shouting, \"Police! Open up!\" Dad freezes. Mom sobs with relief. I... I'm just standing there, shaking.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel in this moment?",
    "Client: Relieved. Scared. Angry. It's all mixed up. I want to run to the door, but I'm afraid to move.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about a 7. The immediate danger feels less intense.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're doing great. What happens next?",
    "Client: Dad... he backs away. He's muttering under his breath, cursing. Mom rushes to me, wrapping her arms around me. I can feel her trembling. The police are still banging on the door.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking it's over. For now. But I know it'll happen again. I feel... God, I feel so helpless. So angry. Why can't I protect her? Why isn't anyone helping us?",
    "Therapist: Those are very normal feelings to have in this situation. Remember, none of this was your fault.",
    "Client: *sighs* I know that now, but then... then I felt like I should have been stronger, braver.",
    "Therapist: How is your body feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. My muscles are all tense. I can feel a headache coming on.",
    "Therapist: Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Feel your feet on the floor, your back against the chair.",
    "Client: *takes a deep breath* Okay. I'm here. In the room with you.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, as we start to bring this session to a close, what's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about a 5 now. Still there, but not as intense.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. You've done very well today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Drained. But... also a bit lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after these sessions. Remember to be kind to yourself for the rest of the day. Do you have any questions or concerns?",
    "Client: No, I... I think I'm okay. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. You showed incredible strength today. We'll continue to work through this in our future sessions. For now, let's do a quick relaxation exercise before you leave.",
