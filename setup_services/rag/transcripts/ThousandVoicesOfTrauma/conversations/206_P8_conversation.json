    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky. My heart's still racing. It's like I'm back there, you know? The earthquake, the chaos... I can still hear the rumbling, the screams. It's all so vivid.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... helplessness. I remember feeling so powerless when the ground started shaking. I couldn't do anything to stop it or protect myself. It's like... like I was at the mercy of nature.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. Where do you feel that fear in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's in my chest. It's tight, like someone's squeezing me. And my hands are clammy. I keep wanting to look around, to make sure everything's stable. It's silly, I know we're safe here, but...",
    "Therapist: That's a natural response. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"What if it happens again?\" I know it's not likely here, but the fear is still there. And then I feel guilty. So many people lost everything, and here I am, safe. It doesn't seem fair.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts and feelings compare to when the event first happened?",
    "Client: They're... they're not as intense now. Back then, I couldn't sleep for weeks. Every little sound made me jump. Now, it's more like... a shadow. Always there, but not as overwhelming. But talking about it brings it all back.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about that difference?",
    "Client: I guess... I guess I've gotten stronger? Or maybe just more used to living with the memory. It's still painful, but I can function now. I couldn't before. It's like... like I've learned to carry it with me.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization make you feel?",
    "Client: Proud, in a way. And surprised. I didn't think I could ever feel normal again after that. But also sad. It's like... like I've accepted that this is part of me now. It's bittersweet, I suppose.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you reflect on that?",
    "Client: I'm thinking about the others. The people I was with during the earthquake. I wonder if they're healing too. Some of them... some of them didn't make it. And I feel this mix of gratitude and guilt. Why did I survive when they didn't?",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with those feelings?",
    "Client: I try to honor their memory. I volunteer at the local crisis center now. It helps, you know? Feeling like I'm doing something useful. But sometimes, especially after talking about it like this, I feel... overwhelmed. Like I'm not doing enough.",
    "Therapist: What would you say to someone else feeling that way?",
    "Client: I'd... I'd probably tell them they're doing their best. That surviving itself is an act of courage. That healing takes time. It's funny, I can say that to others, but it's hard to believe it for myself sometimes.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to recognize that difference?",
    "Client: It's... eye-opening. And a bit frustrating. Why is it so much easier to be kind to others than to myself? But maybe... maybe that's something I can work on. Learning to treat myself with the same compassion I'd show to someone else.",
    "Therapist: What might that look like for you?",
    "Client: I suppose... being gentler with myself when the memories come up. Not pushing them away, but not letting them consume me either. Maybe acknowledging that it's okay to still struggle sometimes, that it doesn't erase the progress I've made.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea sit with you?",
    "Client: It feels... right. A bit scary, but right. Like it's the next step in my journey. I've spent so long trying to be \"strong,\" maybe it's time to learn that it's okay to be vulnerable too. To accept all parts of my experience.",
    "Therapist: What support might you need to do that?",
    "Client: I think... continuing these sessions helps. And maybe... maybe reaching out to other survivors. Sharing our stories. There's something powerful in knowing you're not alone, that others understand.",
    "Therapist: How does talking about this now compare to when we started?",
    "Client: It's... easier. Still emotional, but I feel more... in control? Like I can look at the memory without being completely overwhelmed by it. It's still painful, but I can see it as part of my story, not my whole story.",
    "Therapist: What does that tell you about your progress?",
    "Client: That I'm healing. Slowly, but surely. It's not linear, and some days are harder than others, but overall... I'm moving forward. I'm not letting the trauma define me anymore. I'm... I'm reclaiming my life.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that realization?",
    "Client: Hopeful. For the first time in a long time, I feel genuinely hopeful. Like I can see a future where the earthquake is part of my past, but not something that controls my present. It's... it's a good feeling.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to remember from today's session?",
    "Client: That healing is possible. That it's okay to still struggle sometimes, but that doesn't negate my progress. And that... that I'm stronger than I often give myself credit for. That surviving itself is an act of courage.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... good. Like I've done something important. It's draining to go through these memories, but I feel... lighter somehow. Like I've put down a burden I didn't even realize I was carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. We'll end here for today."
