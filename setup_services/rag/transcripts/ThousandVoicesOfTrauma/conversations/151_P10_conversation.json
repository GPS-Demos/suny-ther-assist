    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Lee. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit apprehensive, to be honest. We're diving into some pretty heavy stuff today, aren't we?",
    "Therapist: Yes, we are. Remember, you're in control. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Let's get on with it before I lose my nerve.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I'm in our living room. It's late afternoon, and the sun is streaming through the blinds. I can smell jasmine from the garden outside. My wife, Mei, is sitting across from me on the sofa. She looks... tired. Worn out. There's a tension in the air that's almost suffocating.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: Mei says, \"We need to talk, Liang.\" Her voice is so quiet, but it feels like a thunderclap in the silence. I can feel my heart starting to race. I... I know what's coming, but I don't want to believe it.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. My palms are sweating, and there's this knot in my stomach. I want to run, but I'm frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 70.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Mei starts talking about how we've grown apart, how she feels like we're just roommates now. Each word feels like a knife. I... I want to argue, to fight back, but I can't find the words. All those years of keeping my emotions in check, of being the \"strong, silent type\"... they're working against me now.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... \"This can't be happening. We're supposed to grow old together. What about our vows?\" But I can't say it out loud. I just... I just sit there, like a statue.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's creeping up... maybe 80?",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: Mei... she's crying now. She says, \"You never talk to me, Liang. You never share what you're feeling. How am I supposed to be in a relationship with someone who's not there?\" And I... God, I want to tell her everything. How much I love her, how scared I am of losing her. But the words... they're stuck in my throat.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What do you notice in your body?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. It's hard to breathe. My hands are clenched so tight my nails are digging into my palms.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Unclench your hands. Breathe deeply.",
    "Client: *exhales slowly* Okay... okay. I'm... I'm still there, in that room. Mei is looking at me, waiting for a response. And I... I finally manage to choke out, \"I'm sorry.\" But it's not enough. It's never been enough.",
    "Therapist: What's Mei's reaction?",
    "Client: She... she looks disappointed. Like she was hoping for more, but knew she wouldn't get it. She shakes her head and says, \"I think we should separate for a while.\" And it's like... it's like the floor drops out from under me.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm devastated. Angry. At her, at myself. I want to scream, to beg her to stay. But I don't. I just... nod. Like I'm accepting a business proposal, not watching my marriage crumble.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. 90, maybe?",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Remember, you're here, you're safe.",
    "Client: *deep, shaky breath* I... I can still see her face. The mix of sadness and resignation. She gets up to leave, and I... I still don't move. I'm paralyzed. She pauses at the door and says, \"You know, Liang, I always hoped you'd fight for us.\" And then she's gone. And I'm... I'm alone.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's happening in your body?",
    "Client: I feel... hollow. Empty. Like someone's scooped out my insides. My throat is tight, and I... I realize I'm holding back tears. Because even now, even alone, I can't let myself cry.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. How's your distress?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. 85, maybe?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I sit there for hours. The sun sets, and I don't move. I'm replaying every moment of our marriage in my head, wondering where I went wrong. Wondering if I could have done something differently. If I had just... if I had just opened up more, shared more...",
    "Therapist: What are you telling yourself in that moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm berating myself. \"You're a failure, Liang. You couldn't even keep your marriage together. You're going to die alone.\" It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Remember, these are just thoughts. They're not facts.",
    "Client: *nods* I... I know. But in that moment, they felt so real. So crushing.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I finally get up. My legs are stiff from sitting so long. I walk to our bedroom - no, my bedroom now. And I... I see Mei's things are gone. Her side of the closet is empty. It's... it's like a physical blow.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel lost. Like I'm in a strange place, not my home. The emptiness of the room... it's echoing the emptiness inside me.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still up there. 80.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* I... I sit on the edge of the bed. Our bed. And for the first time, I let myself cry. It's not loud or dramatic. Just... silent tears. Years of pent-up emotion finally breaking through.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful moment. How does it feel to allow yourself that release?",
    "Client: It's... it's both terrible and liberating. Like I'm finally acknowledging the pain, the loss. But it also feels... shameful. Like I'm weak for crying.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are natural. What happens after that?",
    "Client: I... I eventually fall asleep. When I wake up, for a moment, I think it was all a bad dream. But then I feel the empty space beside me, and it all comes crashing back. And I... I realize this is my new reality.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, as you recall all of this?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm sad. But it's different now. Not as raw. There's a... a hollowness to it. Like an old wound that's scarred over.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's lower now. Maybe a 60?",
    "Therapist: That's good. You've done well today. How do you feel about what we've discussed?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. Painful. But also... I don't know. Maybe a little freeing? Like I'm finally facing it head-on instead of pushing it away.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. We'll end here for today. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I need a moment before I leave.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take all the time you need."
