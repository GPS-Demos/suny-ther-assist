    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to dive into some heavy stuff, and part of me wants to just run out that door. But I'm here, right? That's something.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is commendable. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 6 out of 10. My stomach's in knots.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Let's begin the exposure. Close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Alright... I'm in our old apartment. It's a Saturday afternoon, and I can hear the neighbors' kids playing outside. The sun is streaming through the blinds, casting these long shadows across the living room floor. I'm sitting on the couch, scrolling through my phone, when I hear his key in the lock. My heart immediately starts racing because I know... I know something's off.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: He walks in, and I can tell he's been drinking. His eyes are bloodshot, and there's this... tension in the air. I put my phone down and try to act normal, but my hands are shaking. I say, \"Hey, how was your day?\" And he just... he just glares at me. God, I can feel that glare right now. It's like ice running down my spine.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe an 8?",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Shaky breath) He starts yelling about how I never do anything around the house, how I'm useless. I try to stand up, to defend myself, but he's already stomping towards me. I can smell the alcohol on his breath. He grabs my arm, and I can feel his fingers digging into my skin. I'm trying to pull away, but he's so much stronger...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're doing great.",
    "Client: (Voice breaking) He shoves me, hard. I stumble back and hit the coffee table. The pain... it's sharp in my lower back. I'm crying now, begging him to stop. But he's not listening. He's in a rage, knocking things over, calling me names. I feel so small, so helpless. Why can't I fight back? Why am I just sitting there, letting this happen?",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're not there now. You're safe here. What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: (Sniffling) It's... it's a 9. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Take a deep breath. Continue when ready.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Okay... He's looming over me now, fist raised. I flinch, waiting for the blow. But then... then there's a knock at the door. It's our neighbor. She must have heard the commotion. He freezes, and for a second, I see fear in his eyes. He backs away, telling me to \"clean myself up\" before answering the door. I'm shaking so bad I can barely stand...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: I manage to get to the door. My neighbor, Mrs. Rodriguez, she takes one look at me and knows. She doesn't say anything, just pulls me into a hug. And that's when I break down completely. I'm sobbing into her shoulder, and I can hear him in the background, making excuses, saying we just had an argument. But Mrs. Rodriguez, she's not buying it. She tells him she's calling the police if he doesn't leave right now.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. My heart's pounding. But I also feel... relieved? Like, remembering Mrs. Rodriguez being there for me... it helps.",
    "Therapist: That's good. What happens next?",
    "Client: He leaves, slamming the door behind him. Mrs. Rodriguez helps me inside, gets me some water. She's talking to me, asking if I want to go to the hospital, but I can barely hear her. I'm just... numb. Staring at the mess in the living room, the overturned furniture, the broken picture frames. And that's when it hits me - I can't do this anymore. I can't live like this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7?",
    "Therapist: Good. Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Okay... I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Mrs. Rodriguez stays with me for a while. She helps me pack a bag, insists that I come stay with her for a few days. I'm in a daze, just going through the motions. But as I'm gathering my things, I find this photo of us from when we first started dating. We looked so happy... How did we end up here? I feel this wave of sadness and anger wash over me. I trusted him. I loved him. And he... he broke that trust in the worst way possible.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. They're important.",
    "Client: I... I want to tear up the photo, but I can't. Instead, I just leave it on the dresser. As we're leaving the apartment, I take one last look around. This place that was supposed to be our home... it feels like a prison now. And as I walk out that door, I make a promise to myself: I'm never coming back. No matter how hard it gets, no matter how much he begs or promises to change... I'm done.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of emotions. I feel drained, but also... stronger? Like, remembering that moment when I decided to leave... it reminds me of how far I've come.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent insight. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: I'd say it's down to a 5 now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's take a moment to process what you've shared.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Yeah... it's still hard to talk about, but it feels... I don't know, maybe a little less overwhelming? Like, I can see it as something that happened to me, not something that defines me.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you see yourself in this memory now?",
    "Client: I see someone who was scared and hurt, but also someone who found the strength to leave. I wish I had done it sooner, but I'm proud that I did it at all. And I'm grateful for people like Mrs. Rodriguez who helped me.",
    "Therapist: Those are important insights. How are you feeling physically right now?",
    "Client: My hands are still a bit shaky, and my heart's still beating fast. But I feel like I can breathe easier now. The knot in my stomach is loosening.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's do a grounding exercise. Name five things you can see in this room.",
    "Client: Okay... I see the blue painting on the wall, your desk lamp, the tissue box, the plant in the corner, and my water bottle.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Now, four things you can touch.",
    "Client: The softness of this chair, my jeans against my legs, the smoothness of my necklace, and the coolness of my watch.",
    "Therapist: Good. Three things you can hear?",
    "Client: The ticking of the clock, the hum of the air conditioner, and faint traffic noise from outside.",
    "Therapist: Two things you can smell?",
    "Client: The faint scent of coffee and... is that lavender? From an air freshener maybe?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it is. And finally, one thing you can taste?",
    "Client: The mint from the gum I was chewing earlier.",
    "Therapist: Great job. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Much calmer. More... present, I guess? Like I've come back to the here and now.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 3, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's reflect on what you've accomplished today.",
    "Client: It feels like a lot. I mean, I've talked about this before, but never in such detail. It was hard, really hard. But also... I don't know, maybe healing? Like, I can look at it now without feeling completely overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. How do you think this experience might impact your daily life?",
    "Client: I think... I think it might help me feel less anxious about relationships in general. Like, I've been so scared of getting close to anyone since this happened. But maybe... maybe I can start to trust that not everyone is going to hurt me like he did.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you feel about continuing this work in our next session?",
    "Client: I'm nervous about it, for sure. But I also feel... determined? Like, I've started this journey now, and I want to see it through. I want to keep healing.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent attitude. We'll continue at your pace. For now, what would help you transition back to your day?",
    "Client: I think I need a few minutes to just sit quietly, maybe do some deep breathing. And then... maybe a walk outside? The fresh air might help.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end.",
    "Client: (Deep breaths) Okay... I think I'm ready to wrap up.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredible work today, Maria. Remember to be gentle with yourself this week.",
    "Client: Thank you. I will. And... thanks for guiding me through this. It means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
