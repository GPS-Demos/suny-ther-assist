    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that hostage situation. Describe what you see and feel.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm there. It's dark, and I can smell dust and sweat. We're in a small room, maybe 10 of us. The rebels are shouting outside. My heart is racing, and I can feel sweat trickling down my back.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm trying to stay calm, but I can see the fear in everyone's eyes. One of my colleagues is whimpering softly. I want to comfort her, but I'm afraid any movement might draw attention. The rebels sound angry, and I can hear things being smashed outside.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The air feels thick, hard to breathe. My mouth is dry. I'm thinking about my wife and kids, wondering if I'll ever see them again. God, this is hard...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Right, I'm safe... In the room, I can hear someone praying quietly. It's so surreal. We've been there for hours, and I'm starting to lose track of time. Suddenly, there's a loud bang outside, and everyone flinches. I think I wet myself a little out of fear. I feel so ashamed...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The door bursts open, and two men with guns enter. They're yelling in a language I don't understand. One of them grabs a woman and starts dragging her out. I want to help her, but I'm frozen. I can't move. I'm a coward...",
    "Therapist: It's a normal reaction. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: Am I? I feel like I should have done something. The woman is screaming, and I just sit there. The rest of us are huddled together, trying to make ourselves as small as possible. I can smell the gunpowder from their weapons. It makes me want to vomit.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for facing this memory.",
    "Client: I don't feel brave. I feel terrified. Hours pass, and we're still there. No food, no water. Just fear and uncertainty. Every sound makes me jump. I keep thinking about my family, about all the things I should have said to them. I'm convinced I'm going to die here.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I know, but it feels so real... The night drags on, and suddenly there's a commotion outside. Gunfire, shouting. We all huddle closer together. I'm praying, bargaining with God. Then the door bursts open again, but this time it's our rescue team. The relief is overwhelming, but I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Drained. Relieved it's over, but also guilty. Why did I survive when others didn't? Why couldn't I have been braver?",
    "Therapist: It's normal to have these feelings. We'll work through them.",
    "Client: I hope so. Even now, years later, I still wake up in cold sweats sometimes. I see their faces, hear their screams. I want to move past this, but it's so hard.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. Let's take a deep breath together.",
    "Client: Okay... *deep breath* It does help a little. But talking about it, reliving it... it's exhausting. How many more times do we need to do this?",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. You're doing great work.",
    "Client: I guess... It's just... sometimes I wonder if I'll ever truly get past this. Will I ever feel normal again?",
    "Therapist: It's a process, but you're making strides.",
    "Client: I hope you're right. It's just... when I think about how helpless I felt, how scared... it's overwhelming. But I want to get better. For my family, for myself.",
    "Therapist: That's a great motivation. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think I've had enough for now. Thank you for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I do feel like I'm making some progress, even if it's slow.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. You've done excellent work today."
