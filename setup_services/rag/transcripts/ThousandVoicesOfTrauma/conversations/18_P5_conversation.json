    "Therapist: Welcome back. Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm... not sure. To be honest, I'm a bit nervous. I've been trying to avoid thinking about my experiences in combat for so long. The idea of purposely revisiting those memories is daunting. Can you explain more about why we're doing this?",
    "Therapist: Of course. It's natural to feel anxious. Imaginal exposure helps process traumatic memories. Ready to learn more?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I want to understand the reasoning behind it. I've spent years trying to push these memories away, and now you're asking me to confront them head-on. It's a big shift for me.",
    "Therapist: Understandable. Avoidance can maintain PTSD. Exposure helps reduce symptoms by processing memories. Questions?",
    "Client: I do have a few. Will this make my nightmares worse? I'm already struggling with sleep, and I'm worried this might exacerbate things. Also, how do you ensure I don't become overwhelmed during the process?",
    "Therapist: Good questions. Nightmares may initially increase but usually improve. We'll go at your pace, using coping strategies.",
    "Client: That's somewhat reassuring. I appreciate your honesty about the potential for increased nightmares. Can you tell me more about the coping strategies we'll use? I want to feel prepared.",
    "Therapist: We'll use grounding techniques, deep breathing, and mindfulness. I'll guide you throughout. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It sounds like you've thought this through. I'm still apprehensive, but knowing there are strategies in place helps. My partner has been supportive, but they're worried about how this might affect me. What should I tell them?",
    "Therapist: That's great they're supportive. Explain it's part of treatment, may be challenging, but ultimately helpful. Any other concerns?",
    "Client: Yes, actually. Given my history with depression, I'm worried about spiraling after these sessions. How do we prevent that from happening? And... this might sound silly, but will revisiting these memories make me more prone to anger or violence?",
    "Therapist: Valid concerns. We'll monitor your mood closely. Anger is normal; we'll work on healthy expression. Your safety is priority.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's a relief to know you're considering all these aspects. I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be. What exactly will happen during the exposure? Will I need to close my eyes? Talk about everything in detail?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the memory with eyes closed. Share details, thoughts, and feelings. I'll guide you. Ready to start?",
    "Client: I think so. It's strange, I feel a mix of fear and... hope? Is that normal? Part of me is terrified, but another part feels like this could be a turning point. I've carried this burden for so long.",
    "Therapist: That mix is very common. Your courage is admirable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do this. I trust you, and I'm committed to this process, no matter how difficult it might be. Thank you for your patience and guidance. I'm ready to face these memories and work towards healing.",
    "Therapist: Your bravery is commendable. Remember, we're in this together. Let's start..."
