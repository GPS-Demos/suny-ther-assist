    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Can you describe the moment you were imprisoned during the natural disaster?",
    "Client: It was during the typhoon... I remember the water rising so quickly. We were trying to evacuate, but suddenly we were trapped in our home. The doors wouldn't open because of the pressure from the water outside. It felt like being in a cage, watching the water creep higher and higher.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you saw and felt.",
    "Client: The furniture was floating around us. I could hear the wind howling outside, and the rain was relentless. I was so scared for my husband and our dog. We managed to climb onto the kitchen counter, but the water kept rising. I felt helpless, like we were going to drown in our own home.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) It was getting harder to breathe. The air was so humid, and the space above the water was shrinking. I remember holding onto my husband tightly, thinking this might be our last moment together. Our poor dog was whimpering, and I couldn't do anything to comfort him.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: We spent hours like that, just waiting. The water eventually stopped rising, but we were still trapped. It was dark, and we had no idea if help would come. I kept thinking about our children, wondering if they were safe, if we'd ever see them again. The uncertainty was overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: (starts crying) I felt so guilty. I was the one who insisted we stay home instead of evacuating earlier. If something had happened to my family because of my decision... I don't think I could have lived with myself. The weight of that responsibility was crushing me.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) We were rescued the next day by a boat. But those hours of being trapped... they've stayed with me. Sometimes I still wake up feeling like I can't breathe, like the water is rising around me again. I've never felt so powerless in my life.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard to talk about. But I also feel a little lighter, like I'm not carrying this all alone anymore. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: That's a very common and positive response. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Thank you. I've never really told anyone all the details before. It's always been too painful. But somehow, talking about it here... it feels different. Like I'm looking at it from the outside, almost.",
    "Therapist: That's an important step. Can you tell me more about that feeling?",
    "Client: It's strange. As I'm talking, I can still see and feel everything so clearly, but it's like... I'm not drowning in the memory anymore. I'm just observing it. Does that make sense? It still hurts, but it's not overwhelming me like it usually does.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How does your body feel right now?",
    "Client: I notice my hands are shaking a bit, and my heart is beating faster. But I don't feel as panicked as I thought I would. It's like... I'm acknowledging what happened without being consumed by it. Is this what we're aiming for?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's exactly right. You're doing incredibly well.",
    "Client: I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It's still painful, and I still feel that guilt... but I also feel a tiny bit stronger. Like maybe I can face this memory and not let it control me anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you want to proceed?",
    "Client: I think... I want to keep going. To face more of these memories. It's hard, but I feel like I'm finally starting to process what happened instead of just reliving it. Can we do this again in our next session?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You've made significant progress today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm exhausted, but I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful? Like maybe I can get through this and come out the other side. I haven't felt that way in a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a wonderful sentiment to end on. Well done today."
