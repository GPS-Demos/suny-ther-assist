    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Lee?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. It's been years since I've allowed myself to really think about that day. The airplane crash... it's still so vivid in my memory. I can still hear the screams, smell the burning fuel... (voice trembles) It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The chaos. Everything happened so fast. One moment we were cruising smoothly, the next... (pauses, takes a deep breath) The plane started shaking violently. I remember gripping the armrests, my knuckles turning white. The oxygen masks dropped, and there was this deafening roar. People were crying, praying... I thought, \"This is it. I'm going to die.\"",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory?",
    "Client: It was... difficult. My heart's still racing. I feel like I'm there again, you know? The fear, the helplessness... it's all coming back. But... (sighs) there's also a strange sense of relief. Like I've been holding this in for so long, and now it's finally out in the open.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. How does this connect to your daily life?",
    "Client: I... I never realized how much this affected me. The constant anxiety, always expecting the worst... it all stems from this. Even simple things like boarding a plane or hearing a loud noise... they all bring me back to that moment. It's exhausting, always being on edge.",
    "Therapist: I see. What did you learn from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I'm starting to understand why I react the way I do in certain situations. It's like my body is still stuck in that moment, you know? Always ready for disaster. But going through this memory... it's helping me see that I survived. I made it out. Maybe... maybe I'm stronger than I thought.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: It's scary, but... I want to keep going. For the first time in years, I feel like there might be a way to move past this. To not let that day define my entire life. It's not easy, but... I'm ready to face it.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. What's your takeaway today?",
    "Client: I think... I'm realizing that avoiding these memories hasn't helped. It's just kept me trapped. Talking about it, as painful as it is, feels like the first step towards actually dealing with it. And... (voice softens) I'm grateful to have this space to do that.",
    "Therapist: That's a great perspective. How will you care for yourself now?",
    "Client: I... I think I'll try some of those grounding techniques we discussed. Maybe take a walk in the park near my apartment. And... I might call my daughter. I've been avoiding her calls, but... I think I'm ready to connect again.",
    "Therapist: Excellent plan. Any final thoughts before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but... for the first time in a long while, I feel a glimmer of hope. Like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this and find some peace.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue next week. Take care."
