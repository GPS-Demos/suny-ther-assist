    "Therapist: Alright, Mr. Singh, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's begin. Close your eyes and recall the combat experience we discussed.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm back in Vietnam. The air is thick with humidity, and I can smell the damp earth. We're on patrol, moving through dense jungle. The leaves are brushing against my uniform, and I'm gripping my rifle tightly. My heart is starting to race...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: It's about a 4... maybe 5 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue, please.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud crack. Gunfire erupts all around us. I dive for cover behind a fallen tree. The sound is deafening, and I can feel the vibrations in my chest. My mouth goes dry, and I'm struggling to breathe. I see my buddy, Tom, get hit. He falls... there's so much blood...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: (Voice shaking) It's... it's up to a 7. My hands are sweating, and I feel like I'm really there again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I want to help Tom, but I can't move. I'm frozen. The gunfire is still all around us. I can hear screaming, but I don't know if it's us or them. The smell of gunpowder is overwhelming. I feel so helpless... so scared...",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: (Breathing heavily) It's... it's a 9 now. My heart is pounding, and I feel like I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) The firefight seems to last forever. Finally, it starts to die down. I crawl over to Tom, but... but it's too late. His eyes are open, staring blankly. I failed him. I failed my friend...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's still... still at a 9. I feel so guilty. So ashamed.",
    "Therapist: These feelings are normal. You're processing a difficult memory.",
    "Client: (Voice breaking) I can still see his face. Every time I close my eyes, he's there. Why couldn't I save him? Why am I here, and he's not?",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down a bit. Maybe an 8 now. I feel drained.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The rest of the unit arrives. We secure the area, but it feels hollow. Empty. I help carry Tom's body back. The weight of him... it's not just physical. It's like I'm carrying all my guilt and fear. I can't stop replaying those moments in my head...",

    "Client: (Sighs) I'm... I'm okay. It's hard to talk about, but... I feel a little lighter. Like I've shared some of the burden.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. You did well today."
