    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not really sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. That memory of the earthquake... it's like I was right back there, you know? I could almost feel the ground moving beneath my feet again.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: It's weird, but I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. Like, one minute everything was normal, and the next... chaos. I remember thinking, \"This is it. This is how I die.\" And then feeling guilty for thinking that when so many others were in danger too. It's just... a lot.",
    "Therapist: I see. How do those thoughts make you feel?",
    "Client: Scared, mostly. And... ashamed, I guess? Like I should've been braver or done more to help others. But mostly, I just feel this overwhelming sense of... vulnerability. Like at any moment, everything could fall apart again. It's exhausting, always feeling on edge like that.",
    "Therapist: How does that vulnerability show up in your daily life?",
    "Client: God, in so many ways. I'm always hyper-aware of my surroundings now. Every little shake or rumble sends me into panic mode. I've been drinking more to try and calm my nerves, which I know isn't great. And I've been avoiding tall buildings or crowded places. It's like I'm constantly preparing for the worst.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice in your body as you talk about this?",
    "Client: My shoulders are really tense. I just realized I've been clenching my jaw this whole time. And there's this knot in my stomach that won't go away. It's like my body's still in fight-or-flight mode, even though the danger's long passed.",
    "Therapist: How does recognizing these physical sensations affect you?",
    "Client: It's... eye-opening, I guess? And a bit frustrating. I mean, it's been months since the earthquake. Shouldn't I be over this by now? But feeling all these physical reactions, it's like my body's telling me, \"Nope, not done processing this yet.\" It makes me wonder if I'll ever feel truly safe again.",
    "Therapist: What would feeling safe look like to you?",
    "Client: Wow, that's... that's a tough question. I guess it would mean not flinching every time a truck rumbles by. Being able to go into a high-rise building without my heart racing. Maybe even enjoying a drink socially instead of using it as a crutch. Just... being able to live in the moment without constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop.",
    "Therapist: How does imagining that safety feel?",
    "Client: It feels... almost unattainable right now. But also... hopeful? Like, maybe if I can picture it, I can work towards it. It's just... it's hard to let go of that fear, you know? It's become such a constant companion. But talking about it like this, it makes me realize how much I want to feel that sense of security again.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you could take towards that feeling of safety?",
    "Client: Hmm... Maybe... maybe I could try some of those grounding techniques we've talked about? Like, when I start feeling panicky, instead of reaching for a drink, I could try that 5-4-3-2-1 exercise. Or... I don't know, maybe I could talk to my partner about how I'm feeling more often? I've been kind of shutting them out, and I think that's just making me feel more isolated and scared.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to consider those options?",
    "Client: It's... a mix of emotions, really. Part of me feels a little excited, like maybe there's hope for feeling better. But there's also this voice in my head saying, \"What if it doesn't work? What if you're just stuck like this forever?\" And that's... that's pretty terrifying. But I guess... I guess doing something is better than doing nothing, right?",
    "Therapist: What strength do you see in yourself for considering these steps?",
    "Client: Strength? I... I hadn't really thought about it that way. I guess... I guess it does take some courage to face this stuff head-on instead of just trying to numb it out. And maybe... maybe the fact that I'm here, talking about it, instead of just giving up... that's a kind of strength too? I don't know, it's hard to see myself as strong when I feel so scared all the time.",
    "Therapist: How might acknowledging that strength impact your recovery journey?",
    "Client: That's... that's an interesting way to look at it. I suppose if I can recognize that I'm being brave just by trying, it might make it easier to keep going. Like, maybe I don't have to wait until I feel completely better to give myself credit. Each little step, each time I face a fear instead of running from it... that's a win, right? It's just... it's hard to remember that in the moment when everything feels overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What would help you remember that in those moments?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe I could write it down somewhere? Like a note on my phone or a Post-it on my mirror. Something like, \"You're stronger than you think,\" or \"Every step forward is a victory.\" It sounds a bit cheesy when I say it out loud, but... I don't know, maybe seeing that reminder would help when things get tough.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to come up with that strategy?",
    "Client: It feels... kind of good, actually. Like I'm taking some control back. I mean, I know it's just a small thing, but it's something I can do, you know? And maybe that's what this whole recovery process is about - lots of small things adding up over time. It's still scary, and I know I have a long way to go, but... yeah, it feels like a tiny step in the right direction.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing as we wrap up today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling a bit drained, to be honest. Talking about all this, reliving that memory... it's exhausting. But there's also this weird sense of... I don't know, maybe relief? Like I've been carrying this huge weight around, and just talking about it has lightened the load a little. I'm still anxious, still scared, but... maybe a little less alone with it all? It's hard to put into words.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. How would you like to close our session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to try one of those grounding exercises before I leave, if that's okay? Just to help settle my nerves a bit. And maybe... maybe we could talk more next time about other small steps I can take? I know it's a long road ahead, but I think I'm ready to start walking it. Even if it's just baby steps for now.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great plan. Let's do that grounding exercise now."
