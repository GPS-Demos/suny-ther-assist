    "Therapist: Okay, Rahul, let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start. Close your eyes and bring up that memory.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Alright. I'm back in our old house. I can smell the spices from Mom's cooking... but there's tension in the air. Dad's been drinking again. I'm hiding in my room, trying to block out the sounds.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 4. I'm tense, but it's manageable.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: The shouting starts. It's muffled at first, but getting louder. I can hear Mom crying. My heart's racing now, and my palms are sweaty. I'm frozen, wanting to help but too scared to move.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. I'm feeling really anxious, like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) There's a loud crash. Dad must have thrown something. I hear Mom scream. I'm shaking now, curled up on my bed. I feel so helpless, so angry at Dad, but also terrified of him.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. My chest feels tight, and I'm struggling to stay with the memory.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Rahul. It's normal to feel distressed. Stay with it if you can.",
    "Client: (Breathing heavily) I hear footsteps coming up the stairs. They're heavy, unsteady. Dad's shouting my name now. I'm paralyzed with fear, praying he doesn't come into my room.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's a 9. I feel like I'm right back there. My whole body's tense, and I feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Remember, you're safe now. What happens next?",
    "Client: (Voice shaky) The door handle turns. I can smell the alcohol as he stumbles in. He's yelling, asking why I didn't come when he called. I'm cowering, trying to make myself invisible. I can't look at him.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's still at a 9. I'm... I'm struggling to stay with it. My heart's pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well, Rahul. Take a deep breath. Remember, this is a memory.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) He grabs my arm, pulls me off the bed. I'm crying now, begging him to stop. Mom appears in the doorway, her face bruised. She's pleading with him to leave me alone.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down a bit. Maybe an 8. Seeing Mom there, it reminds me I wasn't completely alone.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this well. What happens next?",
    "Client: Dad lets go of me, turns to Mom. They're arguing again, but it's moving away from my room. I'm left there, shaking, listening to their voices fade down the stairs.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's dropped to a 6. I'm still anxious, but the immediate fear is fading. I just feel... sad. And angry.",
    "Therapist: Those are very normal reactions. You're doing great at staying with the memory.",
    "Client: (Sighs) The house gets quiet again. I can hear Mom crying softly downstairs. I want to go to her, but I'm too scared to leave my room. I just sit there, feeling helpless and alone.",
    "Therapist: And your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5 now. I'm feeling drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved? Like I've faced something I've been avoiding for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent, Rahul. You've done incredibly well. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves before we discuss what you experienced."
