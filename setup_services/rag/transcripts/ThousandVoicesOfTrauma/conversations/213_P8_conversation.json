    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. I can still see her face, you know? My mom's face when she... when she was hit. It's so vivid, like it just happened yesterday.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: Anger, definitely anger. But also... shame? I feel this burning in my chest, and my hands are shaking. I keep thinking, \"Why didn't I do something?\" I was just a kid, but still... I should have protected her somehow.",
    "Therapist: It sounds like you're carrying a lot. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I feel... God, I feel sick to my stomach. It's like I'm right back there in that moment, hearing the shouting, the sound of... of the impact. I can smell the alcohol on his breath. It's overwhelming. I want to run, to hide, but I'm frozen. Just like I was then.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with those sensations. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"This is my fault.\" If I had been a better son, maybe he wouldn't have been so angry all the time. Maybe if I had cleaned up more or gotten better grades... It's irrational, I know, but I can't shake it. And then I think about how I've let her down since then, with my own struggles with substances. It's like I'm becoming him, and that terrifies me.",
    "Therapist: How does that fear manifest for you?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a weight on my chest. I can barely breathe thinking about it. I've tried so hard to be different, to be better, but sometimes I catch myself losing my temper or reaching for a drink when I'm stressed, and I panic. I see his face in the mirror, and I hate myself for it.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Part of me wants to curl up and disappear. But another part... I guess I need to know that I'm not him. That I can break this cycle. It's why I'm here, isn't it? To face this and move past it somehow. But it feels impossible right now.",
    "Therapist: Your awareness is a strength. How else has this memory affected you?",
    "Client: It's affected everything. My relationships, my studies, my self-worth. I struggle to trust people, especially men. I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop, for someone to turn violent or leave. And when things get tough, I turn to substances to numb it all. It's like I'm stuck in this loop, reliving that trauma over and over.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to break that loop?",
    "Client: Freedom, I guess. To not be controlled by these memories anymore. To trust myself and others. To believe that I deserve good things. To look in the mirror and see myself, not him. But it feels so far away, you know? Like I'm reaching for something I can barely see.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful vision. What's one small step towards it?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe talking to my mom about it? We've never really discussed what happened. It's this huge elephant in the room whenever we're together. I'm scared to bring it up, but maybe it could help both of us. And maybe it could help me separate my actions from his, to see that I'm my own person.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a meaningful step. How do you feel about that idea?",
    "Client: Terrified, honestly. But also... hopeful? Like maybe there's a way forward that I couldn't see before. It's still overwhelming, but talking about it here, facing it... it's hard, but it feels like maybe I'm not as powerless as I thought. Maybe I can actually do something about this weight I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant realization. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, somehow? Like some of the pressure has eased. My hands aren't shaking as much anymore. I'm still anxious, but it's different now. It's like... like I can breathe a little easier. And I'm realizing that I'm not that scared little boy anymore. I have choices now, and support. It doesn't fix everything, but it's... it's something.",
    "Therapist: It certainly is. How would you like to close our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to sit with this feeling for a moment. This glimmer of hope. It's small, but it's there. And maybe reflect on some concrete steps I can take moving forward. This was intense, but I feel like I've turned a corner somehow. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You've done remarkable work today. Take care, and we'll continue next session."
