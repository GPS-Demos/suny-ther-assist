    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Can you describe the natural disaster you experienced?",
    "Client: Okay... It was a severe hurricane that hit our coastal town about five years ago. I remember the wind howling and the rain pelting against the windows. The power had gone out, and we were sitting in darkness, listening to the storm rage outside.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you saw and felt.",
    "Client: The trees were bending sideways, and I could hear things crashing outside. I was terrified that our roof would be torn off at any moment. My wife and kids were huddled together in the hallway, and I felt this overwhelming sense of responsibility to keep them safe.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. Stay with that feeling.",
    "Client: It was... I felt so helpless. The wind was getting louder, and suddenly there was a huge crash. A tree had fallen on our neighbor's house. I could hear screaming, and I wanted to go help, but I was frozen in place. I couldn't leave my family, but I felt guilty for not doing anything.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. What happened next?",
    "Client: The storm seemed to last forever. When it finally passed, we ventured outside. The destruction was... overwhelming. Houses were damaged, trees were down everywhere, and there was debris scattered all over the streets. Our house had survived with minimal damage, but others weren't so lucky.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel emotional. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice breaking) I keep thinking about our neighbors. Their house was destroyed, and they lost everything. We took them in for a while, but I felt so inadequate. How do you comfort someone who's lost everything? I still feel guilty that we came out relatively unscathed.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Can you describe more about those feelings of guilt?",
    "Client: It's like... survivor's guilt, I guess. Why were we spared when others suffered so much? I found myself avoiding eye contact with people who had lost their homes. I felt like I didn't deserve to be okay when others were struggling so much. And then there's this constant anxiety now, every time there's a storm warning...",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those feelings. Continue.",
    "Client: Ever since then, I've been hyper-vigilant about weather reports. I've stockpiled emergency supplies, and I get anxious when my family members are out during bad weather. It's affecting my sleep, my work... I feel like I'm always waiting for the next disaster to strike.",
    "Therapist: You're showing a lot of courage facing these memories.",
    "Client: Thanks... it's hard to talk about. The thing is, I know rationally that I can't control the weather, but emotionally, I feel this constant need to be prepared, to protect everyone. It's exhausting. And I feel silly sometimes, getting so worked up over weather reports when nothing happens. But then I remember that night, and all those feelings come rushing back.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're processing a traumatic event.",
    "Client: I guess I am... It's just, I've always prided myself on being the strong one, the one who takes care of others. But that night, I felt so powerless. And now, even years later, I still feel that powerlessness sometimes. It's hard to admit that, you know?",
    "Therapist: You're showing strength by confronting these feelings.",
    "Client: Maybe... It's just, I wish I could go back to how I was before. Carefree, not jumping at every crack of thunder or gust of wind. I miss feeling safe in my own home, in my own skin. But at the same time, I don't want to forget what happened. It feels disrespectful to those who lost so much, you know?",
    "Therapist: It's a complex set of emotions. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Honestly? A bit drained. Talking about it brings back a lot of those intense feelings - the fear, the guilt, the anxiety. But there's also a small sense of... I don't know, maybe relief? Like I'm finally acknowledging how much this affected me instead of trying to push it down all the time.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. We'll end here for today.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you for listening. I know I have a long way to go, but I think... I think this might be helping. It's hard, but maybe facing it is better than trying to run from it all the time.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. We'll continue next session."
