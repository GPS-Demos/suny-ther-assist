    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a mix of emotions. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is terrified of revisiting those memories. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Let's... let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see the community center. It's a warm day, probably early summer. The building looks innocent enough from the outside, but I know what's waiting inside. I can feel my heart racing already.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm walking towards the entrance. My feet feel heavy, like they're made of lead. I don't want to go in, but I know I have to. The leader... he's expecting me. God, I can almost smell that sickening incense they always burned.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 6. Maybe 7.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I push open the door. The smell hits me full force now. Incense, sweat, and something else... fear, maybe? There are others there, milling about. They all look... vacant. Like they're not really there. But the leader, he sees me. His eyes... they're so cold. He motions for me to follow him.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Carlos. What are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. My hands are shaking. I want to run, but my body won't listen. It's like I'm trapped in my own skin.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here in the room with me. You're safe. What's happening now?",
    "Client: He's leading me to a back room. It's dark, lit only by candles. The air feels thick, oppressive. I can hear chanting from somewhere else in the building. He... he tells me to undress. Says it's part of the \"purification ritual.\" I know what's coming, but I feel powerless to stop it.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe higher. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're safe, Carlos. Feel your feet on the ground. You're here with me. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm... I'm undressing. My movements feel mechanical, like I'm outside my body watching this happen. He's smiling, but it's not a kind smile. It's predatory. He starts talking about how this will bring me closer to enlightenment, how I should be grateful. But all I feel is disgust and shame.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: He... he touches me. His hands are cold, and I flinch. But I don't pull away. I can't. He's telling me this is normal, that all the \"chosen ones\" go through this. I want to scream, to fight, but I'm frozen. The chanting gets louder, and I realize it's to drown out any... any sounds.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Carlos. You're safe here. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Remember, you're in control now. You can pause anytime.",
    "Client: I... I need a moment. Just... just give me a second.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take your time. Focus on your breathing.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm... I'm ready to continue. He's... he's pushing me down onto a mat on the floor. The material is rough against my skin. I can smell his breath... it's sour, like old coffee. He's whispering something, but I can't make out the words. My mind is screaming, but my body won't move.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave, Carlos. What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he starts to... God, I can't... It hurts. Physically, emotionally... everything hurts. I'm trying to disconnect, to float away, but I can't. I'm trapped in this moment, feeling everything. The chanting outside gets even louder, and I realize it's to cover my... my cries.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now, Carlos. Remember, this is a memory. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 10. I feel like I'm suffocating.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Feel your feet on the ground. You're here with me, in this room. You're safe.",
    "Client: I... I know. It just feels so real.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're doing incredibly well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: It feels like it lasts forever, but finally... finally, it's over. He stands up, tells me I've done well, that I'm purified now. But I feel... I feel dirty. Violated. Broken. He leaves the room, and I'm alone. I can't move. I just lie there, staring at the ceiling, watching the candlelight flicker.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Shame. So much shame. And anger. And confusion. I trusted these people. They were supposed to help me, to guide me. But they... they destroyed me.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are valid, Carlos. What happens next?",
    "Client: Eventually, I manage to get up. My body aches. I put my clothes back on, but they feel wrong on my skin. When I leave the room, everyone acts like nothing happened. Like I didn't just... like I wasn't just... God, I can't even say it.",
    "Therapist: It's okay. Take your time. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about an 8 now. The worst of it has passed, but I still feel... raw.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well, Carlos. Can you tell me what you do after leaving the room?",
    "Client: I... I walk out of the building. My legs feel weak, shaky. The sunlight hurts my eyes after being in that dark room. I make it to my car, but I don't drive away immediately. I just sit there, gripping the steering wheel, trying to process what just happened. Part of me wants to go to the police, but I'm scared. They've convinced me that no one would believe me, that I'd be ostracized from the community.",
    "Therapist: That must have been an incredibly difficult position to be in. How are you feeling right now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. Emotionally and physically. But there's also a strange sense of... I don't know, relief? Like talking about it is lifting some weight off me. It's still painful, but it feels less... overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. You're showing incredible strength. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 6, I think. The intensity is fading.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Can you bring yourself back to the present moment now? Take a deep breath and slowly open your eyes when you're ready.",
    "Client: (After a moment) Okay... I'm back. That was... intense.",
    "Therapist: You did remarkably well, Carlos. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted, but... but also kind of proud? I never thought I could talk about this without completely falling apart. It hurts, but it feels... manageable.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Remember, healing isn't linear. Some days will be harder than others, but you're showing incredible resilience.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I need some water.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take a moment. We'll discuss some grounding techniques before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay. I... I appreciate your support through this. It means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're very welcome, Carlos. You've done the hard work here. Let's take a few minutes to decompress before we wrap up."

They've convinced me that no one would believe me, that I'd be ostracized from the community."
