    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the scene of the natural disaster?",
    "Client: Okay... I can see the dark clouds gathering. The wind is picking up, and I hear the emergency sirens in the distance. People are rushing around, trying to secure their belongings. I'm standing on my front porch, watching as the trees bend in the wind. My heart is starting to race...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The rain starts falling, heavy and relentless. I can hear the roar of the wind now, it's deafening. Debris is flying through the air - branches, trash cans, even parts of roofs. I'm frozen in place, I can't move. My hands are shaking, and I feel this overwhelming sense of dread...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I see my neighbor's house. The roof is starting to peel off. There's a crashing sound, and I realize it's a car being pushed down the street by the wind. I want to run inside, but I'm paralyzed with fear. My breath is coming in short gasps, and I feel like I might pass out...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Continue.",
    "Client: The water is rising now. It's flooding the street, creeping up towards my house. I finally manage to move, stumbling back inside. But as I close the door, I hear a loud crack. The big oak tree in my yard is falling. It's coming right for the house. I dive to the floor, covering my head. The sound of it crashing through the roof is... it's... I can't...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) The tree crashes through the ceiling, bringing rain and wind inside. Glass is shattering everywhere. I'm curled up in a ball, crying, praying for it to stop. The house is groaning around me, and I'm sure it's going to collapse. I've never felt so helpless, so small. It feels like the world is ending...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you survived this.",
    "Client: Yeah... I did. But in that moment, I didn't think I would. The storm raged for hours. I stayed there, on the floor, soaking wet and shivering. When it finally passed, I emerged to see my neighborhood in ruins. Houses destroyed, trees uprooted, cars overturned. It was like a war zone. And the silence afterwards... it was eerie. That's when I broke down completely, realizing the full extent of what had happened.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... shaken. My heart's still racing a bit. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like, I went through that, and I'm still here. It's hard to revisit those memories, but I can do it.",
    "Therapist: You showed incredible strength. Well done.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's weird, but talking about it like this... it makes it feel less overwhelming. Like, it's just a memory now, not something that's actively threatening me. But I still feel anxious when I think about storms or see news about natural disasters.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I guess so. It's just... sometimes I feel guilty, you know? Like, why did I survive when others didn't? And then there's this constant fear that it could happen again. I check the weather obsessively now. Any hint of a storm sends me into panic mode.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Let's explore that.",
    "Client: Okay. Well, whenever there's bad weather, I start to feel trapped. Like I need to be prepared to run at any moment. I stockpile food and water, keep a go-bag ready. It's exhausting, always being on edge like this. And then there's the guilt... I see stories about other disasters, and it all comes flooding back. I feel like I should be doing more to help, but I'm paralyzed by my own fear.",
    "Therapist: You're very self-aware. That's important.",
    "Client: I suppose. But sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel normal again. Will I always be the guy who freaks out at a thunderstorm? It's affecting my studies too. I have trouble concentrating, always checking the weather instead of focusing on my work. And don't even get me started on dating. How do I explain to someone that I might have a panic attack if it starts raining?",
    "Therapist: These concerns are understandable. We'll work through them.",
    "Client: I hope so. Because right now, it feels like that storm never really ended. It's still raging inside me, you know? Every loud noise, every gust of wind... it all takes me back there. I want to move forward, but I don't know how. How do I let go of this fear without feeling like I'm leaving myself vulnerable?",
    "Therapist: That's a great question to explore next session.",
    "Client: Okay. I guess that's something to think about. It's just... hard. Sometimes I feel like I'm making progress, and other times it's like I'm right back in that moment, terrified and helpless. But talking about it like this... it does help. Even if it's difficult, it feels like I'm facing it head-on instead of running away.",
    "Therapist: You're showing real courage. We'll continue this work.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your guidance through this. It's not easy, but I'm starting to see that maybe, just maybe, I can get through this. I want to be able to live my life without constantly looking over my shoulder, you know? To be able to enjoy a rainy day instead of fearing it. I guess that's what we're working towards, right?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. You're on the right path.",
    "Client: I hope so. It's a long road ahead, but at least I feel like I'm moving forward now. Even just being able to talk about it without completely falling apart feels like progress. I'm looking forward to our next session, to keep working on this. Maybe one day, I'll be able to help others who've been through similar experiences.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive outlook. We'll end here for today.",
    "Client: Alright. Thank you again for your help. I'll see you next week."
