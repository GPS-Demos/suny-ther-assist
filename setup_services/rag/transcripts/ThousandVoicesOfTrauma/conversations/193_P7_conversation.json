    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit nervous about today's session.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We're here to support you.",
    "Client: Thank you. I've been thinking a lot about what we discussed last time, about my experiences during the war. It's been hard to sleep lately.",
    "Therapist: I see. Are you ready to explore those memories further today?",
    "Client: I think so. It's scary, but I want to get better.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Let's begin. Close your eyes and take us back to that day.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm there. It's hot, so hot. The air is thick with dust and smoke. I can hear shouting in the distance, and... and gunfire. Oh god, it's getting closer.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with it.",
    "Client: There are people running everywhere. I'm scared. I see a group of men approaching, they look angry and they're carrying weapons. I want to run, but my feet won't move.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel afraid. You're safe here.",
    "Client: One of them grabs my arm. He's yelling at me in a language I don't understand. I'm trying to pull away, but he's so strong. I'm screaming for help, but no one's coming.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Keep going.",
    "Client: They're dragging me towards a truck. There are other girls there, all looking terrified. I realize what's happening - we're being taken. I feel so helpless, so afraid. I keep thinking about my family, wondering if I'll ever see them again.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel those emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can continue. My heart is racing, and I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe now.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. We're in the truck now. It's dark and cramped. The girls around me are crying. I'm trying to be strong, but inside I'm falling apart. I keep thinking, 'This can't be happening. This can't be real.'",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Keep going.",
    "Client: The journey feels endless. We stop occasionally, and more girls are forced into the truck. I try to comfort some of them, even though I'm terrified myself. I keep hoping someone will rescue us, but as time passes, that hope fades.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an amazing job. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm overwhelmed. It's like I'm reliving it all over again. But... I also feel a bit lighter, like I'm finally letting some of it out.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're very courageous.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard, but I want to continue. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Whenever you're ready.",
    "Client: We finally arrive somewhere. It's a large compound with high walls. As they force us out of the truck, I see other women - some look like they've been here for a while. They look... broken. I'm determined not to let that happen to me, but I'm so scared.",
    "Therapist: Your resilience is admirable. Keep going.",
    "Client: They separate us into groups. I'm trying to stay close to some of the girls I met on the truck, but they push us apart. A man comes and starts inspecting us like we're cattle. It's humiliating and terrifying.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I... I think I need to stop for now. It's becoming too much.",
    "Therapist: That's perfectly fine. You've done excellent work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger?",
    "Therapist: That's a positive sign. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but relieved. It's like a weight has been lifted, even if it's just a small part.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's end here for today.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you for your support. I think... I think I'm ready to go home now.",
    "Therapist: You've done wonderfully. We'll continue next session."
