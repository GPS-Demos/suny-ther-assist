    "Therapist: Welcome, Mei. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is dreading it. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Yes, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I'm in the marketplace. It's bustling, noisy. I can smell spices and hear people haggling. The sun is beating down, and I'm sweating under my uniform.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm on patrol with my unit. We're walking down the main street, eyes scanning the crowd. Suddenly, there's a commotion. I see... oh God, I see a man arguing with a shopkeeper. He's waving something in his hand.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: My heart's racing. I'm alert, tense. I grip my weapon tighter.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you?",
    "Client: About... about 60.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The man... he pulls out a knife. It glints in the sun. People are screaming, running. I shout for him to drop the weapon, but he doesn't hear me or doesn't care.",
    "Therapist: What do you do?",
    "Client: I move closer, my team flanking me. We're yelling for people to clear the area. The man, he... he grabs a young woman. She's terrified, crying.",
    "Therapist: Stay in the moment. What are you experiencing?",
    "Client: My mouth is dry. I can taste dust. My hands are sweaty on my rifle. I'm... I'm scared, but I can't show it.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 75.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're here in the room with me. Keep going.",
    "Client: The man is shouting something I can't understand. He's pressing the knife against the woman's throat. I can see a thin line of blood. I... I have to make a decision.",
    "Therapist: What decision do you make?",
    "Client: I... I take aim. My finger's on the trigger. I'm trying to get a clear shot, but there are too many people. The woman is struggling, and I'm afraid he'll... he'll kill her.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My muscles are tense. I can hear my heartbeat in my ears. I'm barely breathing.",
    "Therapist: And your emotions?",
    "Client: I'm terrified. Angry. Frustrated that I can't do more.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's 85 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Mei. Remember, you're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I see an opening. The man shifts slightly. I take the shot. The sound is deafening in the narrow street. I see... oh God, I see the man fall. There's blood. So much blood.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What do you do after you take the shot?",
    "Client: I'm moving forward, my team securing the area. The woman is hysterical, covered in the man's blood. I reach her, try to calm her down. But she's screaming, pushing me away.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Guilty. Confused. I just saved her life, but she looks at me like I'm a monster.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's 90. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Mei. You're safe here in the room with me. Keep going when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I look down at the man. He's not moving. There's a pool of blood spreading beneath him. I did that. I took a life.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: Was there another way? Could I have talked him down? What if I made the wrong choice?",
    "Therapist: Those are normal thoughts to have. What happens next?",
    "Client: The marketplace is chaos. People are crying, screaming. My team is trying to control the crowd. I'm just... standing there. I can't move.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: I'm numb. My hands are shaking. I feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: And your emotions?",
    "Client: Shock. Disbelief. A deep, overwhelming sadness.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still at 90.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Mei. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I have to give a report. I'm recounting what happened, but it feels like someone else is speaking. I can still hear the woman's screams, see the man's lifeless eyes.",
    "Therapist: How does giving the report make you feel?",
    "Client: Detached. Like I'm watching myself from outside my body. I'm saying the words, but I don't feel connected to them.",
    "Therapist: What happens after you give the report?",
    "Client: We... we have to stay on site until everything's cleared. I'm standing guard, but I can't stop staring at the bloodstain on the ground. People are avoiding me, giving me these looks...",
    "Therapist: What do those looks make you feel?",
    "Client: Like I'm an outsider. Like I don't belong there anymore. I feel... isolated.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to 85.",
    "Therapist: That's good, Mei. You're processing this. What happens as you finish your shift?",
    "Client: I... I go back to base. Everything feels surreal. I clean my weapon, but I can't get the image of the man falling out of my head.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with those images?",
    "Client: I... I try to shut down. I don't talk to anyone. I just go through the motions, hoping it'll all feel like a bad dream tomorrow.",
    "Therapist: And how do you feel as you're lying in bed that night?",
    "Client: Empty. Hollow. I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see his face, hear the gunshot.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to 80 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Mei. We're going to start winding down now. Take a few deep breaths.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay...",
    "Therapist: As we come back to the present, what are you noticing about your body?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tense. My shoulders are tight. But I feel... I feel a little lighter, somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's good. And how are you feeling emotionally?",
    "Client: Drained. Sad. But also... maybe a little relieved? Like I've let something out that I've been holding in for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. Your final SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to 65 now.",
    "Therapist: Excellent work, Mei. You've shown incredible strength today. How are you feeling about the session?",
    "Client: It was hard. Really hard. But... I think it was necessary. I've never talked about it in such detail before.",
    "Therapist: You did remarkably well. Remember to use your coping strategies we've discussed. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we end?",
    "Client: No, I... I think I'm okay. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Mei. I'm proud of the work you did today. We'll process this more in our next session. Take care of yourself this week."
