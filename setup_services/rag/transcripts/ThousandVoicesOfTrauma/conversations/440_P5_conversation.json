    "Therapist: Welcome back. Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm honestly quite nervous. I've been dreading this all week. The idea of revisiting those workplace bullying experiences... it's making my stomach churn. I'm not sure I can handle it.",
    "Therapist: Your anxiety is understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I've worked so hard to push those memories away. I'm afraid that bringing them up will undo all my progress. Plus, my chronic pain tends to flare up when I'm stressed. What if this makes everything worse?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How might revisiting help you heal?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe it could help me process what happened? But I'm still scared. It's like I can already feel the shame and helplessness creeping back in. Being a non-binary person in a conservative workplace was already challenging, and the bullying just amplified everything.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Shall we discuss how this process works?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I need to understand what I'm getting into. Will you be there to support me if things get overwhelming?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'll guide you throughout. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: How long will this take? And what exactly am I supposed to do? I'm worried about getting lost in the memories and not being able to pull myself out.",
    "Therapist: We'll start with 15-20 minutes today. You'll describe the event in detail. I'll be here to ground you.",
    "Client: Okay, that doesn't sound as bad as I imagined. But what if I can't remember everything? Some parts are still fuzzy.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Share what you can. Ready to set some goals?",
    "Client: I think so. I want to be able to think about work without feeling panicked. And maybe... maybe understand that what happened wasn't my fault. Is that realistic?",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent goals. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: I... I guess so. Can you remind me one more time why this is important? I need to hear it to gather my courage.",
    "Therapist: This helps process trauma, reducing PTSD symptoms. Your bravery is the first step towards healing.",
    "Client: Thank you. That helps. I'm still scared, but I'm ready to try. Can we start slowly?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's begin gently. Close your eyes when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay, they're closed. My heart is racing a bit, but I'm here. I'm ready to face this."
