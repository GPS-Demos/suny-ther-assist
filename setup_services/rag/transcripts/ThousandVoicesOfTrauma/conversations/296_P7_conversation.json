    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the cyberbullying incident?",
    "Client: Okay... I remember opening my social media one morning and seeing dozens of hateful comments on my latest post. They were calling me names, mocking my gender identity, and some even threatened violence. It felt like the world was closing in on me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: As I scrolled through the comments, my heart started racing. I felt dizzy and nauseous. I couldn't understand why people would be so cruel. Some of the comments were from people I thought were my friends. I felt so betrayed and alone.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: It's hard to stay with it. I remember closing the app and curling up in bed, crying. I couldn't stop shaking. I kept thinking about the earthquake we had last year, how powerless I felt then, and how I was feeling the same way now. It was like the ground was crumbling beneath me again, but this time it was my social world falling apart.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I didn't want to leave my apartment. I was afraid people would recognize me from the posts and say horrible things to my face. I started having panic attacks whenever my phone buzzed with a notification. It got so bad that I considered dropping out of school. I felt like I couldn't trust anyone anymore.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to talk about. I remember feeling so angry at myself for posting that photo in the first place. I thought, \"If only I had kept to myself, this wouldn't have happened.\" But then I got angry at the bullies too. Why did they have to target me? What did I do to deserve this?",
    "Therapist: You're processing these emotions well. Continue.",
    "Client: The worst part was feeling like I had no control. Just like during the earthquake, when we had to evacuate and I didn't know if my home would still be standing when I returned. With the cyberbullying, I didn't know when or if it would stop. I felt exposed, vulnerable, like anyone could attack me at any moment.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Keep going.",
    "Client: I started having nightmares about being chased by faceless people shouting insults at me. I'd wake up in a cold sweat, checking my phone to see if there were more hateful messages. It was exhausting. I felt like I was constantly on edge, waiting for the next attack.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How did you cope with these feelings?",
    "Client: At first, I didn't cope well at all. I isolated myself, stopped going to classes, and barely ate. But eventually, I reached out to my therapist - not you, my previous one - and they helped me start to process what happened. I also found an online support group for cyberbullying survivors, which helped me feel less alone.",
    "Therapist: That's great. You took positive steps.",
    "Client: Yeah, it helped. But I still struggle sometimes. Certain words or phrases can trigger memories of those comments. And I'm still hesitant to post anything online. It's like I'm constantly second-guessing myself, afraid of drawing attention and inviting more bullying.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to have lingering effects. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I guess so. It's just frustrating because I used to love sharing my life online. It was a way for me to express myself and connect with other non-binary folks. Now it feels like that's been taken away from me. I'm trying to reclaim that space, but it's a slow process.",
    "Therapist: You're showing resilience. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Talking about it is still hard, but I feel a bit lighter. It's like I'm looking at the experience from a distance now, instead of being consumed by it. I'm still angry and hurt, but I also feel proud of myself for surviving it and for working through these feelings.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You've come a long way.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think I have. There are still days when I struggle, especially when I hear about other people being cyberbullied. It brings everything back. But I'm learning to manage those feelings better. I'm focusing on rebuilding my self-esteem and finding safer ways to express myself online.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... okay. A bit drained from reliving it all, but also relieved in a way. Talking about it like this, in detail, it's hard but it also helps me see how far I've come. I'm not that scared, helpless person anymore. I'm stronger now, even if I don't always feel it.",
    "Therapist: You've done very well today. Let's end here.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I think it's helping. I feel like I'm slowly taking back control of my life, one session at a time.",
    "Therapist: You're making great strides. We'll continue next time."
