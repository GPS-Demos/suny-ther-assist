    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. I can still feel my heart racing a bit. Going through that memory of the workplace incident... it's like I was right back there again. The fear, the humiliation, it all came flooding back.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The silence. When it happened, when my supervisor... when he... touched me inappropriately, the office was so quiet. I remember thinking, \"Why isn't anyone saying anything?\" It's like everyone froze, including me. And reliving that moment of paralysis, it's... it's suffocating.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was tough, really tough. But... different from before. I noticed I could breathe through it this time. The panic was there, but it didn't completely take over. Is that... is that progress?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What do you make of that change?",
    "Client: I suppose it means I'm getting stronger? It's still painful, but maybe I'm learning to face it without completely falling apart. It's strange, though. Part of me feels guilty for not being as overwhelmed. Like I'm betraying my younger self by not feeling as devastated.",
    "Therapist: That's an interesting observation. Can you tell me more?",
    "Client: Well, I've carried this pain for so long. It's become a part of me. And now, as I start to process it differently, there's this voice in my head saying, \"You're supposed to be more upset. If you're not falling apart, it means it wasn't that bad.\" But logically, I know that's not true. It's just... it's hard to shake off.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your day-to-day experiences?",
    "Client: I think... I think it explains a lot about my anxiety at work. Even though I'm in a different job now, I'm always on edge, always waiting for something bad to happen. And that constant state of alertness, it's exhausting. But today, being able to face that memory without completely losing control, it gives me hope that maybe I can feel safer in my current workplace too.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What might that look like?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I could start by not constantly scanning for threats. Or by reminding myself that my current colleagues are not my old supervisor. It's hard to imagine feeling completely at ease, but even a little less anxiety would be life-changing.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's scary, but... I want to keep going. For the first time in years, I feel like there might be light at the end of this very long tunnel. I know it won't be easy, but I'm tired of letting that experience control my life. I want to reclaim my peace, my confidence.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. What's one thing you'll take away from today?",
    "Client: That I'm stronger than I thought. And that healing is possible, even if it's slow. I've spent so long thinking I was irreparably broken, but maybe... maybe I'm not. Maybe I'm just a work in progress, and that's okay.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How can you remind yourself of this?",
    "Client: I think I'll write it down. Put it somewhere I can see it every day. \"I am strong. I am healing. I am not broken.\" It sounds simple, but it feels revolutionary to me.",
    "Therapist: Excellent idea. Anything else you want to discuss?",
    "Client: No, I think... I think I need some time to process all of this. It's a lot, but in a good way. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know we have more work to do, but for the first time in a long time, I feel hopeful.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Take care, and we'll continue next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'll see you then."
