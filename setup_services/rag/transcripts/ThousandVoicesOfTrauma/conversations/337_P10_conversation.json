    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Johnson. How are you feeling about our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: Oh, dear... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. My hands are trembling slightly. It's strange, isn't it? Here I am, safe in your office, but just thinking about revisiting those memories makes my heart race.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Can you rate your distress on a scale of 0 to 100?",
    "Client: I'd say... maybe a 60? It's not overwhelming yet, but I can feel the anxiety building.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Let's begin. Close your eyes and take us back to that day at the refugee camp.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Alright... I'm there. The sun is beating down mercilessly. The air is thick with dust and... and the smell of too many people crammed together. I can hear children crying, adults arguing in languages I don't understand. My clothes are sticking to my skin from the heat and... oh god, the fear.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see... I see long lines of people waiting for water. There's a commotion near the front. Someone's shouting. I... I think there might not be enough water for everyone today. My throat feels so dry...",
    "Therapist: Good. What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My mouth is parched. My stomach is in knots. I'm... I'm scared we won't get any water. What if we have to go without again? I... I don't know how much longer I can take this.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Mrs. Johnson. Take a deep breath. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's creeping up. Maybe 75? I can feel my heart pounding.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing great. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: There's a young mother in front of me. Her baby is wailing, and she looks so desperate. I want to help, but I have nothing to give. I feel so... so helpless. The sun is relentless, and I'm getting dizzy from the heat. I... I think I might faint.",
    "Therapist: Remember you're here in my office. You're safe. Take another deep breath.",
    "Client: (Breathes deeply) Yes... yes, I'm here. But it feels so real. I can still hear that baby crying.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's shouting. People are pushing. Oh no... oh no, they're saying the water's run out. The crowd is surging forward. I'm being jostled, pushed. I can't... I can't breathe. Someone's elbow hits my ribs. I'm gasping, trying to stay upright.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Mrs. Johnson. Take another deep breath. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. 85, maybe 90. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I manage to break free from the crowd. My heart is racing. I stumble away, feeling guilty for leaving, but I can't bear it anymore. I find a quiet spot behind a tent. I sink to the ground, my legs shaking. I... I start to cry. I've never felt so alone, so far from home.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I'm thinking about my home, my comfortable life before all this. How did I end up here? Will I ever feel safe again? I'm... I'm angry. Angry at the circumstances that brought me here, angry at the world for letting this happen.",
    "Therapist: Those are very normal feelings. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's still high... maybe 80? But I feel... I feel a little calmer talking about it.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue with what happens next.",
    "Client: I... I sit there for what feels like hours. The camp starts to quiet down as night falls. It gets cooler, and I start to shiver. I'm so thirsty, but I'm afraid to go back to the water line. I... I feel so ashamed of my weakness.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you were in a very difficult situation. There's no shame in your reactions.",
    "Client: (Sighs) I know that now, but then... I felt like I should be stronger. As it gets darker, I start to worry about where I'll sleep. The tent I was assigned to is crowded, and I don't want to go back there. I... I end up curling up right there, behind that tent. I'm cold, I'm thirsty, I'm terrified... but eventually, exhaustion takes over and I fall into a fitful sleep.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Mrs. Johnson. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. My heart is still racing a bit, but I feel... I feel like I can breathe easier. It's like... like I've let something go by talking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's great. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's come down... maybe to a 65? It still feels intense, but not as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's continue. What happens when you wake up?",
    "Client: I... I wake up as the sun is rising. For a moment, I'm disoriented. Then it all comes rushing back. I'm stiff from sleeping on the ground, and my mouth feels like sandpaper. But... but I also feel a strange sense of calm. Like I've survived something.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after enduring a difficult experience. How does that realization make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's mixed. Part of me feels stronger, like if I could get through that night, I can get through anything. But another part feels... broken. Like a piece of me was left behind in that camp.",
    "Therapist: Those are very normal reactions. Let's stay with that moment. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I slowly get up. My body aches, but I force myself to stand. I look around the camp, and it's like seeing it with new eyes. It's still a terrible place, but... but I see people helping each other. Someone offers me a sip of water from their own meager supply. It's a small gesture, but it nearly makes me cry.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful moment. How does it make you feel?",
    "Client: Grateful. So incredibly grateful. And... and a little ashamed of how I'd given up hope the night before. I realize that even in this awful place, there's still kindness. It... it gives me strength.",
    "Therapist: That's a beautiful insight. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's lower. Maybe a 50? I feel sad remembering it all, but also... also a little proud that I got through it.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You showed incredible resilience. Let's start wrapping up. How do you see this experience now, looking back?",
    "Client: It's... it's still painful. I wouldn't wish that experience on anyone. But I also see how it changed me. I'm stronger than I knew. And I have a deep appreciation for the small kindnesses in life. I... I think it's made me a more compassionate person.",
    "Therapist: That's a very insightful reflection, Mrs. Johnson. How are you feeling now that we've worked through this memory?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter. Like I've set down a heavy burden I've been carrying for years. It's still there, but it doesn't weigh on me as much. I'm... I'm grateful we did this, even though it was hard.",
    "Therapist: You've done exceptional work today. What's your final distress level?",
    "Client: I'd say it's down to about a 30 now. I feel... I feel okay. Tired, but okay.",
    "Therapist: That's fantastic progress. Let's take a few deep breaths together to close out our session.",
    "Client: (Takes several deep breaths) Thank you. I... I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without falling apart. But I did it.",
    "Therapist: Yes, you did. You should be very proud of yourself. We'll end here for today. Remember to practice your relaxation techniques, and we'll discuss this further in our next session.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you again. I... I think I'm starting to see a light at the end of this long tunnel.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful to hear, Mrs. Johnson. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
