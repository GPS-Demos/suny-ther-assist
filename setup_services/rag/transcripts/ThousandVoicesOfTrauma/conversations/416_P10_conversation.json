    "Therapist: Welcome, Mei. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is terrified of reliving everything. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 6 or 7 out of 10. My hands are a bit shaky.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. When you're ready, close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Alright... I'm 12 years old. It's a Friday afternoon, and I've just gotten home from school. The house is quiet, which is unusual. Normally, Mom would be in the kitchen starting dinner, but... *pause* but she's not there.",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see... I see Dad's suitcase by the door. My heart starts racing. Something's wrong. I call out, \"Mom? Dad?\" but no one answers. I'm scared.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I hear muffled voices from upstairs. I climb the stairs slowly, my legs feel heavy. The voices are coming from my parents' bedroom. I push the door open and... *voice breaks* and I see Mom sitting on the bed, crying. Dad is standing there with a packed bag.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... God, I feel like my world is crumbling. My chest is so tight. I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *inhales shakily* Okay... okay. Dad looks at me and says, \"Mei, I'm sorry. I have to go.\" Mom is sobbing harder now. I don't understand what's happening. I ask, \"Where are you going, Dad?\" He just shakes his head and says, \"I can't stay here anymore.\"",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. My hands are sweating.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I start crying too. I beg Dad not to leave. I grab his arm, but he gently pushes me away. He says, \"You'll understand when you're older.\" But I don't want to understand! I want him to stay!",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What do you do?",
    "Client: I'm screaming now. Yelling at him not to go. Pleading with Mom to make him stay. But she just sits there, defeated. Dad... he just walks past me. Down the stairs. I follow him, still crying, still begging.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: My throat hurts from screaming. My eyes are burning with tears. My whole body is shaking. I feel like I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *takes a shaky breath* Dad opens the front door. He turns to look at me one last time. His eyes are red, but he's not crying. He says, \"I love you, Mei. Be good for your mother.\" And then... then he's gone. The door closes behind him.",
    "Therapist: What do you do after he leaves?",
    "Client: I... I collapse on the floor. I'm sobbing uncontrollably. I can hear Mom crying upstairs, but she doesn't come down. I feel so alone. So abandoned. Why wasn't I enough for him to stay?",
    "Therapist: Those are painful thoughts. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. My chest hurts so much.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I don't know how long I lay there on the floor. It feels like hours. Eventually, I drag myself up. I'm exhausted. I go to the kitchen and see the calendar on the fridge. There's a family picnic planned for Sunday. I... I rip it off the fridge and tear it to pieces.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling as you do that?",
    "Client: Anger. So much anger. At Dad for leaving, at Mom for not stopping him, at myself for not being enough. I'm shaking as I tear up the calendar. Then I see a photo of us on the fridge. I grab it and... *voice cracks* and I smash it on the floor.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: The glass shatters everywhere. I cut my foot on a piece, but I barely feel it. I'm just... numb. I sink to the kitchen floor, surrounded by broken glass and torn paper. That's when Mom finally comes downstairs.",
    "Therapist: How does she react?",
    "Client: She... she looks shocked. For a moment, I think she's going to yell at me. But instead, she just starts cleaning up the mess. She doesn't say anything. Doesn't comfort me. It's like... like she's forgotten I'm even there.",
    "Therapist: That must have been very painful. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's still... still a 9. My stomach feels sick.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a deep breath. What happens after that?",
    "Client: Mom finishes cleaning up. She looks at me and says, \"Go to your room, Mei. I need to be alone.\" Her voice is... empty. I've never heard her sound like that before. I go to my room, but I can't stop crying.",
    "Therapist: What do you do in your room?",
    "Client: I... I curl up on my bed, hugging my stuffed panda that Dad gave me for my birthday. I'm crying so hard I can barely breathe. I keep hoping this is just a bad dream, that I'll wake up and everything will be normal again.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"What did I do wrong? Why doesn't Dad love us anymore? Is it my fault?\" I feel so guilty, like maybe if I had been a better daughter, he would have stayed. And I'm angry too. I want to hate him for leaving, but... but I still love him and I hate myself for that.",
    "Therapist: Those are very complex emotions. How does your body feel?",
    "Client: My whole body aches. My eyes are swollen from crying. My throat is raw. I feel... hollow inside. Like a part of me left with Dad.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still a 9. I can feel my heart pounding.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I cry myself to sleep. When I wake up, it's dark outside. The house is silent. For a moment, I forget what happened, and then it all comes crashing back. I feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: What do you do then?",
    "Client: I... I creep out of my room. The house feels different, empty somehow. I go to my parents' room. Mom is asleep, but I can see the tear stains on her face. Dad's side of the bed is untouched. It hits me again that he's really gone.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization make you feel?",
    "Client: It's like... like a physical pain in my chest. I can't breathe properly. I want to wake Mom up, to have her hold me and tell me everything will be okay. But I don't. I'm afraid she'll push me away again.",
    "Therapist: That must have been very lonely. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I go back to my room. I sit by the window, staring out at the street. Part of me is hoping to see Dad's car pull up, for him to come back and say it was all a mistake. But he doesn't come. I sit there all night, just... waiting.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful image. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8 now. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Keep going.",
    "Client: As the sun starts to rise, I realize he's not coming back. Not tonight, maybe not ever. I feel... I feel lost. Like I don't know who I am anymore. My whole world has changed overnight.",
    "Therapist: Those are very difficult feelings. How do you cope with them?",
    "Client: I... I don't know how to cope. I feel like I'm drowning. I go to my closet and find the sweatshirt Dad left behind last time we went camping. I put it on. It still smells like him. I curl up in bed wearing it, trying to pretend he's still here.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like it brought you some comfort. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear Mom getting up. She knocks on my door, but I pretend to be asleep. I can't face her yet. I hear her go downstairs, and then I hear... I hear her crying in the kitchen. I want to go comfort her, but I don't know how. I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot of responsibility for a child to feel. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 7 now. I feel drained.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. We're going to start winding down now. Can you bring yourself back to the present?",
    "Client: *deep breath* Yeah... yeah, I'm here. I'm not that scared little girl anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You're safe now. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. But also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved? Like I've let out something I've been holding onto for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's very common. You did excellent work today. Let's do some grounding exercises before we end.",
    "Client: Okay... thank you. I... I didn't think I could do this, but... I did.",
    "Therapist: Yes, you did. You should be proud of yourself. Let's take some deep breaths together."
