    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. My hands are a bit clammy, and I can feel my heart racing already. But I suppose that's normal, right?",
    "Therapist: It's completely normal. Remember, you're in control here. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 6 out of 10. I'm definitely anxious, but not overwhelmed yet.",
    "Therapist: Okay. When you're ready, close your eyes and take us back to that day at the hospital.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Alright... I'm walking into the hospital for my routine check-up. The sliding doors open, and I'm hit with that sterile smell. I'm heading towards the elevator when suddenly... (voice trembles) there's shouting. A man with a gun bursts through a side door.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: He's... he's waving the gun around wildly. People are screaming, dropping to the floor. I... I freeze. I can't move. My legs feel like lead.",
    "Therapist: What's happening in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest is so tight. I can barely breathe. I... I want to run, but I can't.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Remember, you're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: The gunman is yelling something about... about wanting to see a doctor. He's sweating profusely, eyes darting around. I'm trembling uncontrollably. A security guard approaches, and I... oh God, I think he's going to get shot.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: The gunman turns, points the gun at the security guard. I close my eyes, expecting to hear a gunshot. But instead, there's a loud crash. I open my eyes to see the security guard has tackled him. They're wrestling on the ground.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My heart is pounding so hard I can hear it in my ears. I feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe even a 9.",
    "Therapist: Okay, let's pause for a moment. Focus on your breathing. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: (takes several deep breaths) Okay... okay. I think I can continue.",
    "Therapist: When you're ready, pick up where you left off.",
    "Client: The security guard manages to disarm the gunman. More guards rush in. They're handcuffing him, but he's still shouting, struggling. I'm... I'm frozen in place. A nurse approaches me, asks if I'm okay. I can't speak. I just nod.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in that moment?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking, \"This can't be real. This doesn't happen in real life.\" But it is happening. And I feel so... so helpless. So vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: Those are natural reactions. Keep going.",
    "Client: The police arrive. They're questioning everyone. When they get to me, I can barely form words. My voice is shaky. I tell them what I saw, but it feels like I'm watching myself from outside my body.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you're talking to the police?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm trembling. My hands won't stop shaking. I feel cold, even though it's warm in the hospital. I keep looking around, afraid that somehow, there might be another gunman.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Stay with those sensations.",
    "Client: After the police finish questioning me, I... I just want to leave. But I can't. They've cordoned off the area. We're all potential witnesses. I feel trapped. The walls seem to be closing in on me.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take another deep breath. Remember, you're here in my office, safe.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Right. I'm here. I'm safe. (pauses) Can I continue?",
    "Therapist: Whenever you're ready.",
    "Client: Hours pass. They finally let us leave. I practically run out of the hospital. The fresh air hits me, and I gulp it down. But I can't shake this feeling of... of violation. Like my safety has been stolen from me.",
    "Therapist: How does that feeling manifest in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a weight on my chest. A constant tension in my muscles. I feel exhausted, but I know I won't be able to sleep.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens when you get home?",
    "Client: I... I lock all the doors. Check them twice. Three times. I can't stop shaking. I try to call my daughter, but I can't get the words out. I end up texting her instead. I curl up on the couch, wrapped in a blanket, but I can't get warm.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking as you're curled up on the couch?",
    "Client: I keep... I keep replaying it in my mind. The gunman bursting in. The look in his eyes. The sound of people screaming. I wonder what would have happened if... if the security guard hadn't been there. If the gun had gone off.",
    "Therapist: Those are difficult thoughts. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. Emotionally and physically. But also... also kind of relieved? Like, I've faced it again, and I'm still here.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after exposure. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down. Maybe a 6?",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. Let's take a few more deep breaths together.",
    "Client: (breathes deeply) Okay. I think... I think I'm ready to stop for today.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work, Sarah. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted, but... but I feel like I've accomplished something. Like I'm starting to take back control.",
    "Therapist: That's a great observation. You showed a lot of courage today. Let's end here and talk about what you can do for self-care this evening."
