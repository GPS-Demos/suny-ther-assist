    "Therapist: Okay, Maria. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the memory we discussed.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Alright. I'm back in my childhood home. I can smell the strong scent of my abuela's cooking... but also the lingering cigarette smoke from my t\u00edo. I'm seven years old, hiding behind the couch. I can hear them arguing in Spanish, their voices getting louder. My heart is racing...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um... I'd say about a 4. It's uncomfortable, but manageable.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue.",
    "Client: My t\u00edo is yelling at my abuela about me. He's saying I don't belong here, that I'm too... too gringa. That I'm not really part of the family. I can feel tears welling up in my eyes, and my throat feels tight. I want to run, but I'm frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe a 6? My palms are getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) My abuela is defending me, but her voice is shaking. I can hear the fear in it. Suddenly, there's a loud crash. I peek around the couch and see a shattered plate on the floor. My t\u00edo is standing over my abuela, his fist raised. I want to scream, but no sound comes out. I feel so helpless, so... so ashamed.",
    "Therapist: Take a breath. What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) It's... it's an 8. My chest feels tight, and I'm shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Maria. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: (nods) I... I remember running out of the house. The hot sun hit my face, but I felt so cold inside. I ran to the park down the street, climbed into a plastic tube on the playground. I curled up there, crying. All I could think was, \"I don't belong anywhere. I'm not Mexican enough, not American enough.\" I felt so alone, so... rejected.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: (wiping tears) It's still an 8. Maybe even a 9. I feel like that little girl again, lost and scared.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave, Maria. Stay with it.",
    "Client: (nodding) I stayed in that tube for hours. When I finally went home, my abuela hugged me tight. She whispered, \"Mi ni\u00f1a valiente.\" My brave girl. But I didn't feel brave. I felt... broken. Like I'd never be whole again. That feeling... it's stayed with me all these years.",
    "Therapist: How about your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7? I feel drained, but... also a little relieved to have shared this.",

    "Therapist: That's a normal response. You did very well today, Maria.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was hard, but... I think it helped. Can we... can we do this again next time?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll continue at your pace."
