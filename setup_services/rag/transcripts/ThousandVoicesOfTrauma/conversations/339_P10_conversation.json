    "Therapist: Welcome, Ms. Chen. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is terrified. My stomach's in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I guess so. Just... give me a moment to breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. When you're ready, close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm at the airport. It's busy, people rushing everywhere. I can smell coffee from a nearby cafe. My hands are sweaty on my luggage handle.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's happening now?",
    "Client: I'm boarding the plane. The narrow aisle, the hum of the engines... God, my heart's racing already.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 60? It's climbing.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Keep going. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm in my seat, 14C. Middle seat. There's a businessman to my left, typing furiously on his laptop. An elderly woman to my right, she smells of lavender. The plane starts to move and I... I grip the armrests.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: We're taking off. The plane tilts back and my stomach lurches. I hate this part. I'm trying to breathe but it's like my lungs won't expand fully.",
    "Therapist: Remember to stay in the present tense. What's happening right now?",
    "Client: Right, sorry. We're climbing higher. The seat belt sign is still on. I can see the city getting smaller through the window. It's... it's beautiful, but terrifying.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 75. My palms are so sweaty.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: We've reached cruising altitude. The flight attendants are starting their service. I decline a drink, my mouth is too dry. Suddenly, there's a loud bang. The plane shudders violently.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What do you see? Hear?",
    "Client: People are screaming. Oxygen masks drop down. I'm fumbling with mine, hands shaking so badly. The plane is nosediving. Oh god, oh god...",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Remember to breathe. What's happening?",
    "Client: The engines are roaring. We're falling so fast. I can see the ground coming up through the window. People are praying, crying. I'm frozen, I can't move.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My heart is pounding so hard it hurts. I can't breathe. My whole body is tense, like a coiled spring. I think I'm going to be sick.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: The ground is getting closer. I can see trees, a field. The plane is shaking so violently. I close my eyes. I can't watch. There's a deafening crash. Metal tearing. Glass shattering. And then... silence.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice now?",
    "Client: I... I open my eyes. The plane is in pieces. Smoke everywhere. People moaning. I'm still strapped in my seat, but it's not attached to anything anymore. I smell fuel and... and blood.",
    "Therapist: How high is your distress now?",
    "Client: It's... it's maxed out. 100. I can barely speak.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're safe here in my office.",
    "Client: (Deep breaths) Okay... okay. I'm trying to unbuckle my seatbelt. My hands are shaking so much. I fall to the ground when I get free. There's debris everywhere.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I start crawling. There's broken glass, twisted metal. I see bodies... oh god, so many bodies. I'm calling out, but my voice is hoarse. Someone grabs my ankle.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What happens?",
    "Client: It's the elderly woman who was next to me. She's trapped under a piece of the plane. Her face is bloody, but her eyes are clear. She's begging me for help.",
    "Therapist: How do you respond?",
    "Client: I... I try to lift the debris, but it's too heavy. I'm sobbing, telling her I'm sorry. She squeezes my hand and tells me to go, to save myself. I... I leave her there. Oh god, I left her...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, this is a memory. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (Sobbing) I keep crawling. The smoke is getting thicker. I can hear sirens in the distance. My leg is bleeding, I didn't even notice before. I make it to a gap in the wreckage and pull myself out.",
    "Therapist: What do you see when you get out?",
    "Client: It's... it's chaos. The plane is in pieces across a field. There's a small fire starting near the engine. Other survivors are stumbling around, dazed. I collapse on the grass, gasping for air.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm overwhelmed. Guilty for surviving. Terrified. Relieved. It's all mixed up.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe 85?",
    "Therapist: Okay. What happens next?",
    "Client: Emergency vehicles arrive. Paramedics and firefighters swarm the area. Someone puts a blanket around my shoulders and leads me to an ambulance. I'm in shock, I think. Everything seems far away.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What do you notice?",
    "Client: The blanket is scratchy. My ears are ringing. I can taste blood in my mouth. Someone's shining a light in my eyes, asking me questions, but I can't focus.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel?",
    "Client: Sore. Every part of me aches. My leg is throbbing where it was cut. I'm shivering uncontrollably.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: They load me into the ambulance. I catch a glimpse of the wreckage as we drive away. It doesn't seem real. Like a movie set. But the smell... the smell of smoke and fuel and... it's too real.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I... I can't believe I survived. Why me? What about the others? The old woman... I left her there. I should have tried harder to help her.",
    "Therapist: Those are common thoughts after trauma. How's your distress now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 70, I think. My heart's still racing, but I can breathe a little easier.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens at the hospital?",
    "Client: It's a blur of doctors, nurses, tests. They clean and stitch my leg. I overhear them talking about other survivors. Some didn't make it. I feel numb.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I feel disconnected. Like I'm watching everything happen to someone else. They give me something for the pain and I drift off.",
    "Therapist: What happens when you wake up?",
    "Client: I'm in a hospital room. It's quiet except for the beeping of machines. There's sunlight coming through the window. For a moment, I think it was all a dream. Then the pain hits me, and I remember.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel in that moment?",
    "Client: Overwhelmed. Grateful to be alive, but... guilty. So many others didn't make it. I start crying and can't stop.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 60. I feel drained.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. Let's start to bring you back to the present.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm... I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Slowly open your eyes. You're here in my office, safe.",
    "Client: (Deep breath, opens eyes) That... that was intense.",
    "Therapist: You did an excellent job. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Shaky. But... maybe a little lighter? I've never talked about it in such detail before.",
    "Therapist: That's common. Your body and mind have been through a lot. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you... for guiding me through that.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Remember, you're the one doing the hard work here. Let's discuss what you experienced and plan for self-care after this session."
