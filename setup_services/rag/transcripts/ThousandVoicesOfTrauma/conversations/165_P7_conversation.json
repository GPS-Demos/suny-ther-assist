    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure exercise. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the moment you first heard about the natural disaster?",
    "Client: Okay... I was at work, in the office. It was just a normal day, you know? I remember I was typing up some reports when my coworker, Maria, suddenly gasped. She was looking at her phone. I asked her what was wrong, and she just turned her screen towards me. It was a news alert about a massive earthquake hitting my hometown in Mexico. I felt my heart drop instantly.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I couldn't believe it at first. My hands started shaking, and I felt this cold sensation spreading through my body. I immediately tried calling my family, but the lines were all busy. I kept hitting redial over and over, but nothing. I remember feeling so helpless, so far away from them.",
    "Therapist: That must have been terrifying. You're safe now. Continue.",
    "Client: It was. I felt like I couldn't breathe. My boss noticed something was wrong and came over. When I told him, he immediately said I should go home. But I couldn't move. I was frozen, just staring at my phone, willing it to ring. The next few hours were a blur of news reports and failed attempts to reach anyone back home.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. What happened next?",
    "Client: I eventually made it home, but I couldn't sleep. I just sat in front of the TV, watching the news coverage. The images... they were horrific. Buildings collapsed, people crying in the streets. And all I could think was, \"Is my family okay? Are they alive?\" It wasn't until the next morning that I finally got through to my sister.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. How did you feel?",
    "Client: When I heard her voice, I broke down crying. She was alive, but... but she told me that our parents' house had been destroyed. They were okay, but our grandmother... she... she didn't make it out in time. I remember screaming, dropping the phone. It felt like my world was ending.",
    "Therapist: I know this is difficult. You're doing great. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) It's just... I keep thinking, if I had been there, maybe I could have helped. Maybe I could have gotten to my grandmother in time. I feel so guilty for not being there when they needed me most.",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The days after were a blur. I couldn't eat, couldn't sleep. I kept seeing the news images in my head, imagining my family in those situations. I felt so helpless, so far away. And the grief... it was overwhelming. I'd never lost someone so close to me before. I didn't know how to handle it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How did you cope?",
    "Client: I... I didn't, really. I threw myself into work, trying to distract myself. But at night, the nightmares would come. I'd wake up in a cold sweat, thinking I was trapped under rubble. Sometimes I'd dream about my grandmother, about not being able to save her. It was torture.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I know, but... it's still so hard. I feel like I abandoned them, you know? Like I should have been there. And now, every time I hear about any natural disaster, I panic. I can't help but think about what happened, about what could happen again. It's like I'm constantly waiting for the next disaster to strike.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. How are you managing now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still a struggle. I've been trying to talk to my family more, to stay connected. But sometimes it's hard because it brings back all those memories. And the guilt... it's always there, lurking in the background. I want to move forward, but I don't know how.",
    "Therapist: You're taking important steps. Keep going.",
    "Client: I guess... I'm trying to find ways to help. I've been donating to disaster relief funds, volunteering when I can. It helps a little, makes me feel less powerless. But there are still days when it all feels too much, when the memories and the fear overwhelm me. I just want to feel normal again, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You're doing great work.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's just... it's hard to reconcile everything. The guilt of surviving when others didn't, the fear of it happening again, the grief of losing my grandmother. Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning in all these emotions. But being here, talking about it... it helps. It's scary, but it helps.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also a bit lighter. Talking about it is hard, but it's like releasing some of the pressure that's been building up inside me. I know I still have a long way to go, but maybe... maybe I can start to move forward, to find a way to live with what happened without letting it control me.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive outlook. Well done today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It means a lot to have someone listen and understand. I know it's going to take time, but I'm starting to believe that maybe, just maybe, I can get through this. It won't be easy, but I'm willing to try.",
    "Therapist: That's all we can ask. You've done excellent work today."
