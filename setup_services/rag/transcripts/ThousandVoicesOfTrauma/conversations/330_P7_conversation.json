    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the memory we're focusing on today?",
    "Client: Okay... It's about the day my grandmother passed away. I was 12 years old, and it was a sunny Saturday morning. I remember waking up to the sound of my mom crying in the kitchen. I felt this immediate sense of dread in my stomach.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what happened next.",
    "Client: I walked downstairs, and I saw my mom hunched over the kitchen counter, holding the phone. She looked up at me, and her face was red and puffy. I knew something was terribly wrong. I asked her what happened, and she just shook her head, unable to speak. My dad came in and hugged me, telling me that grandma had passed away in her sleep.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What were you feeling?",
    "Client: I felt... numb at first. Like I couldn't process what was happening. Then this overwhelming sadness hit me. My grandmother was my best friend. We spent every weekend together. I couldn't imagine life without her. I started crying, and I couldn't stop. It felt like my whole world was crumbling.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I remember running up to my room and slamming the door. I buried my face in my pillow and sobbed. I kept thinking about all the plans we had made - she was supposed to teach me how to bake her famous apple pie that summer. We were going to go on a road trip to the beach. All of that was gone now. I felt so angry and hurt.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice breaking) I... I'm sorry. This is harder than I thought it would be. I can still feel that pain so vividly. It's like I'm right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. You're doing well.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay. As I was lying there crying, I heard a soft knock on my door. It was my dad. He came in and sat on the edge of my bed. He didn't say anything at first, just put his hand on my back. Then he told me that grandma had lived a long, happy life and that she wouldn't want us to be sad. But I was so angry. How could he say that? How could he expect me not to be sad?",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I remember shouting at him, telling him he didn't understand. I said some really hurtful things. I told him that he didn't love grandma as much as I did, that's why he wasn't as upset. I regret that now, but at the time, I was just so overwhelmed with grief.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those reactions. Continue.",
    "Client: The next few days were a blur. People kept coming to our house, bringing food and offering condolences. I hated it. I hated seeing all these people who barely knew my grandma acting like they cared so much. I just wanted to be alone with my memories of her.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How did you feel during the funeral?",
    "Client: The funeral was the worst part. Seeing her lying there, so still and pale... it didn't look like her at all. I couldn't bear to go up and see her up close. I stayed in the back of the church, clutching my mom's hand. When they started lowering the casket into the ground, I lost it. I started screaming and crying. My dad had to take me away from the graveside.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel emotional. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (wiping tears) I'm sorry. Even now, years later, it's still so painful to remember. I miss her so much. Sometimes I still expect to see her when I visit my parents' house, or I'll think of something I want to tell her before remembering she's gone.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also a bit lighter. Talking about it is hard, but I think it helps. I just wish the pain would go away completely.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to still feel that pain. You're processing it well.",
    "Client: Thank you. I know rationally that grief is a process, but sometimes it feels like I'll never fully get over losing her. She was such a big part of my life, and losing her at such a young age... it really shaped who I am.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's just... sometimes I wonder if I'm holding onto the grief too tightly. Like, if I let it go, I'll be letting her go too. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Many people feel that way. It's a common reaction.",
    "Client: I guess so. It's just hard to find a balance between honoring her memory and moving forward with my life. Sometimes I feel guilty when I'm happy, like I'm betraying her somehow.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are valid. You're making progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. I know this process isn't easy, but I'm trying. I want to be able to think about her without feeling this overwhelming sadness. I want to be able to remember the good times without them being overshadowed by the loss.",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. You're on the right path.",
    "Client: I hope so. Sometimes it feels like one step forward, two steps back. But I'm committed to working through this. I want to get to a place where I can think of her and smile, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent attitude. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Thank you. I really appreciate your support through this. It's not easy to talk about, but I know it's necessary. I just hope that one day, the good memories will outweigh the pain of losing her.",
    "Therapist: That's a natural progression. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: I think I'm starting to understand that now. It's a process, and it takes time. But I'm willing to put in the work. I want to honor her memory by living my life fully, the way she would have wanted me to.",
    "Therapist: That's a healthy perspective. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... tired, but also a bit more at peace. Talking about it, reliving those moments - it's exhausting, but I can feel that it's helping. It's like I'm slowly untangling a knot inside me.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Let's wrap up.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you for guiding me through this. It wasn't easy, but I'm glad we did it. I feel like I've taken a small step forward in processing my grief.",
