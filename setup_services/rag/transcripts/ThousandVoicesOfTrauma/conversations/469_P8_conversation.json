    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. The memory of that car accident, it's so vivid now. I can still hear the screeching of tires, the shattering glass. My heart's racing, and I feel a bit shaky.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: Fear, mostly. And guilt. I keep thinking about how I could have prevented it. If I'd just left the house a few minutes later, or taken a different route... Maybe then I wouldn't have been there when that truck lost control. It's silly, I know, but I can't shake the feeling that somehow it's my fault.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like a heavy weight on my chest. Makes it hard to breathe sometimes. And my shoulders are so tense, like I'm constantly bracing for impact. It's exhausting, really. I find myself getting tired so easily these days.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are accompanying these physical sensations?",
    "Client: I keep replaying the moment over and over. Wondering what I could have done differently. And then I feel angry at myself for not being able to let it go. I'm 76, for goodness sake! I've lived through so much, why is this affecting me so strongly? It makes me feel weak, vulnerable. Like I can't trust my own judgment anymore.",
    "Therapist: How does this experience connect to other parts of your life?",
    "Client: Well, it's made me hesitant to go out. I used to enjoy my independence, even in assisted living. Now, I find myself making excuses not to leave. And when I do go out, I'm constantly on edge, watching every car that passes. It's isolating. I miss my late partner terribly in moments like these. They always knew how to calm me down.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in those moments?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Sometimes I think I just need someone to listen, to understand. Other times, I wish someone could just make it all go away. But mostly, I think I need to feel safe again. To believe that I can handle whatever comes my way, like I used to.",
    "Therapist: How does talking about it now feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a bit relieving. Scary, but relieving. Like I'm finally letting out a breath I've been holding for months. I didn't realize how much I've been keeping inside. It's still painful, but maybe... maybe it's a good pain? Like stretching a stiff muscle.",
    "Therapist: What's different about sharing it here?",
    "Client: Here, I don't feel judged. I've tried talking to some of the other residents, but they either brush it off or start sharing their own stories. And while I know they mean well, it just makes me feel more alone. But here, I feel... heard. Like my experience matters. And maybe, just maybe, there's hope for feeling better.",
    "Therapist: How might you carry this feeling forward?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. But I think I'd like to try. Maybe I could start small, like taking a short walk outside the facility. Or calling my grandchild - I've been avoiding their calls, and I miss them. It's scary to think about, but also... exciting? Like I'm reclaiming a bit of myself.",
    "Therapist: What strength do you notice in yourself now?",
    "Client: Strength? Hmm... I suppose it takes strength to face this, doesn't it? To relive it and talk about it. I've always considered myself resilient, but this experience made me doubt that. But being here, talking about it... maybe I am still that strong person. Just... a different version of strong.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... comforting, actually. Like rediscovering an old friend. I've been so focused on what I've lost - my sense of safety, my confidence - that I forgot about what I still have. My experiences, my wisdom, my ability to adapt. It doesn't fix everything, but it feels like... like a start.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to work on feeling safer when I'm out. Maybe we could talk about strategies for managing my anxiety in public spaces? And... if it's okay, I'd like to explore more about how this experience connects to past traumas. I've been bullied in the past, and I'm starting to see some parallels in how I'm reacting now.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... lighter somehow. Like I've put down a heavy load I've been carrying. There's still a long way to go, I know, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I might actually get there. Thank you for listening, for helping me see things differently.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Take care of yourself."
