    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure exercise. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the scene of the animal attack?",
    "Client: Okay... I was walking in the park near my apartment. It was early evening, and the sun was starting to set. I remember feeling a bit uneasy because there weren't many people around. Suddenly, I heard growling behind me. When I turned, I saw this large, angry dog. Its teeth were bared, and it was crouching like it was ready to pounce.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: The dog lunged at me without warning. I tried to back away, but I tripped and fell. I felt its teeth sink into my leg, and the pain was excruciating. I screamed for help, but no one was there. The dog kept biting and shaking my leg. I was terrified, thinking it might go for my throat next.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What were you feeling?",
    "Client: I felt... helpless. Completely powerless. The pain was intense, but the fear was worse. I thought I was going to die there, alone in the park. My heart was racing so fast, I could hear it pounding in my ears. I was crying and trying to push the dog away, but it was so strong.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) It's hard to talk about this. I can still feel the fear, you know? After what felt like forever, the dog finally let go. I was bleeding badly, and I couldn't stand up. I just lay there, sobbing and shaking. I kept thinking about how I might die there, how no one would find me until it was too late.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I know, but it's still so vivid. I managed to crawl to my phone and call for help. The wait for the ambulance was agonizing. I kept looking around, terrified the dog would come back. Every sound made me flinch. When the paramedics arrived, I broke down completely. I was so relieved but also embarrassed about how scared I was.",
    "Therapist: There's no need for embarrassment. Your reactions were normal.",
    "Client: I guess... It's just, ever since then, I've been so anxious around dogs. Even small ones. And I can't go to that park anymore. Sometimes, I have nightmares about the attack. I wake up in a cold sweat, feeling like I'm back there again. It's affecting my daily life, and I hate feeling so vulnerable all the time.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. It helps to talk about it, even though it's difficult. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel normal again. The attack brought back memories of the sexual abuse I experienced as a child. That same feeling of helplessness, of being at someone else's mercy. It's like all my traumas are connected now, and I don't know how to separate them.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. We'll address those connections.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's just... sometimes I feel so alone in this. Being non-binary and dealing with depression on top of everything else, it's like I don't fit anywhere. The attack just added another layer to my feelings of isolation. I want to move past this, but it feels overwhelming at times.",
    "Therapist: You're not alone. We're here to support you through this journey.",
    "Client: That means a lot to me. I know it'll take time, but I'm committed to working through this. I want to reclaim my life, to feel safe again. It's just hard to imagine right now. Every time I close my eyes, I can still see that dog, still feel its teeth. But I'm trying to remind myself that I survived. I'm here, talking about it. That has to count for something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Your strength is evident in your willingness to face this.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm trying to hold onto that. It's just... sometimes the memories feel so overwhelming. Like right now, talking about it, I can feel my heart racing again. My palms are sweaty, and I have this urge to run away. But I'm staying here, I'm talking about it. That's progress, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: It is significant progress. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I'm glad you think so. It's hard for me to see sometimes. I keep thinking about how this attack has changed me. I used to be more outgoing, more confident. Now I'm always on edge, always watching for potential threats. It's exhausting. But being here, talking about it... it feels like a step in the right direction. Even if it's scary, even if it brings up all these intense emotions.",
    "Therapist: Your awareness and effort are commendable. Let's continue next session."
