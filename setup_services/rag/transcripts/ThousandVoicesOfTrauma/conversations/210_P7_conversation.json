    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the day of the earthquake?",
    "Client: Okay... It was early morning, around 6 AM. I was still in bed when it started. At first, I thought it was just a small tremor, but then...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The shaking got more intense. I could hear things falling and breaking in the house. I tried to get up, but I stumbled. The whole room was moving. I was so disoriented...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I managed to get to the doorway, but I was terrified. The noise was deafening - it sounded like the whole world was coming apart. I could hear my neighbors screaming...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Continue.",
    "Client: I wanted to run outside, but I remembered we're not supposed to during an earthquake. So I just stood there, holding onto the doorframe, feeling so helpless. The shaking seemed to go on forever...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: When it finally stopped, everything was silent for a moment. Then I heard sirens and people crying. I was shaking so badly, I could barely move. I felt... I felt like I'd lost all control...",
    "Therapist: That's a natural reaction. Keep going, you're doing well.",
    "Client: I stumbled outside and saw the destruction. Buildings were damaged, cars overturned. It was like a war zone. I couldn't believe this was happening in my own neighborhood...",
    "Therapist: You're describing it vividly. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I... I feel anxious. My heart's racing a bit. It's hard to think about it without feeling scared all over again.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe now.",
    "Client: Yeah... It's just... seeing all that destruction, not knowing if my loved ones were okay. I felt so powerless, you know? Like nothing I did mattered in the face of nature's fury.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: Thanks... It's hard to talk about. After the quake, I couldn't sleep properly for weeks. Every little noise made me jump. I kept expecting another quake to hit...",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel that way. You're showing strength by sharing this.",
    "Client: I guess... It's just, sometimes I still feel on edge, you know? Like I'm waiting for the next disaster. It's exhausting living like that.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. How do you cope with those feelings now?",
    "Client: I try to remind myself that I survived. I do deep breathing exercises when I feel panicky. But sometimes, especially when there's a small tremor, all those feelings come rushing back...",
    "Therapist: You're developing good coping strategies. Keep going.",
    "Client: It's hard not to feel guilty too. I was lucky - my home wasn't badly damaged. But some of my friends lost everything. I feel bad for being relieved that I was okay...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel relieved. You're not responsible for others' misfortune.",
    "Client: I know that logically, but emotionally... it's tough. The aftermath was almost as bad as the quake itself. The constant aftershocks, the struggle to get basic supplies, the fear...",
    "Therapist: You're describing it well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: A bit shaky, to be honest. Talking about it brings back a lot of those feelings. But... I also feel a little lighter? Like sharing the burden helps somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. You're doing excellent work here.",
    "Client: Thanks... It's still hard, but I think it's getting easier to talk about. I just wish I could shake this feeling of vulnerability, you know? Like at any moment, everything could be taken away...",
    "Therapist: That's a natural fear. You're handling it courageously.",
    "Client: I'm trying. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel completely safe again. But I guess talking about it like this, facing those memories... it helps make them less overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. You're making significant progress.",
    "Client: I hope so. It's exhausting carrying all this around. But I'm starting to see that maybe I don't have to let it control me forever. Maybe I can learn to live with what happened without being constantly afraid.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think... I think I need a break now. This has been intense, but... good, I think. Challenging, but good.",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've done excellent work today. Let's take some deep breaths together before we end."
