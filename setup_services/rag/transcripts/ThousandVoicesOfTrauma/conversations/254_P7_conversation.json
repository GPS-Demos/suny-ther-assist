    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Johnson. How are you feeling today as we begin our session?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I know we're going to be discussing my experiences with workplace bullying, and it's not something I'm looking forward to reliving.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate that. It's just... every time I think about those days at the office, my stomach starts to churn. I was so excited when I started my own business, you know? I thought it would be a fresh start, away from all the corporate politics. But then...",
    "Therapist: Take your time. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Well, there was this one client. A big account. He was friends with one of my competitors, and he started spreading rumors about me. Saying I was incompetent, that I couldn't handle the work. It was like being back in high school all over again.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: It's hard to describe how it felt. Every time I walked into a meeting, I could feel eyes on me. People whispering. I started doubting myself, wondering if maybe they were right. Maybe I wasn't cut out for this. I'd wake up in the middle of the night, panicking about losing everything I'd worked so hard for.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The worst part was when I found out that some of my own employees were believing the rumors. People I'd hired, people I trusted. They started questioning my decisions, talking behind my back. I felt so betrayed, so alone. It was like the walls were closing in on me.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: I remember one day, I overheard two of my employees laughing about something. I was sure they were laughing at me. I locked myself in my office and just broke down. I couldn't stop crying. I felt like such a failure. Like maybe everyone was right, and I was just fooling myself thinking I could run a business.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: It's hard to admit, but I started having thoughts of just giving up. Selling the business, moving away. Maybe even... worse thoughts. I felt so worthless, so attacked from all sides. I couldn't see a way out. Every day felt like a battle just to get out of bed and face another day of whispers and doubts.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Remember, you're here now.",
    "Client: You're right. I am here now. It's just... reliving those moments, it brings back all those feelings of helplessness and fear. But I know I'm stronger now. I didn't give up. I fought back. I confronted the rumors, I stood up for myself. It wasn't easy, and there were days I wanted to quit, but I didn't.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. You should be proud.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard sometimes. I still have moments of doubt, moments where I wonder if I'm good enough. But then I remember how far I've come, how much I've overcome. I'm not that scared, doubting person anymore. I'm a survivor.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable strength. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... relieved, I guess. Talking about it, really facing those memories... it's hard, but it's also liberating. Like I'm finally putting it behind me. I'm not that person anymore, and those bullies don't have power over me now.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Well done.",
    "Client: It is. I think I'm starting to see that more clearly now. Yes, those experiences were terrible, and they left scars. But they also made me stronger. I learned who I could really trust, and I learned how to stand up for myself. I'm not just a victim of bullying anymore. I'm a successful business owner who overcame adversity.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent perspective. How does that feel?",
    "Client: It feels... good. Really good. Like a weight lifting off my shoulders. I know there's still work to do, and I'll probably always carry some of those experiences with me. But I feel like I can face them now, without being overwhelmed by fear or doubt.",
    "Therapist: You've made incredible progress. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. This session was tough, but I feel lighter now. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know it's not easy, but I'm starting to see the value in facing these memories head-on.",
    "Therapist: You've done wonderfully. We'll continue next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm looking forward to it. Even though it's challenging, I can feel myself getting stronger with each session. I'm grateful for your support and guidance through this process.",
    "Therapist: You're very welcome. Take care, Mrs. Johnson."
