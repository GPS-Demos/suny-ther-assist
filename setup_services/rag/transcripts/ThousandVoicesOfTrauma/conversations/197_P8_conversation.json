    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is spinning. I can still see those images, you know? The violence I witnessed... it's so vivid. My heart is racing a bit, and I feel this tightness in my chest. It's hard to shake off.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I think. No, wait... it's more like anxiety. Yes, anxiety. It's this overwhelming sense of dread, like something bad is about to happen. Even though I know I'm safe here, my body doesn't seem to believe it. My hands are a bit shaky, and I feel... exposed, vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: How does this anxiety compare to when you're dealing with cyberbullying?",
    "Client: Oh, it's... it's different, but similar in some ways. With the cyberbullying, it's more of a constant, low-level stress. But this... this feels more intense, more immediate. It's like I'm right back there, witnessing that violence all over again. The cyberbullying, it's more of a slow burn, you know? But both make me feel helpless, out of control.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"Why did this happen? Why couldn't I do something?\" And then I start questioning everything. Am I safe now? Will something like this happen again? It's... it's exhausting. And then I feel guilty for feeling this way. I mean, I wasn't even the direct victim, you know? I just witnessed it. But it's like... it's like it's happening to me all over again every time I think about it.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts impact your daily life?",
    "Client: They... they make everything harder. Simple tasks become challenging. I find myself constantly looking over my shoulder, even in safe places. It affects my work, my relationships. I've become more withdrawn, less trusting. And with the cyberbullying... it's like I can't escape. Even in my own home, I don't feel safe. My phone, my computer - they've become sources of anxiety. I feel... I feel trapped, both by my memories and by this new, digital threat.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice in your body right now?",
    "Client: My muscles are tense, especially in my shoulders and neck. I feel a knot in my stomach, and my breathing is shallow. It's like my body is preparing for something bad to happen, even though logically I know I'm safe here. And there's this... this heaviness in my chest. It's hard to explain, but it feels like a weight pressing down on me.",
    "Therapist: How does this physical response relate to your trauma?",
    "Client: I... I think it's my body remembering. When I witnessed that violence, I felt frozen, helpless. My body tensed up, ready to run but unable to move. And now, whenever I think about it, or when I face something stressful like the cyberbullying, my body reacts the same way. It's like... it's like my body is stuck in that moment, even when my mind knows I'm not there anymore.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to tell that younger version of yourself who witnessed the violence?",
    "Client: I... I'd want to hug her, to tell her it's not her fault. That she did the best she could in an impossible situation. I'd tell her that she's strong, that she'll survive this. But... but part of me also feels angry at her. Why didn't she do more? Why didn't she speak up? I know it's not rational, but those feelings are there. And then I feel guilty for being angry at myself. It's... it's a confusing mess of emotions.",
    "Therapist: How does your experience with cyberbullying connect to these feelings?",
    "Client: It's... it's like history repeating itself, in a way. I feel that same helplessness, that same inability to act. With the cyberbullying, I'm again in a position where I'm witnessing something harmful, but I feel powerless to stop it. It brings back all those old feelings of fear, guilt, and anger. And just like before, I find myself questioning why this is happening, why I can't do more to prevent it. It's like... it's like I'm trapped in a cycle, reliving my trauma in a new form.",
    "Therapist: What strength do you see in yourself for facing these memories?",
    "Client: Strength? I... I'm not sure I see any strength. But... but I guess the fact that I'm here, talking about it, that's something, right? It's not easy to confront these memories, to relive them. And with the cyberbullying, I'm trying to educate myself, to understand it better. Maybe that's a form of strength? I don't know. Sometimes it feels like I'm just barely holding on, but... but I'm still here. I'm still trying. Maybe that's strength in itself.",
    "Therapist: How can we build on that strength moving forward?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe by continuing to face these memories, even though it's hard? And perhaps by learning more about cyberbullying, finding ways to protect myself and others. I think... I think I need to work on believing that I'm not helpless, that I can make a difference, even if it's small. Maybe... maybe I could join a support group for trauma survivors or people dealing with cyberbullying? I don't know. It's scary to think about, but... but maybe that's where the strength comes in, doing it despite the fear.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you feel ready to take?",
    "Client: One small step... I think... I think I could try to be more open with my family about what I'm going through. They know I'm struggling, but I've kept a lot of it inside. Maybe... maybe sharing more with them could help. And... and maybe I could look into some online resources about cyberbullying, just to start educating myself. It's not much, but it feels like something I could manage without getting overwhelmed. Does... does that sound like a good start?",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about those ideas?",
    "Client: I feel... nervous, but also a little hopeful. It's scary to think about opening up more, but part of me feels relieved at the idea of not carrying this burden alone. And learning more about cyberbullying... it makes me feel like I'm taking some control back. It's a small step, but it feels like a step in the right direction. I'm still anxious, still scared, but... but maybe there's a glimmer of hope there too. Is that... is that normal to feel all these mixed emotions?",
    "Therapist: What does that glimmer of hope mean to you?",
    "Client: That glimmer of hope... it's like a tiny light in the darkness. It means that maybe, just maybe, things can get better. That I'm not doomed to be trapped in this cycle of fear and helplessness forever. It's fragile, and sometimes I'm afraid to trust it, but it's there. It means that even though I've been through terrible things, and I'm facing new challenges now, there's still a part of me that believes in the possibility of healing, of growth. It's... it's both comforting and terrifying. Comforting because it gives me something to hold onto, but terrifying because... what if I'm wrong? What if things don't get better? But I guess... I guess holding onto that hope, as scary as it is, is better than giving up.",
