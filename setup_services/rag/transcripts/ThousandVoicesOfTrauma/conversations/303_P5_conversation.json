    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Thompson. I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares lately, and I'm not sure if I'm ready for this.",
    "Therapist: I understand. It's natural to feel anxious. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried that talking about what happened will make everything worse. I've been trying so hard to push those memories away, and the idea of bringing them up on purpose... it's scary. Plus, I'm not sure I can handle reliving it all. What if I completely fall apart?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. Let's discuss the process and how it can help.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm listening. But I'm still not sure about this. It's just... every time I think about that day, I feel like I can't breathe. And being here alone in my apartment, sometimes those memories creep up on me, and I feel so helpless. I don't want to feel that way during our session.",
    "Therapist: I'm here to support you. Imaginal exposure helps process trauma memories safely. Shall I explain more?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I want to understand how this is supposed to help when it feels like it might just make everything worse. And... how do I know I won't get stuck in those memories?",
    "Therapist: It allows us to confront and process the trauma in a controlled environment. We'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: At my pace? That's... reassuring. But what exactly will we be doing? And how long will it take? I have exams coming up, and I'm worried about how this might affect my studies. My anxiety is already making it hard to concentrate.",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit the memory gradually. You'll describe it aloud while I guide you. It typically lasts about 30-45 minutes.",
    "Client: That sounds like a long time to be talking about something so painful. What if I can't make it through the whole session? And... will you be recording it? The thought of having that on tape makes me uncomfortable.",
    "Therapist: We can take breaks if needed. And yes, we'll record it, but only for therapeutic purposes. It's confidential.",
    "Client: I see. I guess that makes sense, but it's still nerve-wracking. Can you tell me more about how this is supposed to help with my PTSD symptoms? Because right now, it feels like it might make them worse.",
    "Therapist: Exposure helps reduce the power of traumatic memories over time. It can lessen anxiety and improve daily functioning.",
    "Client: That sounds promising. I'd love to feel more in control of my life again. But... what if I have a panic attack during the session? Sometimes when I think about what happened, I feel like I can't breathe, and my heart races.",
    "Therapist: I'll be here to help if that happens. We have techniques to manage anxiety during the session.",
    "Client: Okay, that's good to know. I appreciate your support, Dr. Thompson. I'm still scared, but I think I'm willing to try. Can you walk me through exactly what I need to do?",
    "Therapist: Of course. You'll share your experience in present tense. I'll guide you with questions. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Just... promise you'll stop if it gets too overwhelming? And... can we have a code word or something if I need a break? I want to push through, but I also want to feel like I have some control over the process.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's use \"pause\" as our code word. Your courage is admirable. Shall we start?",
    "Client: Okay. Yes, let's start. I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Thank you for being so patient with me, Dr. Thompson. Here goes..."
