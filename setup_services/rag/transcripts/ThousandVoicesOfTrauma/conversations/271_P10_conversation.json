    "Therapist: Welcome back. Today we'll be doing an imaginal exposure focusing on your refugee experiences. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. It's a bit daunting, to be honest. I've been thinking about this all week.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Let's start with your SUDS level.",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 6 or 7. My stomach feels a bit tight.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. When you're ready, close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Alright... I'm... I'm in our old apartment in Damascus. It's night, and I can hear explosions in the distance. The power is out again. My partner and I are huddled in the corner of our bedroom, whispering about whether we should leave. The air feels thick, and I can smell smoke.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. My heart is racing, and my hands are shaking. I keep thinking about all the stories we've heard of people trying to escape and... and not making it. (voice breaks) I don't want to die here, but I'm also scared of leaving everything behind.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember to breathe. What happens next?",
    "Client: We... we decide we have to go. Now. We grab the bags we've had packed for weeks, just in case. As we're about to leave, I freeze at the door. I look back at our home, all our memories, and I just... I can't move. My partner is tugging at my arm, saying we need to hurry, but I'm paralyzed.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I'm thinking about my parents. They refused to leave, said they were too old to start over. I'm wondering if I'll ever see them again. If they'll be okay. I'm... I'm feeling so guilty for leaving them behind. (starts to cry)",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: (sniffling) It's... it's probably an 8 now. My chest feels so tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. Feel your feet on the ground. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) Okay... We're on the street now. It's chaos. People are running, screaming. I can hear children crying. We're trying to make our way to the meeting point where a smuggler is supposed to take us across the border. The streets are dark, and I keep tripping over debris. I'm clutching my partner's hand so tightly, I'm afraid I might break it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: We reach the meeting point, and there's a group of about 20 people there. Everyone looks terrified. The smuggler arrives in a beat-up van. He's shouting at us to hurry, to climb in. As we're getting in, I hear a loud explosion nearby. People start panicking, pushing. I... I get separated from my partner in the chaos.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm screaming their name. I can't see them. My heart feels like it's going to burst out of my chest. I'm being pushed into the van, and I'm fighting against it, trying to find them. I'm yelling, begging the smuggler to wait, but he's shouting that we have to go now or we'll all die.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're here now, you're safe. What happens next?",
    "Client: (voice shaking) Just as the van door is closing, my partner appears. They're running towards us, and I'm reaching out, pulling them in. As soon as they're inside, the van speeds off. We're holding each other, crying. I can feel their heart pounding against my chest. I'm... I'm so relieved, but also terrified about what's to come.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My heart is racing. But... but I also feel a sense of relief, remembering that we made it out together.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's probably around a 9 now. It feels so real.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember to breathe. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) The journey is... it's horrible. We're packed in like sardines. It's hot, stuffy. People are crying, praying. I can hear children whimpering. We drive for hours, stopping occasionally to avoid checkpoints. Each time we stop, my heart leaps into my throat, thinking we've been caught.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What do you notice in your body?",
    "Client: My... my muscles are so tense. I feel nauseous. Every bump in the road makes me jump. I'm holding onto my partner's hand so tightly, but I can't let go. It's like... like if I let go, they might disappear.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: After what feels like days, we finally reach the border. The smuggler tells us we have to walk from here. It's pitch black, and we're in the middle of nowhere. We start walking, stumbling over rocks and through bushes. I can hear people panting, children crying quietly. Everyone's terrified of making too much noise.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking at this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm wondering if we made the right choice. What if we get caught? What if we die out here in the wilderness? But then I look at my partner, and I know... I know we had to try. For a chance at a life without fear.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's bittersweet. I feel a glimmer of hope, but it's overshadowed by this overwhelming fear and sadness. We're leaving everything behind, our home, our families, our entire lives.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those emotions. What happens next?",
    "Client: We walk for hours. My feet are bleeding, I can feel the blisters forming. People are starting to lag behind, but the smuggler keeps urging us on. Suddenly, we hear dogs barking in the distance. Everyone freezes. The smuggler starts shouting at us to run.",
    "Therapist: What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I grab my partner's hand, and we run. We're stumbling through the darkness, branches whipping our faces. I can hear people falling, crying out in pain. The barking is getting closer. My lungs are burning, I can't breathe, but I can't stop. If we stop, we'll be caught.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Pure terror. Adrenaline is coursing through my body. I'm in pain, I'm exhausted, but I can't stop. All I can think is \"run, run, run.\" I'm praying, begging whatever higher power might be listening to help us.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) It's... it's a 10. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Remember, you're here now, you're safe. Take a moment to ground yourself.",
    "Client: (takes several deep breaths) Okay... okay. I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: We... we keep running. I don't know how long. Eventually, the barking fades. The smuggler leads us to a hidden spot where we rest for a bit. Everyone's exhausted, terrified. As dawn breaks, we realize some people didn't make it. They got left behind in the chaos. I... I feel guilty for feeling relieved that my partner and I are still together.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have conflicting emotions. What happens next?",
    "Client: We keep moving. The smuggler says we're close to the refugee camp now. As we approach, I see the fences, the tents. It hits me that this is our new reality. We're refugees now. We made it out alive, but... but our lives will never be the same.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. I feel relief that we're alive, that we're safe for now. But I also feel an immense sadness. We've lost so much. And I'm scared about what the future holds. Will we ever have a normal life again?",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. You've been through a tremendous ordeal. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Emotionally drained. But there's also a strange sense of... I don't know, maybe catharsis? Talking about it, reliving it... it's painful, but it also feels like I'm starting to process it.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive sign. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's come down to about a 7, I think. I still feel shaky, but not as overwhelmed as before.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today. Let's take some time to ground ourselves and discuss what you've experienced.",
    "Client: Okay... yeah, that sounds good. I... I didn't realize how much I'd been holding onto all of this.",
    "Therapist: It's a lot to process. Remember, we're here to work through this together. You're not alone.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I really appreciate that. It means a lot to have someone listen and understand.",
    "Therapist: Of course. That's what I'm here for. Now, let's focus on some grounding exercises to help you transition out of this memory.",
    "Client: Alright. I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's start by focusing on your breath..."
