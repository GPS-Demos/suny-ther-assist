    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to dive into some heavy stuff today.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. From 0 to 100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: Uh, probably around a 40. My stomach's a little tight.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we can pause anytime. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I'm in this dingy apartment. It smells like cigarettes and something musty. There's peeling wallpaper, and I can hear traffic outside. I'm sitting on a worn-out couch, and there's this guy... he's pacing back and forth, looking agitated.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he starts yelling at me. Saying I didn't bring in enough money last night. My heart's racing, and I'm trying to make myself smaller on the couch. I can feel the rough fabric against my arms.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm terrified. My mouth is dry, and I can't seem to form words. I just want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 60 now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Can you describe what's happening in more detail?",
    "Client: He's getting closer to me. I can smell the alcohol on his breath. His face is red, and there's a vein pulsing in his forehead. I'm trying to explain, to apologize, but the words won't come out. Then... then he grabs my arm. It hurts. I can feel his fingers digging into my skin.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I... I try to pull away, but he's so much stronger. He yanks me off the couch, and I stumble. My knee hits the coffee table, and I cry out. But he doesn't care. He's still yelling, calling me worthless, saying I owe him.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I just want it to stop. I'm thinking about running, but I know I can't get past him. I'm trapped. I feel so helpless, so... so small.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. Where are you right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm here, in your office. On the couch.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's about 75. My heart's pounding.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Let's continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. He's dragging me towards the bedroom. I'm trying to dig my heels in, but the floor is slippery. There's beer cans everywhere. I'm begging him to stop, but it's like he can't even hear me. We get to the bedroom, and he throws me onto the bed. I bounce a little, and the springs creak. The sheets smell sour, like they haven't been washed in weeks.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What do you see?",
    "Client: He's... he's taking off his belt. I know what's coming, and I'm frozen. I can't move. I can't breathe. He raises the belt, and I flinch, covering my face with my arms. The first strike hits my back, and it's like fire. I cry out, but he doesn't stop. Again and again, the belt comes down. I'm sobbing, pleading, but he just keeps going.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's 90. I feel like I'm there again.",
    "Therapist: Remember, this is a memory. You're here, in my office. Can you feel the couch beneath you?",
    "Client: Y-yes. I can feel it.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I don't know how long it goes on. Eventually, he stops. I'm curled up in a ball, my whole body throbbing. He's breathing hard, and I can hear him pacing again. He mutters something about teaching me a lesson, about how I better not disappoint him again. Then he leaves, slamming the door behind him. I just lie there, unable to move. I can taste blood in my mouth where I bit my lip.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm so angry. At him, at myself for not fighting back. I feel ashamed, like maybe I deserved it. But I know that's not true. It wasn't my fault. It wasn't...",
    "Therapist: That's right. It wasn't your fault. How's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to about 80 now. I'm shaking a little.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're doing great. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I eventually manage to sit up. Everything hurts. I can see welts forming on my arms. I stumble to the bathroom, wincing with every step. The fluorescent light flickers as I look in the mirror. My face is tear-stained, and there's a bruise forming on my cheek where he slapped me earlier. I barely recognize myself.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking that I can't do this anymore. That I need to get out. But I'm also scared. Where would I go? What if he finds me? I feel so trapped, so hopeless.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you did get out. You're safe now.",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, I did. It's just... it feels so real right now.",
    "Therapist: I know it does. You're very brave for facing this. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's about 75 now. I'm feeling a bit calmer.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's continue.",
    "Client: I... I clean myself up as best I can. Put on a long-sleeved shirt to hide the marks. I can hear him in the other room, talking on the phone. Probably setting up... \"appointments\" for me. The thought makes me sick to my stomach. I sit on the edge of the bathtub, trying to figure out what to do. That's when I notice the small window. It's high up, but I think I could reach it if I stood on the toilet.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in that moment?",
    "Client: A mix of fear and... hope, I guess. Like maybe there's a way out after all. My heart's racing again, but it's different this time. It's like... anticipation.",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I wait. I wait until I hear him leave the apartment. Then I move quickly. I grab what little cash I can find, stuffing it in my pockets. I go to the bathroom and climb onto the toilet. The window's small, but I think I can fit. I push it open, wincing as my bruised body protests. Then I pull myself up and through. It's a tight squeeze, but I make it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Scared, but... determined. I drop down to the alley below. It hurts, but the adrenaline's pumping. I start running. I don't know where I'm going, but I know I can't stay here.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 60 now. I feel... I don't know. Relieved, I guess. Like I'm reliving the escape.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're safe now. Can you open your eyes and look around the room?",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, I'm here. In your office. It's... it's over.",
    "Therapist: Well done, Carlos. You've shown incredible strength today. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. But also... I don't know. Lighter, maybe? Like I've let something go.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after these sessions. Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to about 40 now. Back where we started, I guess.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay. Yeah, that sounds good. I... thank you. For helping me through this.",
    "Therapist: You did all the hard work, Carlos. I'm just here to guide you. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: I... I think I am. A little bit, anyway.",
    "Therapist: That's a great start. We'll pick this up next session. For now, just focus on taking care of yourself.",
    "Client: I will. Thanks again."
