    "Therapist: Welcome, James. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Sarah. I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares lately, and I'm not sure if I'm ready for this.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... the idea of reliving those moments in Afghanistan. I've spent so much time trying to forget, you know? The sounds, the smells, the fear... it's all still so vivid. I'm worried that if I start talking about it, I won't be able to stop the memories from flooding back.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are valid. How do you typically cope with intrusive memories?",
    "Client: I usually try to distract myself. I'll turn up the TV, go for a run, or call a friend. Sometimes I'll have a drink or two to numb myself. But lately, nothing seems to work as well as it used to.",
    "Therapist: I see. Today, we'll try a different approach. Are you open to that?",
    "Client: I guess so. But what exactly are we going to do? You mentioned something about imaginal exposure last time, but I'm not sure I fully understand what that means.",
    "Therapist: It's a technique to process traumatic memories. Would you like me to explain further?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I want to know what I'm getting into.",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit your combat experience in a safe environment. You'll describe it in detail while I guide you.",
    "Client: That sounds... intense. Will it make things worse? I'm already struggling to keep it together at work and home. My parents are starting to notice something's off.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel apprehensive. How do you think this might help?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe it could help me face what happened instead of running from it? But I'm scared of losing control or breaking down.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. We'll go at your pace and can stop anytime. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's a bit reassuring. I appreciate that you're not pushing me too hard. Can you tell me more about what to expect during the session?",
    "Therapist: Of course. You might experience strong emotions or physical reactions. This is normal and part of healing.",
    "Client: Okay... I think I can handle that. Will you be there to help if things get too overwhelming?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'll support you throughout. Remember, you're in control here.",
    "Client: That helps, thank you. I'm still nervous, but I think I'm ready to give this a try. How do we start?",
    "Therapist: We'll begin with a relaxation exercise. Then, you'll describe your experience while I guide you.",
    "Client: Alright. I trust you, Dr. Sarah. Let's do this. I want to get better, for myself and my family. I'm tired of feeling like I'm still at war, you know?",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is commendable. Shall we begin with the relaxation exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, I'm ready. Thank you for being patient with me and explaining everything. It really helps."
