    "Therapist: Hello, Juan. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hey, Dr. Rodriguez. I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been thinking a lot about our last session and the idea of this imaginal exposure thing. It's been making me anxious.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... I've spent so much time trying to forget about what happened during my deployment. The idea of purposely bringing those memories back feels... I don't know, counterintuitive? And scary. Plus, I'm worried about how I'll react. What if I completely lose it?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. Let's address them together.",
    "Client: Okay... I appreciate that. It's just, ever since I got back, I've been trying to keep it all bottled up. My parents don't really understand, and at work, I try to act like everything's normal. But then there are these moments where it all comes rushing back, you know? Like when I hear a car backfire or see something on the news about the Middle East. It's like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: That's exactly why imaginal exposure can help. Shall I explain how?",
    "Client: Yeah, please. I mean, I want to get better, but this feels like a big step.",
    "Therapist: It involves revisiting memories in a safe environment. We'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: A safe environment... that's good to hear. But what exactly will we be doing? And how long will it take? I'm worried about getting overwhelmed and not being able to pull myself back together before I have to go home or to work.",
    "Therapist: We'll start with one memory. You'll describe it in detail, present tense.",
    "Client: In the present tense? Like it's happening right now? That sounds... intense. Will you be guiding me through it? And what if I start to panic or feel like it's too much?",
    "Therapist: I'll be here to support you. We can pause anytime you need.",
    "Client: Okay, that's reassuring. I guess I'm just worried about opening this can of worms, you know? Like, once I start talking about it, will I be able to stop? And what about afterwards? Will I be okay to drive home, or should I ask my parents to pick me up?",
    "Therapist: You'll have time to process and ground yourself before leaving. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That sounds good. I appreciate you taking the time to explain all this to me. It's still scary, but I feel a bit more prepared now. I just hope this really helps with the nightmares and the constant feeling of being on edge. It's been affecting my work, and I really want to move out of my parents' place soon, but I feel stuck.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. This is a crucial step towards healing.",
    "Client: Thanks, Dr. Rodriguez. I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Can you just... can you walk me through what we'll do one more time? Just so I'm clear on the process?",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll choose a memory, you'll describe it, and we'll process it together.",
    "Client: Okay. And you'll be there the whole time, right? To help me if it gets too intense or if I start to feel overwhelmed?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'll be here throughout. Your safety is my priority.",
    "Client: Alright. I think I'm ready to give this a try. It's not going to be easy, but if it helps me move forward and deal with this PTSD, then it's worth it. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's begin when you're comfortable. Take a deep breath."
