    "Therapist: Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm honestly quite nervous. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of reliving that hostage situation... it makes my heart race just thinking about it. I'm not sure I'm ready for this.",
    "Therapist: Your anxiety is understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried that revisiting those memories will be too overwhelming. What if I panic? Or what if it brings back the nightmares I've been having? I've worked so hard to keep those thoughts at bay, and now you're asking me to face them head-on. It feels counterintuitive and, frankly, a bit scary.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your honesty. How do you think this exercise might help?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe it could help me process what happened? I've heard that facing fears can sometimes make them less powerful. But it's hard to imagine how reliving such a terrifying experience could be beneficial. Could you explain a bit more about why we're doing this?",
    "Therapist: Certainly. Imaginal exposure helps process trauma memories, reducing their impact over time. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: I see. That makes sense in theory, but I'm still apprehensive. How long will this take? And what exactly will I need to do? Will I need to close my eyes and describe everything in detail? The thought of that makes me feel quite vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. You'll describe the event, eyes open or closed. I'll guide you throughout. Any other concerns?",
    "Client: Yes, actually. What if I get too emotional or can't continue? And afterward, how will I deal with any lingering feelings? I'm worried about going home and being a mess, especially since my husband doesn't fully understand what I'm going through with this therapy.",
    "Therapist: We can pause anytime. We'll also discuss coping strategies for after the session. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's somewhat reassuring. I appreciate your patience with all my questions. I guess I'm just trying to prepare myself mentally for what's to come. It's a big step, and while I understand the potential benefits, it's still daunting. Can you tell me a bit more about what you've seen with other clients who've gone through this process?",
    "Therapist: Many clients find relief and reduced symptoms over time. Your courage is commendable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Okay, I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Thank you for explaining everything and addressing my concerns. It helps to know that others have found this beneficial. I'm still nervous, but I trust you and the process. Let's do this. Where should I start?",
    "Therapist: Start by describing where you were when the hostage situation began. Take your time.",
    "Client: Alright. I was at the bank, just a routine visit on a Tuesday afternoon. It was busy, with several people in line. I remember feeling impatient because I had a meeting later. Then suddenly, there was shouting, and I heard what sounded like a gunshot. Everything happened so fast after that...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you saw and heard.",
    "Client: The noise was deafening. People were screaming and ducking for cover. I saw two men with masks, one waving a gun. My heart was pounding so hard I could barely breathe. I remember the smell of gunpowder and someone's perfume. It was surreal, like a nightmare but I couldn't wake up...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. How were you feeling in that moment?",
    "Client: Terrified. Absolutely terrified. My legs felt weak, and I thought I might faint. I remember thinking about my family, wondering if I'd see them again. The fear was paralyzing, but at the same time, my mind was racing, trying to figure out what to do, how to survive..."
