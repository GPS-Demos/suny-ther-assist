    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the hostage situation you experienced?",
    "Client: Okay... I was at the hospital for a routine checkup when suddenly there was commotion. A man burst into the waiting room waving a gun. He was shouting about how the hospital had killed his wife. Everyone was terrified. He made us all huddle in the corner while he ranted and threatened the staff. I remember feeling my heart racing, thinking this might be how I die.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: The man was becoming increasingly agitated. He kept pacing back and forth, occasionally pointing the gun at us. I could hear people crying softly. The air felt thick with fear. I remember thinking about my late partner, wondering if I'd see them soon. Then, a nurse tried to reason with him. He grabbed her and held the gun to her head. I felt frozen, helpless.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What were you feeling?",
    "Client: I... I felt utterly powerless. My chest was so tight I could barely breathe. I wanted to help her, but I was paralyzed with fear. The nurse was trembling, and I could see tears streaming down her face. I felt guilty for not doing anything, but I was so scared.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: The standoff seemed to last forever. Police sirens were wailing outside, adding to the chaos. The man was becoming more erratic, shouting about how no one understood his pain. I remember thinking about my grandchildren, wondering if I'd ever see them again. The fear was overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there was a loud bang. At first, I thought he had shot someone, but it was a flash grenade. Everything happened so fast after that. Police stormed in, there was shouting, and the man was tackled to the ground. I remember feeling disoriented, my ears ringing from the noise. People were rushing past me, but I couldn't move. I just sat there, shaking uncontrollably.",
    "Therapist: How did you feel once it was over?",
    "Client: I... I felt relieved, but also numb. A paramedic came to check on me, but I couldn't speak. I just kept staring at where the man had been standing. It didn't feel real. Even after I got home, I couldn't shake the feeling of vulnerability. I kept replaying the scene in my mind, wondering what I could have done differently. The guilt and fear... they stayed with me for a long time.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to feel that way. You survived a traumatic event.",
    "Client: Yes, I suppose I did. But it changed me. I became hyper-vigilant, always scanning for danger. I couldn't go to hospitals without having panic attacks. I felt ashamed of my reaction, like I should have been braver. It's been hard to reconcile the person I thought I was with how I acted that day.",
    "Therapist: Your reactions were normal. You're showing courage by facing this memory.",
    "Client: Thank you. It helps to hear that. I've never told anyone the full story before. It's hard to relive it, but I also feel a strange sense of relief. Like I'm finally acknowledging what happened instead of trying to push it away. I just wish I could let go of the guilt and fear.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. We'll work on that together.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's still difficult to think about, especially the moments when I thought I might die. The fear was so intense, unlike anything I'd ever experienced. I remember looking at the other hostages, seeing the same terror in their eyes. It made me realize how fragile life is, how quickly everything can change.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job processing these difficult memories.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard, but I think it's helping. I've carried this burden for so long, always worried that something like that could happen again. I want to be able to go to a hospital without reliving that day. I want to feel safe again. But it's been a long journey, and sometimes I wonder if I'll ever fully recover.",
    "Therapist: Recovery is possible. You're taking important steps right now.",
    "Client: I hope so. I'm trying to be patient with myself, but it's challenging. Sometimes I have nightmares about that day, or I'll hear a loud noise and suddenly I'm back in that waiting room. But being able to talk about it like this, it feels like I'm reclaiming some control. Like I'm not letting that experience define me anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also a bit lighter. It's still painful to remember, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming as it used to. I think I'm starting to understand that my reactions were normal, that I'm not weak for being affected by it. It's a strange mix of exhaustion and hope.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response after processing trauma. Well done today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm grateful for your guidance through this. It's not easy, but I think I'm starting to see a way forward. I know there's still a lot of work to do, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I might be able to move past this eventually. It's a small step, but it feels significant.",
    "Therapist: It is significant. You've shown great courage today.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I'm trying to be kinder to myself, to acknowledge the progress I'm making. It's a slow process, but sessions like this help me see that change is possible. I'm looking forward to continuing this work, even though I know it won't always be easy. Thank you for creating a safe space for me to confront these memories.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue working together at your pace."
