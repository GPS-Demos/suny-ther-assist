    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit nervous about today's session, to be honest.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We're here to support you.",
    "Client: Thanks. I appreciate that. I've been thinking a lot about what we discussed last time, about my divorce and how it's bringing up memories of... of the abuse.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for addressing this. Are you ready to explore those memories?",
    "Client: I think so. It's just... it's hard, you know? But I want to try.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. We'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: Okay. Well, I remember being about 12 years old. It was summer, and I was staying at my uncle's house. He... he always seemed so nice, you know? But that night, he came into the guest room where I was sleeping. I can still smell the alcohol on his breath.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: He... he sat on the edge of the bed. I pretended to be asleep, but I was terrified. I could feel my heart pounding. He started... he started touching me. I wanted to scream, to run away, but I couldn't move. I felt frozen.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) I... I can't. It's too much. I feel like I'm back there again.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're here, in the present.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay. I... I remember feeling so ashamed afterward. Like it was my fault somehow. And now, with the divorce, I feel that same shame. Like I've failed again.",
    "Therapist: You haven't failed. You're incredibly strong.",
    "Client: Am I? Sometimes I don't feel strong at all. Especially when I think about how this has affected my relationships. My wife... ex-wife... she never knew. I couldn't tell her. And now our marriage is over, and I feel like it's because I couldn't be open, couldn't be vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Stay with them.",
    "Client: It's just... it's all connected, you know? The abuse, the secrecy, the divorce. I've spent my whole life trying to be this successful, put-together professional. But inside, I feel like that scared 12-year-old boy.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage right now.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's hard to feel courageous. I keep thinking about my kids. They're adults now, but I worry about how the divorce will affect them. And I'm terrified of them ever finding out about the abuse. What if they look at me differently?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are natural. Keep exploring those thoughts.",
    "Client: I just... I want to be a good father. A good person. But I feel like I'm carrying this darkness inside me. And now, with the divorce, it's like everything I've built is crumbling. I'm 70 years old, and I feel like I'm starting over. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this incredibly well.",
    "Client: Am I? Sometimes I feel like I'm barely holding it together. The depression doesn't help. There are days when I can barely get out of bed. And then I feel guilty for feeling that way. I should be stronger, right?",
    "Therapist: You're stronger than you realize. Continue.",
    "Client: I guess... I guess I'm just scared. Scared of being alone, scared of facing these memories, scared of what the future holds. But being here, talking about it... it helps. Even though it's painful, it feels like I'm finally starting to face things I've been running from my whole life.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. You should be proud.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to feel proud, but I'm trying. I know this is just the beginning of a long journey. But for the first time in a long time, I feel like maybe, just maybe, there's hope. That I can work through this, that I can heal.",
    "Therapist: You're on the right path. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted, honestly. But also... lighter, somehow. Like I've set down a burden I've been carrying for too long. It's scary, but it's also... freeing, in a way.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. We'll end here for today.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you. This... this means a lot to me. I know it's your job, but... thank you for listening, for helping me face this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, John. See you next week."
