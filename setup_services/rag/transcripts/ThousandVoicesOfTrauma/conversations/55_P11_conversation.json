    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. Reliving that earthquake was... it was intense. My heart's still racing a bit. I can almost feel the ground moving beneath me, even though I know I'm safe here.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sound. Oh, the sound was terrible. It was like the world was being torn apart. I remember holding onto my grandson so tightly, thinking we might be swallowed up at any moment. And the fear... the sheer terror of not knowing if we'd make it out alive. It's all so vivid now.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to revisit that memory?",
    "Client: It's... it's difficult, but also... I don't know, maybe a little liberating? For so long, I've tried to push these memories away. But facing them head-on, it's like I'm finally acknowledging what happened. It's scary, but also... empowering, in a strange way.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How does this connect to your daily life?",
    "Client: Well, I've been so anxious since the earthquake. Always on edge, waiting for the next disaster. But going through this memory, I realize I survived. We made it through. Maybe... maybe I'm stronger than I give myself credit for.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. What else?",
    "Client: I've been avoiding anything that reminds me of earthquakes. News reports, movies with natural disasters, even tall buildings make me nervous. But talking about it like this... it's hard, but it's making me think maybe I don't need to be so afraid all the time.",
    "Therapist: How might that change things for you?",
    "Client: I... I could start doing things again. Maybe visit my daughter in the city without panicking. Or watch the news without having a breakdown. It would be nice to feel... normal again. To not let this fear control every aspect of my life.",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. How are you feeling about continuing?",
    "Client: It's challenging, no doubt. There are moments when I want to run away from these memories. But... I also see a glimmer of hope. Like maybe, just maybe, I can reclaim my life from this fear. It's worth it, isn't it? To keep trying, even when it's hard?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Your courage is commendable. Anything else?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm starting to understand why you have me do this. It's not just about reliving the trauma, is it? It's about... processing it. Making sense of it. And maybe, in time, making peace with it. I never thought that would be possible, but now... I'm beginning to hope it might be.",
    "Therapist: That's a profound observation. How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Hopeful, I suppose. And a little scared. But mostly... determined. I want my life back. I want to be able to enjoy time with my family without this constant fear looming over me. It won't be easy, but I think... I think I'm ready to keep working at this.",
    "Therapist: That's fantastic. What's one small step you can take?",
    "Client: Well... maybe I could try watching a mild weather report this week. Just a short one. And use some of those breathing techniques we've practiced if I start to feel anxious. It's a small step, but it's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. It's a great start. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. Thank you for guiding me through this. It's tough, but I'm starting to see that it's worth it. I'm... I'm actually looking forward to our next session. Is that strange?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It shows progress. Take care, Mrs. Johnson.",
    "Client: Thank you, Doctor. I will. See you next week."
