    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is still tense, you know? My heart's racing a bit, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. The memory of that dog attack... it's so vivid. I can still hear the growling, see the bared teeth. It's like I'm right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. I was just frozen, watching this huge dog maul that poor cat. I... I should've done something, anything. But I couldn't move. I feel so ashamed, like I'm a coward. And then I think, what if it had been a person? What if it had been me? I don't know if I could've handled that.",
    "Therapist: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of guilt. How does that feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like this heavy weight in my stomach. I feel nauseous, honestly. And my shoulders are so tense, like I'm bracing for something. I keep replaying the scene in my head, thinking of all the things I could've done differently. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about those thoughts?",
    "Client: I... I guess they're not very rational, are they? I mean, logically, I know I couldn't have done much. I was just a kid, and it happened so fast. But emotionally, it's like I can't shake this feeling that I failed somehow. It's frustrating because I know better, but I can't seem to convince myself.",
    "Therapist: How does recognizing that difference make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... confusing, I guess. Part of me feels a bit relieved, like maybe I'm not as terrible as I thought. But there's still this nagging doubt. I wonder if I've always been this way, you know? Freezing up when things get tough. It makes me worried about the future, about how I'd react in a crisis now.",
    "Therapist: Can you tell me more about that worry?",
    "Client: Well, I'm married now, and we're thinking about having kids. What if something happened and I couldn't protect them? The thought terrifies me. I want to be strong for my family, but this memory... it makes me doubt myself. I've never really talked about this before, and now that I am, I'm realizing how much it's affected me.",
    "Therapist: What's it like to share these feelings?",
    "Client: It's... liberating, in a way. But also scary. I feel vulnerable, like I'm exposing a part of myself I've kept hidden for so long. But there's also this tiny sense of relief, you know? Like maybe by talking about it, I can start to process it better. I just hope I can learn to forgive myself someday.",
    "Therapist: How would forgiving yourself look like to you?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. I guess it would mean accepting that I did the best I could in that situation. Maybe recognizing that being scared doesn't make me weak or a coward. It's hard to imagine, though. I've carried this guilt for so long, it's almost become a part of me. But I want to let it go. I want to be able to think about that day without feeling this overwhelming shame and fear.",
    "Therapist: What small step could you take towards that?",
    "Client: Hmm... Maybe... maybe I could try to be kinder to myself when I remember that day. Instead of immediately jumping to self-blame, I could try to remind myself that I was just a kid, that it wasn't my fault. It sounds simple, but it feels really challenging. Is that... is that a good place to start?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful approach. How does it feel to consider that?",
    "Client: It feels... hopeful, I think. A little scary too, like I'm letting go of something I've held onto for so long. But also like a weight might be lifting. I've spent so much energy beating myself up over this, maybe it's time to try something different. I just hope I can actually do it when those memories and feelings come up.",
    "Therapist: What might help you remember to be kind to yourself in those moments?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe I could set a reminder on my phone? Or write myself a note and keep it somewhere I'll see it often. I could even talk to my wife about it. She's always been supportive, and maybe having her remind me would help. It's strange to think about actively changing how I react to this memory, but I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: That's a big step. How are you feeling now, as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've released something that's been bottled up for a long time. I'm nervous about trying to change my thought patterns, but I also feel a glimmer of hope. Thank you for guiding me through this. It wasn't easy, but I think it was important.",
    "Therapist: You've shown a lot of courage today. We'll continue working on this next session."
