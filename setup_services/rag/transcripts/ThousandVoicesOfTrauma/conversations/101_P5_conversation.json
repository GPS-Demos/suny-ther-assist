    "Therapist: Welcome, [Client's name]. Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm honestly pretty nervous. I've been dreading this all week. The idea of reliving that earthquake... it's terrifying. I can already feel my heart racing just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Your anxiety is understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried that talking about it will make me feel like I'm right back there. What if I panic? Or what if I can't handle it and have to stop? I don't want to disappoint you or waste our time.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How can I support you today?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. Maybe... could you explain why we're doing this again? And what exactly is going to happen? I think knowing more might help me feel a bit more in control.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Imaginal exposure helps process trauma memories. We'll revisit the event safely. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Okay, that makes sense. Um, how long will we be doing this for? And what if I start to feel overwhelmed? Can we take breaks?",
    "Therapist: We'll go for about 30-45 minutes. Breaks are okay. Your safety is priority. Anything else?",
    "Client: That's helpful to know. I guess I'm also wondering... will this actually help? It seems counterintuitive to deliberately think about something I've been trying so hard to forget.",
    "Therapist: Great question. Facing memories reduces their power over time. Your bravery is commendable.",
    "Client: Thanks, that helps me feel a bit better about it. I'm still nervous, but I trust you. I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Where do we start?",
    "Therapist: We'll start slowly. Close your eyes when ready. Describe the day of the earthquake.",
    "Client: Okay... *deep breath* I'll try. It was a Tuesday morning. I was in my dorm room, getting ready for class. The sky was overcast, and it was unusually quiet outside. I remember thinking it might rain later...",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: I was packing my backpack when I felt a slight tremor. At first, I thought it was just a truck passing by. But then it got stronger. The floor started to shake, and my desk lamp fell over. I could hear people shouting in the hallway...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My heart's racing, and my palms are sweaty. It's like I'm right back there. But... I'm okay. I can keep going if that's alright?",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. We can pause if needed. Continue when ready.",
    "Client: Thanks. *takes a deep breath* Okay. As the shaking got worse, I tried to get under my desk, but I stumbled and hit my head on the corner. I could hear glass breaking and things falling all around me. The noise was deafening..."
