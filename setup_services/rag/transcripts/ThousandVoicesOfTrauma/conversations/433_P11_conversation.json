    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) It's... it's a lot to process. I feel drained, but also kind of relieved? I didn't expect to remember so many details about that day at the refugee camp. The smells, the sounds... it all came flooding back.",
    "Therapist: What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: (Pauses, thinking) The overwhelming sense of helplessness. I remember watching the aid workers, how they seemed so busy and important. And there I was, just... waiting. Hoping someone would notice us, help us. It felt like we were invisible.",
    "Therapist: How did that feeling compare to now?",
    "Client: (Sighs) It's different now, but sometimes... sometimes I still feel that way. Like I'm still waiting for someone to really see me, you know? But it's not as intense. I have more control now, I think.",
    "Therapist: What helped you feel more in control?",
    "Client: (Thoughtfully) I guess... time? And learning to speak up for myself. It wasn't easy at first, but I realized no one was going to fight for me if I didn't start doing it myself.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it relate to your PTSD symptoms?",
    "Client: (Nods slowly) I see the connection now. When I have flashbacks or feel anxious, it's like I'm back in that helpless state. But reminding myself that I have agency now... it helps ground me. It's still hard, though. Sometimes the pain in my body makes me feel trapped again.",
    "Therapist: How did your body react during the exposure?",
    "Client: (Shifts in her seat) I noticed my shoulders tensing up, and my chronic pain flared a bit. It's like my body remembers too, you know? But I used those breathing techniques we practiced, and it helped some.",
    "Therapist: Good. What else did you notice?",
    "Client: (Thoughtfully) I realized how much anger I still carry. Not just at the situation, but at myself for not doing more. I know it's not rational, but it's there.",
    "Therapist: How might you address that anger?",
    "Client: (Sighs) I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe I need to forgive myself? It's easier said than done, though.",
    "Therapist: It's a process. What's one small step you could take?",
    "Client: (Pauses) I could... try writing a letter to my younger self. Tell her it wasn't her fault. That she did the best she could.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent idea. How do you feel about continuing these exposures?",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) They're tough, but... I can see how they're helping. I feel like I'm finally facing these memories instead of running from them. It's scary, but also... empowering, in a way.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad you find it helpful. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: (Nods) Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone witness this journey, you know? Sometimes I worry I'm not making progress fast enough, but then I look back and realize how far I've come.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: (Smiles slightly) Yes, I think so. I'm exhausted, but in a good way. Like I've done something important. I'll keep practicing those grounding techniques we talked about.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Take care, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. See you then."
