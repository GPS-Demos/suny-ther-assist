    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not really sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also kind of blank at the same time. My heart is still pounding pretty hard. I can feel this tightness in my chest, you know? It's like I'm right back there again, in that moment.",
    "Therapist: What's the most prominent emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I think. No, maybe more like... dread? It's this overwhelming sense that something terrible is about to happen. Even though I know I'm safe here, my body feels like it's on high alert. My palms are sweaty, and I keep wanting to look over my shoulder.",
    "Therapist: How does that feeling compare to what you experienced during the actual event?",
    "Client: It's... it's really similar, actually. During the combat, there was this constant tension, like a rubber band stretched to its limit. You never knew when it might snap. I feel that same tension now, like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep replaying the scene in my head. The sounds of gunfire, the smell of smoke... it's all so vivid. I'm thinking about how young we all were, how unprepared we felt. And then there's this voice in the back of my head saying, \"You should've done more. You should've been better prepared.\"",
    "Therapist: How do those thoughts make you feel?",
    "Client: Guilty, I guess. And angry. Angry at the situation, angry at myself. But also... helpless? Like no matter what I did, it wouldn't have been enough. It's frustrating because part of me knows that's not true, but I can't shake the feeling.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice in your body as you express these feelings?",
    "Client: My shoulders are really tense. I just realized I've been clenching my jaw this whole time. There's this knot in my stomach, too. It's like my whole body is bracing for impact.",
    "Therapist: How does talking about this now compare to when you first returned from deployment?",
    "Client: It's... it's different. Back then, I couldn't talk about it at all. I'd just shut down or get angry if anyone tried to bring it up. Now, it's still hard, but I can actually put words to what I'm feeling. It's like I'm starting to see it from the outside, if that makes sense?",
    "Therapist: What's that experience like for you?",
    "Client: It's weird. Kind of scary, but also... I don't know, maybe a little liberating? Like, for so long this stuff was just this big, dark cloud in my head. Now it's starting to take shape. Don't get me wrong, it still hurts like hell to think about, but at least now I can start to understand it.",
    "Therapist: How does this understanding affect your view of your experiences?",
    "Client: I guess... I'm starting to see that what happened wasn't my fault. I mean, I still feel responsible in some ways, but I'm beginning to realize that I was just a kid thrown into an impossible situation. It doesn't make it okay, but it helps me make sense of why I reacted the way I did.",
    "Therapist: What does that realization mean for you moving forward?",
    "Client: I... I'm not entirely sure. Part of me feels like maybe I can start to forgive myself a little. But then there's this other part that's scared to let go of the guilt, you know? Like, if I forgive myself, I'm somehow betraying the others or forgetting what happened.",
    "Therapist: How might you balance remembering with moving forward?",
    "Client: That's tough. I guess... maybe it's about honoring what happened without letting it define me? Like, I can remember and respect the experience and the people involved, but also work on building a life that isn't completely overshadowed by it. It's just... it's hard to imagine what that looks like.",
    "Therapist: What small step could you take towards that balance?",
    "Client: Hmm... Maybe I could start by talking to some of the guys from my unit. Not necessarily about what happened, but just... reconnecting, you know? See how they're doing, maybe share some of the good memories too. It's scary to think about, but it might help me feel less alone in this.",
    "Therapist: How does the idea of taking that step make you feel?",
    "Client: Nervous, definitely. There's a part of me that's worried they'll judge me or think I'm weak for struggling. But there's also a tiny bit of hope there. Like, maybe they're going through similar things and we could support each other. It's a small thing, but it feels like it could be a start.",
    "Therapist: What strengths have you discovered in yourself through this process?",
    "Client: I... I guess I'm more resilient than I thought. There were times when I didn't think I'd make it through this, but here I am, still fighting. And maybe I'm braver than I give myself credit for. It takes guts to face this stuff head-on, right? I'm also learning that I'm capable of change, of growth. That's something I didn't believe before.",
    "Therapist: How might these strengths help you moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I think they give me hope. If I've made it this far, maybe I can keep going. Maybe I can use that resilience to build a life that isn't defined by trauma. And the bravery... well, I guess that's what's going to help me take those small steps we talked about. It's scary, but I'm starting to believe I can do it.",
    "Therapist: What's one thing you want to remember from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I want to remember that it's okay to feel all these things. The fear, the guilt, the anger - they're all part of the process. But I also want to remember that I'm more than just my trauma. I'm still here, still fighting, and that counts for something. It's a long road ahead, but maybe, just maybe, I'm strong enough to walk it.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. How are you feeling as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, to be honest. Emotionally drained. But there's also this weird sense of... I don't know, maybe relief? Like I've set down a heavy backpack I've been carrying for miles. I know I'll have to pick it up again, but for now, it feels good to rest. Thank you for listening and guiding me through this. It means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Take care of yourself."
