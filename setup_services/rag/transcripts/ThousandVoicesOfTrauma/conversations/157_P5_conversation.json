    "Therapist: Hello Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Thompson. I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares about the car accident lately, and I'm not sure I'm ready to talk about it in detail.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Your feelings are valid. Shall we discuss the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: Yes, I suppose we should. But can you explain it to me again? I'm still not entirely sure what it involves or why we're doing it. It sounds scary, to be honest.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Imaginal exposure helps process trauma memories. It may be challenging but can reduce PTSD symptoms. What concerns you most?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried that talking about the accident in detail will make me feel like I'm reliving it all over again. I've been trying so hard to avoid thinking about it, and now you want me to describe it in vivid detail? It feels counterintuitive and frightening.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are common. The goal is to process memories safely. We'll go at your pace. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's somewhat reassuring, I guess. But what if I have a panic attack while we're doing it? Or what if it makes my nightmares worse? I'm already struggling to sleep as it is.",
    "Therapist: I'll be here to support you throughout. We can pause anytime. Temporary distress may occur, but it often decreases with practice.",
    "Client: Okay, that makes sense. I appreciate your support. Can you tell me more about what exactly I'll need to do during this imaginal exposure? And how long will it last?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the accident in present tense. We'll start with 30 minutes, adjusting as needed. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: Thirty minutes sounds like a long time to talk about something so distressing. But I suppose if it's going to help, I should try. Will you guide me through it or do I just... start talking?",
    "Therapist: I'll guide you with questions. We'll focus on sensory details and emotions. Remember, you're in control. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm still nervous, but I trust you, Dr. Thompson. And I really want to get better, to stop having these nightmares and flashbacks. If this will help, then I'm willing to try it.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable, Sarah. Let's start slowly. Close your eyes when ready.",
    "Client: Okay, I'm closing my eyes now. My heart is racing a bit, but I'm trying to stay calm. What should I do next?",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Imagine you're in the car. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see the road ahead. It's getting dark, and there's a light rain. The windshield wipers are moving back and forth. I can see the headlights of oncoming cars..."
