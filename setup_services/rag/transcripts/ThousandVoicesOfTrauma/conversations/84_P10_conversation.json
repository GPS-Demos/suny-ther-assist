    "Therapist: Good morning, Mr. Singh. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Ah, well... to be honest, I'm feeling a bit uneasy. You know, talking about the flood... it's not easy. But I suppose we have to face these things, don't we?",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's start slowly. Can you close your eyes and describe where you are at the beginning of the memory?",
    "Client: Right, okay. I'm... I'm in my shop. It's early morning, just before opening time. The air feels heavy, you know? Like it's pressing down on me. There's this... this smell. Damp and earthy. I can hear the rain outside, it's been going on for days now.",
    "Therapist: Good. What are you doing in the shop?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm checking the inventory. Trying to keep my mind off the weather. But I keep glancing out the window. The street... it's starting to flood. Water's creeping up the curb. My heart's racing a bit now.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Oh, I'd say... maybe a 40? It's uncomfortable, but I can manage.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath and continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: The... the water's rising faster now. I can see it seeping under the door. I'm panicking, trying to move things off the floor. My hands are shaking. I... I can't think straight. All those years of work, my livelihood... it's all at risk.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. It's hard to breathe. I... I feel so helpless. Like when I was a child and my parents... they... they'd leave me alone for days. No one to turn to, no one to help.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're safe here. How high is your distress now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 60, I think.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Take another deep breath. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I'm trying to call my wife, but the lines are down. The water's up to my ankles now. I can hear things crashing outside. I'm... I'm terrified. I feel so alone, just like when I was a boy. I... I don't know what to do.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. You're safe here, Mr. Singh.",
    "Client: (voice shaking) The... the water's rising so fast. I can see my stock floating. Years of hard work... gone. I feel... I feel like I'm drowning, not just in water, but in despair. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 75. This is... this is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going. What happens as the water continues to rise?",
    "Client: I... I realize I need to get out. The water's up to my waist now. I'm wading through the shop, trying to reach the door. But it's stuck. I'm... I'm trapped. I start shouting for help, but I can't hear anything over the roar of the water. I'm... I'm so scared. I think I might die here.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. You're safe here in the office.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) Right, yes. I'm... I'm here. It's just... it feels so real.",
    "Therapist: I know. You're doing well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay. I... I manage to force the door open. The street's like a river now. I can see other people, clinging to whatever they can. I start wading towards higher ground. The current's so strong. I... I slip, go under for a moment. I come up spluttering, terrified. I've never felt so helpless, so... so small.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's at 85. I can feel my heart pounding.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you survived this. You're here now, safe. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I manage to grab onto a lamppost. I'm holding on for dear life. I can see... I can see people being swept away. I want to help, but I can't. I'm just... I'm just trying to survive. The water keeps rising. I'm so cold, so tired. I think... I think I might let go.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling hopeless. Like everything I've worked for, everything I am, is being washed away. I'm... I'm remembering all those times as a child when I felt abandoned, worthless. It's all coming back.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Mr. Singh. How high is your distress now?",
    "Client: It's... it's at 90. I feel like I can hardly breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here now. You survived.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Yes... yes, I did survive. I... I held on. For hours, I held on. The rain finally stopped. The water started to recede. I was... I was exhausted, cold, terrified. But I was alive.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You made it through. What happened next?",
    "Client: As... as the water went down, I could see the destruction. My shop... it was ruined. Everything was gone. I felt... I felt so lost. But then... then I saw my wife. She'd been searching for me. When we found each other, we just... we just held each other and cried.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm at about 70. It's... it's hard to remember, but... but I also feel a bit... proud? I survived. We survived.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You showed incredible strength. How do you feel about that now?",
    "Client: I... I never thought of it that way. I've always focused on what I lost. But... but you're right. I did show strength. I... I didn't give up.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. You persevered. Let's take a moment to acknowledge that.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Yes... yes, I did. I made it through. And... and we rebuilt. It was hard, but we did it.",
    "Therapist: You did. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm down to about 50. It's still hard to think about, but... but it doesn't feel as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's take a few deep breaths together.",
    "Client: (breathing deeply) Thank you. This... this wasn't easy, but I think... I think it helped.",
    "Therapist: You did excellent work today, Mr. Singh. How do you feel about what we've accomplished?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel drained, but also... lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after these sessions. You've shown great courage today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without falling apart. But... but I did it.",
    "Therapist: Yes, you did. And that's a significant step. How would you like to end our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to sit quietly for a moment. Just... just to let it all settle.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take all the time you need. When you're ready, we can discuss how you're feeling and plan for our next session.",
    "Client: (after a pause) Okay. I'm... I'm ready. I think... I think I'd like to continue with this. It's hard, but... but I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. We'll continue at your pace. For now, let's talk about some coping strategies you can use between sessions."
