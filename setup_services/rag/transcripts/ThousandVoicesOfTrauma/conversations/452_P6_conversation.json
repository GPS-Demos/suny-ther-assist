    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Can you describe the moment when the natural disaster started?",
    "Client: Okay... I remember it was early morning. The sky was dark, and there was this eerie silence. Then, suddenly, the ground started shaking. It was like... like the earth was angry. I could hear things falling and breaking in the house.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: The shaking got worse. I could hear my parents shouting, trying to get to me. I was frozen in my bed, paralyzed with fear. The walls were cracking, and I thought the roof might collapse on us.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My heart's racing a bit. Maybe a 6 out of 10 now.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. What happened next?",
    "Client: We managed to get outside, but it was chaos. People were screaming, buildings were collapsing. The ground kept shaking, and I remember thinking, \"This is it. We're all going to die.\"",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's getting higher. Probably an 8 now. I can feel my palms sweating.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep going if you can.",
    "Client: We huddled together in an open area. The aftershocks kept coming. I saw a building collapse nearby, and I heard people trapped inside. I felt so helpless, so scared. We had nothing but the clothes on our backs.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I... I'm shaking a bit. My chest feels tight. It's a 9 now.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great. What happened after that?",
    "Client: We spent days in makeshift shelters. No food, no clean water. The smell of dust and... and death was everywhere. I kept having nightmares, reliving the quake over and over.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 8.5? I feel nauseous thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're processing difficult memories. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Eventually, aid workers came. But our home, our community... everything was gone. We had to leave, become refugees. I felt so lost, so angry at the world. Why did this happen to us?",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm crying. But it feels different. Like a release. Maybe a 7 now?",
    "Therapist: That's good. Let those emotions out. What else do you remember?",
    "Client: The refugee camp was tough. But there was a sense of community. We all shared this terrible experience. Slowly, we started to rebuild our lives. It was hard, but we survived.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's coming down. Maybe a 5 now. I feel... I feel stronger, thinking about how we got through it.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible resilience. How do you feel about the experience now?",
    "Client: It's still painful, but... I realize how strong we were. How strong I am. It's like a 3 now. I feel... almost proud of surviving.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful progress. Let's take a moment to breathe.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I never thought I could talk about this without falling apart.",
    "Therapist: You've done amazingly well. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... lighter somehow. Like I've let go of something heavy.",
    "Therapist: That's often how it feels. We'll end here for today. Well done."
