    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, John?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's a lot to process, you know? Reliving that moment when I witnessed the car accident... it's like I was right back there on that street corner. The screeching tires, the sound of metal crumpling, the screams... it all felt so real again. My heart's still racing a bit, to be honest.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. Watching it unfold and feeling like there was nothing I could do to stop it. I keep thinking about the young woman in the blue car. Her face... the look of terror just before impact. It haunts me. I wonder if I could have done something, anything, to prevent it or at least help more afterward.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. Scary, but also... I don't know, maybe a little cathartic? I've avoided thinking about it for so long. Talking about it, really allowing myself to remember... it's painful, but there's also a sense of... release, I suppose? Like I'm finally confronting something I've been running from.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant insight, John. How does this connect to your daily life?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... I've been avoiding a lot of things, haven't I? Not just memories, but situations that remind me of the accident. Busy intersections, the sound of sirens... even watching certain TV shows. It's like I've been living in this bubble, trying to protect myself. But in doing so, I've cut myself off from so much. My kids have been asking me to visit more, but I always make excuses. The thought of driving long distances... it terrifies me.",
    "Therapist: What do you make of that connection?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm realizing how much this has controlled my life. It's not just about that one memory, is it? It's seeped into everything. My relationships, my daily routine, my willingness to engage with the world. I've been so focused on avoiding pain that I've been missing out on life.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you feel about it?",
    "Client: It's... overwhelming, to be honest. Sad, because I've lost so much time. But also... maybe a little hopeful? Like maybe by facing this, I can start to reclaim some of what I've lost. It's scary, but... I want to try. I want to be present for my family again, to enjoy life without this constant fear hanging over me.",
    "Therapist: That's a courageous perspective. What's one small step you might take?",
    "Client: I... I think I might call my daughter tonight. Maybe we could plan a short visit. Not a long drive, just... baby steps. The thought makes me nervous, but... I miss her. And I'm tired of letting fear make my decisions for me.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great idea, John. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: A bit drained, honestly. But also... lighter? Like I've set down a heavy load I've been carrying for too long. It's not gone, but... I feel like I can breathe a little easier. Thank you for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but... I think it's important. I'm ready to keep working on this.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength today. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?"
