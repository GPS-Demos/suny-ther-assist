    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the animal attack?",
    "Client: Okay... I was walking in the park near my house. It was early morning, and I was alone. Suddenly, I heard growling behind me. I turned around and saw a large, aggressive dog. Its teeth were bared, and it was charging towards me. I froze in fear, my heart racing...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: The dog lunged at me, grabbing my arm with its teeth. I screamed in pain and terror. I tried to pull away, but its grip was so strong. I could feel its hot breath on my skin, and the pressure of its jaw was excruciating. I thought I was going to die...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) I... I don't know if I can...",
    "Therapist: It's okay. Take a deep breath. You're doing great.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay... As I struggled, I remembered the self-defense classes I took. I managed to kick the dog in its chest, and it released my arm. But it didn't back off. It circled me, snarling and snapping. I was terrified, but I knew I had to fight back...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I grabbed a nearby stick and swung it at the dog, yelling as loudly as I could. My arm was bleeding, and I was in so much pain. But the adrenaline kept me going. Finally, someone heard my screams and came running. The dog ran away when it saw other people approaching...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... shaking. My heart is pounding, just like it did that day. I can almost feel the pain in my arm again. It's overwhelming...",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (takes another deep breath) After the attack, I was rushed to the hospital. The wounds were deep, and I needed surgery. The physical recovery was tough, but the emotional scars... they've been much harder to heal. I've been afraid of dogs ever since. I can't even walk in that park anymore...",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength.",
    "Client: It's just... it's not just about the attack itself. It brought back memories of the physical abuse I endured in my past. The feeling of helplessness, the pain... it all came flooding back. I felt like I couldn't protect myself, just like when I was younger...",
    "Therapist: I understand. You're very brave.",
    "Client: (voice breaking) Sometimes, I have nightmares about the attack. In my dreams, the dog turns into my abuser, and I'm that helpless child again. I wake up in cold sweats, feeling like I can't breathe...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're processing trauma.",
    "Client: I know... but it's so hard. I feel like I've lost my sense of safety in the world. I'm constantly on edge, always looking over my shoulder. I've become so isolated. I used to love going for walks, but now I rarely leave my house...",
    "Therapist: You're making progress by talking about this.",
    "Client: Thank you... I'm trying. It's just... the attack brought back all these feelings of vulnerability and fear that I thought I had overcome. It's like I'm fighting two battles at once \u2013 the trauma from the dog attack and the resurfaced trauma from my past abuse...",
    "Therapist: You're incredibly resilient. Keep going.",
    "Client: I've been trying to find ways to cope. I've started meditating and doing yoga at home. It helps sometimes, but other times, the fear and anxiety are just too overwhelming. I miss the person I used to be \u2013 confident, outgoing. Now, I feel like a shell of my former self...",
    "Therapist: Your efforts are commendable. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also a bit lighter. Talking about it is hard, but I know it's necessary. I want to reclaim my life, to feel safe again. I'm tired of letting fear control me...",
    "Therapist: You're making great progress. We'll end here for today.",
    "Client: Thank you. This was difficult, but I'm glad we did it. I hope that one day, I'll be able to think about the attack without feeling this overwhelming fear and anxiety. I want to be able to enjoy life again, to feel strong and in control...",
    "Therapist: You're on the right path. We'll continue next session."
