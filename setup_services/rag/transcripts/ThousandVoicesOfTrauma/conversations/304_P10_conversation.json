    "Therapist: Welcome, Rahul. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to be talking about some heavy stuff today.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 4 or 5 out of 10. I'm not panicking, but there's definitely some tension.",
    "Therapist: Alright. When you're ready, let's begin. Take us to that day.",
    "Client: Okay... *deep breath* It's a sunny afternoon. I'm at work, in my home office. The light is streaming through the window, and I can hear the faint hum of traffic outside. I'm focused on my computer, working on a project deadline. Then... then my phone rings. It's my mom.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I answer, and... and I can tell something's wrong immediately. Her voice is shaky. She says, \"Beta, it's about your father.\" My heart starts racing. I... I can feel my palms getting sweaty, even now.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe a 6 or 7 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: She tells me... she tells me he had a heart attack at work. They rushed him to the hospital, but... *voice breaks* but it was too late. He didn't make it. I... I can't breathe. I feel like the room is spinning.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Rahul. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *inhales shakily* I... I remember dropping my phone. I couldn't... couldn't process what she was saying. My dad, he was always so strong, you know? He came to this country with nothing, built a life for us. And now... now he's just gone?",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. My hands are shaking. I... I feel like I'm back there, getting that call all over again.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I somehow manage to tell my mom I'll be there soon. I grab my keys, stumble out of my apartment. The sun feels too bright, too harsh. Everything feels wrong. I get in my car, but I can barely see straight to drive.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"This can't be real. It's a mistake.\" But deep down, I know it's not. I... I remember feeling so alone in that moment. Like the world was moving on around me, but I was frozen in time.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. Maybe an 8 now. My heart is pounding.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Rahul. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: *takes a few deep breaths* Okay... okay. I make it to the hospital somehow. The halls are so white, so sterile. I see my mom in the waiting room. She looks... she looks broken. When she sees me, she just collapses into my arms, sobbing.",
    "Therapist: What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I hold her. I want to be strong for her, but I'm falling apart inside. I keep thinking about all the things I never got to say to him. All the moments he'll miss. My wedding, if I ever get married. My kids, if I have any. He'll never meet them.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those thoughts. How does it make you feel?",
    "Client: Angry. Sad. So, so sad. And... and guilty. We had an argument the last time we spoke. Something stupid about my career choices. I... I never got to apologize. Never got to tell him I love him one last time.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to carry. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe a 9. I feel like I can't breathe again.",
    "Therapist: Let's take a moment. Focus on your breathing. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: *follows breathing instructions* It... it helps a little. But the pain is still there.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. The pain is part of the process. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The doctor comes out. He's talking, but I can barely hear him over the ringing in my ears. Words like \"massive heart attack\" and \"nothing we could do\" float around. I feel numb. Like this is happening to someone else, not me.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I ask to see him. The doctor hesitates, but leads us to a room. And there he is. My dad. He looks... he looks like he's sleeping. But I know he's not. I touch his hand, and it's cold. That's when it really hits me. He's gone. Really gone.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, Rahul?",
    "Client: I... I feel like I'm drowning. Like there's this weight on my chest that I can't shake off. I keep thinking about all the times I took him for granted. All the calls I didn't return, the visits I postponed. And now... now it's too late.",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault, Rahul. These thoughts are common after loss.",
    "Client: I know that... logically. But emotionally? It's hard. And then... then there's the cultural aspect. In our community, losing a parent, especially a father... it's like losing a part of yourself. I feel... I feel lost.",
    "Therapist: Can you elaborate on that feeling?",
    "Client: It's like... like I've lost my anchor. My dad was always the one who bridged the gap between our culture and life here. He understood both worlds. And now, I feel... I feel more alone in navigating that. More... exposed, I guess.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant loss. How's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8 now. The pain is still there, but talking about it... it helps, somehow.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Rahul. Let's continue.",
    "Client: The next few days are a blur. Arranging the funeral, dealing with relatives, trying to be strong for my mom. I remember standing at the funeral, watching as they lowered his casket. I couldn't cry. I felt... numb. Like it wasn't real.",
    "Therapist: What were you thinking during that moment?",
    "Client: I... I kept thinking about all the things he'd miss. All the conversations we'd never have. And... and I felt angry. Angry at the world, at God, at myself. Why him? Why now? It wasn't fair.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings, Rahul. How do you feel now, reliving this?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. My chest still feels tight. But... but there's something else. A kind of... release, I guess? Like I'm finally letting myself feel everything I've been holding back.",
    "Therapist: That's an important part of the healing process. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7 now. It still hurts, but... but I feel like I can breathe a little easier.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: *takes a few deep breaths* Okay... okay. I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, can you tell me about the days following the funeral?",
    "Client: It was... it was tough. Going back to work, trying to act normal. But nothing felt normal. I'd catch myself wanting to call him, to ask for advice, and then remembering... remembering he wasn't there anymore. It felt like this huge, gaping hole in my life.",
    "Therapist: How did you cope with those moments?",
    "Client: I... I threw myself into work at first. Tried to stay busy. But that only worked for so long. Eventually, I had to face it. The grief, the loss. It came in waves, you know? Some days I'd be okay, and others... others I could barely get out of bed.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience with grief. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still painful. But talking about it like this, really diving into the memories... it's like I'm reconnecting with him, in a way. I can almost hear his voice, his laugh. It hurts, but it's also... comforting, somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's a beautiful way to look at it. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's lower now. Maybe a 5 or 6. The pain is still there, but it feels... manageable.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today, Rahul. How do you feel about the session?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but in a good way? Like I've let out something that's been building up for a long time. It's still hard, but... but I feel like I can breathe a little easier now.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's end here for today. Remember to practice self-care.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think this is helping. It's hard, but... but I think it's what I need.",
    "Therapist: You're very welcome, Rahul. We'll continue this work in our next session."
