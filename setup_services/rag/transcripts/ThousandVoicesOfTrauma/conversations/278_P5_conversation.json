    "Therapist: Mrs. Patel, today we'll be doing imaginal exposure. Are you familiar with this?",
    "Client: No, I'm not sure what that means. Is it something to do with my memories?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it involves revisiting your refugee experiences. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: Oh, I see. Well, to be honest, I'm a bit nervous. Those memories are quite difficult for me. I've spent so many years trying to forget them. Is it really necessary to bring them up again?",
    "Therapist: I understand your hesitation. It's a crucial part of healing. What concerns you most?",
    "Client: I'm worried it might be too overwhelming. What if I can't handle it? And... will reliving those experiences make my depression worse?",
    "Therapist: Valid concerns. We'll go at your pace. How can I support you best?",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I think I'd feel better if we could take breaks when needed. And maybe... could you remind me that I'm safe here? Sometimes when I think about the past, I feel like I'm back there again.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll take breaks and I'll ground you. What else might help?",
    "Client: Thank you, that helps. Maybe we could have a cup of chai afterwards? It always calms me down. Oh, and could you explain a bit more about how this will help? I want to understand the process better.",
    "Therapist: Chai after sounds perfect. This process helps process trauma memories. Ready to start?",
    "Client: I appreciate your explanation. I'm still a bit nervous, but I think I'm ready. Can you tell me exactly what we'll be doing? And how long will this take? I want to be prepared.",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit memories for about 30-45 minutes. I'll guide you through it. Okay?",
    "Client: That sounds manageable. I'm glad it's not too long. Will I need to close my eyes? And what should I do if I start feeling overwhelmed? I sometimes get dizzy when I'm anxious.",
    "Therapist: Eyes closed helps, but not required. If overwhelmed, we'll pause and refocus. Ready?",
    "Client: Alright, I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. It's strange, I feel nervous but also a little hopeful. This might help me finally move past some of these old wounds. Before we start, is there anything I should do to prepare myself?",
    "Therapist: Just breathe deeply and remember you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, let's begin. I'm taking those deep breaths now. Thank you for being so patient with me, doctor. It means a lot to have someone listen and understand after all these years."
