    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. Today we'll start imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm honestly pretty nervous. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of reliving those combat experiences... it's terrifying. I've spent so long trying to push those memories away, you know? And now you're asking me to bring them back on purpose. It feels counterintuitive and scary.",
    "Therapist: I understand. It's normal to feel anxious. How can I help?",
    "Client: I guess I just need to know... is this really going to help? I mean, I've been having nightmares and flashbacks for years now. How is deliberately thinking about these things going to make it any better? And what if I completely fall apart during the session? I'm worried I won't be able to handle it.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. This process helps by allowing you to process the memories in a safe environment.",
    "Client: Okay, I can see how that might work. But still, the thought of going through those memories again... it's overwhelming. I've been having trouble sleeping lately just knowing we were going to do this. And with everything else going on in my life right now - being unemployed, living alone - I'm not sure I have the strength for this. Plus, I've been... well, I've been using more often to cope with the anxiety. I'm worried that might complicate things.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your honesty. We'll go at your pace and can stop anytime. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That does make me feel a bit better. I guess knowing I have some control over the process helps. But I'm still worried about what might come up. Some of the things I saw and experienced... they're really hard to talk about. And I'm not just talking about the combat itself. There were... other things that happened. Things related to being a woman in a male-dominated environment. I'm not sure I'm ready to unpack all of that.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for being here. We'll focus only on what you're comfortable with today.",
    "Client: Thank you, I appreciate that. I suppose I should mention... there's been some racial stuff that's come up recently that's been triggering some of my PTSD symptoms. I know we're focusing on the combat experiences, but I'm finding it hard to separate everything out in my mind. It all feels connected somehow. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Trauma can interconnect. We can address those connections as they arise.",
    "Client: Okay, that's good to know. I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Can you walk me through exactly what we're going to do? And... what should I do if I start to feel overwhelmed or panicky during the exposure?",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll start slowly, focusing on one memory. Use grounding techniques if overwhelmed. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: Alright, I think I'm ready. Just... please be patient with me if I struggle. This is really hard for me, but I want to get better. I'm tired of letting these experiences control my life. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: I'm here to support you. Your courage is admirable. Shall we start?"
