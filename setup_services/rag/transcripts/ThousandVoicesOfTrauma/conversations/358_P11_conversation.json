    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Chen?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's always hard to go back to that moment, you know? The airplane crash... it's still so vivid in my mind. I can still hear the screeching of metal and smell the burning fuel. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you this time?",
    "Client: Well, I... I noticed something different this time. I realized that I was focusing a lot on the sounds. The screams, the alarms, the crushing metal... it was like a terrible symphony. But what really got to me was the silence afterwards. That eerie quiet before the rescue teams arrived. It was... unsettling.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How did it feel to notice that?",
    "Client: It was... strange. I mean, I've always remembered the chaos, but the silence... it's like I'd blocked that part out. Reliving it now, I felt this deep sense of loneliness and fear. Like I was the only person left in the world. It... it made my chest tight, and I felt so small and helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're very observant. How does this connect to your daily life?",
    "Client: I... I think it explains a lot, actually. You know how I've always struggled with being alone? I think... I think that moment of silence in the crash is why. It's like I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop, for something terrible to happen when everything goes quiet. That's probably why I keep the TV on all the time at home, even when I'm not watching it.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful connection. What else?",
    "Client: Well, I've noticed that I get really anxious in quiet places. Like libraries or when I'm trying to sleep at night. I always thought it was just general anxiety, but now I see it's... it's tied to the crash. It's like my body is always on alert, waiting for danger.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about making that connection?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a relief, in a way. I mean, it's still hard, but understanding where it comes from... it makes me feel less crazy, you know? Like there's a reason for how I feel, and maybe... maybe I can do something about it.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive outlook. What might help?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I need to practice being in silence more? Like, start small, maybe just a few minutes a day, and work my way up? And perhaps... perhaps I could try some of those breathing exercises you taught me when I start feeling anxious in quiet places.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like great ideas. How else can you support yourself?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to be kinder to myself. I've been so hard on myself for being 'jumpy' all these years, but now I understand why. Maybe... maybe I can start acknowledging my progress more, even the small steps. And... and maybe I can reach out to my daughter more when I'm feeling overwhelmed, instead of trying to handle it all on my own.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How do you feel about continuing our work?",
    "Client: I... I want to keep going. It's hard, and sometimes I feel like I'm not making progress, but... but moments like this, where I have these realizations... they make me feel like there's hope. I want to understand myself better and... and learn how to feel safe again. I know it won't be easy, but... I'm willing to keep trying.",
    "Therapist: That's commendable. What's one thing you'll focus on this week?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'll try that silence exercise. Maybe start with just one minute a day, and see how it goes. And... and I'll try to remind myself that it's okay if it's hard. That I'm working on healing, and it takes time. Is... is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How would you like to end today's session?",
    "Client: I... I think I'd like to do one of those grounding exercises we've practiced. The one where we focus on the present moment. After reliving the crash, I... I need to remind myself that I'm here, now, and that I'm safe. Can... can we do that?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's begin..."
