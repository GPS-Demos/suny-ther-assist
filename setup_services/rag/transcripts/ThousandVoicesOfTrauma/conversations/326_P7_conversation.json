    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the hostage situation you experienced?",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... It was a regular day at work. I was at the bank, waiting in line to deposit a check. Suddenly, there was a loud bang, and three men with masks burst in, waving guns. Everyone started screaming and ducking. I froze, my heart racing. One of the men shouted, \"Everyone on the ground, now!\" I dropped to the floor, trembling.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I could hear sobbing around me. The men were yelling at the tellers, demanding money. I kept my face pressed to the cold tile floor, afraid to look up. My hands were shaking uncontrollably. I remember thinking about my husband, wondering if I'd ever see him again. The air felt thick, suffocating.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Voice quavering) One of the men started walking between us, his boots heavy on the floor. He stopped near me, and I could hear him breathing. I was terrified he'd do something to me. My whole body was tense, waiting for the worst. I... I can still smell his cologne mixed with sweat.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep describing what happened.",
    "Client: (Pauses, takes a shaky breath) I... I'm not sure I can continue. It's too much.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (After a moment) Okay... The man moved on, but I could still hear him nearby. Suddenly, there was a commotion at the front. Someone had tried to be a hero, I think. There was shouting, then a gunshot. I flinched so hard, I thought I'd pass out from fear. People were screaming again. I started crying silently, praying it would end.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Time seemed to stretch forever. My arms were aching from lying still for so long. I could hear police sirens outside, getting closer. The robbers started arguing among themselves. Their voices were panicked. I remember thinking they might start shooting all of us to eliminate witnesses. I've never felt so helpless in my life.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) I... I feel shaky. My heart is racing, just like it did then. But... I also feel a bit relieved to be talking about it. It's like a weight is lifting, even though it's painful to remember.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're doing incredibly well.",
    "Client: Thank you. (Takes a deep breath) The standoff lasted for hours. Eventually, I heard more commotion, shouting from outside. There was a loud bang, like an explosion. I think it was a flash grenade. Everything became chaos. People were running, there was more gunfire. I just stayed on the ground, covering my head, praying I wouldn't get hit.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I remember the relief when I heard police officers telling us it was over, that we were safe. But even as I stood up, my legs were like jelly. I couldn't stop shaking. When I finally got outside, the sunlight seemed so bright, almost surreal. I saw my husband in the crowd, and I just broke down crying in his arms. I felt so grateful to be alive, but also... broken somehow.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: (Exhales slowly) I feel... drained, but also a bit lighter. Talking about it is hard, but I can feel it's helping. The memories don't seem as overwhelming as they did before. I still feel some fear, but it's not as intense. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's a common response. You're making progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It's still difficult, but I feel like I'm regaining some control. The nightmares and flashbacks have been so hard to deal with. But sharing this... it's like I'm taking some of the power back from those memories.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself. Shall we pause here?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. This session has been intense, but I'm glad we did it. I feel like I've taken a big step forward today. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. We'll end here."
