    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Patel?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's not easy revisiting those memories of when we first arrived as refugees. The uncertainty, the fear... it all comes rushing back.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out most to you this time?",
    "Client: The faces. I could see the faces of those children who bullied my son at school so clearly. Their mocking expressions, the way they imitated his accent... It made me feel so helpless all over again.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really difficult. How did your body react?",
    "Client: My hands were shaking, and I felt this tightness in my chest. It's like I was right back there, watching it happen and unable to do anything.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does that compare to your daily experiences now?",
    "Client: Well... I suppose I still feel that helplessness sometimes, especially when I think about my children and grandchildren facing discrimination. But it's not as intense as it was during the exposure.",
    "Therapist: That's an important observation. What else did you notice?",
    "Client: I... I felt angry. Not just at those bullies, but at myself for not doing more. I know it's not rational, but...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have those feelings. How do you think this connects to your current symptoms?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe this is why I get so anxious when my grandkids talk about school? I'm always worried something similar might happen to them.",
    "Therapist: That's a really insightful connection. How else has this affected you?",
    "Client: I've become so protective, almost to a fault. I know I need to let them live their lives, but the fear... it's always there.",
    "Therapist: I understand. What strategies have helped you cope so far?",
    "Client: Deep breathing helps sometimes. And reminding myself that times have changed, that there's more support now. But it's still hard.",
    "Therapist: Those are great strategies. How can we build on them?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I could talk more openly with my family about these fears? I've kept so much bottled up for years.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive step. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's challenging, but... I think it's helping. I want to be free from these old fears, to enjoy my family without this constant worry.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: Perhaps we could explore ways to communicate better with my family about these experiences? I want to bridge that gap.",
    "Therapist: Excellent idea. Is there anything else you'd like to share?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm finally addressing things I've avoided for decades.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work, Mrs. Patel. How about we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. I feel drained, but also... lighter, somehow. Like I've set down a burden I've been carrying for too long.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful feeling. Take care, and we'll continue next week.",
    "Client: Thank you, doctor. I'll see you then."
