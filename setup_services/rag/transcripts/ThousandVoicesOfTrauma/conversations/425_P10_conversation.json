    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, Doctor. My arthritis is acting up, and thinking about the plane crash... it's bringing back a lot of memories. Not just from that day, but... other things too.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's start slowly. Can you close your eyes and describe where you are in the memory?",
    "Client: (deep breath) Okay... I'm at the airport. It's busy, noisy. I can smell coffee from a nearby caf\u00e9. My husband, Carlos, he's... he's right beside me. We're excited about our vacation, but I'm also... anxious. Flying always made me nervous.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's happening now?",
    "Client: We're boarding the plane. The seats are cramped, and I'm feeling claustrophobic. Carlos takes my hand, tries to calm me down. But I can't shake this feeling of dread.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: About... 60, I'd say.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (exhales slowly) The plane starts to take off. I'm gripping the armrests so tight my knuckles are white. Then... oh God... there's a loud bang. The plane shudders. People are screaming. I... I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Maria. Remember, you're here with me, safe in my office.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) The oxygen masks drop down. Carlos is trying to help me, but I'm frozen. The plane is losing altitude fast. I can see the ground getting closer through the window. I'm thinking about my children, my parents... (starts crying)",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel emotional. Can you tell me what you're feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My... my heart is racing. My hands are sweating. I feel like I can't catch my breath, just like that day.",
    "Therapist: Let's pause for a moment. Take a few deep breaths with me. In... and out.",
    "Client: (breathing slowly) Okay... okay. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 80.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You're doing great. When you're ready, continue with what happened next.",
    "Client: The impact... it's violent. Metal screeching, glass shattering. I'm thrown forward, but my seatbelt holds. There's smoke everywhere. I can't see Carlos. I'm calling for him, but I can't hear my own voice over the chaos.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment, Maria. What do you see, smell, hear?",
    "Client: Smoke... it smells acrid. People are coughing, crying. I hear the crackle of flames. My leg is pinned, and I'm in so much pain. I'm terrified, but... but I need to find Carlos.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel guilty. I survived, and Carlos... (voice breaks) Carlos didn't.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those feelings. Remember, the crash wasn't your fault.",
    "Client: (crying softly) I know, but... it's hard. I keep thinking about what I could have done differently.",
    "Therapist: Let's focus on what happened next. You're doing really well, Maria.",
    "Client: I... I manage to unbuckle my seatbelt. The smoke is so thick, I can barely see. I'm calling for Carlos, crawling through the wreckage. My hands are cut from the debris. I find him... he's unconscious, trapped under a seat.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (deep breath) I try to pull him free, but I can't. The flames are getting closer. A flight attendant finds me, tells me we have to get out. I... I don't want to leave Carlos, but she pulls me away. We escape through an emergency exit.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind at this point?",
    "Client: I feel... helpless. Angry. Scared. I'm watching the plane burn, knowing Carlos is still inside. I'm praying for a miracle, but deep down... I know he's gone.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings, Maria. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's 90. This is so hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Let's take a few deep breaths together.",
    "Client: (breathing slowly) Okay... I'm... I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: Good. Can you continue with what happened after you got out?",
    "Client: We're on the tarmac. There's chaos everywhere. Ambulances, fire trucks. I'm in shock, I think. A paramedic is talking to me, but I can't understand what he's saying. I keep looking back at the plane, hoping to see Carlos.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: Numb. Cold. I'm shaking uncontrollably. My leg is throbbing with pain, but it feels distant somehow.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Maria. Stay with those sensations.",
    "Client: They take me to the hospital. Everything's a blur. I keep asking about Carlos, but no one will give me a straight answer. It's not until hours later that they tell me... (voice breaks) that he didn't make it.",
    "Therapist: That must have been devastating. How are you feeling now, reliving this?",
    "Client: I feel... empty. Lost. Like a part of me died with Carlos that day.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are completely understandable. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still at 90. I thought it would get easier with time, but it hasn't.",
    "Therapist: Healing takes time, Maria. You're showing incredible courage facing this.",
    "Client: (sighs) After that... everything changed. I couldn't sleep without nightmares. Loud noises would make me panic. I pushed away my family, my friends. I felt so alone.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about your response to the trauma now?",
    "Client: I... I understand it better now. I know I was grieving, dealing with PTSD. But I still feel guilty for shutting everyone out.",
    "Therapist: It's important to remember that you were doing the best you could with the tools you had at the time.",
    "Client: I know. It's just... hard. Sometimes I still feel like I'm on that plane, waiting for the crash.",
    "Therapist: That's why we're here, Maria. To work through these feelings. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired. Drained. But... maybe a little lighter? My distress level has gone down to about 75.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. You've done incredibly well today. Let's take a few more deep breaths together before we end.",
    "Client: (breathing slowly) Thank you, Doctor. This isn't easy, but... I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work, Maria. I'm here to support you. Let's end here for today. Remember to use the coping strategies we've discussed if you feel overwhelmed later.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Maria. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
