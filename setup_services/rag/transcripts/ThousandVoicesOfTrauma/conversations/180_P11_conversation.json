    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Singh?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite drained, to be honest. Reliving that moment when I found out about my brother's passing... it's still so vivid. The phone call, the way my wife's face changed when I told her... it's like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: What stood out to you most about revisiting that memory?",
    "Client: The overwhelming sense of helplessness, I think. I keep replaying the moment over and over, wondering if there was something I could have done differently. Maybe if I had called him more often, or if I had visited him in the hospital... I just... I feel like I failed him as a brother.",
    "Therapist: How does that feeling of helplessness connect to your day-to-day life now?",
    "Client: It's... it's everywhere. I find myself constantly worried about my wife's health, my children... I'm always expecting bad news. It's like I'm stuck in that moment of shock and disbelief, waiting for the next tragedy to strike.",
    "Therapist: Mm. How has this affected your relationships?",
    "Client: Well, I've become quite withdrawn. I used to be the life of the party, you know? Now, I barely leave the house. My wife... she tries to understand, but I can see the frustration in her eyes. I'm not the man she married anymore.",
    "Therapist: What do you think your brother would say about how you're coping?",
    "Client: (long pause) He... he'd probably tell me to get my act together. (chuckles softly) He was always the strong one, you know? He'd say, \"Come on, little brother, life's too short for this nonsense.\" But... but it's not that simple, is it?",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to imagine him saying that?",
    "Client: It's... bittersweet. Part of me feels comforted, like he's still here, guiding me. But another part feels... angry. Angry that he left, angry that I can't be as strong as he was. It's... it's complicated.",
    "Therapist: What might be a small step towards honoring his memory?",
    "Client: I... I've been thinking about volunteering at the hospital where he spent his last days. He always talked about how kind the staff was. Maybe... maybe I could give back somehow. But the thought of being there... it's terrifying.",
    "Therapist: How might facing that fear align with your recovery goals?",
    "Client: I suppose... it could help me feel less helpless. Maybe by helping others, I could... I don't know, find some purpose again? But it's scary to think about putting myself out there.",
    "Therapist: What support might you need to take that step?",
    "Client: I think... I'd need my wife's encouragement. And maybe... maybe I could start small, just visiting the hospital first before committing to anything. Do you think that's a good idea?",
    "Therapist: How does that plan sit with you?",
    "Client: It feels... manageable. Still scary, but... maybe a bit exciting too? Like I'm finally doing something instead of just... existing. Do you think my brother would be proud?",
    "Therapist: What do you think?",
    "Client: I... I think he would be. He always encouraged me to step out of my comfort zone. Maybe this is my way of carrying on his legacy, in a small way. It's... it's a nice thought, actually.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, I think. Still sad, of course, but... there's a glimmer of hope there. Like maybe I can find a way forward that honors my brother's memory without being consumed by grief. It's a small step, but... it feels significant.",
    "Therapist: What will you take away from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... the idea that I can still have a connection with my brother, even though he's gone. And that facing my fears, bit by bit, might actually help me heal. It's not going to be easy, but... I think I'm ready to try."
