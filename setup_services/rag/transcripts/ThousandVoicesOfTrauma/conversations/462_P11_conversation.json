    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, [Client's name]?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Revisiting those cult experiences, it's like I'm right back there again. The isolation, the constant pressure to conform, the fear of disappointing the leaders... it's all so vivid.",
    "Therapist: What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The sense of powerlessness, I think. I remember this one time when I wanted to call my parents, but the cult leaders refused. They said my family was \"toxic\" and would hinder my \"spiritual growth.\" I felt so trapped, so... small. Like I had no control over my own life.",
    "Therapist: How did that feel in your body?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight just thinking about it. My hands are a bit shaky too. It's like... like I'm back in that small room where they'd make us meditate for hours. I can almost smell the incense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What thoughts came up?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"How could I have been so stupid?\" I mean, I was an adult when I joined. I should have known better. But they were so convincing, so... manipulative. They knew exactly what to say to keep us in line.",
    "Therapist: Mm. How does this connect to your day-to-day life now?",
    "Client: I guess... I still struggle with trusting my own judgment sometimes. Even at work, when I have to make decisions, there's always this voice in the back of my head questioning if I'm doing the right thing. And in my relationship... sometimes I feel like I'm too dependent on my wife, always seeking her approval. It's like I'm still trying to please some authority figure.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful connection. What else?",
    "Client: Well, the depression... I think it stems from the guilt and shame of those years. Sometimes I feel like I lost a part of myself in that cult, you know? Like I'll never fully recover who I was before.",
    "Therapist: Your awareness is growing. How do you feel about your progress?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard to see sometimes. But I guess I am making progress. A few months ago, I couldn't even talk about this without having a panic attack. Now, it's still difficult, but... I can face it. That's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What's helping you move forward?",
    "Client: These sessions, for sure. And my wife's support has been incredible. I've also started journaling, which helps me process things. Oh, and I joined a support group for ex-cult members. It's comforting to know I'm not alone in this.",
    "Therapist: Those are great strategies. Any new insights today?",
    "Client: Yeah... I realized that even though they took so much from me, they didn't take everything. I still have my core values, my ability to love and connect with others. That's... that's actually pretty powerful to recognize.",
    "Therapist: Indeed. How will you care for yourself after this?",
    "Client: I think I'll go for a long walk in the park. Being in nature always helps ground me. And then maybe call my brother. I've been meaning to reconnect with him, and... well, today feels like a good day to strengthen those family bonds.",
    "Therapist: Excellent plan. Anything else you want to discuss?",
    "Client: No, I think... I think I'm good for now. This was tough, but... I feel a bit lighter. Like I've taken another step forward, you know?",
    "Therapist: You have. We'll continue next week?",
    "Client: Definitely. Thank you, doctor. This... it means a lot to me.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, [Client's name]."
