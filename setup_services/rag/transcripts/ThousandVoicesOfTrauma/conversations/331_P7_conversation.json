    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Patel. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit anxious, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about that incident again, and it's making me nervous.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's just... every time I think about it, my heart starts racing.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Okay... So, it was a regular day at work. I was heading to my car in the parking garage when I heard shouting. At first, I thought it was just some kids horsing around, but then I saw them... Two men were attacking another man, yelling racial slurs. The victim looked like he could have been my son.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that memory. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I froze. I wanted to help, but I was terrified. They were so violent, punching and kicking him. I could hear the man's cries, see the blood on his face. I felt so helpless, so ashamed for not intervening.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. Keep going.",
    "Client: I called 911, but by the time the police arrived, the attackers had fled. The victim was lying there, barely conscious. I keep replaying it in my mind, wondering if I could have done more. What if it had been my son? The guilt... it's overwhelming sometimes.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Remember, you did what you could.",
    "Client: But was it enough? I've always taught my children to stand up against injustice, and when the moment came, I... I failed. I feel like a hypocrite, a coward. How can I face my family knowing I stood by while someone was brutalized because of their race?",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. You're showing courage by confronting this.",
    "Client: It's just... since that day, I've been more paranoid. I'm constantly looking over my shoulder, worried about my family's safety. I've started avoiding that parking garage, taking longer routes home. I know it's irrational, but I can't shake this fear.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. You're processing a traumatic event.",
    "Client: Sometimes, I have nightmares about it. In my dreams, it's my son being attacked, and I'm still frozen, unable to move or speak. I wake up in a cold sweat, feeling utterly helpless. It's affecting my sleep, my work... everything.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep exploring those feelings.",
    "Client: I find myself getting angry too. Angry at the attackers, at society, at myself. I've lived in this country for over 40 years, and I thought things were getting better. But now... I'm not so sure. I worry about my children, my grandchildren. Will they always be seen as outsiders, potential targets?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. You're showing strength by discussing this.",
    "Client: I've started to question every interaction. Is that person staring because they're racist or am I being paranoid? I hate feeling this way. I want to feel safe again, to trust people. But how can I when something like this can happen in broad daylight?",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have these thoughts. You're working through them.",
    "Client: I guess... I just want to feel normal again. To not flinch at loud noises or feel my heart race when I see a group of young men. I want to be able to tell my family that the world is a good place, but right now, I'm not sure I believe that myself.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. These feelings are part of healing.",
    "Client: Thank you for listening. It's hard to talk about this, but I know I need to. I just hope that one day, I can think about this without feeling this overwhelming mix of fear, guilt, and anger.",
    "Therapist: You're doing excellent work. Let's pause here for today."
