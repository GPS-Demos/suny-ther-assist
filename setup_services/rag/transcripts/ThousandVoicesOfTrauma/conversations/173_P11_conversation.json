    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Johnson?",
    "Client: Oh, dear... it's... it's quite overwhelming, to be honest. I didn't expect it to feel so vivid after all these years. I could almost smell the musty hallways of that old school building. It's funny how memory works, isn't it? One moment I'm here in your office, and the next, I'm right back there, a scared little girl all over again.",
    "Therapist: What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The laughter. Their cruel laughter. I can still hear it ringing in my ears. They... they called me such horrible names because of my accent and the way I dressed. We had just moved from Poland, you see, and everything was so different here. I didn't fit in, and they made sure I knew it. I remember clutching my books to my chest, trying to make myself as small as possible, hoping they wouldn't notice me. But they always did.",
    "Therapist: How did reliving that feel today?",
    "Client: It was... difficult. My heart was racing, and I felt that same knot in my stomach I used to get every morning before school. But... but there was something different this time. I felt... stronger, somehow. Like I was watching it happen to someone else, even though I knew it was me. Does that make any sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. What do you make of that difference?",
    "Client: Well, I suppose... I'm not that helpless little girl anymore, am I? I've lived a whole life since then. I've had a career, a family... I've faced so many challenges. Those bullies, they're probably grandparents now too, just like me. It's almost... almost funny to think about, in a way.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your current experiences?",
    "Client: I... I never thought about it before, but I think this is why I always felt so nervous around my grandchildren's school events. I would make excuses not to go, telling my daughter I was too tired or my arthritis was acting up. But really, I was afraid of feeling like that outsider again. It's silly, isn't it? To let something from so long ago still affect me?",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. How might you approach this differently now?",
    "Client: Well, I... I think I'd like to try attending the next school event. Maybe if I face it, like we're doing here, it won't have such a hold on me. My granddaughter has a piano recital coming up. I've always wanted to see her play.",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's not easy, that's for certain. But... but I think it's important. I don't want to be controlled by these memories anymore. I want to be there for my family without this... this shadow hanging over me. It's high time I stood up to those bullies, even if they're just in my memories now.",
    "Therapist: You're showing real courage. What's your takeaway from today?",
    "Client: I suppose... I'm stronger than I thought. And maybe, just maybe, I can start to let go of some of this old pain. It won't happen overnight, but I feel like I've taken a step in the right direction. Is that... is that a good thing?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How will you care for yourself after this session?",
    "Client: Oh, I think I'll have a nice cup of tea and call my daughter. Maybe I'll even tell her about the recital. And... and I'll try to remember that I'm not alone anymore. That little girl might have been, but I'm not her anymore. I have people who love me now.",
    "Therapist: That sounds wonderful. You've done great work today, Mrs. Johnson.",
    "Client: Thank you, dear. It's... it's not easy, but I'm glad I'm doing this. Same time next week?",
    "Therapist: Yes, I'll see you then. Take care."
