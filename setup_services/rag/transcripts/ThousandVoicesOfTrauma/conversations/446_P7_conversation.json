    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. We're going to talk about the earthquake, right? I'm not sure I'm ready for this.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We'll take it slow.",
    "Client: Okay... I guess we should start. It was just a normal day, you know? I was at work, in my home office. The first tremor was small, and I thought, \"Oh, it's just a little shake.\" But then...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: It got stronger. Much stronger. The whole house started to shake violently. I could hear things falling and breaking. I was frozen in my chair, gripping the desk. The noise was deafening - like a freight train was running through my living room.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you remember?",
    "Client: I remember... I remember the fear. It was overwhelming. My heart was pounding so hard I thought it might burst out of my chest. I couldn't breathe properly. I wanted to run, but I couldn't move. I was paralyzed.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I know, but it feels so real again. I can almost feel the shaking. My palms are sweating just thinking about it. I... I don't know if I can continue.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. After what felt like an eternity, the shaking stopped. But I was still terrified. I crawled under my desk, convinced another quake was coming. I could hear car alarms going off outside, and people shouting. It was chaos.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Anxious. My heart is racing again. But... I think I can continue. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: Thanks. So, I stayed under the desk for a while. I don't know how long exactly. When I finally got the courage to come out, I was shocked. My office was a mess - books everywhere, my computer on the floor, picture frames shattered. I carefully made my way to the living room, and it was even worse.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job describing this. Keep going.",
    "Client: The TV had fallen and cracked. There was broken glass everywhere from the windows. I remember the smell - dust and something else, maybe gas? I panicked thinking there might be a leak. I rushed to open the windows, nearly cutting myself on the broken glass.",
    "Therapist: How did you manage in that moment?",
    "Client: I... I tried to stay calm. I remembered the emergency kit I had prepared - you know, just in case. I found it in the kitchen cupboard, thankfully intact. It had a battery-powered radio, and I turned it on. The news was reporting widespread damage, aftershocks expected. I felt so alone and scared.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I know, but sometimes it still feels like it just happened. I keep reliving those moments of terror, the uncertainty. Will my house collapse? Will there be a bigger quake? What about my friends and family? I couldn't reach anyone on my phone - the lines were jammed.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well, Sarah. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. But talking about it, I feel like I'm starting to process it a bit better. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's a positive sign. Would you like to continue?",
    "Client: I think so. The aftershocks were almost worse than the main quake. Each time the ground trembled, I'd freeze up. I spent that night huddled in my doorway, too afraid to sleep. Every creak or sound made me jump. I felt so vulnerable, like the earth could swallow me up at any moment.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage. Keep going.",
    "Client: The next day was surreal. The streets were a mess - cracked pavements, fallen trees, some buildings partially collapsed. People were out, looking shell-shocked. I remember this eerie silence, punctuated by sirens in the distance. It was like being in a movie, but it was real. Too real.",
    "Therapist: How does recalling this make you feel now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. But I think it's helping. Talking about it makes it feel less overwhelming, somehow. Like I'm taking back some control. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're making great progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think... I think I'd like to stop here for today, if that's okay. It's a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've done exceptionally well today, Sarah.",
    "Client: Thanks. I feel drained, but also a bit lighter. Is that normal after these sessions?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it's very common. How about we wrap up?",
    "Client: That sounds good. Thank you for guiding me through this. It wasn't easy, but I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself, Sarah. We'll continue next week."
