    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. That memory of the combat situation was so vivid, even though it wasn't my own experience. It's strange how my childhood trauma seems to connect with these military stories I've heard.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sounds, definitely. The explosions and gunfire... they reminded me of the loud fights my parents used to have. I could almost feel the ground shaking, just like when my dad would slam doors. And the feeling of helplessness... that was overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: How did that helplessness feel in your body?",
    "Client: It was like a weight on my chest. I felt frozen, like I couldn't breathe properly. My hands were clammy, and I had this urge to curl up into a ball and hide. It's similar to how I felt as a child, but somehow... more intense.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does this connect to your everyday experiences?",
    "Client: Well, I've noticed that I tend to freeze up in stressful situations at work or in my relationship. I guess... I'm still carrying that child's response with me. It's like I'm always waiting for the next \"explosion,\" you know?",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. How might this awareness help you?",
    "Client: I think... maybe if I can recognize when I'm starting to feel that way, I could try to remind myself that I'm not helpless anymore. I'm an adult now, and I have choices. It's not easy, but... maybe it's a start?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. What else did you notice during the exposure?",
    "Client: I was surprised by how angry I felt. Not just scared, but really angry. At the situation, at the people causing harm, at myself for feeling so powerless. It's not an emotion I usually let myself feel.",
    "Therapist: How do you typically handle anger?",
    "Client: I... I don't. I push it down, I guess. It feels dangerous to be angry. But during the imaginal exposure, it just came rushing out. It was actually kind of... liberating?",
    "Therapist: Liberating how?",
    "Client: Like... for once, I wasn't just a victim. The anger made me feel strong, in a way. Like I had a right to protect myself or fight back. It's not something I'm used to feeling.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How might you use this?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I could try to acknowledge my anger more in daily life? Not to lash out, but to recognize it as a valid emotion. To stand up for myself more, set boundaries. It's scary to think about, but also exciting.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive direction. What else?",
    "Client: I noticed that even though the memory was intense, I got through it. I didn't fall apart or lose control. That feels... significant. Like maybe I'm stronger than I thought.",
    "Therapist: How does that strength feel?",
    "Client: It's... comforting, I guess? And a little surprising. I've spent so long feeling fragile, like I might break at any moment. But maybe I've been underestimating myself. It's a strange feeling, but a good one.",
    "Therapist: What do you want to remember from today's session?",
    "Client: That I can handle more than I thought. That my anger isn't something to be afraid of, but maybe a tool I can use. And that even though my past experiences still affect me, I'm not that helpless child anymore. I have resources and strength I didn't have then.",
    "Therapist: Excellent insights. How will you carry this forward?",
    "Client: I think I'll try to be more aware of when I'm starting to feel that helplessness or freeze response. Maybe I can practice some of the grounding techniques we've talked about. And... maybe I'll try to be a little braver in expressing myself, especially when I'm feeling angry or frustrated. It's scary, but I think it could be really good for me.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a solid plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... good. Like I've done something important. It's hard work, but I think I'm starting to see why it matters. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You did great. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: I'm wondering... is it normal for these imaginal exposures to bring up memories or feelings that don't seem directly related? Like how the combat scenario triggered memories of my childhood?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's quite common. Why do you think that happens?",
    "Client: I guess... trauma is trauma? Maybe my brain doesn't really distinguish between different types of scary experiences. They all kind of... feed into each other, create this network of fear and stress responses. Is that right?",
    "Therapist: That's a good way to look at it. Anything else?",
    "Client: I'm just... I'm curious about what to expect moving forward. Will these exposures get easier? Or will they always be this intense?",
    "Therapist: What do you think based on today's experience?",
    "Client: I... I hope they'll get easier. Maybe not less emotional, but... easier to handle? Like, maybe I'll get better at recognizing that I'm safe in the present moment, even when remembering scary things. Is that realistic?",
    "Therapist: Very. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: I'm nervous, but... determined. I think I'm starting to see how this could really help me. It's not easy, but I want to keep going. I want to get better at managing these memories and feelings.",
    "Therapist: That's great. Anything else before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For being here, for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone I trust helping me navigate all of this. I'm grateful.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Great work today, Sarah."
