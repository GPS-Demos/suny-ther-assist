    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the cyberbullying incident.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm sitting at my computer, scrolling through social media. Suddenly, I see a post about me. It's... it's a photo of me from a party, but it's been edited to make me look ridiculous. The comments are cruel, calling me names and...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably a 6 out of 10. My heart's beating faster.",
    "Therapist: Keep going. You're doing well.",
    "Client: The comments keep coming. People I thought were friends are joining in. I feel so betrayed. My hands are shaking as I try to delete the post, but it's already been shared. I... I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. I feel like I'm back there, helpless and humiliated.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: I shut down my computer and curl up on my bed. My phone keeps buzzing with notifications. I feel so alone, like the whole world is against me. Tears are streaming down my face, and I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: Still an 8. My chest feels tight, and I'm sweating.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I consider deleting all my social media accounts. The thought of facing anyone at work tomorrow makes me feel sick. I don't know how I'll ever recover from this humiliation.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... actually down to a 7. Talking about it... it's hard, but I feel less alone.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing the memory. Continue.",
    "Client: I reach out to my sister, telling her what happened. She comes over, and just having her there... it helps. We report the post, block the worst offenders. I start to feel a tiny bit of control returning.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5 now. My breathing is steadier.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. You're doing really well. How does the memory end?",
    "Client: My sister stays the night. In the morning, I wake up feeling drained but... stronger. I decide to post about cyberbullying, sharing my experience. The support I receive is overwhelming. It doesn't erase what happened, but it helps.",
    "Therapist: Final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's a 4 now. I feel... I feel okay.",
    "Therapist: You've done an amazing job. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... relieved. It wasn't as bad as I feared, talking about it like this.",
    "Therapist: That's often the case. You've shown incredible strength today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to revisit that memory without falling apart.",
    "Therapist: That's the power of this therapy. You're making real progress.",
    "Client: I feel it. It's still painful, but... I feel more in control now.",
    "Therapist: That's exactly what we're aiming for. Well done."
