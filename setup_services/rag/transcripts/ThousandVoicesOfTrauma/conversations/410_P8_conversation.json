    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart is still racing, and I feel a tightness in my chest. The memory of witnessing that violence, it's so vivid now. I can still hear the shouting, the sound of glass breaking. It's like I'm right back there, you know?",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. I was just a kid, and I couldn't do anything to stop it. I remember wanting to run away, but I was frozen in place. And now, as an adult, I still feel that same sense of powerlessness sometimes. It's frustrating because I know I'm not that little girl anymore, but the feelings are so strong.",
    "Therapist: I see. How do those feelings of powerlessness show up in your life today?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... I tend to avoid conflict at all costs. Even in my marriage, if there's a disagreement, I shut down. I'm always afraid things will escalate, even though my husband has never been violent. It's like I'm still trying to make myself invisible, you know? And at work, I struggle to assert myself. I'm always worried about upsetting someone or causing a scene.",
    "Therapist: That makes sense. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much this has affected my relationships. Not just with my husband, but with everyone. I keep people at arm's length because I'm afraid of getting hurt. And I'm always on edge, waiting for something bad to happen. It's exhausting, really. I want to feel safe, but it's like my body won't let me relax.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to be talking about this now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a bit relieving. I've never really put it all together like this before. It's scary to face these memories and feelings, but there's also a part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe hopeful? Like maybe if I can understand all this, I can start to change it.",
    "Therapist: Mm. What's giving you that sense of hope?",
    "Client: I guess... the fact that I'm here, talking about it. For so long, I've tried to just push it all down and pretend it didn't affect me. But now, even though it's painful, I feel like I'm finally acknowledging what happened and how it's shaped me. And maybe... maybe that's the first step to not letting it control me anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How do you want to move forward from here?",
    "Client: I think... I want to work on feeling safer in my relationships. Maybe start with my husband, try to be more open with him about what I'm feeling. And at work, maybe I can practice speaking up more, in small ways at first. It's scary to think about, but I'm tired of living in fear all the time.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like good goals. What support do you need?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. I guess... patience? This isn't going to change overnight. And maybe some strategies for when I start feeling overwhelmed or triggered. Oh, and... I think I need to remind myself that it's okay to feel vulnerable sometimes. That's been hard for me.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll work on those together. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but also a little lighter? Like I've set down a heavy backpack I've been carrying for years. There's still a lot to work through, but for the first time in a long time, I feel like maybe I can do this. It's not going to be easy, but... I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: That's great. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... maybe we could talk more about strategies for managing my anxiety in social situations? And maybe explore more about how this has affected my relationships. I want to understand that better so I can start making changes.",
    "Therapist: Sounds good. Is there anything else you'd like to add before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for helping me make sense of all this. I know we have a long way to go, but I feel like I've taken a big step today. It's scary, but also... kind of exciting? Like I'm finally starting to take control of my life instead of letting my past control me.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. How would you like to end our session?",
    "Client: I think... maybe we could do a quick grounding exercise? Something to help me transition back to the present moment. I'm feeling a bit raw and exposed after all this, and I want to make sure I can face the rest of my day.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's do that now..."
