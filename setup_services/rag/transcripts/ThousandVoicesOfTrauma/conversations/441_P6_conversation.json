    "Therapist: Welcome back, Mr. Patel. Are you ready to continue our imaginal exposure exercise today?",
    "Client: Yes, Dr. Singh. I'm a bit nervous, but I think I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's begin. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see myself in the hospital waiting room. The fluorescent lights are harsh, and there's that antiseptic smell. My wife is beside me, holding my hand tightly.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, about a 4 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: The doctor comes out. His face is grim. I feel my heart racing. He tells us... he tells us our daughter didn't make it. She... she was found in that... that trafficking ring, but... but it was too late.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I... I can't breathe. My chest is so tight. I feel like I'm going to collapse.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe even a 9.",
    "Therapist: That's intense. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: My wife is screaming. I can't... I can't comfort her. I'm frozen. I keep thinking, \"We should have known. We should have protected her.\" The guilt... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you experiencing?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking. I feel nauseous. There's this... this pressure in my head.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: Still... still a 9.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Continue.",
    "Client: I... I slide down the wall. I can't stand anymore. A nurse comes to help, but I can't hear what she's saying. All I can think is, \"Our baby is gone. We failed her.\"",
    "Therapist: Stay with those thoughts. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I start to cry. For the first time, I just... break down. My wife and I hold each other, sobbing. It feels like the world has ended.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe a 7.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this. Keep going.",
    "Client: We... we have to call our families. Tell them what happened. But how do you say those words? How do you tell everyone that your child is... is gone?",
    "Therapist: What emotions are coming up for you?",
    "Client: Grief. Anger. This... this deep, aching sadness. And shame. So much shame.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: Back up to an 8.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. It's normal for it to fluctuate. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I... I remember looking at my wife and thinking, \"How will we survive this?\" But somehow... somehow we did.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. Exhausted. But... also a little lighter? Is that strange?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a common experience. Final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: I'd say... about a 5 now.",
    "Therapist: Well done, Mr. Patel. You've shown incredible strength today."
