    "Therapist: How are you feeling after today's imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, Dr. Thompson. It was intense, reliving that combat experience. My heart's still racing a bit. I keep seeing flashes of... of the explosion, you know? The chaos afterwards. It's like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The sounds. God, the sounds. The initial blast, then people screaming. I remember feeling so helpless, like I couldn't do enough to help everyone. And the guilt... it's overwhelming sometimes.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt feel in your body right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's heavy. Like a weight on my chest. Makes it hard to breathe sometimes. I know logically I did what I could, but emotionally... it's different.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does this connect to your day-to-day life?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... I'm always on edge, you know? Waiting for something bad to happen. And I push people away. It's easier than letting them get close and potentially losing them.",
    "Therapist: Mm. How has that impacted your relationships?",
    "Client: It's... it's made them pretty non-existent, to be honest. I mean, I live with my parents now, at my age. It's embarrassing. But I can't seem to maintain connections with anyone else. I'm just... always waiting for the other shoe to drop.",
    "Therapist: What have you learned from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I'm starting to see how much that experience still affects me. How it's shaped everything since. It's scary to face, but... maybe necessary? I don't know.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's terrifying, honestly. But... I'm tired of living like this. Always afraid, always alone. If this can help... I want to try. It's just... it's so hard to let my guard down.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. What's one small step you can take this week?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I could try calling my old friend Janet. We haven't spoken in years, but... maybe it's time to reach out. Even if it's just a short call.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great idea. How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Nervous. Really nervous. But also... maybe a little hopeful? Is that crazy?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. Hope is important. Shall we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Thank you, Dr. Thompson. This was tough, but... I think it might be helping. Slowly, but... yeah.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work, Sarah. See you next week.",
    "Client: See you then. Thanks again."
