    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember to share your SUDS rating when I ask. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's begin. Close your eyes and recall the memory.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back at the office party. I can see my ex-husband across the room, laughing with his new girlfriend. My chest feels tight, and I'm struggling to breathe normally. The room seems to be spinning a little.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 6 out of 10. It's uncomfortable, but I can manage.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue with the memory.",
    "Client: I'm trying to act normal, but I feel so humiliated. Everyone knows about our divorce, and I can feel their eyes on me. My hands are shaking as I try to hold my drink. I want to run away, but I'm frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's getting worse. Maybe an 8? My heart is racing, and I feel like I might cry.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Stay with it.",
    "Client: I... I see him walking towards me. His face looks concerned, but I feel so angry. I want to scream at him, but instead, I feel tears welling up. My throat is tight, and I can barely speak when he asks if I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. I feel overwhelmed. My palms are sweaty, and I'm dizzy.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I mumble something and rush to the bathroom. I can hear whispers as I pass. In the bathroom, I break down sobbing. I feel so alone and embarrassed. I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: Still a 9. I feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: I splash water on my face, trying to calm down. But when I look in the mirror, all I see is a failure. I feel worthless and unlovable. The pain in my back flares up, making everything worse.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to ease a bit. Maybe an 8? I'm still upset, but the intensity is lessening.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Continue with the memory.",
    "Client: I take some deep breaths and decide to leave the party. As I walk out, I hold my head high, even though I'm crumbling inside. The cool night air helps me feel a bit more grounded.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6 now. I still feel shaky, but I'm starting to calm down.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How does it feel to revisit this memory?",
    "Client: It's hard, but... I feel stronger than I expected. Like I survived it once, and I can face it again.",
