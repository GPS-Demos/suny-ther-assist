    "Therapist: Welcome back. Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. To be honest, I'm feeling quite anxious. The idea of revisiting those experiences as a refugee... it's daunting. I've spent so long trying to push those memories away.",
    "Therapist: Your anxiety is understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I worry that talking about it will bring back all those intense emotions. The fear, the uncertainty, the helplessness... I've worked hard to build a new life here, and I'm scared that revisiting those memories might undo all that progress.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How do you think this exercise might help?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe it could help me process those experiences better? I've heard that avoiding trauma memories can actually make things worse in the long run. But it's still scary to face them head-on.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. Avoidance often prolongs suffering. This exercise aims to reduce that.",
    "Client: That makes sense. But how will this be different from just remembering it on my own? I've had flashbacks before, and they're terrifying.",
    "Therapist: Good question. Unlike flashbacks, this is controlled and supported. I'll guide you through it.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I trust you, but I'm still nervous. What should I expect during the exercise? Will it be intense?",
    "Therapist: It may be challenging, but we'll go at your pace. What coping strategies might help?",
    "Client: Well, I've been practicing deep breathing and grounding techniques. Maybe we could use those if things get too overwhelming? And... is it okay if I need to take breaks?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll use those techniques and take breaks as needed. Your safety is paramount.",
    "Client: Thank you. That helps me feel more at ease. I appreciate your patience with my questions. I think I'm ready to try this, even though it's scary.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Remember, this is to help you heal. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm ready. Just... please remind me that I'm safe here if I start to feel too overwhelmed. It means a lot to have your support through this.",
    "Therapist: Of course. You're safe here. Let's start with a deep breath..."
