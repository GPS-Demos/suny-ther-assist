    "Therapist: Welcome, Margaret. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is terrified. My hands are a bit shaky.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 6 or 7. My stomach's in knots.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I guess so. Where do I start?",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes and describe the moment you learned about your illness.",
    "Client: (deep breath) I'm... I'm sitting in the doctor's office. The walls are this sickly pale green color. There's a faint smell of disinfectant. My hands are gripping the armrests so tight my knuckles are white.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: The doctor comes in. He's holding a clipboard and won't meet my eyes. I know something's wrong. He sits down and says, \"I'm sorry, Margaret, but the tests came back positive.\" My heart starts racing. I can hear it pounding in my ears.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I... I feel like I can't breathe. Like the room is closing in on me. I want to run, but I'm frozen in place. The doctor's still talking, but I can't hear him over the roaring in my ears.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe an 8 now.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (inhales shakily) I finally manage to croak out, \"How long?\" The doctor hesitates, then says, \"Without treatment, maybe six months.\" Six months. The words echo in my head. I feel... I feel so alone. So scared.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay in the moment.",
    "Client: I start to cry. Not loud sobs, just... silent tears rolling down my cheeks. The doctor offers me a tissue, but I can't even move to take it. All I can think is, \"This is it. This is how I die.\"",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm thinking about all the things I never did. All the places I never saw. And... and how there's no one to call. No one who'll care if I'm gone. It's like a weight crushing my chest.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're here now, you're safe.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) The doctor's talking about treatment options, but it all sounds like gibberish. I'm nodding, but I'm not really there. I'm thinking about my empty apartment, about how I'll have to face this alone.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe a 9 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: Okay... (breathes deeply) I can feel the chair beneath me. I can hear the clock ticking on the wall.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: I finally stand up to leave. My legs feel like jelly. The doctor hands me some pamphlets, but they feel like lead in my hands. As I walk out of the office, everything seems surreal. The receptionist smiles at me like nothing's wrong, and I want to scream.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I get in my car, but I don't start it. I just sit there, staring at nothing. My mind is racing, thinking about all the pills I'll have to take, the treatments I'll have to endure. And for what? To buy a few more months?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What else?",
    "Client: I suddenly feel so angry. Why me? What did I do to deserve this? I start hitting the steering wheel, over and over, until my hands hurt. Then I just... deflate. I feel empty, hollow.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing well.",
    "Client: (inhales deeply) I finally start the car and drive home. The whole way, I'm on autopilot. I keep thinking about how I'm going to die alone in my apartment, and no one will even notice I'm gone for days.",
    "Therapist: What happens when you get home?",
    "Client: I walk into my apartment and it feels... different. Like I'm seeing it for the first time. The silence is deafening. I look at all my stuff and wonder what's going to happen to it when I'm gone. Who's going to care about my books, my photos?",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I grab a bottle of whiskey from the cabinet. I know I shouldn't, but I don't care anymore. I pour a glass with shaking hands and down it in one gulp. It burns, but I welcome the feeling. It's better than the numbness.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... lost. Scared. Angry. I pour another drink and another. I want to forget, to not feel anything. But it's not working. The fear is still there, gnawing at me.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. Maybe even a 10. I can't... I can't do this.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Let's pause for a moment.",
    "Client: (breathes shakily) Okay... okay. I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: I... I end up drinking most of the bottle. I'm sitting on my couch, surrounded by darkness. The TV's on, but I'm not really watching it. I'm just... existing. And then it hits me - this is what the rest of my life is going to be like. Alone, scared, waiting to die.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... maybe I should just end it now. Why prolong the inevitable? But then I think about the doctor, about the treatments. There's a tiny part of me that wants to fight, but it's so small compared to the fear and despair.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: I... I start crying. Really crying this time. Big, ugly sobs that shake my whole body. I'm curled up on the couch, hugging a pillow, and I just let it all out. All the fear, the anger, the loneliness. I cry until I have no tears left.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8. But it feels different now. Like... like I've let something out.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. Take a moment to breathe.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) I... I eventually fall asleep on the couch. When I wake up, it's morning. For a split second, I forget everything. Then it all comes crashing back, and I feel this weight on my chest.",
    "Therapist: What do you do then?",
    "Client: I... I force myself to get up. To shower. To eat something. It all feels mechanical, like I'm just going through the motions. But I do it. And as I'm making coffee, I realize... I'm still here. I'm still fighting.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's complicated. I'm still scared. Still angry. But there's something else now. A tiny spark of... I don't know. Hope, maybe? Determination? I decide to call the doctor back, to talk about those treatment options.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. But also... maybe a little stronger? Like I've faced the worst of it and I'm still standing.",
    "Therapist: Your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 6, I think. Still high, but... manageable.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today, Margaret. How are you feeling about the session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm surprised. It was hard, really hard. But I feel like I understand my feelings better now. Like I've processed some of it.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. We'll end here for today. Well done."
