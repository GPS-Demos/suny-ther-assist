    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not really sure. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I'm back there, you know? Seeing those images on the news, hearing about another case of police brutality. It just... it brings me right back to when I was bullied in school. The feeling of helplessness, of being targeted for no reason. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What physical sensations are you noticing?",
    "Client: My hands are clammy, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's like I can't get enough air. And my stomach feels like it's in knots. It's the same feeling I used to get when I'd see my bullies in the hallway at school. That dread, that fear of what might happen next.",
    "Therapist: How do these sensations connect to your memories?",
    "Client: It's... it's like my body's reliving those moments. When I see footage of police using excessive force, it's not just about what I'm seeing. It triggers all these old feelings of being powerless, of being singled out. I remember how the teachers would sometimes turn a blind eye, just like how some people justify police brutality. It makes me angry and scared at the same time.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why does this keep happening?\" Both with the bullying and now with these cases of police brutality. It's like... is the world just inherently unfair? Are there always going to be people who abuse their power? And then I feel guilty, because I'm not the one experiencing police brutality directly, but it affects me so deeply. I wonder if I'm overreacting, but I can't shake these feelings.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to have these reactions. How do you cope with these emotions?",
    "Client: Honestly, sometimes I don't cope well. I've been withdrawing more, spending a lot of time alone. My partner notices, but I find it hard to explain. I try to distract myself with work, but then I feel guilty for not staying informed. It's like I'm caught between wanting to be aware and wanting to protect myself from these triggering events.",
    "Therapist: How does this impact your daily life?",
    "Client: It's... it's exhausting. I find myself constantly on edge, especially when I'm out in public. I'm hyper-aware of authority figures, always watching for potential conflicts. It affects my sleep too. I have nightmares sometimes, where I'm back in school being bullied, but now it's police officers instead of other kids. And then I wake up feeling drained before the day even starts.",
    "Therapist: What do you think these reactions are telling you?",
    "Client: I guess... they're showing me how deep these wounds go. It's not just about what happened in the past; it's about feeling unsafe in the present. Every new incident I hear about is like ripping off a scab. I want to heal, to move past this, but it feels like the world keeps reminding me why I should be afraid.",
    "Therapist: How does talking about this make you feel now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of things. There's some relief in getting it out, in putting words to these feelings. But there's also this sadness, this heaviness. It's like I'm grieving for my younger self and for all the people who are experiencing this kind of trauma right now. And there's a part of me that feels a bit stronger for facing it, even though it's hard.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to work on coping strategies. Ways to stay informed without getting overwhelmed. And maybe... maybe we could explore how I can use these experiences to make a positive change somehow? I don't want to just be a victim of my past or a passive observer of what's happening now. I want to find a way to turn this pain into something meaningful, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great direction. We'll explore that next time.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's not easy, but I'm glad we're doing this work. I feel... I feel heard, and that means a lot. It's different from when I was younger, feeling so alone with all of this. I'm nervous about digging deeper, but I'm also hopeful that it might lead to some real healing.",
    "Therapist: You're showing a lot of courage. We'll take it one step at a time.",
    "Client: Yeah, one step at a time. That sounds good. It's still all swirling in my head, but talking about it like this... it helps make it feel less overwhelming. I'm looking forward to our next session, even if it's challenging. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care until next time."
