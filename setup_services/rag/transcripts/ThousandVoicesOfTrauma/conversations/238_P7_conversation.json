    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Can you describe the car accident for me?",
    "Client: Okay... I was driving home from class. It was raining, and the roads were slick. I remember gripping the steering wheel tightly, trying to stay focused. Suddenly, I saw headlights coming towards me. They were in my lane. I panicked and tried to swerve...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The car started to spin. I lost control completely. Everything was a blur of lights and screeching tires. I felt this intense fear in my chest, like I couldn't breathe. Then there was a loud crash, and my body jerked forward. The airbag deployed, hitting me in the face. I tasted blood in my mouth...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The smell... there was a strong smell of burning rubber and gasoline. My ears were ringing, and I could hear people shouting outside. I was so disoriented. I tried to move, but my leg was trapped. The pain hit me all at once, and I started to cry. I was terrified that the car might explode...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this really well. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can continue. My heart is racing just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. I remember calling out for help, but my voice sounded strange, like it wasn't mine. Someone came to the window, telling me to stay still. I could see blood on the shattered glass. The wait for the ambulance felt like hours. I kept thinking about my parents, how worried they'd be...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The paramedics arrived, and they started working on getting me out. The sound of metal being cut was so loud. When they finally got me free, the pain intensified. I screamed as they moved me onto the stretcher. The ride to the hospital was a blur of sirens and voices. I felt so alone and scared...",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel shaky and anxious, but also... a little relieved? It's like a weight has been lifted, talking about it like this.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. You're doing excellent work.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to believe it happened to me. Sometimes I have nightmares about being trapped in the car again. I wake up in a cold sweat, feeling like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to have those reactions. You're processing the trauma.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess so. It's just... every time I get in a car now, I feel this intense anxiety. My hands get sweaty, and I start to panic. I've been avoiding driving as much as possible.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. We'll work on that together.",
    "Client: I hope so. I hate feeling this way. It's like the accident took away my independence. I used to love driving, and now it terrifies me. Even as a passenger, I flinch at every sudden movement or loud noise.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. We'll take it step by step.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's just frustrating because I know logically that not every car ride will end in an accident, but my body doesn't seem to understand that. I get these intrusive thoughts about crashes all the time.",
    "Therapist: That's common after trauma. You're not alone in this.",
    "Client: Thank you for saying that. It helps to know I'm not crazy for feeling this way. Sometimes I feel guilty too, like maybe I could have done something differently to prevent the accident.",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. You're very courageous for facing this.",
    "Client: I'm trying. It's just hard because the accident has affected so many aspects of my life. My studies have suffered because I have trouble concentrating. My relationship has been strained because I'm always on edge. I feel like I'm not the same person I was before.",
    "Therapist: Change is part of healing. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I hope you're right. I want to get back to my old self, or at least a version of me that isn't constantly afraid. I miss feeling carefree and excited about the future. Now, I'm always waiting for something bad to happen.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We'll work on rebuilding your sense of safety.",
    "Client: I'd really like that. I want to be able to enjoy life again without this constant fear hanging over me. It's exhausting being on high alert all the time. I just want to feel normal again.",
    "Therapist: Your goal is achievable. You're already taking important steps.",
    "Client: Thank you. I know it's going to be a long process, but I'm committed to working through this. I don't want the accident to define the rest of my life. I want to be able to drive again, to feel confident and in control.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. You're showing real strength.",
    "Client: I'm trying. Some days are harder than others, but I'm hopeful that with time and these sessions, I'll be able to move past this. I want to use this experience to become stronger, maybe even help others who've been through similar situations.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive outlook. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: Thank you. I really appreciate your support and guidance through this process. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't judge me for my fears and anxieties.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. That's what I'm here for.",
    "Client: I think I'm feeling a bit drained now. Talking about the accident in such detail... it's brought up a lot of emotions. But I also feel like I've made some progress today.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Let's wrap up here."
