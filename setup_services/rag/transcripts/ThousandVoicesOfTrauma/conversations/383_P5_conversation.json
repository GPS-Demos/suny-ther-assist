    "Therapist: Good morning, Mr. Singh. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Good morning, Doctor. I'm... I'm okay, I suppose. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares lately about... about what happened when I was a child. It's bringing up a lot of anxiety.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you ready to discuss it?",
    "Client: I think so. But I'm not sure what to expect. Can you explain a bit more about what this involves? I'm worried it might make things worse.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Imaginal exposure helps process traumatic memories. It may be uncomfortable but can reduce PTSD symptoms. Shall I elaborate?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I'm particularly concerned about how this relates to my childhood experiences and the recent incidents of police brutality I've been hearing about. It's all getting mixed up in my head, and I'm finding it hard to separate the past from the present.",
    "Therapist: I see. Imaginal exposure helps distinguish past from present. We'll focus on your childhood memories. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That makes sense, I suppose. But I'm still worried about reliving those memories. What if I can't handle it? What if it triggers a panic attack? I've been struggling to keep my anxiety under control as it is.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace. I'll be here to support you throughout. How does that reassurance feel?",
    "Client: It helps a little. I appreciate your support. I guess I'm just scared of facing those memories head-on. They've been buried for so long. But I also know that I can't keep living like this, with the nightmares and the constant fear. I want to be better for my family, for my business. I'm tired of feeling trapped by my past.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. This process can be challenging but rewarding. Shall we discuss what to expect during the session?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think knowing what's coming might help me feel more prepared. And... I'm wondering, how long will this process take? Will I have to do this multiple times?",
    "Therapist: We'll likely have several sessions. Each time, it typically gets easier. Today, we'll start gradually. Does that help?",
    "Client: I see. Yes, that does help a bit. I suppose it's like exercise - it gets easier with practice. But what exactly will I be doing during these sessions? Will I need to describe everything in detail? I'm not sure I remember all the specifics anymore.",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the traumatic event in present tense. Share what you remember, including thoughts and feelings. We'll record it. Ready to hear more?",
    "Client: Recording it? That sounds... intense. But I understand why it might be necessary. I'm just worried about getting overwhelmed. Sometimes when I think about what happened, it feels like I'm right back there, like a small child again. How do I stay grounded in the present?",
    "Therapist: We'll use grounding techniques. I'll guide you throughout. Remember, you're safe here. How does this plan sound?",
    "Client: It sounds challenging, but I think I understand the purpose now. I appreciate your guidance and support. I'm still nervous, but I'm also feeling a glimmer of hope. Maybe this can really help me move forward. Is there anything else I should know or prepare for before we start?",
    "Therapist: Just be kind to yourself. This is brave work. Do you have any other questions before we begin?",
    "Client: I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Thank you for explaining everything so patiently. I'm grateful for your help and expertise. Let's do this - for my peace of mind, for my family, and for myself. I'm ready to face this and hopefully, finally start healing.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is inspiring. Let's begin. Remember, I'm here with you every step of the way."
