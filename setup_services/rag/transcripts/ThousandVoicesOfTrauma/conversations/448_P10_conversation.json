    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Ah, Doctor Ramirez, to be honest, I'm feeling a bit... uneasy. You know, at my age, dredging up old memories isn't easy. But I understand why we're doing this.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your honesty. Are you ready to begin the exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I suppose so. It's strange, talking about this... but yes, I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Good. Remember, use present tense. Start when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm... I'm at the docks. It's early morning, still dark. The air is heavy with salt and diesel. I'm loading crates onto a ship. My back aches, but I keep working. There are others around me, but we don't speak much. We're all... we're all afraid.",
    "Therapist: What do you see around you?",
    "Client: I see... large metal containers. The ship is enormous, looming over us. There are dim lights, casting long shadows. I hear... I hear muffled sounds coming from some of the containers. It makes my stomach churn.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 6. My hands are sweating just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: A man approaches. He's well-dressed, out of place here. He speaks to the foreman, pointing at specific containers. I try not to look, but... I can't help it. I know what's happening. I... I feel sick.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. It's hard to breathe. I want to run, but I can't. I need this job. I have a family to feed. But the guilt... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The sun is starting to rise now. The containers are being sealed. I hear... I hear a cry. It's faint, but unmistakable. A child. I... I drop the rope I'm holding. My coworker glares at me, tells me to keep working. But I can't move.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. This is... it's too much.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here in the room with me.",
    "Client: (deep breath) Okay... okay. I'm still there, but... The foreman is yelling now. The well-dressed man looks nervous. They're rushing to finish loading. I pick up the rope again, my hands shaking. I tell myself I have no choice, but... do I?",
    "Therapist: What do you want to do in that moment?",
    "Client: I want to open the containers. I want to let them out. But I'm... I'm a coward. I keep working. The ship is almost loaded now. The sun is fully up, casting a harsh light on everything. I see the faces of my coworkers. They look... haunted.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: The last container is loaded. The well-dressed man hands an envelope to the foreman. Money. Blood money. I feel... I feel dirty. Contaminated. The ship's horn blows. It's leaving. And I... I just stand there. Watching it go. Knowing what's on board. The guilt... it's crushing me.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I can barely breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. Ground yourself.",
    "Client: (inhales deeply) I'm... I'm still at the docks. The ship is gone now. We're cleaning up. No one speaks. We all know, but no one says anything. I... I think about my own children at home. Safe. And I think about the children on that ship. I... I start to cry. I can't help it.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: My coworker pats me on the back. He doesn't say anything, but... I know he understands. We finish cleaning in silence. I clock out, my hands still shaking. As I walk home, I... I vow to never work there again. But I know... I know the damage is already done.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. Exhausted. But also... relieved? Like a weight has been lifted. My SUDS is down to about a 6 now.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today, Carlos. How about we start winding down?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I... I never thought I'd be able to talk about this. It's been bottled up for so long.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great courage. Let's do some grounding exercises.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm... I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Name five things you can see in this room.",
    "Client: I see... your desk, the painting on the wall, the plant in the corner, my shoes, and the clock.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now four things you can touch.",
    "Client: The armrest of this chair, my wedding ring, the fabric of my shirt, and... the smoothness of my watch.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Three things you can hear?",
    "Client: The ticking of the clock, the hum of the air conditioner, and... my own breathing.",
    "Therapist: Two things you can smell?",
    "Client: The leather of this chair and... is that coffee?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it is. And finally, one thing you can taste?",
    "Client: The mint from the gum I was chewing earlier.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... more present. More grounded. My SUDS is down to about a 3 now.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Carlos. How do you feel about today's session?",
    "Client: It was... intense. Difficult. But also... freeing? I've carried this for so long. Talking about it... it helps. I didn't think it would, but it does.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. Remember, healing is a process.",
