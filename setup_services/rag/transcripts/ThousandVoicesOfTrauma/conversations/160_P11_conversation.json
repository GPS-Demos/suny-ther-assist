    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Lee?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's strange, you know? I've lived with these memories for so long, but talking about them like this... it's different. My heart's still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you?",
    "Client: The sounds. I could hear the helicopters so clearly, and the gunfire... it was like I was right back there in Vietnam. I could almost smell the jungle. And then there was this moment when I saw my buddy, Tom, get hit. I... I haven't thought about that specific moment in years.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory?",
    "Client: It was... intense. Scary, but also... I don't know, maybe a little liberating? I've been avoiding thinking about it for so long. But talking about it, I felt this wave of sadness and guilt. I keep wondering if I could've done something different, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. How does this connect to your daily life now?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... I've always been on edge, especially around loud noises. And I've pushed people away, afraid of losing them like I lost Tom. But going through this memory today, I realized how much it's still affecting me. It's like I've been stuck in that moment for decades.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. What else?",
    "Client: I... I think I've been so focused on the trauma that I've forgotten about the good times. We had some laughs too, you know? It wasn't all bad. Maybe I need to remember those moments too.",
    "Therapist: That's a valuable perspective. How do you feel about continuing this process?",
    "Client: It's tough, doc. Really tough. But... I think it's helping. I feel like I'm finally facing this head-on instead of running from it. It's exhausting, but also... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful?",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. What's your takeaway from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'm starting to see that these memories don't have to control me. They're a part of me, sure, but they don't define me. And maybe, just maybe, by facing them, I can start to let go of some of this weight I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How can you apply this moving forward?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to be more open with my family. They've been trying to understand, but I've shut them out. Maybe sharing some of these experiences, the good and the bad, might help them understand me better. And... I think I need to start doing some of those grounding exercises you taught me when the memories get overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Excellent ideas. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm tired, but... okay. Better than I expected, actually. It's like... like I've taken a step forward, you know? It's a small step, but it feels significant.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I guess. For listening, for guiding me through this. I know we have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like there might be a light at the end of this tunnel.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yeah, I'll be here. It's not easy, but... I'm ready to keep going. One memory at a time, right?"
