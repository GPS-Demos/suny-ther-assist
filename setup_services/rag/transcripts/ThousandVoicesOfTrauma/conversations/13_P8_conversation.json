    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken up, to be honest. It's like I was right back there in the hospital, you know? The smell of antiseptic, the beeping of the machines... it all felt so real. My heart's still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: It's a mix of things. There's this overwhelming sense of fear, like I'm back in that moment when the doctor told me about my diagnosis. I can feel my hands getting clammy just thinking about it. But there's also this... I don't know, almost a feeling of anger? Like, why did this have to happen to me? I've always tried to take care of myself, you know?",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. Tell me more about that anger.",
    "Client: Well, it's... it's not just directed at the illness itself. I think I'm angry at myself too. I keep thinking about all the times I turned to alcohol to cope with stress. Did that contribute to my condition? Could I have prevented this somehow? And then I feel guilty for even thinking that way. It's a vicious cycle.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you're talking about this?",
    "Client: My shoulders are tense, like I'm carrying a heavy weight. There's this knot in my stomach that won't go away. And I notice I'm clenching my jaw. It's like my whole body is on high alert, even though I know I'm safe here.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep hearing the doctor's voice, you know? \"It's serious, but we'll do everything we can.\" And then my mind jumps to all the worst-case scenarios. What if the treatment doesn't work? What if I end up alone and unable to care for myself? It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts and feelings compare to when you first received the diagnosis?",
    "Client: They're... they're not as intense as they were then. Back then, it felt like the world was ending. Now, it's more like... like a storm cloud that follows me around. It's always there, but sometimes it's just a light drizzle, and other times it's a full-on downpour. Today, it feels like somewhere in between.",
    "Therapist: What helps you weather that storm?",
    "Client: Hmm... I've been trying to focus on the present more. Like, reminding myself that right now, in this moment, I'm okay. And... and talking about it helps too. Not just here in therapy, but with my roommate and some close friends. It's still hard, but it feels less lonely.",
    "Therapist: That's a great observation. How else has your perspective changed?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'm starting to see my illness as something I'm dealing with, rather than something that defines me. It's still scary, don't get me wrong. But I'm trying to approach it with a bit more... I don't know, acceptance maybe? And I'm more aware of how my past coping mechanisms, like drinking, weren't really helping. I'm trying to find healthier ways to deal with stress now.",
    "Therapist: What's that process been like for you?",
    "Client: It's been challenging, to say the least. There are days when I really crave a drink, especially when the memories of my diagnosis are particularly vivid. But I'm learning to sit with those uncomfortable feelings instead of trying to numb them. It's not easy, but... I think it's helping me process things better in the long run.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about your progress?",
    "Client: I... I have mixed feelings. Some days, I feel like I'm making real progress. I can talk about my illness without feeling like I'm going to break down. But other days, it feels like I'm right back at square one. It's frustrating, you know? But I guess... I guess that's part of the process?",
    "Therapist: Indeed. What helps you on those difficult days?",
    "Client: Well, I've been trying to practice some of the mindfulness techniques we've talked about. Sometimes just taking a few deep breaths can help ground me. And I've been keeping a journal, which helps me get some of those swirling thoughts out of my head. Oh, and I've started going for walks in the park near my place. There's something about being in nature that helps put things in perspective.",
    "Therapist: How does reflecting on this experience make you feel now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a bit of a rollercoaster, to be honest. There's still fear there, definitely. But there's also... I don't know, maybe a tiny bit of pride? Like, I've been through something really tough, and I'm still here, still fighting. And talking about it like this, it makes me realize how far I've come. It's not easy, but... I think I'm stronger than I give myself credit for sometimes.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's next for you in this journey?",
    "Client: I think... I think I want to focus on rebuilding some of the relationships that suffered when I was at my lowest. Especially with my sister. We used to be so close, but I pushed her away when I got sick. I'm nervous about reaching out, but I think it's important. And I want to continue working on my sobriety. It's hard, but I know it's crucial for my health, both physical and mental.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like meaningful goals. How do you feel as we wrap up today?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense? Like I've let out a lot of stuff that's been bottled up. There's still a lot to work through, but I feel a bit lighter. Thank you for listening and guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and we'll continue next week."
