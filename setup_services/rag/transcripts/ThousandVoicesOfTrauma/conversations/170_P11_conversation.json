    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Patel?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's strange, you know? Even though it happened years ago, going through that car accident memory feels so vivid. My heart's still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sound. The screeching of tires and then that awful crunch of metal. It's like I can still hear it echoing in my ears. And the smell of burnt rubber... it's so strong in my mind. I didn't realize how much I'd suppressed these details.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit those sensations?",
    "Client: It was... intense. Scary, even. For a moment, I felt like I was right back there, trapped in the car. My chest tightened, and I had this overwhelming urge to escape. But then I reminded myself that I was here, safe in your office. It's a strange mix of relief and lingering anxiety.",
    "Therapist: You did well grounding yourself. How does this compare to your daily experiences?",
    "Client: You know, it's not that different from when I'm driving now. I get these flashes of panic, especially at intersections. But going through it here... it's like I'm facing it head-on instead of trying to push it away. It's exhausting, but also... I don't know, maybe a bit empowering?",
    "Therapist: That's a valuable insight. How might this experience inform your recovery?",
    "Client: I think... maybe it's showing me that I can face these memories without completely falling apart. Don't get me wrong, it's tough. But if I can sit here and talk about it without losing control, maybe I can start to regain some confidence in my daily life. Especially with driving.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's one thing you'd like to work on before our next session?",
    "Client: I've been avoiding long drives, especially on highways. Maybe... maybe I could try a short trip on the freeway? Just a few exits. It feels scary to even consider, but after today, I think I might be ready to give it a shot.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful goal. How will you prepare for that?",
    "Client: Well, I could use some of the breathing techniques we've practiced. And maybe I'll ask my wife to come along for support. Oh, and I'll remind myself that even if I feel anxious, I've proven today that I can handle those feelings without losing control.",
    "Therapist: Excellent plan. How are you feeling about our session overall?",
    "Client: It was tough, no doubt about that. But I'm... I'm actually feeling a bit proud of myself. I didn't think I could face that memory so directly. It's like I've taken a step forward, you know? Still a long way to go, but it feels like progress.",
    "Therapist: That's great self-awareness. Any final thoughts before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I'm starting to see a glimmer of hope that I might be able to move past this trauma. I'm nervous about trying that drive, but also a bit excited to see if I can do it.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great courage today. We'll discuss your experience next time.",
    "Client: Absolutely. I'm dreading it a bit, but also looking forward to it, if that makes sense. It's like... I'm finally taking control back, bit by bit. I just hope I can keep this momentum going.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive outlook. Remember to use your coping strategies.",
    "Client: I will. I've got them written down, and I'll review them before I try the drive. It's funny, I used to think these techniques were a bit silly, but now I'm realizing how helpful they can be. Especially that grounding exercise - it really helped me today during the exposure.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad you're finding them useful. Shall we schedule our next session?",
    "Client: Yes, please. Same time next week? I'll make sure to try that short highway drive before then. And... I think I'll start journaling about my experiences too. You mentioned it might help, and after today, I can see how getting my thoughts out might be beneficial.",
    "Therapist: That's a great idea. I'll see you next week, then.",
    "Client: Thank you again. I'm leaving feeling... well, not exactly relaxed, but maybe... lighter? Like I've put down a heavy load I've been carrying. It's a good feeling, even with the lingering anxiety. I'm actually looking forward to seeing what progress I can make this week.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive way to end. Take care, Mr. Patel."
