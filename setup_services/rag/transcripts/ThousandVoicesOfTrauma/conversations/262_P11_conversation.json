    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not really sure. It's a lot to process. The memory of that hurricane was so vivid, you know? I could almost feel the wind and hear the crashing of debris. It's like I was right back there, watching my neighborhood get torn apart. But then, as we were going through it, my mind kept jumping to those recent news stories about police brutality. It's weird how those two things got mixed up in my head.",
    "Therapist: What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The overwhelming feeling of helplessness, I guess. During the hurricane, we were at the mercy of nature. And now, with all these stories about police violence, it feels like we're at the mercy of a system that's supposed to protect us. It's... it's terrifying, honestly.",
    "Therapist: How did your body respond?",
    "Client: My heart was racing the whole time. My palms got sweaty, and I felt this tightness in my chest. It's the same feeling I get when I'm having an anxiety attack. I... I didn't expect it to hit me so hard, you know?",
    "Therapist: What thoughts came up?",
    "Client: I kept thinking, \"I'm not safe. Nowhere is safe.\" It's like, the hurricane showed me that nature can destroy everything in an instant, and now these police brutality cases are making me feel like even the people who should be keeping us safe can't be trusted. It's... it's a lot to deal with.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your daily life?",
    "Client: I've been having trouble sleeping lately. I keep having nightmares about both the hurricane and police violence. And during the day, I'm constantly on edge. Every time I hear a siren or see a police car, I freeze up. It's affecting my studies too. I can't concentrate in class because I'm always worried about what might happen next.",
    "Therapist: What's different now compared to before?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... I'm talking about it more? Before, I tried to just push these feelings down and pretend everything was fine. But now, even though it's really hard, I'm actually facing these memories and fears head-on. It's scary, but... maybe it's a step forward?",
    "Therapist: How might this help your recovery?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe by confronting these fears, I can start to regain some sense of control? Like, I can't change what happened during the hurricane, and I can't single-handedly solve the issue of police brutality, but maybe I can change how I respond to these fears. Is that... is that what we're aiming for here?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. What strategies have helped so far?",
    "Client: The breathing exercises we've practiced have been helpful. When I feel myself starting to panic, I try to focus on my breath. And... and writing in that journal you suggested has been surprisingly helpful. It's like, getting the thoughts out of my head and onto paper makes them feel a bit less overwhelming. Oh, and talking to my roommate about some of this stuff has been good too. He's been really supportive.",
    "Therapist: Great progress. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: It's tough, I won't lie. There are days when I just want to give up and go back to avoiding everything. But... I think I'm starting to see some small improvements. Like, yesterday, I heard a loud noise outside that normally would have sent me into a panic, but I was able to use the breathing technique and calm myself down pretty quickly. So, yeah, I want to keep going. It's hard, but I think it's worth it. I just... I want to feel like myself again, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. What's your goal for next week?",
    "Client: I think... I want to try and face one of my smaller fears. Maybe... maybe I could walk past the police station near campus? I've been avoiding that street entirely, but I know it's not rational. So yeah, that's my goal. And I'll keep up with the journaling and breathing exercises too. Is that... is that a good plan?",
    "Therapist: Sounds perfect. Anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: I... I just wanted to say thank you. I know I'm not an easy patient, and this process is really scary for me. But I appreciate your patience and how you're guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone who believes I can get better, even when I'm not sure I believe it myself. So... yeah, thanks."
