    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling pretty shaken up, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel this tightness in my chest. It's like I was right back there, you know? The sounds, the smells... it all came flooding back.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I think. No, maybe... guilt? It's hard to separate them. I keep seeing the faces of my mates, the ones who didn't make it. And I feel this overwhelming sense of... I don't know, like I should have done more.",
    "Therapist: I see. Can you tell me more about that guilt?",
    "Client: It's... it's crushing. Like, I know logically that I did everything I could, but there's this voice in my head saying I should have been faster, smarter, braver. Maybe if I had, more of us would have made it out. And then I feel guilty for even being here, talking about it, when they can't.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really heavy. How does your body feel as you're talking about this?",
    "Client: My shoulders are tense, and my stomach feels like it's in knots. I've got this lump in my throat, too. It's like my body's trying to brace itself against the memories, you know?",
    "Therapist: I understand. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how unfair it all is. Why did I survive when others didn't? And then I feel selfish for even thinking that. It's like... I'm grateful to be alive, but at the same time, I feel like I don't deserve it. And then there's this anger, too. At the situation, at the enemy, at myself... it's all mixed up.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to process. How do these feelings compare to when you first came home?",
    "Client: They're... they're not as intense, I guess. Back then, it was like I was drowning in these emotions. Now, it's more like... waves. They come and go. But during the exposure, it felt just as raw as it did back then. It's scary how vivid it all still is.",
    "Therapist: I hear you. What do you think has changed since then?",
    "Client: Well, I think I'm better at recognizing these feelings now. Before, they'd just hit me out of nowhere and I'd be a mess. Now, I can at least name what I'm feeling. And... I guess I'm starting to accept that it's okay to have these reactions. It doesn't make me weak or... or broken.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant shift. How does that acceptance feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a relief, in a way. Like I'm not fighting myself as much. But it's also scary, you know? Accepting these feelings means accepting that what happened was real, that it changed me. And sometimes I worry about what that means for my future, for my family.",
    "Therapist: Can you elaborate on those worries?",
    "Client: Yeah, I... I worry that I'll never be the same person I was before. That my wife and kids will always see me as this... damaged goods, I guess. I worry that the nightmares and flashbacks will never fully go away, and that I'll always be on edge. And then there's this fear that if I fully process all of this, I'll lose the connection to my mates who didn't make it. It's like... holding onto the pain is the only way to honor them.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How does sharing this make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of things. There's some relief in getting it out there, like I'm not carrying it all alone anymore. But it's also embarrassing, you know? I was trained to be tough, to handle anything. And here I am, struggling with memories and emotions. But... I guess there's also a small part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe hopeful? Like maybe by talking about it, I can start to make sense of it all.",
    "Therapist: That hope is important. What do you think you need right now?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to be patient with myself. To remember that healing isn't linear, and that it's okay to have good days and bad days. And maybe... maybe I need to find a way to honor my mates that doesn't involve holding onto all this pain. I'm just not sure how to do that yet.",
    "Therapist: That's a thoughtful reflection. How can we work towards that?",
    "Client: I'm not entirely sure, to be honest. Maybe... maybe we could explore some ways to memorialize them that feel positive? And I think I need to keep working on opening up to my family. They want to support me, but I've been pushing them away. It's just... it's hard to let them see this side of me.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like meaningful steps. Shall we discuss this more next time?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think that would be good. This session was tough, but... I feel like we're making progress. It's exhausting, but in a different way than before. Like maybe I'm finally moving forward instead of just treading water, you know?",
    "Therapist: I'm glad you feel that way. How would you like to close our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to take a few deep breaths and try to ground myself before I leave. Maybe you could walk me through a quick relaxation exercise? I want to leave feeling a bit more centered.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's do that now."
