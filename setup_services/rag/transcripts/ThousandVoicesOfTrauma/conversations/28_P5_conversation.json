    "Therapist: Mr. Ahmadi, today we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of reliving those painful memories from my divorce... it's not something I'm looking forward to. But I understand it's necessary. I just hope I can handle it.",
    "Therapist: Your apprehension is natural. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about losing control of my emotions. I've worked hard to keep everything bottled up for so long. What if I can't stop crying? Or worse, what if I get angry and lash out? I'm not used to being vulnerable, especially at my age. It feels... undignified, somehow.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your honesty. How might we address these concerns?",
    "Client: I suppose it would help if I knew what to expect. Will you guide me through the process? And what happens if it becomes too overwhelming? I'm also curious about how this will help me in the long run. I mean, I've survived this long without facing these memories head-on. Why stir things up now?",
    "Therapist: Valid questions. Let me explain the process and benefits.",
    "Client: Alright, I'm listening. But I have to admit, part of me is still skeptical. I've always been the type to just push through difficulties. This feels like the opposite of that approach. It's almost as if we're intentionally reopening old wounds. I'm not sure I see the logic in that.",
    "Therapist: Understandable. Imaginal exposure helps process trauma memories, reducing their impact over time.",
    "Client: I see. So it's like facing the demon head-on instead of running from it. That makes sense, I suppose. But it's still daunting. How long does this process usually take? And what kind of changes can I expect to see in myself? I've been living with these feelings for so long, they've become a part of who I am. It's hard to imagine life without them.",
    "Therapist: The duration varies, but many see improvements within weeks. Shall we discuss coping strategies?",
    "Client: Yes, that would be helpful. I'm particularly concerned about managing any intense emotions that might come up during or after our sessions. As I mentioned, I'm not used to dealing with strong feelings. I've always prided myself on being logical and composed. This feels like it could really shake that foundation.",
    "Therapist: Understood. Let's explore grounding techniques and self-care practices.",
    "Client: That sounds good. I'm willing to try anything that might help. You know, the more we talk about this, the more I realize how much I've been affected by my past experiences. It's not just the divorce, but the bullying I endured in my youth as well. I never really connected the two before, but now I'm starting to see how they might be related. It's a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: Your insight is valuable. Ready to begin our first imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I think I am. I'm still nervous, but I feel more prepared now. Thank you for taking the time to explain everything and address my concerns. It means a lot to have someone listen without judgment. I just hope I can live up to your expectations and make progress. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Shall we start?"
