    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your baseline SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10. My stomach feels a little tight.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and describe the memory.",
    "Client: I'm walking home from work. It's getting dark. I hear sirens in the distance, and suddenly there are flashing lights behind me. My heart starts racing as I see two police officers approaching. They're shouting at me to stop and put my hands up. I'm confused and scared. I don't know what I've done wrong.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. My palms are sweating, and I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Keep going. You're doing well.",
    "Client: They're getting closer, and one of them has his hand on his holster. I'm terrified they might shoot me. I try to speak, but my voice is shaky. I manage to ask what I've done, but they ignore me. One officer roughly grabs my arm and twists it behind my back. The pain is sharp, and I cry out.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. I feel like I'm right there again. My arm hurts, and I'm shaking.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: I know, but it feels so real. They're handcuffing me now, the metal cold against my wrists. I'm pleading with them, trying to explain that there must be a mistake. But they're not listening. They're treating me like I'm nothing, like I don't matter. I feel so helpless and angry.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Still an 8. My chest feels tight, and I'm clenching my jaw.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: They push me against their car, and I hit my head. It stings, and I feel dizzy. I hear them talking about me like I'm not even there. One of them says something about \"these people\" always causing trouble. I feel a surge of anger and humiliation. I want to scream at them, tell them they're wrong, but I'm too scared to speak.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 9. I feel so angry and helpless. My whole body is tense.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant increase. What's happening in your body?",
    "Client: My heart is pounding, and I feel like I can't catch my breath. My hands are shaking, and I feel this overwhelming urge to run away.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm trying. In the memory, they're putting me in the back of the police car now. I'm crying, begging them to listen to me. I can see people on the street watching, and I feel so ashamed. I keep thinking about my family, my job. What if I lose everything because of this mistake?",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's still a 9. I feel so trapped and powerless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: We're driving to the station now. I'm in the back, and I feel like I can't breathe. The officers are talking and laughing up front like nothing's wrong. I'm thinking about all the stories I've heard about police brutality, and I'm terrified of what might happen to me at the station. I feel so alone and scared.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down a little. Maybe an 8 now. I'm still scared, but I'm also feeling exhausted.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm drained. My body feels heavy, and I have a headache. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little relieved? Like I've gotten through the worst part.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's start wrapping up.",
    "Client: Okay. As we're pulling into the station, I'm trying to calm myself down. I keep telling myself that the truth will come out, that this is all a mistake. I'm still scared, but I'm also starting to feel a tiny bit of hope.",
    "Therapist: Final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: I think it's down to a 6 now. I'm still shaken, but I'm starting to feel more present here in the room with you.",
