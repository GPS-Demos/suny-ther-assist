    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure exercise. Can you describe the animal attack in detail?",
    "Client: Okay... I was hiking in the woods near my cabin. It was a beautiful summer day, and I felt so peaceful. Suddenly, I heard a rustling in the bushes. Before I could react, a large brown bear emerged, standing on its hind legs. I froze in terror.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: The bear's eyes locked onto mine. I could smell its musty odor and hear its heavy breathing. My heart was pounding so hard I thought it might burst out of my chest. I knew I should play dead, but panic took over. I turned to run.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What happened next?",
    "Client: As I turned, I felt a sharp pain in my back. The bear's claws tore through my jacket and into my skin. I screamed in agony and stumbled forward. I could feel warm blood trickling down my back. The pain was excruciating.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can. It's too much. My heart is racing just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay. I managed to run a short distance before collapsing. I could hear the bear's heavy footsteps behind me. I thought, \"This is it. I'm going to die.\" The pain in my back was unbearable, and I was losing blood quickly.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Continue.",
    "Client: Suddenly, I heard shouting. Some other hikers had heard my screams and came running. They scared the bear away with air horns and flares. I was barely conscious at this point. The last thing I remember before passing out was someone pressing a cloth against my back and saying, \"Hold on, help is coming.\"",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Shaken. My palms are sweaty, and I can feel my heart racing. But... I also feel a sense of relief. Like I've faced something I've been avoiding for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're doing excellent work.",
    "Client: The next thing I knew, I was in a helicopter being airlifted to the hospital. The pain was still intense, but I felt a glimmer of hope. I remember looking out the window and seeing the vast forest below, thinking how close I came to never seeing it again.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. What happened at the hospital?",
    "Client: At the hospital, everything was a blur. Doctors and nurses rushing around, the bright lights, the beeping machines. I was immediately taken into surgery. The bear's claws had caused significant damage to my back muscles and had barely missed my spine. I was told later that if the cuts had been just a centimeter deeper, I might have been paralyzed.",
    "Therapist: That must have been terrifying. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... intense. I can almost smell the antiseptic of the hospital room. I spent weeks there, in constant pain, terrified of infection setting in. The physical therapy afterward was grueling. Every movement hurt, and I was scared I'd never fully recover.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The hardest part was the nightmares. For months after, I'd wake up in a cold sweat, feeling the bear's claws on my back. I became afraid to go outside, especially anywhere near wooded areas. The attack changed everything - my love for nature, my sense of security, even my relationships. I pushed people away because I didn't want them to see how broken I felt.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to acknowledge those feelings.",
    "Client: (Voice breaking) I still struggle with chronic pain from the injuries. Some days are better than others, but it's a constant reminder of what happened. I feel like I lost a part of myself that day in the woods, and I'm not sure I'll ever get it back.",
    "Therapist: You're very courageous for sharing this.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to talk about, but I think it helps. I want to move past this, to not let the fear control me anymore. But it's so difficult.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I think what scares me most is the randomness of it all. One moment I was enjoying a peaceful hike, and the next, fighting for my life. It makes me feel like danger could be lurking around any corner. How do I ever feel safe again?",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to feel that way. We'll work on that.",
    "Client: I hope so. I want to be able to enjoy nature again, to not flinch at every unexpected sound. I want to be the person I was before the attack - confident, adventurous, unafraid. But right now, that feels so far away.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength today. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... lighter somehow. Like I've set down a heavy burden I've been carrying for a long time. It's still painful to talk about, but I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can start to heal.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. We'll end here for today.",
    "Client: Thank you. This wasn't easy, but I'm glad we did it. I feel like I've taken a small step forward, even if there's still a long way to go."
