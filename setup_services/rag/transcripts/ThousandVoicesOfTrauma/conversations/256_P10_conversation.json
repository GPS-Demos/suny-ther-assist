    "Therapist: Welcome, Ali. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is terrified. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I guess so. Yeah, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in the hospital. The fluorescent lights are so bright, they're hurting my eyes. The air smells sterile, like disinfectant. I'm lying in a bed, and there's this constant beeping from the machines around me.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's happening now?",
    "Client: A nurse comes in. She's checking my vitals. I feel so weak, I can barely lift my head. My whole body aches. I'm scared... I don't know what's wrong with me.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 40? It's uncomfortable, but I can handle it.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: The doctor comes in. He's frowning, looking at my chart. He starts explaining something, but I can barely focus. I catch words like \"severe infection\" and \"compromised immune system.\" My heart's racing. I... I think I'm going to die.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. It's hard to breathe. I'm... I'm shaking.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Remember, this is just a memory. You're here, in this room, safe. Can you feel the chair beneath you?",
    "Client: Y-yeah. I can feel it. It's... it's grounding.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's higher. Maybe 60?",
    "Therapist: Alright. You're doing well. Continue with what happened next.",
    "Client: My parents arrive. They look so worried. Mom's crying, and Dad's trying to comfort her. I've never seen them like this before. It makes everything feel more real, more serious. I want to reassure them, but I can't even speak. I'm so tired.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about all the things I haven't done yet. I haven't finished college, I haven't fallen in love, I haven't... I haven't told anyone about what happened to me as a kid. I feel so alone, even with my parents here.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Ali. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's pretty high. Maybe 75?",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. Remember, you survived this. You're here now.",
    "Client: Right. Yeah. I'm here now. Okay... The next few days are a blur. I'm in and out of consciousness. There are more tests, more doctors. I overhear them talking about \"aggressive treatment\" and \"last resort options.\" Every time I wake up, I'm terrified it might be the last time.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your surroundings during these moments?",
    "Client: The room is always dim. There's a window, but the blinds are usually closed. I can hear the constant hum of machines. Sometimes, I hear other patients coughing or crying in nearby rooms. It makes me feel less alone, but also more scared.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. It's intense, but I can handle it. Maybe a 70 on the distress scale?",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Keep going.",
    "Client: One night, I wake up and I can't breathe. I'm gasping for air. Alarms are going off, and suddenly the room is full of people. They're putting an oxygen mask on me, injecting something into my IV. I'm panicking. I think... I think this is it. This is how I die.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay. I'm... I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I don't remember much after that. The next clear memory I have is waking up a few days later. The doctor is there, smiling this time. He's telling me the treatment worked, that I'm going to be okay. I don't believe him at first. It doesn't feel real.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: Weak. So, so weak. But there's this... lightness. Like a weight has been lifted. I'm exhausted, but I'm alive.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's lower. Maybe a 50? I feel... I don't know. Relieved, I guess?",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this well. What happens as you start to recover?",
    "Client: It's slow. So frustratingly slow. I have to learn to walk again, to feed myself. My parents are there every day. I start to feel guilty for putting them through this. And... and I start thinking about the abuse again. About how I never told anyone. How close I came to taking that secret to my grave.",
    "Therapist: That's a heavy realization. How does it make you feel?",
    "Client: Angry. Sad. I feel like I've wasted so much time being afraid. Nearly dying... it put things in perspective, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight, Ali. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. It's weird, but I feel stronger. Like, if I could survive this, maybe I can face the other stuff too.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent observation. Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's down to maybe 30? I feel... I don't know. More in control?",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today, Ali. How do you feel about ending the exposure here?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think that's good. It was... it was intense, but I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: I'm proud of you for facing this memory. Remember, you survived not just the illness, but everything that came before it. You're resilient.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I'm starting to believe that.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end the session.",
    "Therapist: Well done, Ali. We'll process this more next time. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm tired, but... good. Like I've accomplished something important.",
    "Therapist: You have. Take care of yourself for the rest of the day, okay?",
    "Client: I will. Thank you."
