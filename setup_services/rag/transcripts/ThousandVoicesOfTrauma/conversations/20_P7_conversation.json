    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Are you ready to revisit the memory of witnessing violence?",
    "Client: I... I think so. It's still hard to think about, but I'll try.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great already. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay. I was walking home from the library late one night. It was dark, and the streets were mostly empty. I heard shouting coming from an alley up ahead. As I got closer, I saw two men fighting. One of them had a knife...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: The man with the knife was tall, wearing a dark hoodie. The other guy was shorter, backing away with his hands up. I froze, not knowing what to do. The tall man lunged forward, and I heard a scream...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I saw blood. The shorter man fell to the ground, clutching his stomach. The attacker looked around, and for a second, our eyes met. I thought he might come after me next...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel scared. You're safe now.",
    "Client: My heart was racing. I couldn't move. The attacker ran past me, bumping my shoulder as he fled. I wanted to help the injured man, but I was terrified...",
    "Therapist: That must have been overwhelming. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Shaky. My hands are sweating. It's like I'm back there again.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: I finally managed to call 911. I stayed with the injured man until the ambulance came. There was so much blood... I kept thinking, what if I had intervened earlier? Maybe I could have prevented it.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those thoughts, but remember, you're not responsible for the attacker's actions.",
    "Client: I know, but the guilt still haunts me. For weeks after, I couldn't sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that man's face, the knife, the blood...",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job describing this. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Anxious. My heart is pounding. But... it's not as bad as before. Talking about it... it helps, somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. You're facing this memory courageously.",
    "Client: I've never told anyone all the details before. It's hard, but I feel... I don't know, maybe a little lighter?",
    "Therapist: That's a positive sign. You're processing this trauma.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess so. It's still painful, but not as overwhelming as it used to be. I used to avoid that street completely, but last week, I walked by there during the day. It was tough, but I did it.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant achievement. How do you feel about that now?",
    "Client: Proud, I guess. And a little surprised at myself. I didn't think I could do it.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You're showing great strength.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's still a work in progress, but I feel like I'm finally moving forward instead of being stuck in that moment.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent insight. Shall we pause here for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. This was intense, but... helpful. Thank you.",
    "Therapist: You've done remarkable work today. We'll continue next session."
