    "Therapist: Alright, Carlos. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day of the earthquake.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in my office. It's a normal day, then suddenly everything starts shaking. The ground is moving so violently, I can hear things crashing all around me. My heart is racing, and I'm frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, about a 6. I can feel my palms getting sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: The shaking gets worse. I try to move under my desk, but I stumble. There's so much noise - people screaming, glass breaking. I'm terrified we're all going to die.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to an 8. My chest feels tight, and I'm starting to breathe faster.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Continue.",
    "Client: Right... So, I'm under the desk. The building is groaning, and I can see cracks forming in the walls. I'm thinking about Maria, my wife, wondering if she's safe. Then I hear a loud crash, and part of the ceiling collapses near me. I'm covered in dust, coughing, and I can't see clearly.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. I feel like I'm right back there. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Carlos. Remember, you survived this. What happened next?",
    "Client: The shaking starts to slow down. I'm still under the desk, afraid to move. I can hear people crying and calling for help. I want to help them, but I'm paralyzed with fear. I feel so ashamed of my cowardice.",
    "Therapist: Your current SUDS?",
    "Client: It's still at 9. I feel a lump in my throat, and my eyes are stinging with tears.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel emotional. This was a traumatic experience. Keep going.",
    "Client: I finally gather the courage to crawl out. The office is destroyed. There's debris everywhere, and I can see some of my coworkers are injured. I start helping people out of the building, but I'm shaking so badly I can barely stand.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down a bit. Maybe a 7? I feel a mix of relief that I'm helping and guilt that I didn't act sooner.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. What happens as you leave the building?",
    "Client: We get outside, and the city looks like a war zone. Buildings are damaged, cars overturned. I'm overwhelmed by the destruction. But then I see Maria running towards me, and I break down crying. We hold each other, both of us sobbing with relief.",
    "Therapist: Your current SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5 now. I feel drained, but also grateful we both survived.",
    "Therapist: You've done extremely well, Carlos. Let's take a few deep breaths together."
