    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I know we're going to be talking about the car accident again, and it's still difficult for me to think about.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate that. It's just... every time I think about it, my heart starts racing, and I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's begin when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay. I'll try. So, I was driving home from work. It was a rainy evening, and the roads were slick. I remember gripping the steering wheel tightly, trying to focus on the road ahead. The windshield wipers were going back and forth, but it was still hard to see clearly.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going.",
    "Client: Suddenly, I saw headlights coming towards me. They were in my lane, getting closer and closer. I panicked. I tried to swerve, but the car started to skid. I could hear the screeching of tires, and then... the impact. It was so loud. Metal crunching, glass shattering. I felt like I was spinning, out of control.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with it.",
    "Client: I... I can feel my heart racing now, just like it did then. My hands are shaking. I remember the airbag deploying, the smell of smoke and rubber. Everything hurt. I was so scared, thinking I might die there, trapped in the car.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I know, but it feels so real. I can hear people shouting, sirens in the distance. I was crying, trying to move, but my body wouldn't respond. The rain was coming in through the broken window, mixing with my tears and blood.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Keep going.",
    "Client: I remember thinking about my family, wondering if I'd ever see them again. The paramedics arrived, and they were talking to me, but their voices sounded so far away. They had to use the jaws of life to get me out. The sound of metal being torn apart... it was terrifying.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Thank you. It's hard, but I'm trying. As they were pulling me out, I felt this sharp pain in my leg. I screamed. They quickly put me on a stretcher and into the ambulance. The lights were so bright, and everything was moving so fast. I kept asking about the other driver, but no one would tell me anything.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: In the hospital, everything was a blur. Doctors, nurses, tests... I was in and out of consciousness. When I finally came to, I learned that I had a broken leg, several fractured ribs, and a concussion. The other driver... he didn't make it. I felt so guilty, even though they told me it wasn't my fault. He had been drinking.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those feelings. You're processing well.",
    "Client: I still struggle with that guilt sometimes. The physical pain eventually subsided, but the emotional trauma... it's been much harder to shake. Every time I get in a car now, I feel tense. Rainy days are the worst. I keep reliving that moment, wondering if there was something I could have done differently.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. My heart is still racing a bit, but talking about it... it helps. It's like each time I tell the story, it loses a little bit of its power over me. I know I still have a long way to go, but I'm trying.",
    "Therapist: You've made excellent progress today. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. It means a lot to hear that. I know it's not easy, but I'm committed to working through this. I want to be able to drive again without fear, to enjoy rainy days like I used to. I want to honor the life that was lost by living mine fully.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful goal. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: I am, in a way. It's been a long journey, and I know I'm not at the end yet, but I can see progress. Some days are harder than others, but I'm learning to cope better. I'm grateful for this therapy and for the support I've received.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable resilience. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. Thank you for guiding me through this. It's never easy, but I always feel a sense of accomplishment after our sessions.",
    "Therapist: You've earned that feeling. Take care, Sarah."
