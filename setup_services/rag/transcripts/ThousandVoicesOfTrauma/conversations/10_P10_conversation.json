    "Therapist: Welcome, Raj. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a lot on my mind. The idea of revisiting that night... it's daunting.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start slowly. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that night. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I'm in our living room. It's late, maybe 11 PM. The lights are dim, and I can hear the hum of the refrigerator from the kitchen. Priya's... she's sitting on the couch, her knees pulled up to her chest. She looks small, vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm pacing. My fists are clenched. I'm so angry, I can feel my heart pounding in my chest. Priya's saying something, but I can barely hear her over the blood rushing in my ears.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 6? It's getting intense.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I start yelling. God, I hate remembering this. I'm shouting about how she never listens, how she's always undermining me. Priya's crying now, but I can't stop. I pick up a vase from the coffee table and throw it against the wall. The crash is so loud...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My... my hands are shaking. I feel hot, like my skin is on fire. There's this tightness in my chest, like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... Priya's sobbing now. She's begging me to calm down, but I can't. I grab her arm, hard. I can see the fear in her eyes. It's... it's like I'm not even myself anymore.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Raj. Remember, you're just observing now. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I pull Priya off the couch. She stumbles, nearly falls. I'm towering over her, screaming in her face. I can smell the alcohol on my breath. God, I was so drunk. Priya's trying to push me away, but I'm so much stronger than her.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I raise my hand. Priya flinches, covers her face. And then... and then I see it. The bruise on her arm from last week. It's... it's like a bucket of cold water. I stumble backward, horrified at what I was about to do.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Disgusted. Ashamed. I... I can't believe I did that to her. To someone I love.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. Keep going.",
    "Client: Priya's crying softly now. She won't look at me. I try to approach her, to apologize, but she backs away. The fear in her eyes... it's like she doesn't even recognize me anymore. And honestly, I don't recognize myself either.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. This is really intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Raj. Remember to breathe. What happens after that?",
    "Client: I... I grab my keys and leave. I can't face what I've done. I drive around for hours, ending up at some dingy bar. I drink until I can barely stand, trying to forget. But I can't. The image of Priya's face, the fear in her eyes... it's burned into my mind.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that image. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Guilt. So much guilt. And shame. I feel like a monster. How could I do that to her? To anyone?",
    "Therapist: These are difficult emotions, but it's important to face them. Continue.",
    "Client: I... I wake up the next morning on a park bench. My head's pounding, and for a moment, I hope it was all a bad dream. But then I see the bruises on my knuckles from punching the wall, and it all comes rushing back. I feel sick, not just from the hangover, but from the weight of what I've done.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I go home. The apartment's a mess. There's broken glass everywhere. Priya's gone. There's a note on the fridge saying she's staying with her sister. I break down crying. I've ruined everything.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Overwhelmed. Devastated. It's like I'm reliving it all over again.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still a 9. Maybe even a 10.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Raj. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I clean up the apartment. Every broken piece I pick up is a reminder of what I've done. I try to call Priya, but she doesn't answer. I leave voicemails, begging her to come back, promising I'll change. But even as I'm saying the words, I don't know if I believe them.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking at this moment?",
    "Client: That I've lost her. That I've become the very thing I always swore I'd never be. I'm thinking about my father, how I promised myself I'd never be like him. And here I am, following in his footsteps.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those thoughts. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I call my brother. I tell him everything. He's silent for a long time, and then he tells me I need help. He's right, of course, but hearing it... it makes it real. I spend the rest of the day researching anger management programs, therapists, anything that might help me.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Scared. Hopeful, maybe? But mostly terrified. I don't know if I can change, if Priya will ever forgive me, if I can ever forgive myself.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those things. What happens in the following days?",
    "Client: Priya comes back after a few days to get some clothes. She won't look at me, won't let me near her. I try to apologize, but the words feel hollow. She tells me she needs time, that she doesn't know if she can trust me again. I don't blame her.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7?",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The next few weeks are a blur. I start therapy, join a support group. I'm trying to understand why I did what I did, why I let my anger control me. It's hard, facing all these ugly parts of myself. But I know I have to if I ever want a chance at making things right.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that process?",
    "Client: It's... it's exhausting. Painful. But also... necessary? I feel like I'm finally facing things I've been running from my whole life. My relationship with my father, my own insecurities, my need for control... it's all coming to the surface.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to process. How are you coping?",
    "Client: Some days are better than others. I'm learning to recognize my triggers, to catch myself before I explode. I'm trying to be more open, more vulnerable. It's terrifying, but... I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: What about Priya?",
    "Client: We're... we're talking. Slowly. She's still living with her sister, but she's agreed to couples counseling. I don't know if we'll make it, but I'm committed to doing the work, whether we stay together or not.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Scared. Hopeful. Grateful for the chance. I know I don't deserve it, but I'm determined not to waste it.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 5, I think. Talking about it, facing it... it's hard, but it's also a relief.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well today, Raj. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Drained. But... lighter, somehow? Like I've finally started to face this thing that's been haunting me. I know there's still a long way to go, but... I feel like maybe, just maybe, there's hope.",
    "Therapist: That's a great place to end. Well done, Raj."
