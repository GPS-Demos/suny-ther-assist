    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, John?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. Going back to that moment when I was wrongfully imprisoned, it's like I'm right there again. The cold walls, the isolation, the overwhelming sense of injustice. It's hard to shake off.",
    "Therapist: What stood out most to you this time?",
    "Client: The helplessness. I felt so powerless, you know? Like my whole life was stripped away in an instant. I keep replaying the moment they closed that cell door. The sound of it locking... it still makes my heart race.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel right now?",
    "Client: Tense. Really tense. My shoulders are tight, and I notice I'm clenching my jaw. It's like my body is still on high alert, even though I know I'm safe here.",
    "Therapist: That's important to notice. What else?",
    "Client: I... I feel angry. Not just at the system that failed me, but at myself. I keep thinking I should have done something differently, fought harder, or... I don't know. It's irrational, I know, but the feeling is still there.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your daily life now?",
    "Client: I guess... I'm always on edge. Always waiting for the other shoe to drop. It's affected my relationships, especially with my wife. I have a hard time trusting that good things will last. And sometimes, I push people away before they can hurt me.",
    "Therapist: What's one thing you learned today?",
    "Client: That... that maybe I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. I survived that experience. And reliving it here, as painful as it is, I'm still standing. That has to count for something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How does that realization feel?",
    "Client: It's... comforting, in a way. But also scary. Because if I'm strong enough to face this, what's stopping me from moving forward? It's like... I've been using my trauma as a shield, and now I'm not sure what to do without it.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What next?",
    "Client: I think... I need to work on trusting again. Not just others, but myself. Maybe I can start by sharing more with my wife about what I'm going through here in therapy. It's hard, but... I think it might help.",
    "Therapist: How can you support yourself in this?",
    "Client: I... I could try using some of the grounding techniques we've practiced when I feel overwhelmed. And maybe... maybe I could start a journal? Writing down my thoughts might help me process things better between sessions.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great plan. Anything else?",
    "Client: I just... I want to thank you. This isn't easy, but I feel like I'm finally starting to see a way forward. It's terrifying and exciting at the same time. I know we have more work to do, but for the first time in a long time, I feel... hopeful.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredible work today, John. How do you want to close?",
    "Client: I think... I want to take a moment to breathe. To remind myself that I'm here, I'm safe, and I'm moving forward. And to acknowledge that while what happened to me was unjust and traumatic, it doesn't define my future. I'm more than what happened to me.",
    "Therapist: Beautifully said. Let's do that together."
