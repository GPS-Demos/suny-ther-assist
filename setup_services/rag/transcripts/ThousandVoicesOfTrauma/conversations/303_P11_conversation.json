    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. That memory of witnessing the violence between my parents... it's just so vivid, you know? I can still hear the shouting, the sound of glass breaking. It's like I'm right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The fear, definitely. I remember feeling so small and helpless, like I couldn't do anything to stop it. And the confusion... I didn't understand why they were hurting each other. I think what really hit me this time was realizing how much that fear has stayed with me, even now. It's like... it's shaped how I see relationships, how I interact with people.",
    "Therapist: How so?",
    "Client: Well, I've always had trouble trusting people, especially in romantic relationships. I guess I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop, you know? Like, even when things seem good, I'm on edge, expecting something bad to happen. It's exhausting, really. And I think that's why I've been single for so long. It just feels safer that way.",
    "Therapist: Mm. How does that realization feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually kind of liberating, in a weird way. Like, I've always known I had trust issues, but connecting it back to that specific memory, it makes sense now. It's not just me being paranoid or difficult. There's a reason behind it. But it also makes me sad, you know? Like, how much of my life have I missed out on because of this fear?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What else?",
    "Client: I noticed something else too. During the exposure, I kept feeling this urge to run away or hide. And I realized that's exactly what I do in my daily life when things get tough. I withdraw, I isolate myself. It's my go-to coping mechanism, but I'm starting to see that it might not always be the healthiest choice.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your goals?",
    "Client: I think... I think it shows me that I need to work on facing things head-on instead of always retreating. My anxiety has held me back in so many ways - in my studies, in making friends, in pursuing relationships. If I can learn to sit with the discomfort instead of running from it, maybe I can start to build the life I really want.",
    "Therapist: That's insightful. How can you apply this?",
    "Client: I've been thinking about that. Maybe I could start small, you know? Like, the next time I feel anxious about a social situation, instead of cancelling plans, I could try to push through and go anyway. Or in my classes, when I feel that urge to not speak up, I could challenge myself to contribute at least once. It's scary to think about, but I also feel a little excited. Like maybe there's hope for change.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How was today's session overall?",
    "Client: It was tough, really tough. Reliving that memory is never easy. But I feel like I've gained some valuable insights. It's like... it's like I'm starting to see the bigger picture of how my past has influenced my present. And even though that's painful, it also gives me a roadmap for where I need to focus my efforts. I'm grateful for that, even if the process is difficult.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great courage. Anything else?",
    "Client: I just... I want to thank you. For guiding me through this, for helping me make these connections. I know we still have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I'm moving forward instead of just treading water. It's a good feeling.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work. Ready to wrap up?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've really accomplished something today. I'm looking forward to seeing how I can apply what we've talked about in my daily life. It's scary, but also kind of exciting.",
    "Therapist: That's great. We'll continue next week. Take care.",
    "Client: Thank you. I will. See you next week."
