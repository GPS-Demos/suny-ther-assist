    "Therapist: Welcome, Ahmad. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I... I think so. To be honest, I'm feeling a bit anxious about revisiting the earthquake experience.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to help you process this. Let's start with your SUDS level.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say it's about a 6 right now. My hands are a little shaky.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Take a deep breath. When you're ready, close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in my apartment in Beirut. It's a hot August afternoon. I'm working at my desk, focused on a project deadline. The air conditioning is humming softly in the background.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's this low rumbling sound. At first, I think it's just a truck passing by, but then... the whole building starts to shake. My coffee mug rattles off the desk and shatters on the floor.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm frozen. My heart is racing. I can't believe this is happening. The shaking gets more intense, and I hear people screaming outside.",
    "Therapist: What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I stumble to the doorway. I remember hearing that's the safest place to be. The walls are creaking, and I can hear things falling and breaking all around me. I'm gripping the doorframe so tightly my knuckles are white.",
    "Therapist: How's your anxiety level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to an 8. My palms are sweating just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Take a deep breath. What do you see and hear next?",
    "Client: The shaking stops, but there's chaos outside. I can hear car alarms going off, people crying. I'm... I'm afraid to move. What if there's another tremor?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens after that?",
    "Client: I... I finally gather the courage to look out the window. There's dust everywhere. Some buildings down the street have partially collapsed. People are running in the streets, looking panicked. I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Ahmad. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. It's hard to breathe. I... I need a moment.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a few deep breaths. Focus on the present. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: When you're ready, continue with what you see.",
    "Client: I... I grab my phone to call my ex-wife and kids. The lines are jammed. I can't get through. I'm terrified something might have happened to them.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind at this point?",
    "Client: I feel so powerless. I should be there to protect them, but I can't even reach them. What kind of father am I? I... I start pacing, trying again and again to call.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those emotions. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I decide I need to go find them. As I'm grabbing my keys, there's another tremor. It's not as strong, but it sends me into a panic. I rush down the stairs, nearly falling.",
    "Therapist: How's your anxiety now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe a 9. My hands are shaking just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... I'm outside now. The streets are chaotic. People are crying, hugging each other. I see an old woman sitting on the curb, bleeding from her head. I... I want to help her, but I'm so focused on finding my family.",
    "Therapist: What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I stop for a moment. I tear a strip from my shirt and help bandage her head. She's muttering prayers in Arabic. I feel guilty leaving her, but I have to find my kids.",
    "Therapist: How does helping her make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... conflicting. I feel a small sense of purpose, but also overwhelming guilt. There are so many people who need help, and I can't do enough.",
    "Therapist: Continue with what happens next.",
    "Client: I start making my way towards my ex-wife's neighborhood. The streets are full of debris. I have to climb over fallen concrete and dodge around abandoned cars. I keep trying my phone, but nothing's getting through.",
    "Therapist: What are you experiencing physically?",
    "Client: My heart is pounding. I'm sweating, partly from exertion, partly from fear. My throat is dry from the dust in the air. I... I feel like I can't get enough oxygen.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Thank you... I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: As I get closer to their neighborhood, I see more destruction. Some buildings have completely collapsed. There are people digging through rubble, calling out names. I... I start running, panic rising in my chest.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens when you reach their street?",
    "Client: I... I turn the corner, and my heart stops. Their building... half of it has crumbled. There's a crowd gathered, people crying and shouting. I... I can't breathe. I push through the crowd, screaming their names.",
    "Therapist: How high is your anxiety now?",
    "Client: It's... it's off the charts. A 10. Maybe higher. I feel like I'm reliving it all over again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing very well, Ahmad. Remember, you're here with me. You're safe. Take a few deep breaths.",
    "Client: *shaky breaths* I... I'm trying.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, tell me what happens next.",
    "Client: I... I spot my ex-wife in the crowd. She's covered in dust, but she's alive. I rush to her, and she collapses in my arms, sobbing. She tells me the kids were at school when it happened. We don't know if they're okay.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in that moment?",
    "Client: Relief... and then immediate, crushing fear. I feel like I'm being torn in two directions. I want to comfort her, but I also want to run to the school immediately.",
    "Therapist: What do you decide to do?",
    "Client: I... I tell her we need to go to the school. We start making our way there, holding onto each other. The streets are even more chaotic now. Emergency vehicles are trying to get through, but there's so much debris.",
    "Therapist: How are you managing your fear as you walk?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm trying to stay focused on putting one foot in front of the other. I keep repeating in my head, \"They're okay, they're okay.\" But every time we pass a collapsed building, I feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: We finally reach the school. It's... it's still standing, thank God. But there's a crowd of frantic parents outside. Teachers are trying to organize, calling out names. I... I've never felt so scared and hopeful at the same time.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: We push through the crowd. I'm calling out my kids' names. Suddenly, I hear a small voice... \"Baba!\" I turn, and there they are. Both of them, scared but alive. I... I drop to my knees and hug them so tightly.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment with that feeling. How does your body respond?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. Tears are streaming down my face. I feel this immense wave of relief, but also... guilt. So many others weren't as lucky.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those conflicting emotions. How's your anxiety level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down. Maybe a 7? I still feel shaky, but having my family in my arms... it grounds me.",
    "Therapist: You've done very well, Ahmad. Let's take a few deep breaths together.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Thank you... I... I didn't think I could get through reliving that.",
    "Therapist: You showed great strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. Emotionally and physically. But also... I feel like I've faced something I've been avoiding for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. We'll end our session here. Take some time to care for yourself today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I will. This was hard, but... I think it was important.",
    "Therapist: It was. We'll continue to work through this in our next session. Take care, Ahmad."
