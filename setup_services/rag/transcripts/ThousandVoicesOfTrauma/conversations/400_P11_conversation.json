    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. Reliving that moment when we had to flee our village... it's bringing back a lot of emotions I've tried to bury for years. The fear, the uncertainty, the chaos... it's all so vivid again.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sounds. I could hear the screams, the gunfire in the distance. And... and the look on my wife's face. She was trying to be strong for our children, but I could see the terror in her eyes. It's haunting.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... difficult. My heart was racing, and I felt that same panic rising in my chest. But... but I also felt something else. A sense of... I don't know, maybe strength? Like I've survived this once, I can face it again.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does this connect to your daily life now?",
    "Client: I... I think it explains a lot. Why I'm always on edge, always expecting the worst. Even here, in safety, part of me is still back there, waiting for everything to fall apart again. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: I can imagine. What do you think might help you feel more present and safe?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe acknowledging that I'm not there anymore? That I'm here, in a different country, with my family safe beside me. It's hard to believe sometimes, but... but it's true.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent insight. How might you practice that?",
    "Client: I could... maybe I could start each day by reminding myself where I am. And when I feel that panic rising, I could... I could look around, ground myself in the present. It sounds simple, but it feels like it could make a difference.",
    "Therapist: Simple can be powerful. How are you feeling about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's scary, but... but I think it's necessary. I want to be free from this constant fear, to be fully present for my family. They've been through enough. They deserve a husband and father who's... who's truly here with them.",
    "Therapist: That's a commendable goal. What's one small step you can take this week?",
    "Client: I... I think I'll try that grounding technique. And maybe... maybe I'll talk to my wife about what we went through. We've avoided it for so long, but perhaps sharing might help us both.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful plan. Is there anything else on your mind?",
    "Client: I... I just want to thank you. This isn't easy, but I feel like I'm finally starting to understand myself better. It's... it's a strange mix of pain and hope.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. I have a lot to process, but... but I'm feeling more optimistic than I have in a long time. Thank you, doctor.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
