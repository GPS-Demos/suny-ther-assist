    "Therapist: Good morning, Mr. Lee. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Good morning, Doctor. I'm... I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. I know we've been working towards this, but the idea of revisiting those memories is making me anxious.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you ready to discuss it?",
    "Client: I think so. Can you remind me what exactly we'll be doing? I've been thinking about it all week, and I'm not sure I fully grasp the concept.",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll revisit your combat experiences through guided imagination. It helps process trauma memories.",
    "Client: I see. But won't that make things worse? I've spent years trying to forget those experiences.",
    "Therapist: It's a common concern. However, facing memories can actually reduce their power over you.",
    "Client: I understand the logic, but it's still frightening. What if I can't handle it? What if I break down?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace, and I'll be here to support you throughout.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I appreciate your patience with me, Doctor. It's not easy to open up about these things. In my culture, we're often taught to keep our problems to ourselves, especially men. But I know I need to do this for my family. My wife has been so supportive, but I can see the toll my PTSD takes on her too.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. What questions do you have about the process?",
    "Client: Well, how detailed do I need to be? There are some things... some images that I've never shared with anyone. They're horrific.",
    "Therapist: Share what you're comfortable with. We can gradually increase details in future sessions.",
    "Client: Okay, that makes me feel a bit better. And what about my anxiety? Sometimes when I think about those experiences, I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: We'll use grounding techniques if needed. Remember your breathing exercises?",
    "Client: Yes, I've been practicing those. They do help. It's just... this feels like a big step. But I want to get better. I want to be able to sleep through the night without nightmares, to enjoy time with my grandchildren without constantly being on edge.",

    "Therapist: You're welcome. Let's start with deep breathing. Close your eyes when you're ready."
