    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. We're diving into some heavy stuff today, and I can feel my heart racing already. But I know this is important, so I'm trying to stay focused.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's start with a quick grounding exercise. Can you tell me three things you see in the room?",
    "Client: Um, okay. I see... the blue painting on the wall, your potted plant in the corner, and the stack of books on your desk.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, let's begin. Remember, you're safe here. Start by describing where you are in your memory.",
    "Client: Alright. I'm... I'm in my apartment. It's late evening, and I'm watching TV. The news is on, and they're talking about a developing situation at the border. Human trafficking, they say. I feel a knot forming in my stomach as I listen.",
    "Therapist: What do you see on the TV?",
    "Client: There are images of people huddled together, looking scared and exhausted. The reporter is standing near a chain-link fence, and behind her, I can see border patrol vehicles. It's dark, but there are floodlights illuminating the area. God, those poor people...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... helpless. Angry. There's this surge of emotions, you know? I want to do something, but I'm just sitting here on my couch. My hands are clenched, and I realize I'm holding my breath.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 60. It's uncomfortable, but I can handle it.",
    "Therapist: Okay, continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: The news switches to a different story, but I can't shake what I've seen. I grab my phone and start searching for more information. The more I read, the more overwhelmed I feel. Stories of families separated, children lost in the system... It's too much. I'm scrolling frantically now, my breathing getting faster.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing well. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"This can't be happening. Not here, not now.\" But it is happening, and I feel so powerless. I remember the earthquake I survived years ago, how chaotic and terrifying it was. This feels similar somehow \u2013 that same sense of the world being turned upside down.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you're thinking about this?",
    "Client: Tense. Really tense. My shoulders are up to my ears, and there's this pressure in my chest. I feel like I need to do something, anything, but I don't know what.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Take another deep breath.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Okay... okay. I'm trying to calm down, but my mind keeps racing. I start thinking about volunteering, donating, anything to help. But then I spiral into thoughts of \"What if it's not enough? What if things just keep getting worse?\"",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What do you do next in your apartment?",
    "Client: I... I get up. I'm pacing now, back and forth across my living room. The TV is still on in the background, but it's just noise now. I'm muttering to myself, trying to make sense of it all. I grab a notepad and start scribbling down ideas, organizations to contact, ways I might be able to help.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's higher... maybe 75? I'm feeling really agitated.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I end up sitting back down, notepad in hand. I'm staring at what I've written, and suddenly I feel so small. The problem is so big, and I'm just one person. I can feel tears starting to form, and my throat feels tight. I'm angry at the traffickers, at the system that allows this to happen, at myself for not doing more sooner.",
    "Therapist: What do you do with those feelings?",
    "Client: I... I cry. I just sit there and cry for a while. It's not just about the trafficking anymore \u2013 it's everything. The earthquake, the constant stream of bad news, the feeling that the world is falling apart. I curl up on the couch, hugging a pillow, and I just let it all out.",
    "Therapist: That's a natural response. How long do you cry?",
    "Client: It feels like forever, but it's probably only about 15 minutes. Eventually, I start to calm down. My breathing slows, and I wipe my eyes. I feel... drained, but also a little clearer.",
    "Therapist: What do you do after you've calmed down?",
    "Client: I take a deep breath and look at my notepad again. This time, instead of feeling overwhelmed, I start to focus. I circle a few of the ideas I had \u2013 places where I could volunteer, organizations I could donate to. It still feels like a drop in the ocean, but it's something concrete I can do.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: A bit better. Like maybe I'm not completely powerless after all. I decide to email one of the organizations right then and there, asking about volunteer opportunities. As I'm typing, I can feel some of the tension leaving my body.",
    "Therapist: That's great. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 50. Still there, but more manageable.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Keep going.",
    "Client: After I send the email, I decide I need to step away from all of this for a bit. I turn off the TV and put my phone on silent. I head to the kitchen to make some tea \u2013 chamomile, something soothing. As the kettle boils, I find myself taking deep breaths, trying to center myself.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel now?",
    "Client: Still tense, but less so. My shoulders have dropped a bit, and the knot in my stomach has loosened. I'm focusing on the simple act of making tea \u2013 the warmth of the mug in my hands, the steam rising, the familiar smell.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I take my tea back to the living room and sit by the window. It's dark outside, but I can see the lights of the city. I sip my tea slowly, trying to stay present in the moment. I start thinking about the contrast \u2013 here I am, safe in my apartment, while so many others are suffering. But instead of spiraling again, I try to channel that into determination.",
    "Therapist: How do you do that?",
    "Client: I make a promise to myself. That I'll follow through with the volunteer work, that I'll educate myself more, that I'll find ways to make a difference, even if they're small. It doesn't completely erase the distress, but it gives me a sense of purpose.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Calmer. Still sad and a bit angry, but not overwhelmed anymore. My distress level is probably down to a 30 or 35. I finish my tea and decide to go to bed, knowing that tomorrow I can start taking concrete steps.",
    "Therapist: You've done an excellent job working through this memory. How are you feeling about the exercise?",
    "Client: It was tough, especially at the beginning. But I feel... I don't know, maybe a bit stronger? Like I've faced something difficult and come out the other side. And I think I understand my reactions better now.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Sarah. You showed real resilience. Let's take a few minutes to debrief and discuss some coping strategies for when these feelings come up in the future.",
    "Client: Okay, that sounds good. I'm feeling pretty drained, but also kind of... accomplished? Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a common feeling after working through a challenging memory. Let's talk about what you've learned and how you can apply it moving forward."
