    "Therapist: Alright, Mrs. Thompson, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I understand why we're doing this.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your SUDS rating now.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10. My heart's beating a little faster than usual.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and describe that day.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) It was a Sunday afternoon. I was in the kitchen, preparing dinner. I could hear the TV in the living room where my husband was watching a football game. The smell of roast beef filled the air...",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. My palms are getting sweaty as I remember him walking into the kitchen.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: He came in, complaining about the game. I could smell the alcohol on his breath. I tried to ignore him, focusing on peeling potatoes. But then he grabbed my arm, hard. I can still feel the pain...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: (Voice shaking) It's an 8. My chest feels tight. I can see his angry face so clearly...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Breathing deeply) He was yelling, his face red with anger. I tried to pull away, but he was so strong. I felt so helpless, like a child again. The potato peeler clattered to the floor...",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: (Sobbing) It's a 9. I can feel his grip on my arm, hear the awful things he said. I was so scared...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it.",
    "Client: (Through tears) He pushed me against the counter. The edge dug into my back. I remember thinking, \"This is it. He's finally going to really hurt me.\" I closed my eyes, waiting for the blow...",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: (Sniffling) It's still at 9. My heart's racing, and I feel like I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: But then... then I heard a crash. He'd knocked over a vase. It seemed to snap him out of his rage. He let go of me and stumbled out of the kitchen. I just stood there, shaking, listening to him curse as he left the house...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's come down to a 7. I feel drained, but also... relieved? Like I've let something go.",
    "Therapist: That's common. How do you feel physically?",
    "Client: My breathing's slower now. I feel tired, but not as tense. It's like a weight has lifted.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was hard, but... I think it helped. I feel stronger somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's great. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves before we end."
