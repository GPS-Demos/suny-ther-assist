    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Singh. Today, we'll be preparing for imaginal exposure. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... not great, to be honest. The thought of revisiting my time in prison makes me incredibly anxious. I've spent years trying to forget those experiences.",
    "Therapist: I understand. It's normal to feel anxious. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about losing control. What if I can't handle reliving those memories? I've worked hard to build a new life since my divorce and getting clean. I don't want to jeopardize that progress.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How do you think this exercise might affect your recovery?",
    "Client: I'm afraid it might trigger a relapse. The stress of remembering... it's intense. I've been using work to distract myself, but this feels like I'm voluntarily walking back into a nightmare. And living in shared accommodation, I worry about how I'll cope afterward if I'm emotionally raw.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. How can we make this process feel safer for you?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe if we could have a clear exit strategy? Like a way to stop if it becomes too much? And perhaps some techniques to ground myself afterward?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll establish a safe word and grounding exercises. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That helps, thank you. I guess I'm also curious about why we need to do this. Isn't it better to leave the past in the past?",
    "Therapist: Great question. Imaginal exposure helps process traumatic memories. Would you like to know more about how it works?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I need to understand why I'm putting myself through this.",
    "Therapist: It allows us to confront and reprocess the trauma in a safe environment, reducing its emotional impact over time.",
    "Client: I see. So it's like facing my fears head-on instead of avoiding them. That makes sense, but it's still scary. How long will this process take?",
    "Therapist: It varies for each person. We'll go at your pace. What are your thoughts on that?",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I'm still nervous, but I think I'm ready to try. My cultural background doesn't really encourage talking about these things, so this is a big step for me.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. How can I support you during this process?",
    "Client: Just... be patient with me, I suppose. And remind me why we're doing this if I start to doubt. Also, maybe we could incorporate some breathing exercises? I've found those helpful in managing stress at work.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll integrate breathing exercises. Any other questions before we begin?",
    "Client: I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Thank you for explaining everything and listening to my concerns. It means a lot, especially given how different our backgrounds are. I just hope this helps me move forward and maybe even improve my relationships, including with my kids.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your commitment to healing is inspiring. Shall we start with a brief relaxation exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, that sounds good. I'm nervous, but I'm also feeling a glimmer of hope. Let's do this."
