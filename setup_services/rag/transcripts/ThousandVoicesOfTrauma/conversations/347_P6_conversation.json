    "Therapist: Alright, let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Can you tell me about your experience during the natural disaster?",
    "Client: Okay... I was in my apartment when the earthquake hit. It started as a slight tremor, but then everything began to shake violently. I could hear glass shattering and people screaming outside. I tried to run to the doorway, but I stumbled and fell. The floor was moving so much, I couldn't get up. I was terrified, thinking the whole building might collapse on me.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 6 out of 10. My heart is starting to race just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: As I lay there on the floor, I could hear creaking noises all around me. The power went out, and suddenly I was in complete darkness. I felt so helpless and alone. I started to cry, thinking about my family and if they were okay. The shaking seemed to go on forever. I was convinced I was going to die there.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's gone up to an 8. My palms are sweaty, and I feel a tightness in my chest.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Take a deep breath. What happened next?",
    "Client: After what felt like an eternity, the shaking finally stopped. But I was too scared to move. I just lay there in the dark, sobbing and shaking. I could hear sirens and people shouting outside. The air was thick with dust, and I could barely breathe. I was afraid to call out for help in case it triggered another quake.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: Still at an 8. My throat feels tight, like I can't swallow.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: Eventually, I heard someone calling out, checking if anyone needed help. I managed to crawl to the door and open it. The hallway was a mess of debris and broken glass. My neighbor helped me out of the building. When we got outside, I was shocked. The street was unrecognizable. Buildings were damaged, cars overturned. It looked like a war zone.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's actually dropped to a 6. Describing it... it's like I'm starting to separate myself from the memory a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing it. Continue.",
    "Client: We gathered in a nearby park with other survivors. Everyone looked shell-shocked. I remember feeling guilty for being relatively unharmed when others were injured. The aftershocks kept coming, and each one sent a new wave of panic through the crowd. I felt so vulnerable, like the ground could open up and swallow us at any moment.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: Back up to a 7. My stomach is in knots thinking about those aftershocks.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're doing great. What else do you remember?",
    "Client: As night fell, it got cold. We huddled together for warmth. I couldn't sleep, kept imagining another big quake coming. The uncertainty was agonizing. Would there be more? Was my family okay? When could we go home? It felt like the world had ended, and we were just waiting in limbo.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's a 5 now. I feel drained, but also... lighter somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's common. You're processing the memory. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: I think I can go on. The relief efforts started arriving the next day. Seeing the rescue workers gave me hope. But it also made the reality of the situation sink in. The city I knew was gone. I felt a deep sense of loss, not just for the physical damage, but for the sense of security I'd lost.",
    "Therapist: And your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: I'd say it's at a 4 now. I feel exhausted, but also... I don't know, maybe a bit stronger?",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Tired, but... okay. It's strange, talking about it like this. It's still painful, but it feels less overwhelming now.",
    "Therapist: That's the goal. You did very well today."
