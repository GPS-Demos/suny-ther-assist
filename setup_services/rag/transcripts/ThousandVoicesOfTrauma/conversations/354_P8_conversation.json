    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mr. Thompson?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel a tightness in my chest. The memory of that day, seeing the violence unfold... it's like I was right back there again.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: It's strange, you know. I can still hear the shouting, the sound of glass breaking. I keep seeing her face, my wife's face, when I told her what happened. She was so... shocked. I feel this deep sadness, but also... guilt? Like I should have done something to stop it.",
    "Therapist: Hmm. Tell me more about that guilt.",
    "Client: Well, I... I was just standing there, frozen. I couldn't move, couldn't speak. I keep thinking, what if I had called out? What if I had tried to intervene? Maybe things would have turned out differently. And now, with her gone, I can't help but wonder if I'm just... useless. Unable to protect the people I love.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does that belief affect you?",
    "Client: It... it makes me feel small. Insignificant. Like I'm not really living, just... existing. I find myself avoiding busy places now, always on edge, always watching for danger. It's exhausting. And lonely. God, it's so lonely without her.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I... I'm realizing how much anger I'm carrying. Not just at the people who committed the violence, but at myself. For being weak, for not doing more. And... and I'm angry at the world, I suppose. For taking her away from me. It's like a fire in my stomach, this anger. But it's mixed with this... emptiness. Like a void where she used to be.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. How do these feelings compare to before?",
    "Client: They're... they're more intense now, I think. Before, it was like I was numb. Going through the motions. But now, it's like everything's raw. Exposed. It hurts more, but... but I also feel more alive, if that makes sense? Like I'm finally allowing myself to feel it all.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What do you make of that?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me is scared of these feelings. They're so strong, and I'm afraid they'll overwhelm me. But another part... another part feels like this might be necessary. Like I need to face this to... to move forward, maybe? To honor her memory and find a way to live again. It's terrifying, but also... maybe a little hopeful?",
    "Therapist: Mm. How does that hope feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's small. Fragile. Like a tiny flame flickering in the wind. But it's there. For the first time in a long while, I can imagine a future where the pain isn't all-consuming. Where I can remember her with love instead of just grief. It's scary, but... but I think I want to nurture that flame. To see where it might lead.",
    "Therapist: That's really powerful. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I... I think I need a moment. To just sit with these feelings. To acknowledge them without trying to push them away or drown in them. And... and I think I need to know that it's okay. That I'm not betraying her memory by trying to heal. That it's alright to feel hope alongside the grief.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take all the time you need. We're here to support you.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I appreciate that more than I can say. This process, it's not easy. But for the first time in a long while, I feel like I'm actually moving. Like I'm not just stuck in that horrible moment anymore. It's painful, but... but maybe that's okay. Maybe that's part of living again.",
    "Therapist: How would you like to end our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to take a few deep breaths. To ground myself in the present. And maybe... maybe to say her name out loud. To acknowledge her presence in my life, even now. Is that... is that alright?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Whenever you're ready.",
    "Client: [Takes a deep breath] Margaret. My dear Margaret. I miss you. I love you. And I'm... I'm trying to find my way back to life. I hope... I hope that's okay.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Drained, but... lighter, somehow. Like I've set down a heavy burden, even if just for a moment. It's... it's a start, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: It certainly is. We'll pick up here next time."
