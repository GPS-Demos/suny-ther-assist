    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're in control. Can you describe the scene?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm 10 years old, walking home from school. It's a hot day, and I can feel the sun beating down on me. I'm wearing my favorite red dress, the one with little white flowers. As I turn the corner onto my street, I see a group of older kids. They're laughing and pointing at me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: They start shouting things at me. \"Go back to where you came from!\" \"Dirty Mexican!\" I'm not even Mexican, I'm Colombian. My heart starts racing, and I feel like I can't breathe. I want to run, but my feet won't move.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I'm frozen in place, and they're getting closer. One of them, a tall boy with blond hair, spits at me. It lands on my dress, and I feel so... so humiliated. Tears are welling up in my eyes, but I'm trying not to cry. I don't want to give them the satisfaction.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. What happens next?",
    "Client: I finally manage to move, but I'm shaking so much. I start walking faster, almost running. They're laughing behind me, and I can hear them mocking my accent. I make it home and slam the door shut. I slide down to the floor, my back against the door, and I just... I just break down sobbing.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I can still smell the sweat on my skin from running, mixed with the scent of my mother's cooking. She calls out to ask if I'm okay, but I can't answer. I'm crying too hard. I feel so alone, so different. Why can't I just fit in? Why do they hate me?",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. My chest feels tight, and my hands are shaking a little. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been holding onto for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've done excellent work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to talk about, but I think it's getting easier. I've never really told anyone about this before. I always felt so ashamed, like it was somehow my fault. But now, I can see that it wasn't. I was just a kid, and they were cruel.",
    "Therapist: You're absolutely right. It wasn't your fault.",
    "Client: I wonder how many other kids went through similar things. You know, for years after that, I tried to hide my culture. I stopped speaking Spanish in public, I begged my mom to pack me \"American\" lunches. It's only now, in my 60s, that I'm starting to embrace my heritage again.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it feel to embrace your heritage now?",
    "Client: It feels... liberating. Like I'm reclaiming a part of myself that I lost. But it's also bittersweet. I think about all the years I spent trying to be someone else, all the rich experiences and connections I might have missed out on. But I'm trying to focus on the present and the future. It's never too late to be true to yourself, right?",
    "Therapist: That's a great perspective. You've made incredible progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. I really appreciate your support through this. It's not easy to revisit these memories, but I think it's helping. I feel like I'm finally starting to understand how these experiences shaped me, and how I can move forward without letting them define me. It's a long journey, but I feel like I'm on the right path.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself. How are you feeling about ending our session?",
    "Client: I think I'm ready to wrap up. It's been intense, but in a good way. I feel emotionally drained, but also... lighter, if that makes sense. Like I've put down a heavy burden I've been carrying for years. I know we'll have more work to do in future sessions, but for now, I feel like I can breathe a little easier.",
    "Therapist: That's great to hear. Take care of yourself today."
