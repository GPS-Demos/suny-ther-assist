    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Patel. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is dreading it. It's been years since I've really talked about my time in the military.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start slowly. Can you close your eyes and bring yourself back to a specific moment during your combat experience?",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Okay... I'm there. It's hot, so hot. The air feels thick with dust and... and the smell of diesel. We're in a convoy, moving through a small village. I'm in the lead vehicle, a Humvee. The tension is... it's palpable.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, about a 4, I'd say.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: The road is narrow, buildings on both sides. I'm scanning constantly, looking for any sign of danger. My hands are sweaty on the steering wheel. I can hear the radio chatter, but it's just background noise. I'm focused on... on the road ahead.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud bang! I... I can't tell where it's coming from. My heart is racing. I yell to the others, \"IED! IED!\" The Humvee swerves...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to a 7.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Can you describe what you see around you in that moment?",
    "Client: There's... there's smoke everywhere. I can hear shouting, but it sounds muffled. My ears are ringing. I'm trying to regain control of the vehicle, but it's hard. I see flashes of movement in the buildings around us. Are they civilians running for cover or insurgents? I can't tell...",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm trying to radio for backup, but my hands are shaking. I can taste blood in my mouth - I must have bit my tongue. The gunner is yelling something, but I can't make it out. I'm scanning for a safe place to stop, but everywhere looks dangerous.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How's your stress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. Maybe an 8 now.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Take a moment to ground yourself if you need to.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... okay. We've stopped now. I'm ordering everyone out of the vehicle. We need to secure the area. I can smell burning rubber and... and something else. Something worse. My training kicks in, but I'm terrified. What if there's another IED? What if we're ambushed?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those thoughts. What happens as you exit the vehicle?",
    "Client: I... I stumble out. My legs feel weak. The heat hits me like a wall. I'm shouting orders, trying to sound confident, but my voice is shaking. I can see the other vehicles in our convoy have stopped too. There's chaos all around. Civilians are screaming, running. I... I see a child, crying, blood on their face. God, I want to help, but I can't. We have to secure the area first.",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly difficult. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Remember, you're here in the room with me. Can you feel the chair beneath you?",
    "Client: Yes... yes, I can.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: (Swallows hard) We're setting up a perimeter. I can hear gunfire in the distance. Is it coming closer? My mouth is dry, I'm so thirsty. The smell of smoke is overwhelming. I see one of my men, Johnson, he's bleeding from his arm. I yell for the medic, but everything seems to be moving in slow motion. I feel so... so helpless. Like I should be doing more, but I don't know what.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking, \"This is my fault. I should have seen it coming. I'm responsible for these men.\" But at the same time, I'm... I'm scared. I want to run, to hide, but I can't. I have to lead. I have to be strong.",
    "Therapist: Those are heavy thoughts. How's your stress level?",
    "Client: Still... still a 9. Maybe even a 10 now.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: (Takes several deep breaths) Okay... okay. We're waiting for backup. It feels like hours, but it's probably only minutes. I can hear moaning from somewhere nearby. One of ours? A civilian? I don't know. The gunfire is getting closer. I'm trying to think, to plan, but my mind feels foggy. I keep seeing that child's face...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Can you describe what you're feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My... my heart is pounding. My hands are shaking. I feel nauseous. There's this weight on my chest, like I can't breathe properly. I want to curl up, to make myself small, but I can't. I have to stand tall, to show strength for my men.",
    "Therapist: Remember to stay in the present tense. What happens next?",
    "Client: Right, sorry. Um... Backup arrives. I hear the choppers before I see them. There's a moment of relief, but it's short-lived. We still have to get out of here. I'm barking orders, trying to coordinate an evacuation. The injured first, then the rest of us. I... I can't stop looking at the buildings around us. Where did that IED come from? Are there more?",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. But still on edge. Every sound, every movement makes me flinch.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe a 7 now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's continue. What happens as you evacuate?",
    "Client: We're loading up into the choppers. The noise is deafening. Dust is swirling everywhere. I'm doing a headcount, making sure everyone is accounted for. I see Johnson being helped in, his arm bandaged. He gives me a weak thumbs up. I feel a surge of... of something. Relief? Guilt? I'm not sure.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those emotions. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm the last to board. As we lift off, I look down at the village. It looks so small from up here. The smoke, the destruction... it's surreal. I feel... I feel numb. Like I'm watching a movie of someone else's life. But then I look at my hands, and they're covered in dirt and blood. It's real. It happened. We made it out, but... but at what cost?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful moment. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. Emotionally and physically. It's like I've been through it all again.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well. What's your final SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 5 now. I feel... I don't know. Sad? Relieved? It's a mix.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've processed a lot today. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay... thank you. This was... it was hard, but I think it was good. I've never talked about it in this much detail before.",
    "Therapist: You showed great courage today. How do you feel about continuing this process in our next session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm nervous, but I think it's helping. I want to keep going.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. Let's end here for today and discuss how you can take care of yourself for the rest of the day."
