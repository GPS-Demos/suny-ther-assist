    "Therapist: Welcome back, Sarah. Are you ready to continue our imaginal exposure work today?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with your current SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10. My stomach feels a bit tight.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Let's begin. Close your eyes and describe the night of the home invasion.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) It was around 2 AM. I was sleeping, and suddenly I heard a loud crash downstairs. My heart started racing immediately. I... I froze in my bed, trying to convince myself it was just my imagination.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My palms are getting sweaty. The fear is creeping back in. Maybe a 6 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: I heard footsteps on the stairs. They were slow, deliberate. I couldn't breathe. I wanted to scream but no sound came out. I just lay there, paralyzed, listening to them getting closer and closer...",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. 7, maybe 8. My chest feels so tight.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: The doorknob to my room started to turn. I squeezed my eyes shut, praying they wouldn't come in. But they did. I heard them breathing, rummaging through my things. I was shaking so hard I thought they'd notice. God, I was so scared they'd find me.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I... I can't... It's too much. SUDS is 9. My heart's pounding. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) They were in my room for what felt like hours. I could hear them whispering, but I couldn't make out the words. Then, suddenly, they left. I heard them go back downstairs and then... silence.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... coming down a bit. Maybe 7? I still feel shaky, but the tightness in my chest is easing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I lay there for so long, afraid to move. When I finally got up the courage to look at my phone, it was 4 AM. Two hours had passed. I called the police, but... but I felt so helpless, so violated. My safe space wasn't safe anymore.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. SUDS is down to a 5. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger?",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You did well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard, but... it's getting easier to talk about it.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. How about we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think that would be good. I'm exhausted, but... I'm glad we did this.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself. We'll continue next week."
