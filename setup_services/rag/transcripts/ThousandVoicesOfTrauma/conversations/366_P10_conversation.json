    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I'm... a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we've talked about this, but actually revisiting that day... it's making my stomach churn a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess so. Where do you want me to start?",
    "Therapist: Start with the morning of the hurricane. Describe what you see, hear, and feel.",
    "Client: Okay... It's early morning. The sky is this eerie dark gray color. I can hear the wind picking up outside, whistling through the trees. I'm in my kitchen, trying to make coffee, but my hands are shaking a bit. The weather report is on TV in the background, and they keep talking about how this storm is going to be worse than anyone expected.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Uh, probably about a 4 or 5.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue, and remember to stay in the present tense.",
    "Client: The power flickers, and I jump a little. I'm starting to feel really anxious. I look out the window, and the trees are bending in ways I've never seen before. I can see my neighbor across the street boarding up their windows. I should have done that yesterday, but I thought... I thought it wouldn't be this bad.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: The wind is getting louder. It's like a constant roar now. I'm trying to decide if I should leave or stay put. My phone buzzes - it's my daughter. She's telling me to get out now, that the storm surge predictions have changed. I... I feel frozen. I can't seem to move.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe a 7?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Remember your grounding techniques. Can you name five things you see in this room right now?",
    "Client: Uh, yeah. I see... the desk, the plant in the corner, your notepad, the clock on the wall, and the painting behind you.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, continue with your story.",
    "Client: Right... So, I finally snap out of it and start throwing some clothes and important papers into a bag. The lights go out completely, and I hear a huge crash outside. My heart is racing. I look out the window and see that the big oak tree in my front yard has fallen onto my car. I'm... I'm trapped.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. I keep thinking, \"This is it. I'm going to die here.\" The wind is so loud now, it's like a freight train. I can hear things hitting the house - branches, debris. The windows are rattling so hard I think they might shatter at any moment.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's pretty high. Maybe an 8 or 9.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. Remember, you survived this. You're here now, safe.",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, you're right. Okay. So, I decide the safest place is probably the hallway, away from the windows. I grab some pillows and blankets and hunker down there. The noise is deafening. I can hear the roof creaking, and I'm sure it's going to tear off at any moment. I'm... I'm crying. I'm praying, and I'm not even religious. I just want it to stop.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Hours pass like this. I lose track of time. The house is shaking, and I can hear water. At first, I think it's just the rain, but then I realize... the storm surge is here. Water starts seeping in under the doors. It's rising fast. I'm panicking now, trying to figure out where to go. The attic maybe? But what if the roof goes?",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. My heart is pounding. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Focus on your breath. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... okay. The water keeps rising. It's up to my knees now. The current is strong, pushing against me. I manage to get to the attic access and pull myself up. The whole house is groaning and creaking. I'm soaked, shivering, and I've never felt so alone and helpless in my life.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still pretty high. Maybe an 8?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: In the attic, I can see outside through a small window. The world is just... water. Everywhere. Houses, cars, trees - everything is partially submerged. I see things floating by - furniture, a car, even a boat. The wind is still howling. I'm exhausted, but I'm too scared to sleep. I keep thinking the house might just... float away with me in it.",
    "Therapist: How long were you in the attic?",
    "Client: It felt like days, but I think it was about 36 hours. The storm finally starts to die down, but the water is still high. I'm so thirsty, so hungry. I feel weak. I keep hearing noises - helicopters, maybe? But no one comes. I'm starting to think I've been forgotten.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind at this point?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm angry. At myself for not leaving, at the government for not being prepared, at the world for letting this happen. But mostly, I'm just... sad. I'm thinking about my daughter, wondering if I'll ever see her again. I'm thinking about all the things I never did, never said.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot of heavy emotions. How are you feeling now, recounting this?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. My chest still feels tight, but... I don't know. There's something... almost cathartic about saying it all out loud.",
    "Therapist: That's good, John. What happens next?",
    "Client: Finally, the water starts to recede. I can see more of the houses, the streets. Everything is covered in mud and debris. It's like a war zone. I manage to get out of the attic and downstairs. The smell is awful - mold, sewage, who knows what else. Everything I own is ruined.",
    "Therapist: What do you do then?",
    "Client: I... I just walk. The streets are barely recognizable. There are other people out, all of us looking shell-shocked. We nod at each other, but no one speaks. What is there to say? I walk until I find a rescue center. They give me water, some food. I'm able to call my daughter. When I hear her voice... (voice breaks) I just break down. I've never cried like that before.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like an incredibly emotional moment. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's lower. Maybe a 5 or 6?",
    "Therapist: That's good. You've done really well, John. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. But there's also this weird sense of... I don't know, relief? Like, I've carried this story inside me for so long, and now it's out there.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after an exposure session. You've done excellent work today. Let's take a few minutes to debrief and do some grounding exercises before we end.",
    "Client: Yeah, okay. That sounds good. Thank you... for listening, for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, John. You've shown incredible strength today. Let's start with some deep breathing exercises..."
