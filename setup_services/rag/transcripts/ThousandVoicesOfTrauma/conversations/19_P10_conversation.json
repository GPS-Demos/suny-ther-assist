    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to dive into some heavy stuff today, and part of me wants to just run out the door.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess so. Let's do this before I change my mind.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day at the hospital. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in the waiting room. The chairs are uncomfortable, and there's this antiseptic smell that's making me nauseous. My wife, Sarah, she's sitting next to me, holding my hand. We're waiting for the test results.",
    "Therapist: Good. What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My heart's racing. I can feel it pounding in my chest. My palms are sweaty, and there's this knot in my stomach that won't go away.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 60... maybe 65.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath and continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: The doctor comes out. He's got this look on his face, and I just know it's bad news. He asks us to come into his office. Sarah squeezes my hand so tight it almost hurts.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking, \"This is it. This is how my life changes forever.\" I'm scared out of my mind, but I'm trying to keep it together for Sarah.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: We sit down in his office. It's small, claustrophobic almost. He starts talking, but it's like I'm underwater. I can see his lips moving, but the words aren't making sense. Then suddenly, everything becomes crystal clear when he says, \"Stage 3 cancer.\"",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I can't breathe. It feels like someone's sitting on my chest. The room is spinning, and I'm gripping the armrests of the chair so hard my knuckles are white.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're safe here. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 80.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. Remember, you survived this. Can you tell me what happens next?",
    "Client: Sarah starts crying. I can hear her, but it's like she's far away. The doctor is still talking, explaining treatment options, but all I can think is, \"I'm going to die. I'm going to leave Sarah alone.\" And then... then I get angry.",
    "Therapist: What does that anger feel like?",
    "Client: It's hot. It's burning in my chest. I want to scream, to throw things, to punch the wall. But I don't. I just sit there, clenching my fists, nodding like a robot while the doctor talks.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I stand up. I tell the doctor I need some air. Sarah tries to stop me, but I shake her off. I practically run out of the office, down the hallway. People are staring, but I don't care.",
    "Therapist: Where do you go?",
    "Client: I end up in the hospital chapel. It's empty, thank God. I collapse into a pew and just... break down. I'm sobbing, ugly crying like I haven't since I was a kid. I'm begging, pleading with God or whoever's listening to make this not be real.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly intense. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's pretty high. Maybe 90.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, John. Remember, you're here now, you're safe. Take a deep breath. What happens after the chapel?",
    "Client: I... I don't know how long I stay there. Eventually, Sarah finds me. She sits next to me, puts her arm around me. We don't speak for a long time. Then she says, \"We'll fight this together.\" And I want to believe her, but I'm so scared.",
    "Therapist: What are you scared of in that moment?",
    "Client: I'm scared of dying, obviously. But more than that, I'm scared of what this will do to Sarah. I'm scared of the pain, the treatments. I'm scared of becoming a burden. And... and I'm scared that she'll leave me.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid fears. How does Sarah respond?",
    "Client: She just... she just holds me tighter. She tells me she loves me, that we're in this together. But I can see the fear in her eyes too. And that... that just makes me feel worse.",
    "Therapist: How so?",
    "Client: Because I'm supposed to be the strong one, you know? I'm supposed to protect her, not the other way around. And now... now I feel weak. Helpless.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to process. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. But the fear is still there, just under the surface.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's come down a bit. Maybe 75?",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. Let's continue. What happens when you leave the hospital?",
    "Client: We... we go home. The drive is silent. I can't even look at Sarah. When we get home, I go straight to the bedroom. I tell Sarah I need to be alone, but really, I just can't face her.",
    "Therapist: What do you do in the bedroom?",
    "Client: I sit on the edge of the bed, staring at nothing. I'm trying to process everything, but it's like my brain is stuck. I keep hearing the doctor's words over and over. \"Stage 3 cancer.\" It doesn't seem real.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I start to get angry again. I grab a pillow and just start hitting it, over and over. I'm cursing, yelling. I don't even know what I'm saying. I'm just so... so furious at the universe.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel during this?",
    "Client: It's tense. Every muscle is tight. My jaw is clenched so hard it hurts. I'm sweating, and my heart is racing again.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's back up to about 85.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this really well, John. Take a deep breath. What happens after your outburst?",
    "Client: I... I collapse on the bed. I'm crying again, but it's different this time. It's not just sadness, it's... it's despair. I feel hopeless. And then Sarah comes in.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: I'm embarrassed. I don't want her to see me like this. But I'm also... relieved? I don't know. It's complicated.",
    "Therapist: What does Sarah do?",
    "Client: She sits next to me on the bed. She doesn't say anything at first, just rubs my back. Then she says, \"It's okay to be scared. I'm scared too.\" And somehow... that helps.",
    "Therapist: How does it help?",
    "Client: It... it makes me feel less alone, I guess. Like we're in this together, for real. It doesn't fix anything, but it makes the burden feel a little lighter.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful moment. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm still scared. Still angry. But there's also this tiny spark of... I don't know, hope maybe? Like maybe we can actually do this.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's come down a bit. Maybe 70?",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, John. Let's keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: We... we start talking. Really talking. About our fears, our hopes. About treatment options and what it might mean for our future. It's hard, and we both cry a lot, but it feels... necessary.",
    "Therapist: How long does this conversation last?",
    "Client: It feels like hours. The sun is setting by the time we finish. We're both exhausted, emotionally drained.",
    "Therapist: What do you do after the conversation?",
    "Client: We... we order takeout. Neither of us has the energy to cook. We eat in silence, but it's not uncomfortable. It's like we've said everything we need to say for now.",
    "Therapist: How does that feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a relief, honestly. Like a weight has been lifted. I'm still terrified about what's to come, but I feel... I don't know, more prepared? More united with Sarah?",
    "Therapist: That's a significant shift. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually down to about 55, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, John. How do you end the night?",
    "Client: We go to bed early. Sarah holds me, and for the first time since we got the news, I feel... safe. I know it's just for a moment, that tomorrow will bring new challenges, but for now, I let myself feel that safety.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful image to end on. How are you feeling now, back in the present?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. It was hard to go through that again, but I feel... lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent, John. Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's down to about 40 now.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today. How do you feel about the progress you've made?",
    "Client: I feel... proud, I guess? It was tough, but I did it. And I think... I think it helped.",
    "Therapist: That's great to hear, John. Remember, healing is a process. We'll continue to work through this together. For now, take some time to relax and process what we've discussed today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I appreciate your help.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, John. I'll see you next week."
