    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure exercise. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the animal attack?",
    "Client: Okay... I was walking in the park near my apartment. It was a sunny day, and I decided to take a shortcut through a wooded area. I heard rustling behind me, and suddenly, this large dog came charging out of the bushes. Its teeth were bared, and it was growling... I froze in place, my heart racing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: The dog lunged at me, and I instinctively put my arm up to protect myself. Its teeth sank into my forearm, and the pain was excruciating. I screamed, but there was no one around to help. I tried to shake it off, but it wouldn't let go. I could feel its hot breath and saliva on my skin, and the pressure of its jaw was intense.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can. It's too vivid. I can almost feel the pain again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a deep breath. You can handle this.",
    "Client: Okay... The dog kept shaking its head, tearing at my arm. I started hitting it with my free hand, trying to make it let go. I was screaming for help, but my voice felt weak. The fear was overwhelming. I thought I was going to die there, alone in the woods.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: After what felt like forever, I heard someone yelling. An older man came running towards us, waving a stick. The dog finally released my arm and ran off. I collapsed to the ground, sobbing and clutching my bleeding arm. The man helped me up and called for an ambulance. I was in shock, shaking uncontrollably.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking a little. My heart is racing. It feels so real, like it's happening all over again.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're safe here. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's just... the memory of the pain, the fear, the helplessness. It's all coming back. I keep thinking about how close I came to being seriously injured or even killed. And now, every time I see a dog, even a small one, I feel that panic rising in my chest.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Remember, you survived.",
    "Client: You're right. I did survive. But it's left me feeling so vulnerable. I used to love going for walks in nature, and now I can't even step into a park without feeling anxious. I keep replaying the attack in my mind, wondering if there was something I could have done differently.",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. You're working through this.",
    "Client: I know, logically, that it wasn't my fault. But emotionally, it's hard to shake that feeling. The worst part is how it's affecting my daily life. I've become so hyper-vigilant. Every unexpected noise makes me jump. I'm constantly scanning my surroundings for potential threats. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I hope so. It's just frustrating because this one event has changed so much. I feel like I've lost a part of myself, you know? The carefree part that could enjoy a simple walk in the park. Now everything feels tainted by fear. And I hate feeling this way, feeling weak and scared all the time.",
    "Therapist: You're not weak. You're facing your fears now.",
    "Client: I'm trying. It's just so hard sometimes. There are days when I feel like I'm making progress, and then something will trigger me \u2013 like seeing a dog on TV or hearing a bark in the distance \u2013 and I'm right back in that moment of terror. It's like my body doesn't understand that the danger has passed.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Your body is learning you're safe now.",
    "Client: I hope it learns quickly. I'm tired of feeling this way. I want to be able to go out without constantly looking over my shoulder. I want to be able to see a dog without my heart racing and my palms sweating. I want to feel normal again. Do you think that's possible?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're already taking important steps.",
    "Client: Thank you. That gives me hope. I know it's a process, but sometimes it feels like I'll never get past this. The attack has affected so many aspects of my life. My studies have suffered because I have trouble concentrating. My relationship has been strained because I don't want to go out as much. It's like this one event has rippled out and touched everything.",
    "Therapist: You're recognizing the impact. That's important progress.",
    "Client: I suppose you're right. At least I'm aware of how it's affecting me now. In the beginning, I was just numb, trying to pretend it hadn't happened. But now I can see how it's changed things. I just hope that by working through this, I can start to reclaim some of what I've lost. I want to feel strong again, to feel like I can handle whatever comes my way.",
    "Therapist: You are strong. You're here, facing this.",
    "Client: Thank you. It means a lot to hear that. Sometimes I forget how far I've come. I mean, a few months ago, I couldn't even talk about the attack without having a panic attack. And now, here I am, describing it in detail. It's still hard, and I still feel the fear, but I'm doing it. That has to count for something, right?",
    "Therapist: It absolutely does. You should be proud.",
    "Client: I am, in a way. It's a strange mix of emotions. I'm proud of the progress I've made, but I'm also still angry that this happened to me. And scared that I might never fully recover. But I'm trying to focus on the positive, on the steps forward I'm taking. This therapy, facing the memory head-on, it's challenging but I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: It is helping. You're showing great courage.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm trying to hold onto that courage. It's not easy, but I'm committed to working through this. I want my life back, you know? I want to be able to enjoy simple things again without fear. I want to be able to help others who might go through something similar. Maybe by overcoming this, I can turn it into something positive eventually.",
    "Therapist: That's a great perspective. We'll end here for today.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you for guiding me through this. It was tough, but I feel like I've made some progress. Same time next week?",
    "Therapist: Yes, same time. You did excellent work today."
