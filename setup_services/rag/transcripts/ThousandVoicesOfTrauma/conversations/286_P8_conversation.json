    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I'm back there, you know? In that small room, the walls closing in on me. I can almost smell the musty air and feel the cold concrete beneath me.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... anger? Yeah, anger. I'm angry that I was put in that situation, that I felt so helpless and powerless. It's like a knot in my stomach, twisting and turning.",
    "Therapist: Can you tell me more about that anger?",
    "Client: It's... it's hot. Like a fire burning inside me. I want to lash out, to scream, to break something. But at the same time, I feel frozen. Like I can't move or speak. It's frustrating, you know? To feel so much and yet be unable to do anything about it.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are accompanying these feelings?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"This isn't fair. I didn't deserve this.\" And then I wonder, \"What if it happens again? What if I can't protect myself or my family?\" It's like a loop playing over and over in my head.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts impact you physically?",
    "Client: My muscles are tense, especially in my jaw and shoulders. I notice I'm clenching my fists. And there's this heaviness in my chest, like I can't take a full breath. It's exhausting, really.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to run away, to forget all of this. But another part knows I need to face it. I guess... I need to feel safe. To know that it's over and I'm okay now. Is that... is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Can you identify anything that helps you feel safe right now?",
    "Client: Um, focusing on my breathing helps a bit. And... and remembering that I'm here, in this room, not back there. The sunlight coming through the window, the softness of this chair \u2013 it's all so different from that place. It grounds me, I suppose.",
    "Therapist: That's great. How does acknowledging these differences make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... calming, in a way. Like a weight lifting off my chest. I can breathe a little easier. But there's still this underlying anxiety, you know? Like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop.",
    "Therapist: What do you think that anxiety is telling you?",
    "Client: I guess... it's telling me to be on guard. That I can't let my defenses down completely. But rationally, I know I'm safe here. It's just hard to convince my body and mind of that sometimes.",
    "Therapist: How does this experience compare to previous exposures?",
    "Client: It's... it's getting easier, I think. The first few times, I could barely get through it without having a full-blown panic attack. Now, it's still intense, but I feel like I have a bit more control. Like I can observe my reactions without being completely overwhelmed by them. Is that progress?",
    "Therapist: What do you think?",
    "Client: I... I guess it is progress. It doesn't always feel like it in the moment, but looking back, I can see how far I've come. It's just... it's a slow process, you know? Sometimes I get impatient, wondering if I'll ever fully heal from this.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with that impatience?",
    "Client: I try to remind myself that healing isn't linear. Some days are better than others, and that's okay. I've been trying to practice self-compassion, but it's not easy. There's still a part of me that feels weak for struggling with this, even though I know that's not true.",
    "Therapist: What would you say to a friend going through something similar?",
    "Client: I'd... I'd tell them that they're incredibly strong for facing their trauma head-on. That it takes courage to do this work, and that they should be proud of themselves. I'd remind them that healing takes time and that they're doing the best they can. Huh... I guess I should probably tell myself those things too, right?",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to recognize that?",
    "Client: It's... enlightening, I suppose. And a bit emotional, to be honest. I realize I'm often harder on myself than I would be on anyone else. Maybe I need to work on extending that same kindness to myself.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you could take towards that?",
    "Client: I could... I could try to acknowledge my progress more often, even the small things. Like today, I got through this exposure without dissociating. That's a win, right? Maybe I need to start keeping a journal or something, to track these little victories.",
    "Therapist: How do you think that might help?",
    "Client: It could give me a more balanced perspective, I guess. Help me see that I am making progress, even when it doesn't feel like it. And maybe it would help me be kinder to myself on the tough days, knowing that I've gotten through difficult times before.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful approach. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... calmer. Still a bit shaky, but more grounded. It's like the intensity has dialed down a notch. I'm surprised at how much talking through it helps. It's like... it takes some of the power away from the memory, you know?",
    "Therapist: Can you elaborate on that?",
    "Client: Well, when the memory is just in my head, it feels overwhelming and all-consuming. But when I talk about it, it becomes... I don't know, more manageable somehow? Like I'm looking at it from the outside rather than being trapped in it. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. What else have you noticed about this process?",
    "Client: I've noticed that each time we do this, I remember new details. Some are hard to face, but others... they remind me of my resilience. Like today, I remembered how I used to sing to myself quietly to stay calm. I'd forgotten about that.",
    "Therapist: How does remembering that make you feel?",
    "Client: It's bittersweet. Sad that I was in a situation where I needed to do that, but proud of myself for finding a way to cope. It's a reminder that even in my darkest moments, there was a part of me fighting to survive.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How might you carry that forward?",
    "Client: I think... I think I can use it as a reminder of my strength when I'm struggling. If I could find a way to cope in that situation, surely I can handle what life throws at me now, right? It's like... evidence that I'm more resilient than I sometimes give myself credit for.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful perspective. We're nearing the end of our session. How are you feeling as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... tired, but in a good way? Like I've done some hard but necessary work. And I feel a bit more hopeful, I think. Like I'm making progress, even if it's slow. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Is there anything else you'd like to address before we end?",
    "Client: No, I think I'm good. Just... thank you. For creating a safe space for me to process all of this. It means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
