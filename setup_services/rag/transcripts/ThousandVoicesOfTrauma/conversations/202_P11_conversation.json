    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. The memory of the airplane crash feels so vivid now. I can still hear the screeching of metal and smell the smoke. It's like I was right back there, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. Being strapped in my seat, watching as everything around me fell apart. I keep thinking about the other passengers, their screams... God, it's awful. I feel like I should've done something, anything.",
    "Therapist: How did reliving that make you feel?",
    "Client: Terrified, mostly. But also... guilty? I survived when others didn't. And angry too, I guess. Why did this have to happen? It's not fair.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. How does this connect to your daily life?",
    "Client: Well, I've been avoiding flying, obviously. But it's more than that. I'm always on edge, expecting the worst. It's affecting my studies, my relationships. I feel so... disconnected from everyone.",
    "Therapist: I see. What did you learn from this experience?",
    "Client: I... I realized how much I've been holding onto this fear. It's like it's been controlling every aspect of my life without me even noticing. Maybe... maybe I need to start facing it head-on instead of running away.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. How might you do that?",
    "Client: I don't know, exactly. Maybe... maybe I could start by looking at pictures of airplanes? Or watching flight safety videos? It sounds silly, but even that feels scary right now.",
    "Therapist: Small steps are valuable. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: It's hard, really hard. But I want to get better. I want to be able to travel again, to not feel this constant dread. So yeah, I think I want to keep going. It can't get worse than it already is, right?",
    "Therapist: Your determination is admirable. What support do you need?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe just knowing that it's okay to struggle? That it's normal to feel this way after what I've been through? And maybe some techniques to help me calm down when the memories get too intense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll work on that. Anything else you want to share?",
    "Client: I guess... I'm scared of the next session. Of having to go through this again. But at the same time, I feel a tiny bit lighter? Like maybe there's hope. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's a common experience. How can we build on this?",
    "Client: Maybe we could set some small goals? Like, I don't know, looking at a picture of an airplane for 30 seconds without panicking? And maybe you could teach me some breathing exercises or something to help when things get overwhelming?",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent ideas. Shall we plan that for next time?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think that would be good. It's scary, but... I'm ready to try. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know it's not easy, but I really want to get better.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. We'll continue this journey together.",

    "Client: I think that's good. I'm exhausted, to be honest. But also... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful? Is it okay if I call you if things get really bad between now and our next session?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take care, and we'll talk soon.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'll try to practice some of what we talked about. See you next time."
