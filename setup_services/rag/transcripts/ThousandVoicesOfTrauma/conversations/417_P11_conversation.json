    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving that airplane crash... it's like I was right back there, you know? The sounds, the smells, the sheer panic... it's all so vivid. I can still feel my heart racing.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The screaming. God, the screaming. It was everywhere. I remember thinking, \"This is it. I'm going to die.\" And then there was this... this moment of eerie calm right before impact. It's like time slowed down. I could see every detail - the fear on people's faces, the oxygen masks dangling... it's burned into my memory.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... difficult. Really difficult. But, um, also different from how I usually experience it. Usually, when I think about it, I just shut down. This time, I felt like I was actually processing it, if that makes sense? It still hurts, but it's like... I don't know, like I'm starting to see it from the outside rather than just being trapped in it.",
    "Therapist: That's an important observation. Can you elaborate?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... before, whenever I thought about the crash, I was right back in that seat, frozen in terror. But today, even though I was reliving it, there was a part of me that knew I was here, safe, talking to you. It's a small thing, but it feels significant somehow.",
    "Therapist: It is significant. How does this relate to your day-to-day symptoms?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe it's giving me hope? Like, if I can start to separate myself from the memory even a little bit, maybe the flashbacks won't be so overwhelming. Maybe I won't feel the need to... you know, to drink to numb myself every time I hear a loud noise or see a plane in the sky.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What else?",
    "Client: It's made me realize how much this trauma has been controlling my life. I've been avoiding so much - flying, obviously, but also loud places, crowded areas... anywhere that reminds me of that day. And the substance use... it's been my crutch, my way of escaping. But going through this exposure, as hard as it is, it's like... maybe I don't have to run anymore?",
    "Therapist: How does that possibility feel?",
    "Client: Scary. Really scary. But also... liberating? Like, for the first time in years, I can see a future where I'm not controlled by this. Where I can maybe even fly again someday. It's terrifying, but also... exciting?",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What's your takeaway from today?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's that I'm stronger than I thought. That maybe, with time and work, I can face this trauma head-on instead of trying to avoid it or numb it. It's not going to be easy, but... I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How will you apply this moving forward?",
    "Client: I want to keep doing these exposures, as hard as they are. And... I think I'm going to try to cut back on the drinking. Maybe look into some support groups for that. I know it's all connected - the PTSD, the substance use... I need to tackle it all if I want to really get better.",
    "Therapist: That's a solid plan. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For guiding me through this. For the first time in a long time, I feel like there's hope. Like maybe I can actually move past this and reclaim my life. It's scary, but... I'm ready to keep going.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. We'll continue next session."
