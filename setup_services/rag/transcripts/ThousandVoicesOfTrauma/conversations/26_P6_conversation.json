    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the memory.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in our living room. Sarah is standing there, arms crossed. She's just told me she wants a divorce. I... I can feel my heart racing already.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably a 6 out of 10. My palms are sweating.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: She's saying she can't do this anymore. That I'm too focused on work, that I don't make time for her. I'm trying to explain, but the words aren't coming out right. I feel like I'm choking.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. I'm... I'm starting to panic. Sarah's voice is getting louder, or maybe it just seems that way. She's listing all the times I've let her down. Each one feels like a punch to the gut.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe even a 9. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: I'm trying to tell her I'll change, that we can work it out. But she's shaking her head. She looks so... disappointed. I feel like a failure. My legs are shaking, I think I need to sit down.",
    "Therapist: Keep going. You're handling this bravely.",
    "Client: I'm on the couch now. Sarah's still talking, but it's like I can't hear her anymore. There's this ringing in my ears. I feel... God, I feel so alone. So scared. What am I going to do without her?",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Still... still a 9. My whole body is tense. I can feel tears starting.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: She's walking towards the door now. I want to stop her, but I can't move. It's like I'm paralyzed. She's saying goodbye, and I... I can't even respond. The door closes, and I'm just... sitting there. Alone.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Empty? Scared? My SUDS is maybe down to a 7 now. The panic is fading, but there's this... heaviness setting in.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. Let's stay with this for a bit longer.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm still on the couch. The house feels so quiet now. I can hear the clock ticking. Each tick feels like it's marking the end of my marriage. I feel... lost. Like I don't know who I am without her.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6. I feel drained, but the intense panic is gone. Just this... ache in my chest.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. Let's start to bring your attention back to the present.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay. I'm... I'm back. That was... intense.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired. Sad. But... maybe a little relieved? My SUDS is down to a 4 now.",
    "Therapist: That's common. You've shown great courage today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was hard, but... I think it helped. I feel like I understand my reactions better now.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's discuss what you've learned from this experience."
