    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Fatima?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. My heart is still racing a bit. It's like I was right back there, you know? Seeing those flashing lights, hearing the shouting... It's all so vivid.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: Fear, mostly. And anger. I keep thinking about how helpless I felt in that moment. I'm a successful professional, I've lived in this country for decades, and yet in that instant, none of that mattered. I was just... a target. It's infuriating and terrifying at the same time.",
    "Therapist: I hear that. Can you tell me more about those feelings?",
    "Client: Well, the fear... it's like a cold knot in my stomach. I can feel my hands shaking even now. And the anger, it's hot, like it's burning in my chest. I want to scream, to fight back, but I know that would only make things worse. It's this awful mix of rage and powerlessness.",
    "Therapist: And how does that connect to your broader experience?",
    "Client: I suppose... it reminds me of all the times I've felt othered or discriminated against. But this was so much more intense, so much more dangerous. It's like all those smaller experiences were building up to this moment, you know? And now, I find myself constantly on edge, always watching over my shoulder.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really challenging. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why me? What did I do wrong?\" And then I get angry at myself for even asking that because I know I didn't do anything wrong. But there's this voice in my head that keeps saying maybe if I had done something differently, dressed differently, spoken differently... maybe it wouldn't have happened. And then I feel guilty for even considering changing who I am.",
    "Therapist: How do those thoughts make you feel?",
    "Client: Frustrated. Sad. It's like... I've worked so hard to build a life here, to contribute to this society, and in an instant, all of that can be erased. I feel like I'm constantly walking a tightrope, trying to be the perfect citizen, the model immigrant. It's exhausting, and it's not fair.",
    "Therapist: Mm. What else are you noticing in your body right now?",
    "Client: My shoulders are so tense, they're almost up to my ears. And I can feel this tightness in my chest, like I can't take a full breath. It's like my body is still braced for impact, you know? Like at any moment, something might happen and I need to be ready.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does this compare to how you felt during the actual event?",
    "Client: It's... it's less intense now, but similar. During the event, it was like time slowed down. I could hear my heart pounding in my ears. My mouth went dry, and I felt like I couldn't move. Now, it's like an echo of that feeling. It's not as overwhelming, but it's still there, lurking under the surface.",
    "Therapist: What do you make of that?",
    "Client: I guess... I guess it shows how deeply this has affected me. Even though I'm safe now, my body and mind are still reacting as if I'm in danger. It's frustrating because logically, I know I'm okay, but I can't seem to convince my subconscious of that.",
    "Therapist: How does that impact your daily life?",
    "Client: It's... it's changed everything. I'm more anxious now, especially in public spaces. I find myself scanning every room I enter, looking for exits, potential threats. I've stopped going out as much, and when I do, I'm always on high alert. It's affecting my sleep, my work... even my relationships. My husband tries to understand, but I can see the worry in his eyes.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really difficult. What helps you cope?",
    "Client: Deep breaths help a little. And talking about it, like we're doing now. It helps to name these feelings, to acknowledge them. Sometimes I try to remind myself of all the good experiences I've had, all the kind people I've met. It doesn't erase what happened, but it helps balance things out a bit.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like helpful strategies. What else?",
    "Client: I've been trying to reconnect with my cultural roots more. Cooking traditional foods, listening to music from back home. It's comforting, and it reminds me of my strength, of where I come from. And... I've been thinking about getting involved in advocacy work. Maybe if I can help prevent this from happening to someone else, it will give some meaning to what I went through.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea make you feel?",
    "Client: It makes me feel... hopeful, I think. And a little scared. But mostly determined. I don't want this experience to define me or break me. I want to use it to make a difference, to push for change. It's not going to be easy, but I think it might be an important part of my healing process.",
