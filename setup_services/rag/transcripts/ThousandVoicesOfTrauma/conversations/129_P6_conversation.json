    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Johnson. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I suppose so, Dr. Taylor. I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with your SUDS rating. From 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 40. My stomach's a little queasy, but I'm trying to stay calm.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Let's begin. Close your eyes and describe the day of the animal attack.",
    "Client: Okay... I was at the park near my old house. It was a sunny afternoon, and I was walking my dog, Max. We were on our usual route when suddenly... Oh god, I can see it so clearly. This massive Rottweiler came charging at us from behind some bushes. Its eyes were wild, teeth bared... I froze. Max started barking, but he was so small compared to this beast...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to about 65. My heart's racing, and I can feel my palms getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath and continue.",
    "Client: The Rottweiler lunged at Max first. I tried to pull him away, but the big dog was so strong. I could hear Max yelping in pain, and I... I felt so helpless. Then it turned on me. Its teeth sank into my arm, and the pain was excruciating. I screamed for help, but no one was around. The dog kept shaking my arm, and I thought it was going to tear it off...",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 80. My arm is actually aching, and I can almost feel those teeth again. I'm shaking...",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: I managed to kick the dog hard enough that it let go for a moment. I scooped up Max, who was whimpering and bleeding, and I just ran. My arm was throbbing, blood dripping everywhere. I could hear the dog barking behind us, but I didn't look back. I just ran and ran until I reached the street. A car stopped, and the driver called an ambulance. I was in shock, holding Max, both of us bleeding...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's still around 80. My chest feels tight, and I'm having trouble catching my breath.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a moment. Breathe slowly.",
    "Client: The wait for the ambulance felt like forever. I kept thinking the dog would come back to finish us off. When we finally got to the hospital, they had to pry Max from my arms. I was so worried about him, even though my own arm was mangled. They told me later that he... he didn't make it. And I... I felt like I'd failed him. He was my best friend, and I couldn't protect him...",
    "Therapist: I'm so sorry. That must have been devastating. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm at a 90. I can feel tears on my cheeks, and my chest hurts so much. I miss Max every day. And I... I still have nightmares about that dog's eyes...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe now. Take some deep breaths.",
    "Client: (Breathing deeply) It's just... I feel so guilty. If I had been stronger, or faster, maybe Max would still be alive. And now, every time I see a large dog, I panic. I can't even go to the park anymore...",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's coming down a bit... maybe 75? I still feel shaky, but talking about it... it helps somehow.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: Okay... (deep breath) You know, I've never told anyone all the details before. It's hard, but... I think I needed to get it out.",
    "Therapist: That's very courageous of you. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm down to about a 60. I feel drained, but also... lighter? Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a common experience. You've shown great strength today.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Taylor. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It still hurts, but... maybe there's hope?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You've taken a big step today. How about we end here?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. I'm exhausted, but... I'm glad we did this.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself. We'll continue next session."
