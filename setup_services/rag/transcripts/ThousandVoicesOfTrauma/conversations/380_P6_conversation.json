    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and describe the scene where you witnessed violence. Remember to stay present in the memory. What's your initial SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back there, in our old house. My parents are screaming at each other in the kitchen. I'm hiding behind the couch, peeking around the corner. My heart is racing. I'd say my SUDS is about a 6 right now.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: The yelling is getting louder. My dad's face is red, and he's clenching his fists. Mom is backing away, looking terrified. I want to help her, but I'm frozen. My stomach is in knots, and I'm trembling. I can smell dinner burning on the stove, forgotten in the chaos.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to an 8. I feel so helpless and scared.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Keep going, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Dad grabs a plate and throws it against the wall. The crash is deafening. Shards of ceramic scatter everywhere. Mom screams and covers her face. I'm crying silently, trying not to be noticed. My chest feels tight, like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS?",
    "Client: Still an 8. Maybe... maybe edging towards 9. I feel dizzy, like the room is spinning.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I see Dad advancing towards Mom. His eyes are wild, unfamiliar. She's cowering in the corner, begging him to stop. I want to run to her, but my legs won't move. The air feels thick, suffocating. I'm sweating, but I feel cold at the same time.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel overwhelmed, like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep breathing. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear a loud slap. Mom cries out in pain. I can't take it anymore. I start sobbing uncontrollably. Dad turns and sees me. His face changes, like he's waking up from a trance. He looks... ashamed. Mom rushes to me, hugging me tightly. I can feel her shaking.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down. Maybe a 7? I feel drained, but also relieved that it's over.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing the memory. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The kitchen is a mess. There's broken glass everywhere. The smell of burnt food is stronger now. Mom is stroking my hair, whispering that everything will be okay. Dad is just standing there, looking lost. I feel... confused. Angry. Scared it might happen again.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's hovering around 6 now. I feel exhausted, but less overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: You're doing excellent work. How does the memory end?",
    "Client: Mom takes me to my room. She tucks me in, even though it's not bedtime. She stays with me, humming softly until I fall asleep. I remember feeling safe with her there, but also worried about what would happen when she left.",
