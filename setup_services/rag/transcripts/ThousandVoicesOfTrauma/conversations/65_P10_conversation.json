    "Therapist: Welcome, Ali. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Honestly, I'm a bit on edge. I know we're going to be talking about the home invasion, and just thinking about it makes my heart race a little.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say... maybe a 4 out of 10? I'm not panicking, but I'm definitely tense.",
    "Therapist: Okay. When you're ready, close your eyes and describe the night of the invasion.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Alright... It's late, maybe around 11 PM. I'm in my room, scrolling through my phone. The house is quiet; my parents are already asleep. Suddenly, I hear a crash downstairs. At first, I think maybe my dad dropped something, but then I hear unfamiliar voices. My heart starts pounding...",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you hear?",
    "Client: I... I hear hushed voices. They're speaking Arabic, but it's a different dialect than what we use at home. There's the sound of drawers opening, things being moved around. I'm frozen in my bed, afraid to move.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's climbing... maybe a 6?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember to breathe. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I decide I need to do something. I reach for my phone to call the police, but my hands are shaking so much I can barely unlock it. I'm trying to be quiet, but I accidentally knock over a book on my nightstand. The voices downstairs suddenly stop. Oh God, I think they heard me...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. I can feel my heart pounding in my ears. My palms are sweaty, and I'm starting to feel a bit dizzy. I'm scared they're going to come upstairs.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear footsteps on the stairs. They're coming up slowly, probably trying to be quiet. I'm paralyzed with fear. I want to hide, but I can't move. The footsteps are getting closer to my door...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. I can feel my hands shaking just talking about it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Ali. Remember, this is just a memory. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *nods* Okay... The doorknob starts to turn. I'm holding my breath. The door creaks open, and I see a shadow in the doorway. It's a man, he's tall and wearing dark clothes. He has a mask on. Our eyes meet, and for a second, everything just stops. Then he shouts something to his partners downstairs. I can't understand what he's saying, but his voice is so angry...",
    "Therapist: What do you do in that moment?",
    "Client: I... I finally find my voice and I scream. I scream as loud as I can, hoping my parents will wake up, hoping the neighbors will hear. The man lunges towards me, and I roll off the bed, trying to get away. I'm still screaming, and I can hear my parents' door opening down the hall.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, Ali?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I feel like I'm back there. It's... it's intense.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. Remember, you're here in my office, safe.",
    "Client: *takes a few deep breaths* Okay... I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: The intruder grabs me, trying to cover my mouth. I'm fighting back, kicking and flailing. I can hear my dad shouting now, and there's commotion downstairs. The man holding me suddenly lets go and runs out of the room. I hear him thundering down the stairs, and then the sound of a door slamming.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: My parents rush into my room. My mom is crying, asking if I'm okay. My dad is on the phone with the police. I'm shaking uncontrollably, and I can't seem to form words. I just cling to my mom, sobbing. The house feels so violated, so unsafe...",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. I feel vulnerable, exposed. Like it could happen again at any moment.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's still high... maybe a 7?",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Ali. Let's take a few deep breaths together.",
    "Client: *breathes deeply with the therapist*",
    "Therapist: Good. Can you continue?",
    "Client: Yeah... The police arrive pretty quickly. They ask us questions, take statements. I feel like I'm in a daze, answering mechanically. They search the house, but the intruders are long gone. They took some jewelry, electronics... but all I can think about is how they took our sense of safety.",
    "Therapist: How does that loss of safety affect you now?",
    "Client: It's... it's always there. I have trouble sleeping at night. Every little noise makes me jump. I feel like I'm constantly on edge, waiting for something bad to happen again. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response to trauma. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: A bit drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved? Talking about it is hard, but it also feels like I'm facing it instead of running from it.",
    "Therapist: That's great insight, Ali. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's come down a bit. Maybe a 5?",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's continue. What happened in the days following the invasion?",
    "Client: It was tough. We stayed with my aunt for a few days while the police investigated. Coming back home was... it was really hard. I couldn't sleep in my room for weeks. I kept having nightmares about the man in the doorway. My parents installed a security system, but it didn't really help me feel safer.",
    "Therapist: How did you cope during that time?",
    "Client: Honestly, not very well. I started skipping classes, avoiding friends. I felt... ashamed, I guess? Like I should have done more to protect my family. And I was angry too, at the intruders, at myself, even at my parents for not waking up sooner. It was a mess of emotions.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to have complex emotions after a traumatic event. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's still hard, but talking about it... it helps. It's like each time I go through it, it loses a little bit of its power over me.",
    "Therapist: That's exactly the goal of these exercises. You're doing great, Ali.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's just... sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel completely safe again, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a common concern. We'll work on rebuilding that sense of safety. For now, how's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 4 now. Still there, but not as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's continue. How has this experience affected your relationships?",
    "Client: It's been tough. I've pulled away from a lot of my friends. It's hard to explain to them what I'm going through. And dating... I haven't even tried. The idea of being vulnerable with someone feels impossible right now.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. How about your relationship with your parents?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. On one hand, we've become closer. We check in on each other more, we're more protective. But there's also this unspoken tension. I think they feel guilty for not protecting me, and I feel guilty for bringing this into our home. It's like we're all walking on eggshells sometimes.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Frustrated, mostly. And sad. I want things to go back to normal, but I don't even know what normal is anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after trauma. Remember, healing takes time. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: A bit drained, but also... lighter? Like I've put down a heavy backpack I've been carrying around.",
    "Therapist: That's a great analogy. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 3, I think. Still there, but manageable.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today, Ali. How do you feel about the session?",
    "Client: It was tough, but... good. I feel like I'm making progress. It's still scary to talk about, but it's getting easier.",
    "Therapist: That's great to hear. Remember, healing isn't linear. Some days will be harder than others, but you're moving in the right direction.",
    "Client: Yeah, I'm starting to see that. Thanks for your help.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Ali. We'll continue this work in our next session. For now, take care of yourself and practice those grounding techniques we discussed.",
    "Client: I will. Thanks again.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, Ali. We'll talk again soon."
