    "Therapist: Hello, Mr. Johnson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I suppose. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been thinking a lot about our last session and the idea of this imaginal exposure you mentioned. It's been weighing on my mind.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... I've spent so long trying to forget about those experiences with the cult. The thought of purposely bringing them up and reliving them... it's terrifying. I'm worried I might lose control or get stuck in those memories. And honestly, I'm not sure how it's supposed to help. Won't it just make everything worse?",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your honesty. Let's address those concerns.",
    "Client: Okay, I'm listening. But I have to admit, I'm still skeptical. These memories... they're not just unpleasant, they're devastating. The way they isolated us, manipulated our thoughts, made us distrust our own families... it's like they rewired our brains. And the bullying that came after, when I finally got out... it was like I couldn't escape, even in the real world. How can reliving all that possibly be beneficial?",
    "Therapist: The goal is to process and integrate these memories, reducing their power over you.",
    "Client: I see... but how does that actually work? I mean, I understand the theory, but in practice, how do you stop memories from being so overwhelming? And what if I can't handle it? What if I break down completely?",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace and I'll guide you throughout. You're in control.",
    "Client: That's... somewhat reassuring. I appreciate that you're not pushing me to dive in headfirst. But I'm still worried about the aftermath. After we do this, will I be able to function normally? Go home to my wife, run my business? Or will I be a mess for days or weeks afterward?",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel some distress, but it typically subsides. We'll develop coping strategies.",
    "Client: Coping strategies... that sounds good. I could definitely use some of those. I've been relying on work to keep my mind occupied, but that's not always enough. And my wife, bless her, she tries to understand, but there's only so much I can explain to her. It's like there's this wall between us sometimes, built from all these experiences she can't possibly comprehend. Do you think this process might help with that too?",
    "Therapist: Yes, processing trauma can improve relationships. Shall we start with a brief exercise?",
    "Client: I... I guess so. I mean, we've come this far, right? And if it could help me connect better with my wife, that would be amazing. She's been my rock through all of this, even when I've pushed her away. Okay, let's do it. But... can we start with something small? Maybe not the worst memory right off the bat?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll start gently. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot. I've felt so unsafe for so long, even after leaving the cult. It's like I've been carrying this weight, this constant vigilance. Always watching for signs that someone might be trying to manipulate me again. It's exhausting. So... what do I do? How do we begin?",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes, breathe deeply. We'll start with a neutral memory first.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm closing my eyes. Deep breaths. This feels... strange. But not bad. It's quiet in here, isn't it? I can hear the clock ticking. It reminds me of... no, never mind. Let's stick to neutral memories. What should I think about?",
    "Therapist: Think of a calm place you enjoyed before the trauma. Describe it to me."
