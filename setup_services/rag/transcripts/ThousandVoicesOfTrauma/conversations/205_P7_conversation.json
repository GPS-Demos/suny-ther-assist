    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the scene?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in Afghanistan. It's a hot day, and I'm on patrol with my unit. We're walking through a small village, and everything seems quiet. Too quiet. I can feel the sweat trickling down my back, and my uniform feels heavy and uncomfortable.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: Suddenly, we hear shouting from one of the houses. A woman runs out, screaming for help. She's speaking rapidly in Pashto, but I catch words like \"children\" and \"taken.\" My heart starts racing, and I grip my weapon tighter.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: We... we follow her into the house. It's dark inside, and it takes a moment for my eyes to adjust. The smell hits me first - a mix of sweat, fear, and something else I can't quite place. As my vision clears, I see... oh God, I see children. So many children, huddled together, terrified.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: They're so young, some barely older than toddlers. Their eyes are wide with fear, and some are silently crying. I feel sick to my stomach. We quickly realize this is a human trafficking operation. The woman who called us in is sobbing, pointing to an empty corner where her daughter should be.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I... I don't know what to do. We're trained for combat, not this. I want to comfort the children, but I can't let my guard down. My mind is racing, trying to figure out how to secure the area and get these kids to safety. But all I can think about is how many we didn't find in time.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: We radio for backup and start trying to gather information. Some of the older children are able to tell us bits and pieces. It's a sophisticated operation, moving kids across borders. I feel so angry, so helpless. These are innocent children, and someone's treating them like... like commodities.",
    "Therapist: I understand this is difficult. You're doing great.",
    "Client: As we wait for support to arrive, I sit down next to a little boy. He can't be more than five or six. He's shaking, and I want to hug him, tell him it'll be okay. But I can't promise that. I don't even know if we'll find his parents. I just sit there, feeling useless, as he stares at me with those big, frightened eyes.",
    "Therapist: You're showing a lot of strength. Keep going.",
    "Client: The wait feels like an eternity. Every minute that passes, I think about the children we haven't found yet, about the ones being moved right now. I'm a trained soldier, but I feel so powerless. When our support finally arrives, it's almost a relief to have something to do, to start processing the scene. But I know I'll never forget those children's faces, or the weight of my own inadequacy in that moment.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Talking about it brings it all back so vividly. The fear, the anger, the helplessness. But also... I don't know, maybe a bit of relief? Like sharing this burden makes it a little lighter.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. You've shown great courage.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to think about, but I guess it's getting easier to talk about. I just wish I could have done more for those kids.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I know logically we did what we could, but emotionally... it's still tough. But I think I'm ready to face these memories now, instead of trying to bury them.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's a long road, but I feel like I'm finally moving forward instead of being stuck in that moment. I'm grateful for your support through this process.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll end here for today. You've made excellent progress."
