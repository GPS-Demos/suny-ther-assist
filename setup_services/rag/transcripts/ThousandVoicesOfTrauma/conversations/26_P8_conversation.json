    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. I can still see her face when she told me it was over. The way her eyes wouldn't meet mine. I feel this tightness in my chest, like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Anger. Definitely anger. But it's mixed with this overwhelming sadness. I dedicated seven years to our relationship, and she just... threw it away. Like it meant nothing. I keep replaying our last conversation in my head, wondering if I could have said something different, done something to change her mind.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's hot. Like a fire in my stomach that's spreading through my chest. My fists are clenched, and I notice I'm grinding my teeth. But then the sadness hits, and it's like a wave washing over me, extinguishing the fire and leaving me cold and empty.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are accompanying these feelings?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"I'm not good enough.\" It's like a mantra repeating in my head. But then another part of me is screaming, \"How could she do this to me?\" I trusted her completely, and now I feel like such a fool. I'm questioning every moment we shared, wondering if any of it was real.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How does this experience connect to your past?",
    "Client: I... wow, I hadn't thought about that. But now that you mention it, it reminds me of how my mother used to criticize me. She'd build me up one moment and tear me down the next. I never knew where I stood with her. Just like with my ex. I guess I've always been seeking validation, always afraid of being abandoned.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about that pattern?",
    "Client: It's... it's exhausting. I've spent so much of my life trying to be what others want me to be, always afraid of not measuring up. With my ex, I thought I'd finally found someone who accepted me as I am. But now... now I'm wondering if I ever really showed her my true self. Maybe I was just playing a role, like I did with my mother.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization make you feel?",
    "Client: Honestly? It makes me feel lost. Like I don't know who I am anymore. But there's also a tiny spark of... hope? Maybe? Like, if I've been playing a role all this time, maybe now I have a chance to figure out who I really am. It's terrifying, but also... exciting?",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to be your authentic self?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. I've spent so long trying to be what others want, I'm not even sure what I want anymore. But I think... I think it would mean being honest about my feelings, even when they're messy or uncomfortable. It would mean setting boundaries and not always putting others' needs before my own. It would mean accepting that I can't control how others see me or whether they stay in my life.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea sit with you?",
    "Client: It's scary. Really scary. But also... liberating? Like a weight being lifted off my shoulders. I've been carrying around so much anxiety, always worried about saying or doing the wrong thing. Always trying to predict what others want from me. The idea of just... being me... it's both terrifying and exhilarating.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you could take towards that authenticity?",
    "Client: I... I think maybe I could start by being more honest with my friends. I've been putting on a brave face, pretending I'm fine with the breakup. But I'm not. I'm hurting, and I'm scared, and I need support. Maybe I could start by telling them that.",
    "Therapist: How do you think they might respond?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me is afraid they'll think I'm weak or needy. But another part of me knows they care about me. They've been reaching out, offering support, but I've been pushing them away. Maybe... maybe they'd actually appreciate me being honest with them.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean for you if they responded supportively?",
    "Client: It would mean... everything. To know that I can be vulnerable, that I can show my true feelings and still be accepted and loved. It would be a completely new experience for me. I've always felt like I had to be strong, to handle everything on my own. The idea that I could lean on others, that they might want to support me... it's overwhelming, but in a good way.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your broader recovery journey?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's all part of learning to trust again. Not just others, but myself. To trust that I'm worthy of love and support, even when I'm not perfect. To trust that I can handle difficult emotions without falling apart. And to trust that even if relationships end, it doesn't mean I'm worthless or unlovable.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you say that?",
    "Client: A mix of emotions, really. There's sadness for all the years I spent hiding parts of myself, fear of what it means to be truly vulnerable. But there's also this growing sense of... possibility? Like maybe this breakup, as painful as it is, could be the start of something new. A chance to build relationships based on who I really am, not who I think I should be.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that possibility?",
    "Client: It's... it's both exciting and terrifying. I feel like I'm standing on the edge of a cliff. Jumping is scary, but staying where I am isn't an option anymore. I want to live authentically, to have real connections. I'm realizing that even though the breakup hurts, maybe it's forcing me to confront things I've been avoiding for years.",
    "Therapist: What's one thing you've learned about yourself today?",
    "Client: I think... I think I've learned that I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. This imaginal exposure was incredibly difficult, but I got through it. And not only that, but I'm starting to see patterns and make connections I never noticed before. It's painful, but it's also... empowering? Like maybe I have more control over my life and my happiness than I thought.",
    "Therapist: How will you care for yourself after this session?",
    "Client: I... I think I need some time to process all of this. Maybe I'll go for a walk in the park, let myself feel whatever comes up without judgment. And... I think I might reach out to a friend, be honest about how I'm feeling. It's a small step, but it feels like an important one.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but in a good way? Like I've just finished a really intense workout. There's pain, but also a sense of accomplishment. And underneath it all, there's this tiny spark of hope. Like maybe, just maybe, I can come out of this stronger and more authentic than before.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing so openly. We'll pick up here next time.",
    "Client: Thank you. This was hard, but... I think it was important. I'm actually looking forward to our next session, even though I know it won't be easy. I feel like I'm finally starting to understand myself better."
