    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to dive into some heavy stuff today, and part of me wants to just run out that door. But I'm here, right? That's something.",
    "Therapist: It is. Your commitment is admirable. Are you ready to begin the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I guess so. As ready as I'll ever be. Where do we start?",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day. Describe what you see, hear, and feel.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm... I'm in the Humvee. The air is thick with dust and it's so hot. God, it's always so hot. I can feel sweat trickling down my back. The radio's crackling with chatter, but I can't make out the words. Everything feels tense, like we're all waiting for something to happen.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's happening now?",
    "Client: We're moving slowly through the city. Buildings are half-destroyed, there's debris everywhere. I'm scanning the rooftops, my fingers tight on my weapon. I... I can smell something burning. My mouth is so dry.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 40? It's uncomfortable, but I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: We turn a corner and... oh God. There's a group of children playing in the street. They look so normal, so out of place in all this destruction. I want to smile, but I can't let my guard down. And then... then I see movement on a rooftop. Just a flash, but I know. I know what's coming.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Panic. Pure panic. My heart's racing, I can barely breathe. I'm yelling, trying to warn the others, but everything's happening so fast. The explosion... it's so loud. I can feel the heat, the force of it. And the screams... oh God, the screams.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Sarah. Remember, you're safe here. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 70. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: I know it is. You're very brave. Take a deep breath. Can you continue?",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, I can. The dust is settling, and I... I can see the aftermath. There's so much blood. One of the kids, a little girl, she's not moving. I want to help her, but we're under fire. I can hear the bullets pinging off the Humvee. I'm frozen. I can't move. I should be doing something, but I can't...",
    "Therapist: You're right there in the moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking this is all my fault. If I'd spotted the threat sooner, if I'd reacted faster... maybe that little girl would still be alive. Maybe my team wouldn't be in danger. I feel so useless, so... guilty.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you couldn't have controlled everything. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's pretty high. Maybe 85?",
    "Therapist: Let's take a moment. Focus on your breathing. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... okay. I'm here. It's just... it feels so real.",
    "Therapist: I know. You're doing great. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: We manage to get out of there. The rest is a blur of shouting, more explosions in the distance. When we get back to base, I'm numb. I can still see that little girl's face. I... I throw up as soon as I'm alone. I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel now, remembering that?",
    "Client: Sad. So incredibly sad. And angry. Why did it have to happen? Why couldn't I do more?",
    "Therapist: Those are natural feelings. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's down a bit. Maybe 60?",
    "Therapist: Good. You're processing this well. What happened in the following days?",
    "Client: I couldn't sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw those kids. I started volunteering for every dangerous mission I could. Part of me hoped... I don't know. That I could make up for it somehow? Or maybe that I'd... that something would happen to me too.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like it was a very difficult time. How do you feel about it now?",
    "Client: It's still hard. But... I guess I understand now that I was punishing myself. That I couldn't have saved everyone.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually down to about 40. Talking about it... it helps, somehow.",
    "Therapist: You're doing excellent work, Sarah. Let's continue a bit more. What else do you remember?",
    "Client: I remember the first time I laughed after that day. It was weeks later, and someone told a stupid joke. I laughed, and then immediately felt guilty. Like I didn't deserve to be happy. But now... now I think maybe that laughter was the start of healing.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How does that memory feel now?",
    "Client: Bittersweet, I guess. But not as painful as before.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: Maybe... 30? It's getting easier to talk about.",
    "Therapist: You're making great progress. Let's wrap up for today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Tired. Really tired. But... maybe a little lighter? Like I've set down a bit of the weight I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's often how it feels. You did incredibly well today, Sarah.",
    "Client: Thank you. It... it means a lot to hear that. I know we have more work to do, but... I think I can do this.",
    "Therapist: I believe you can too. We'll continue next session. For now, take care of yourself.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you... for everything.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Sarah. I'll see you next week."
