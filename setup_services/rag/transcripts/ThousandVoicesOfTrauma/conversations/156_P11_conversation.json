    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel... I don't know, maybe a little shaky? But also... relieved? Is that strange?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. Can you tell me more about that?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... going through that memory again, it was intense. I could hear the gunfire, smell the smoke, feel the fear in my gut. But this time, I didn't feel... trapped in it, you know? I knew I was here, in this room, and that I was safe. It's... it's different from when I usually remember it.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant observation. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: I think... the faces of my fellow soldiers. I've always focused on the chaos, the danger, but this time... I noticed their determination, their bravery. It made me feel... proud, I guess. Proud to have served with them.",
    "Therapist: How does that pride sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. I feel guilty for feeling proud when so many didn't make it back. But... it's also comforting, in a way. Like their strength is still with me, even now.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How might this new perspective impact your daily life?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe I could start looking at old photos again? I've avoided them for so long, but now I'm thinking they might bring some comfort instead of just pain.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a meaningful step. How do you feel about trying that?",
    "Client: Nervous, but... hopeful? It's like... maybe I can start reclaiming some of those memories instead of just running from them.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent insight. What else did you notice during the exposure?",
    "Client: I... I realized that my anxiety now, in everyday life... it's not so different from what I felt then. The hypervigilance, the constant tension... it's like I'm still in that combat zone sometimes. But today, I could separate then from now. It was... empowering, I guess?",
    "Therapist: That's a crucial connection. How might you use this awareness?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I can start recognizing when I'm reacting to old threats instead of real ones? Like, when I'm at the grocery store and get overwhelmed, I could remind myself that I'm not in danger anymore.",
    "Therapist: Excellent strategy. How do you feel about continuing these exposures?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. Really hard. But I think it's helping. I feel... I don't know, like I'm starting to take control back? Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Your progress is commendable. Shall we schedule our next session?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I... I think I'm ready to keep going. It's tough, but... I want my life back, you know?",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's set that up. You're doing great work, Mrs. Johnson."
