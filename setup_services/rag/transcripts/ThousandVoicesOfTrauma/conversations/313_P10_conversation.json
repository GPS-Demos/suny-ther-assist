    "Therapist: Good morning, Margaret. How are you feeling about our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: Oh, hello there, young man. I... I'm not quite sure how I'm feeling, to be honest. My hands are a bit shaky, and I've been thinking about this all night. It's not easy, you know, reliving these things at my age.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's start slowly. Can you close your eyes and describe where you are at the beginning of the memory?",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Alright... I'm in my living room. It's evening, and I'm sitting in my favorite armchair. The lamp is on, casting a warm glow. I can smell the chamomile tea I just made. It's quiet, peaceful. I'm... I'm reading a book about gardening, thinking about what flowers I might plant come spring.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear a noise. At first, I think it's just the house settling, but then... then there's a loud crash. It sounds like it's coming from the kitchen. My heart starts racing. I... I put my book down and stand up, my legs feeling wobbly.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Oh, I'd say about a 60. My palms are getting sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What do you do after hearing the crash?",
    "Client: I... I call out, \"Hello? Is someone there?\" My voice is shaking. There's no answer, but I hear footsteps. They're heavy, unfamiliar. I'm frozen in place, my mind racing. Should I run? Hide? Call for help? But my phone is in the kitchen...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My chest is tight, like I can't breathe properly. My mouth is dry, and I can hear my heart pounding in my ears. I feel so... so helpless. I'm not as spry as I used to be, you know. I can't just run away.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Margaret. Remember, you're here with me, safe in this room. What happens next?",
    "Client: A man appears in the doorway. He's big, wearing dark clothes and a mask. I can see his eyes, though. They're cold, calculating. He says, \"Don't move, old lady. Where's your valuables?\" His voice is gruff, threatening. I... I start to tremble all over.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 80, I'd say. This is hard, doctor.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Margaret. Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor, your back against the chair. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) Okay... I tell him, \"Please, don't hurt me. I'll give you whatever you want.\" My voice sounds small, frightened. He starts ransacking the room, pulling out drawers, knocking things over. The noise is overwhelming. I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you thinking in that moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about my late husband, wishing he was here to protect me. I'm angry at myself for being so vulnerable, for living alone. I'm scared he'll hurt me, that I'll die here, alone and afraid.",
    "Therapist: Those are natural thoughts in such a terrifying situation. What happens as he continues searching?",
    "Client: He keeps demanding to know where I keep my jewelry, my cash. I tell him about the safe in my bedroom, hoping he'll just take what he wants and leave. But he... he grabs my arm, roughly. His grip is so tight, I can feel bruises forming. He drags me towards the bedroom, and I stumble, nearly falling.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, Margaret?",
    "Client: I'm at a 90, doctor. It's... it's almost too much.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave, Margaret. Remember, this is a memory. You survived this. Take a few deep breaths with me.",
    "Client: (Breathing deeply) Thank you... I... I can continue.",
    "Therapist: Okay. What happens in the bedroom?",
    "Client: He pushes me towards the safe, tells me to open it. My hands are shaking so badly, I can barely work the combination. I'm fumbling, and he's getting angrier. He shoves me aside and tries to do it himself. I... I see my chance. There's a heavy lamp on the bedside table. I grab it and... and I swing it at his head with all my strength.",
    "Therapist: What happens when you swing the lamp?",
    "Client: It connects with a sickening thud. He stumbles, falls to his knees. I'm in shock, I can't believe I did that. But then... then survival instinct kicks in. I run, as fast as my old legs can carry me. I'm gasping for air, my heart feels like it might burst. I make it to my neighbor's house, pounding on their door, screaming for help.",
    "Therapist: You showed incredible strength, Margaret. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I'm surprised. I feel a bit proud, actually. I didn't know I had that in me. My distress... it's down to about 70 now.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. Can you tell me what happens next?",
    "Client: My neighbors call the police. They arrive quickly, sirens blaring. I'm wrapped in a blanket, shaking, as they search my house. They find him, still unconscious in my bedroom. I watch as they handcuff him, lead him away. I feel... relieved, but also hollow. Like something's been taken from me that I can never get back.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after trauma. How does the memory end for you?",
    "Client: I'm sitting in a police car, giving my statement. An officer tells me I was brave, that I did the right thing. But all I can think about is how my safe, peaceful home doesn't feel safe anymore. I'm exhausted, drained. I just want to sleep, but I'm afraid to close my eyes.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Margaret. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. Tired, but okay. My distress is down to about 50 now. It's strange, talking about it like this. It's hard, but... but I feel a little stronger.",
    "Therapist: You did extremely well. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves before we end the session.",
    "Client: Thank you, doctor. I... I think I'd like that.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's start by focusing on your breath..."
