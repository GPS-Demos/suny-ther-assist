    "Therapist: Alright, Mr. Johnson, let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's begin. Close your eyes and describe the refugee camp scene.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm there. The camp is crowded, tents everywhere. The smell of unwashed bodies and sewage is overwhelming. I can hear children crying and people arguing in the distance. My family and I just arrived, and we're exhausted from the journey. The guards look intimidating with their guns...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue.",
    "Client: We're directed to a small tent. It's barely big enough for the five of us. The ground is hard and damp. I'm worried about my wife and kids, especially my youngest who's been sick. The uncertainty of our future is crushing...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6.",
    "Therapist: I hear that. Keep going.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's shouting outside. People are running. I peek out and see a fight breaking out near the food distribution area. My heart's racing. I'm torn between investigating and staying to protect my family. The noise is getting louder, and I can smell smoke...",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. My palms are sweating, and I feel a tightness in my chest.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with it if you can.",
    "Client: I... I decide to check outside. As I step out, I see flames. A tent is on fire. People are panicking, pushing each other. I'm scared for my family, but I can't move. My legs feel like lead. I'm frozen, watching the chaos unfold...",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I can't breathe. My heart is pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I force myself to turn back to our tent. But in the crowd, I've lost my bearings. Everything looks the same. I can't find our tent. I'm calling out for my wife and kids, but my voice is drowned out by the commotion. I feel so helpless, so guilty for leaving them...",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: Still a 9. I feel sick to my stomach. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: After what feels like hours, I finally spot our tent. I rush in, and thankfully, they're all there. My wife is holding our youngest, who's crying. The older kids look terrified. I want to comfort them, but I feel like I've failed them by leaving. The guilt is overwhelming...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe a 7.",
    "Therapist: I see. What's happening as the memory continues?",
    "Client: We spend the night huddled together, barely sleeping. The next morning, we see the damage from the fire. Some families lost everything. There's a heavy silence in the camp. I feel a mix of relief that we're okay and guilt that others weren't so fortunate...",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5 now. I feel drained, but less anxious.",
    "Therapist: You've done well. Let's start wrapping up.",
    "Client: Okay. As I open my eyes, I feel... I don't know, a bit shaky but also relieved it's over.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: My SUDS is about a 3. I'm surprised I made it through.",
    "Therapist: You did great. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves before we discuss further."
