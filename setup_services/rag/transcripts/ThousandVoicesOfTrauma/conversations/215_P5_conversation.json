    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do. I've been having more nightmares lately about that night at the convenience store. It's like I can't escape it, even in my sleep.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you familiar with this?",
    "Client: Not really. Is it... is it going to be difficult?",
    "Therapist: It can be challenging, but it's a crucial step in your healing journey. Ready to learn more?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Though I'm not sure I want to relive that night. It's hard enough dealing with the memories as they are.",
    "Therapist: Your hesitation is normal. This technique helps process the trauma. Shall I explain further?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I want to understand what I'm getting into. Will it make the nightmares worse?",
    "Therapist: It may initially intensify symptoms, but ultimately helps reduce them. We'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: That's... a little scary to hear. But I trust you. Can you tell me more about what we'll actually be doing?",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit the traumatic memory in a safe environment. You'll describe it in detail, present tense.",
    "Client: In the present tense? Like it's happening now? I... I don't know if I can do that. My heart's already racing just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Your reaction is normal. We'll start slowly and you can pause anytime. How does that sound?",
    "Client: A little better, I guess. But what if I panic? Or can't continue?",
    "Therapist: I'll be here to support you. We have grounding techniques if needed. Your safety is priority.",
    "Client: Okay. I appreciate that. It's just... it's been so long since I've allowed myself to really think about that night. I've been trying so hard to forget.",
    "Therapist: Avoidance is common, but confronting the memory helps long-term healing. You're very brave, Maria.",
    "Client: Thank you. I don't feel brave, but I want to get better. How long will this process take?",
    "Therapist: It varies for each person. We'll go at your pace, over several sessions. Any other questions?",
    "Client: I think I understand better now. It's still scary, but I'm willing to try. Can we start slowly today?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll begin gently. Remember, you're in control. Ready to take this step?",
    "Client: I am. It's time to face this. I can't keep living in fear. Let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Let's start with a relaxation exercise first. Close your eyes..."
