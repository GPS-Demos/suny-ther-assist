    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. The memories of that medical procedure, they just came flooding back. I could almost feel the cold metal of the instruments, smell the antiseptic... It's like I was right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The helplessness. I felt so powerless, like I had no control over what was happening to my body. And the fear... God, the fear was paralyzing. I kept thinking about all the people who go through human trafficking, how they must feel that same helplessness every day. It's horrifying.",
    "Therapist: How does that connect to your daily life now?",
    "Client: I... I guess I'm always on edge, waiting for something bad to happen. I struggle to trust doctors or anyone in authority. It's affecting my work, my relationships. I'm constantly anxious, always looking over my shoulder.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really challenging. How did it feel to revisit the memory today?",
    "Client: It was... hard. Really hard. But also... I don't know, maybe a little empowering? Like, I survived it once, and I survived telling it again. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What else did you notice?",
    "Client: I realized how much anger I'm carrying. Not just at the people who did this to me, but at the system that allows human trafficking to continue. It makes me want to do something, to help somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How might you channel that?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe volunteer? Or donate to organizations fighting trafficking? I feel like I need to do something constructive with these feelings.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive direction. What else came up for you?",
    "Client: I noticed my body's reactions more this time. My heart was racing, palms sweating. But I was able to use those grounding techniques we practiced. They actually helped a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's scary, but... I think it's helping. I feel like I'm starting to understand myself better, you know? And maybe... maybe I'm not as powerless as I thought.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant insight. What's your takeaway from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. And maybe by facing this head-on, I can start to reclaim some of the control I lost. It's not easy, but I'm beginning to see a way forward.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful conclusion. How can we build on this for next time?",
    "Client: I'd like to work more on those grounding techniques. And maybe... maybe start thinking about how I can use my experience to help others. Is that something we could explore?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll focus on that next session. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... okay. Better than I expected, actually. Thank you for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't judge.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your courage is admirable. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?",

    "Therapist: You've done the hard work. We'll end here for today. Take care of yourself.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again. See you next week."
