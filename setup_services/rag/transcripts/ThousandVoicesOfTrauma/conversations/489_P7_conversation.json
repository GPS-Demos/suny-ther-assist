    "Therapist: Good morning, Mr. Johnson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Morning, Dr. Thompson. I'm... I'm alright, I suppose. A bit nervous about today's session, if I'm honest. My back's been acting up again, which doesn't help.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's begin when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay, I'll try. So, it was about five years ago when that terrible flood hit our town. I remember waking up in the middle of the night to the sound of rushing water. At first, I thought it was just heavy rain, but then I heard my neighbor shouting outside. When I looked out the window, I saw water everywhere. It was rising so fast, already reaching the bottom of my front door. I panicked. I didn't know what to do. I live alone, you know, since the divorce, and I felt so helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The water kept rising, and I could hear things crashing outside. I grabbed what I could - some clothes, my medicine, and my late wife's photo. But as I was trying to figure out how to get out, the power went out. It was pitch black, and the water was now ankle-deep inside my house. I was terrified. I couldn't swim well due to my arthritis, and I feared I might drown in my own home.",
    "Therapist: That sounds frightening. You're safe here.",
    "Client: It was. I managed to open the front door, but the current was so strong it almost knocked me over. I held onto the doorframe, shouting for help. The water was so cold, and my legs were in pain from the arthritis. I saw my neighbors' houses, some partially submerged. Cars were floating down the street. It was like a nightmare, but I couldn't wake up from it.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: I don't know how long I stood there, but eventually, I heard a boat. It was the rescue team. They were going house to house, helping people. When they got to me, I was shivering and in shock. They had to practically pry my hands off the doorframe to get me into the boat. As we moved through the neighborhood, I saw the destruction everywhere. Houses damaged, trees uprooted, and people crying. It was overwhelming. I felt guilty for being rescued when others were still waiting.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. You're doing great.",
    "Client: At the evacuation center, it was chaos. So many people, all of us lost and confused. I couldn't stop shaking, partly from the cold, partly from fear. I kept thinking about my home, my belongings, my whole life potentially washed away. The pain in my back was excruciating from the stress and the cold. I felt so alone, even surrounded by all those people. It was then that I realized how much I missed having a family, someone to lean on in times like these.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: The days that followed were a blur. We couldn't go back to our homes for weeks. Living in the shelter was hard, especially with my chronic pain. I couldn't sleep on those cots, and the stress made the pain worse. When we finally could return, my house was a mess. Everything was ruined - furniture, photos, memories. The smell of mold and mud was overwhelming. I broke down right there in what used to be my living room. It felt like I had lost everything, not just possessions, but a sense of security. Even now, years later, whenever it rains heavily, I get anxious. I worry it might happen again, that I'll lose everything once more.",
    "Therapist: You've come so far. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Talking about it... it's hard, but I feel a bit lighter. Like I'm not carrying it all alone anymore. But I'm exhausted, and my back is really hurting now. Can we stop here for today?",
    "Therapist: Of course. You did exceptionally well."
