    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Can you describe the scene when you witnessed the violence?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm at home. It's late evening, and I hear shouting from next door. My heart starts racing as I realize it's my neighbors fighting again. I can hear glass shattering and a woman screaming. I'm frozen, unsure what to do.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 6 out of 10. My palms are getting sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Let's continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: The screaming gets louder. I hear thumping sounds, like someone's being thrown against a wall. I'm shaking now, torn between calling the police and being too scared to get involved. I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's climbing... maybe an 8? My chest feels tight, and I'm having trouble breathing steadily.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What do you see or hear next?",
    "Client: I... I see the woman run out of the house. Her face is bruised, and she's sobbing. She looks right at me through my window, and I see such fear and desperation in her eyes. I feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. I feel like I'm right back there, seeing it all happen again.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here with me. You're safe. What happens after you see her?",
    "Client: I finally snap out of my paralysis and call 911. My hands are shaking so much I can barely dial. I'm whispering into the phone, terrified her husband will hear me and come after me next.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Still pretty high, maybe an 8.5. My heart is pounding in my ears.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're doing great. What occurs after the call?",
    "Client: I hear sirens in the distance. The woman is huddled on the sidewalk, crying. Her husband comes out, sees her, and starts yelling. I'm sure he's going to attack her again, but then the police cars pull up.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7? I feel a little relief seeing the police arrive.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this well. What happens as the police arrive?",
    "Client: They separate the couple. An officer comes to talk to me as a witness. I'm still shaking, but I manage to tell them what I saw and heard. I feel guilty for not calling sooner, wondering if I could have prevented her injuries.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's around a 6 now. I feel drained, but the immediate panic is subsiding.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job. How does the scene conclude?",
    "Client: The woman is taken to an ambulance. Her husband is arrested. The street is full of flashing lights, and curious neighbors are peeking out their windows. I feel exhausted and numb, but also relieved it's over.",
    "Therapist: And your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: I'd say it's down to a 5. I'm feeling emotionally worn out, but the intense anxiety has faded.",
    "Therapist: Well done. Let's take a moment to breathe and ground ourselves."
