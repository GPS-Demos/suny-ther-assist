    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Johnson. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to be talking about what happened at the hospital, and just thinking about it makes my heart race a little.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in the emergency room. The lights are so bright, and there's this constant beeping from machines. I can smell antiseptic, and it's making me nauseous. I'm lying on a gurney, and my chest... oh god, my chest hurts so much.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's happening around you?",
    "Client: There are doctors and nurses rushing around. They're talking so fast, using words I don't understand. I hear someone say \"cardiac event\" and I'm terrified. I don't know what's happening to me.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, in your body?",
    "Client: My heart is pounding. I can feel sweat on my forehead, and my hands are clammy. I'm trying to ask what's wrong, but no one's listening to me. They're just... they're treating me like I'm not even there.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 70. I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe now. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... um, a nurse is putting an IV in my arm. It stings, and I wince. She doesn't even look at me. I'm scared and alone, even though the room is full of people. My husband... where's my husband? I keep asking for him, but no one's answering me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm going to die. No one's telling me anything, and the pain in my chest is getting worse. I'm gasping for air, and I hear alarms going off. Someone shouts \"We're losing her!\" and I... I...",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take another deep breath. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I need... I need someone to hold my hand. To tell me it's going to be okay. But there's no one. I'm all alone, surrounded by strangers who are treating me like a problem to solve, not a person.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 85. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you survived this. Let's ground ourselves for a moment. Can you name five things you can see in this room?",
    "Client: Um... your desk, the painting on the wall, the plant in the corner, the box of tissues, and... and my own hands.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, continue with what happened next.",
    "Client: They're... they're putting an oxygen mask on my face. It's cold and plastic, and I feel like I can't breathe. I'm trying to pull it off, but someone's holding my hands down. I feel so trapped, so powerless. And then... then everything starts to go dark. I can hear voices fading away, and I think... I think this is it. This is how I die.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about my kids. About how I won't see them graduate, or get married. I'm thinking about all the things I never said to my husband. And I'm angry. I'm so angry that this is happening to me, that I'm alone, that no one seems to care.",
    "Therapist: Your anger is valid. How does it feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a fire in my chest. My jaw is clenched, and I want to scream, but I can't because of the mask. I'm furious at the doctors for not explaining anything, at my husband for not being there, at myself for... for being weak.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're not weak. You're incredibly strong for facing this. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Everything goes black. The next thing I remember is waking up in a different room. It's quieter, and the lights are dimmer. I can hear the steady beep of a heart monitor, and I realize... I realize I'm alive.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. I'm relieved, but also confused and scared. What happened? Why am I here? And then I see my husband. He's asleep in a chair next to my bed, and he looks... he looks so tired and worried.",
    "Therapist: What do you want to do in that moment?",
    "Client: I want to reach out to him, but I can't move. My body feels heavy and strange. I try to speak, but my throat hurts and no sound comes out. I feel... I feel trapped in my own body.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly frustrating. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My distress is... it's down to about 60. I'm still anxious, but knowing I survived helps.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's continue. What happens when your husband wakes up?",
    "Client: He... he notices I'm awake and jumps up. He's crying, telling me how scared he was, how he thought he'd lost me. And I... I want to comfort him, but I also feel angry. Where was he when I needed him? Why wasn't he there?",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have mixed feelings. Can you express that anger now?",
    "Client: I... I want to yell at him. I want to ask him why he left me alone, why he wasn't there to hold my hand when I thought I was dying. But I can't speak, and it's... it's infuriating. I feel like I'm going to explode with all these emotions I can't express.",
    "Therapist: Allow yourself to feel that anger fully. What does it want to say?",
    "Client: It wants to scream, \"Where were you? I needed you! I was so scared and alone, and you weren't there!\" But... but I also know it's not his fault. He probably wasn't allowed in the emergency room. And that makes me even angrier, at the whole situation.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 75. Remembering that anger is intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Take a deep breath. What happens next?",
    "Client: A doctor comes in. He starts explaining what happened - that I had a heart attack, that they had to perform emergency surgery. But I'm not really listening. I'm watching my husband's face, seeing the fear and relief there. And I'm... I'm realizing how close I came to losing everything.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it affect you?",
    "Client: It's... it's terrifying. I feel so vulnerable, so mortal. And I'm angry at my body for betraying me like this. I've always taken care of myself, and now... now I can't trust my own heart to keep beating.",
    "Therapist: That loss of trust can be devastating. How are you coping with it?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure I am coping. Every twinge, every slight pain makes me panic. I'm constantly afraid it's going to happen again. And I'm... I'm pushing my family away because I don't want them to see me like this, weak and scared.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to feel that way. But remember, seeking support isn't weakness. How might letting your family in help?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Part of me wants to be held, to be comforted. But another part is so afraid of being vulnerable, of being a burden. I don't want them to worry about me all the time.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How do you think your family would respond if you shared these feelings with them?",
    "Client: I... I think they'd want to help. My husband, he's been so patient, even when I snap at him. And my kids, they've been tiptoeing around me. Maybe... maybe if I let them in, it would be better for all of us.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive step. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling a bit lighter. My distress is down to about 50. Talking about it, really facing those memories... it's hard, but it's also kind of liberating.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. How do you feel about ending the session here?",
    "Client: I think... I think that's good. It's a lot to process, but I feel like I've made some progress.",
    "Therapist: You absolutely have. Remember to be kind to yourself as you continue to work through this. We'll pick up here next time.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I'm actually looking forward to it, in a way. It's hard, but it feels important.",
    "Therapist: It is important, and you're doing great. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
