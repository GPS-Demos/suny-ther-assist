    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure exercise. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the hostage situation?",
    "Client: It was a normal day at the bank where I work. I was helping a customer when suddenly there was shouting. Three men with masks burst in, waving guns. They ordered everyone to get down on the floor. I was terrified, my heart racing. I could smell the fear in the air.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: One of the men grabbed me by the arm, dragging me to the vault. His grip was so tight, it hurt. He kept yelling at me to open it, but my hands were shaking so badly. I couldn't remember the code. I was sure he was going to shoot me.",
    "Therapist: That must have been terrifying. You're safe now.",
    "Client: It was. I finally managed to open the vault, and they shoved me inside with some other employees. We were huddled together, crying silently. I could hear them ransacking the bank. Every loud noise made me jump. I thought about my family, wondering if I'd ever see them again.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: Hours passed. It felt like an eternity. My legs were cramping from sitting on the cold floor. I was so thirsty, but too afraid to ask for water. Then we heard sirens. The robbers started panicking, yelling at each other. I was sure they were going to kill us all before the police could get in.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're here now.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there was a loud bang and smoke filled the air. I couldn't see anything. People were screaming. Someone grabbed me, and I thought it was one of the robbers. I struggled, but then I realized it was a police officer. They were evacuating us. When I got outside, the bright sunlight hurt my eyes. I collapsed on the ground, sobbing uncontrollably.",
    "Therapist: You've done an excellent job describing that. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I... I feel shaky. My heart is racing, just like it did that day. I can still smell the smoke, feel the fear. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) It's hard to believe it's over sometimes. I still have nightmares about being trapped in that vault, thinking I'll never get out.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great facing these memories. What else do you recall?",
    "Client: I remember the aftermath. The police questioning, the news reporters hounding us. I couldn't sleep for days. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw those masked men. I started drinking to numb the fear and memories. It... it nearly destroyed my marriage.",
    "Therapist: You've been through so much. How do you feel now, talking about it?",
    "Client: It's... it's still painful, but different. Like I'm watching it happen to someone else. I feel sad for that scared woman in the bank, but I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I survived it once, I can survive talking about it now.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. You are strong.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without falling apart. It's still hard, but... I think I'm starting to see that it doesn't have the same hold on me it once did.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How do you feel physically now?",
    "Client: My heart rate has slowed down. I feel less shaky. There's still this knot in my stomach, but it's not as intense as when we started.",
    "Therapist: You've done remarkably well today. How would you like to end our session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to sit quietly for a moment, if that's okay. Just to let everything settle. And maybe... maybe we could talk about some strategies for when the memories come up outside of our sessions?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take a moment to breathe together."
