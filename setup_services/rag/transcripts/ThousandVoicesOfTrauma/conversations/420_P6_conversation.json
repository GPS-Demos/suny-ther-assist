    "Therapist: Alright, let's begin the imaginal exposure. Can you describe the animal attack you witnessed? Start with your SUDS level.",
    "Client: Okay, um... I'd say my SUDS is about a 4 right now. It was a sunny afternoon, and I was walking in the park near my university. I saw a large dog, maybe a Rottweiler, approach a young girl who was playing...",
    "Therapist: Continue. What happened next?",
    "Client: The dog suddenly lunged at her, growling fiercely. I froze in shock as it knocked her down. Her screams... they were so piercing. I can still hear them echoing in my head. The dog was biting her arm, shaking it violently. There was blood... so much blood...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 7. My heart is racing, and I feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Keep going. You're doing well.",
    "Client: I... I wanted to help, but I couldn't move. My legs felt like lead. A man ran over, trying to pull the dog off. But it was so strong... The girl's cries were getting weaker. I thought... I thought she might die right there in front of me.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My SUDS is at 8. I'm sweating, and my hands are shaking. I feel so guilty... I should have done something.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. Remember, you're safe now. What happened next?",
    "Client: Finally, the dog's owner arrived and managed to control it. The girl was lying there, barely moving. There was blood everywhere... on her clothes, on the grass. The ambulance came, but it felt like it took forever. I just stood there, useless...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's still at 8. My chest feels tight, and I can't stop trembling.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep breathing. What else do you remember?",
    "Client: The paramedics were working on her, and I could hear them saying something about severe lacerations. Her parents arrived, and their anguished cries... God, I'll never forget that sound. I felt so helpless, so... inadequate.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My SUDS has dropped to a 6. I feel drained, but the tightness in my chest is easing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this well. What happened after that?",
    "Client: The police came and started asking questions. I gave them my statement, but I felt like I was in a daze. Everything seemed surreal. I couldn't stop thinking about how quickly a normal day had turned into a nightmare.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5. I feel... I don't know, numb? Like I'm disconnected from it all.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. You're doing well. Can you describe how you felt in the days after?",
    "Client: I couldn't sleep properly for weeks. Every time I closed my eyes, I'd see that girl's face, hear her screams. I avoided parks, dogs... I felt on edge all the time. It was exhausting.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's back to a 4. I feel tired, but... lighter somehow. Like talking about it is helping to lift a weight off my shoulders.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How do you feel about the experience now?",
    "Client: I still feel guilty sometimes, but I understand that freezing is a normal response to trauma. I'm learning to forgive myself. It's a process, but I'm getting there.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. How would you rate your final SUDS?",
    "Client: I'd say it's at a 3 now. I feel drained but also... relieved? Like I've faced something I've been avoiding for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's fantastic progress. Let's start our cool-down."
