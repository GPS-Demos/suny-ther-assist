    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's begin. Close your eyes and recall the memory we discussed.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm at the grocery store. I can see the fluorescent lights and smell the produce section. I'm reaching for some apples when I hear someone behind me say, \"You people are always in the way.\" I freeze, feeling my heart start to race.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue with the memory.",
    "Client: I turn around, and there's this older white man glaring at me. He mumbles something about \"going back where I came from.\" I feel my face getting hot, and my hands are shaking. I want to say something, but I'm scared he might get violent.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. My chest feels tight, and I'm starting to sweat.",
    "Therapist: That sounds challenging. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I try to ignore him and finish my shopping, but I can feel his eyes on me. Other people are staring too. I feel so exposed and vulnerable. It's like I'm not even a person to them, just some... some intruder. My legs feel weak, and I'm having trouble focusing on what I need to buy.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: (voice trembling) It's an 8 now. I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (inhales deeply) I abandon my cart and hurry to the exit. As I'm leaving, I hear someone laugh. I don't know if it's directed at me, but it feels like it is. I get to my car and just sit there, shaking. I feel so angry and helpless and... ashamed. Like maybe I did something wrong just by existing.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's still an 8. My heart is pounding, and I feel nauseous.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice breaks) I know, but it feels so real. I can still hear his voice, see the disgust in his eyes. I wish I had stood up for myself, said something back. But I was too scared. I feel like such a coward.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: (sighs) It's come down a bit. Maybe a 7 now.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Can you describe what you're feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My shoulders are tense, and there's a knot in my stomach. I feel drained, like all my energy has been sucked out. But the shaking has stopped.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Let's continue.",

    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5. I feel sad more than anything now.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. Let's start to bring your attention back to the present."
