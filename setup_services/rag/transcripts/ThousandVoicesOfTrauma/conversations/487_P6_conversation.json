    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, you can stop anytime. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10 right now. My palms are a little sweaty.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and describe the hostage situation.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) I'm in the hospital cafeteria. It's lunchtime, busy. I hear a loud crash, then screaming. A man with a gun bursts in, waving it around. People are diving under tables. I'm frozen, can't move. My heart's racing...",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to a 6. I can feel my chest tightening.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: The gunman is yelling, demanding drugs. He grabs a nurse, pointing the gun at her head. I'm shaking, can barely breathe. The security guard tries to approach, but the gunman shoots him in the leg. There's blood... so much blood...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) It's an 8 now. I feel like I'm back there. My hands are clammy, and I'm feeling dizzy.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Breathing heavily) The police arrive. There's chaos, people crying. The gunman is getting more agitated. He's threatening to kill hostages. I'm terrified he'll shoot me next. I can smell the gunpowder, hear the whimpers...",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: (Choked up) It's... it's a 9. I feel like I can't breathe. My chest hurts.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here with me.",
    "Client: (Sobbing) The police start negotiating. It feels like hours. My legs are numb from crouching. The gunman is pacing, screaming. Suddenly, there's a loud bang. The SWAT team rushes in. There's smoke, shouting... I think I screamed...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: (Gasping) It's still... still a 9. I can feel my heart pounding.",
    "Therapist: You're safe. The memory can't hurt you.",
    "Client: (Breathing slows) The smoke clears. The gunman is down. Paramedics rush in. I'm in shock, can't move. Someone helps me up, leads me outside. The sunlight hurts my eyes. I'm shaking uncontrollably...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... coming down. Maybe a 7 now. I feel drained.",
    "Therapist: You did wonderfully. How do you feel?",
    "Client: Exhausted. But... also a bit relieved? Like I faced something I've been avoiding.",
    "Therapist: That's common. Let's end here today."
