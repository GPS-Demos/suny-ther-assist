    "Therapist: Okay, Priya. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important for my recovery.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day in the hospital.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Alright. I'm... I'm in the emergency room. The lights are so bright, and there's this constant beeping from machines. I can smell disinfectant, and it's making me feel nauseous. My chest feels tight, like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 6. It's uncomfortable, but manageable.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The doctor comes in, and his face is so serious. He's holding my test results, and I can tell something's wrong. My heart starts racing, and I feel dizzy. He tells me... he tells me I have a tumor, and it's aggressive. I feel like the room is spinning, and I can't process what he's saying. It's like I'm watching myself from outside my body.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to an 8. I can feel my palms sweating, and my mouth is dry.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I start crying uncontrollably. The doctor is still talking, but I can't hear him over the sound of my own sobbing. I'm thinking about my family, my studies... everything I might lose. I feel so alone and scared. My body feels heavy, like I can't move.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's a 9 now. I feel overwhelmed, just like I did that day.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Priya. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: (Voice shaking) I... I remember calling my husband. My hands were shaking so much I could barely hold the phone. When I told him, there was this long silence. I thought the call had dropped, but then I heard him crying. That's when it really hit me - this was real, and it was happening to me.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's still at a 9. My chest feels so tight, like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here, Priya.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) I remember leaving the hospital in a daze. The world seemed surreal, like a bad dream. I kept hoping I'd wake up and it would all be over. But the pain in my body reminded me it was real. I felt so betrayed by my own body.",
    "Therapist: How about now? Your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe an 8 now. I still feel shaky, but talking about it is helping somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Keep going.",
    "Client: The next few days were a blur of more tests and appointments. I felt like I was drowning in medical jargon and decisions I wasn't prepared to make. The worst part was telling my parents. Seeing the fear in their eyes... it broke something inside me. I started drinking more to numb the pain and fear.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's back up to a 9. Remembering how I turned to alcohol... it makes me feel ashamed and scared.",
    "Therapist: It's okay, Priya. You're working through it now.",
    "Client: (Sighs) You're right. I am. It's just... it's still so hard to face. But I'm here, and I'm trying. That has to count for something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My SUDS is down to a 7. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I faced the memory and survived.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent, Priya. You did very well today."
