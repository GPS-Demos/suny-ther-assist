    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is buzzing, you know? My hands are shaky, and there's this tightness in my chest. The memories... they felt so real. I could smell the gunpowder, hear the explosions. It's like I was right back there in the war zone.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... anger? Yeah, anger. I'm angry that I still feel this way after all these years. And there's guilt too. So much guilt.",
    "Therapist: Can you tell me more about that guilt?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming sometimes. I keep thinking about the people we couldn't save, the decisions I had to make. And then I come home, and I'm supposed to just... what? Go back to normal? Be a good partner? But I'm not the same person anymore. I feel like I'm constantly on edge, waiting for something terrible to happen.",
    "Therapist: How does this relate to your experiences with domestic violence?",
    "Client: God, it's... it's all connected, isn't it? The hypervigilance from the war, it followed me home. I started seeing threats everywhere, even in my own house. I'd lash out at my partner, not physically, but verbally. I was so scared all the time, and I didn't know how to handle it. It's like I brought the war home with me.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... maybe I don't deserve to feel better. Maybe this is my punishment for the things I've done. But then another part of me is screaming that it's not fair. I didn't ask for any of this. I just wanted to serve my country, you know? And now... now I feel like I'm at war with myself every single day.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you share these thoughts?",
    "Client: It's... it's weird. My shoulders are so tense they're almost up to my ears. But at the same time, there's this heaviness in my chest, like someone's sitting on it. And my stomach... it's in knots. It's like my body can't decide if it wants to fight or collapse.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Part of me wants to run away, to hide from all of these feelings. But another part... I think I need to feel understood. To know that I'm not alone in this. That maybe, just maybe, there's hope for me to feel okay again someday.",
    "Therapist: You're not alone. What you're feeling is a normal response to trauma.",
    "Client: Normal? It doesn't feel normal. It feels like I'm losing my mind sometimes. Like I'm two different people - the person I was before the war, and this... this shell of a person I am now. I look in the mirror and I barely recognize myself. How do I reconcile these two versions of me?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful question. How do you think you might start?",
    "Client: I... I guess by acknowledging that both versions are me? The person who went to war, and the person who came back... they're both part of my story. Maybe instead of trying to go back to who I was, I need to focus on who I can become now. Someone who's been through hell but is still standing. Someone who can use their experiences to help others, maybe?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive perspective. How does that idea make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's scary, but also kind of exciting? Like, for the first time in a long time, I can see a glimmer of hope. Maybe I'm not just damaged goods. Maybe all of this pain and struggle can mean something. I don't know if I'm ready to embrace that fully yet, but... it's something to hold onto, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a significant insight. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... lighter? Yeah, lighter. Like maybe I've been carrying this massive weight for so long, and I just put a tiny bit of it down. Don't get me wrong, I still feel pretty messed up. But there's this tiny voice in the back of my head saying \"maybe it'll be okay.\" And for once, I want to listen to it.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful shift. How might you carry this forward?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to start talking more. To my partner, to other vets, maybe even to my family. I've been so closed off, trying to protect everyone from the mess inside my head. But maybe by opening up, I can start to make sense of it all. And maybe... maybe I can start to forgive myself, little by little.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a meaningful goal. How do you feel about our session today?",
    "Client: Honestly? I'm exhausted. But it's a good kind of exhausted, you know? Like I've done something important. I feel... raw, but also more real than I have in a long time. Thank you for... for helping me face this. I know we have a long way to go, but for the first time in forever, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can do this.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength today. We'll continue this journey together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I appreciate that more than you know. It's not going to be easy, but I think I'm finally ready to really try. To face these memories and feelings head-on instead of running from them. It's terrifying, but also... liberating? Yeah, liberating. Like maybe I can finally start to take control of my life again, instead of letting the trauma control me.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's your next step?",
    "Client: I think... I think I want to talk to my partner tonight. Really talk, you know? Open up about some of what we discussed today. They've been so patient with me, and I've kept them at arm's length for so long. It's time I let them in, let them see the real me - scars and all. It's scary, but... I think it's necessary. For both of us.",
    "Therapist: That takes courage. How do you feel about ending our session?",
    "Client: I feel... ready. Ready to face the world outside this room. It's still intimidating, but I feel like I have some new tools now. Some new understanding of myself. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know we have more work to do, but for the first time in a long time, I'm actually looking forward to our next session. Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a positive sign. Take care, and we'll continue next time.",
    "Client: Thank you. Really, thank you. I'll see you next week."
