    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and recall the hostage situation. What's happening?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in the hospital waiting room. It's so quiet, but tense. There's a man with a gun, pacing. He's shouting about wanting to see a doctor. My heart's racing. I can smell the antiseptic, it's making me nauseous.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: It's about a 6. I'm feeling anxious, but I'm here with you.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: The man is getting more agitated. He's waving the gun around. I'm trying to make myself smaller in my chair. My hands are shaking. I can hear a child crying somewhere. It's making everything feel more real, more dangerous.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to an 8. I'm really starting to feel scared.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: A nurse tries to calm him down. He grabs her. I want to help, but I'm frozen. My mouth is dry. I can hear my pulse in my ears. The fluorescent lights seem so bright, almost painful.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm at a 9. It's really intense. I feel like I'm back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here with me. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. Security arrives. There's shouting. The man is distracted. Some people run. I want to, but my legs won't move. I'm sweating. My vision is blurry. I hear a loud bang. Was it a gunshot? I don't know. Everything's chaotic.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's still at 9. I feel so helpless, so scared.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're safe now. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: The security tackles him. The gun slides across the floor. I'm shaking uncontrollably. People are crying, hugging. I'm alone. I feel disconnected, like I'm watching a movie. My chest hurts. I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down. Maybe a 7? I'm starting to feel more present.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're processing this memory. How do you feel physically?",
    "Client: My shoulders are tense. I'm still shaky, but my breathing is slowing down. I feel drained, but also... relieved? Like I survived it again.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5. I'm feeling more grounded.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... okay. Like I faced something big. It's still scary, but maybe a little less overwhelming now.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've shown great courage. Let's end here and discuss coping strategies."
