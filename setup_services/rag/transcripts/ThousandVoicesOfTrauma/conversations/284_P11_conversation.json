    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Rashid?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's strange, you know? I've lived with this memory for so long, but going through it in such detail... it's different. My heart's still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you this time?",
    "Client: The sounds. I hadn't realized how vivid they were in my memory. The shattering glass, the heavy footsteps... It's like I was right back there in our living room, frozen in fear. I could almost smell the intruder's cologne, you know? It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit those sensations?",
    "Client: It was... intense. At first, I felt that same paralyzing fear. But then, as I continued, something shifted. I started feeling angry. Angry that this happened to us, that our sense of safety was stolen. And... and a bit proud, I suppose. We survived it. We're still here.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. How does this connect to your day-to-day life now?",
    "Client: Well, I've always been hyper-vigilant about home security. Triple-checking locks, installing cameras... But going through this memory, I realized how much energy I've been putting into preventing something that's already happened. It's... it's exhausting, really.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts do you have about that realization?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to find a balance. Safety is important, but I've been letting fear control too much of my life. My wife, she's been saying this for years, but I couldn't hear it. Now, I think I understand what she means.",
    "Therapist: That's a valuable insight. How might you apply this moving forward?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to start trusting more. In our security measures, in the likelihood that we're safe. Maybe... maybe I could try not checking the locks more than once before bed. It sounds small, but it feels like a mountain right now.",
    "Therapist: Small steps can lead to big changes. How do you feel about trying that?",
    "Client: Nervous, definitely. But also... hopeful? Like maybe I can reclaim some peace in my own home. It's been so long since I've felt truly relaxed there.",
    "Therapist: That hope is important. What else came up for you during the exposure?",
    "Client: I... I realized how much I've been carrying this alone. My wife was there too, but we've never really talked about it. I've always tried to be strong, to protect her. But maybe... maybe sharing this burden could help us both heal.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How might opening up change things?",
    "Client: I think... I think it could bring us closer. We've drifted a bit, always tiptoeing around this elephant in the room. Talking about it might be painful, but it could also be freeing. Like we're finally facing this thing together.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive step. How do you feel about your progress today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm surprised, actually. I was dreading this session, but I feel like I've uncovered some important things. It's still hard, and I know we have more work to do, but... I feel a glimmer of hope. Like maybe I won't always be a prisoner to this memory.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. What would you like to focus on before our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to try that thing with the locks. And maybe... maybe have a conversation with my wife about the home invasion. Not all at once, but... start opening that door a little.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like thoughtful goals. How can I support you in this?",
    "Client: Could we... could we maybe role-play how I might start that conversation with my wife? I'm nervous about bringing it up after all this time.",
    "Therapist: Certainly. Let's work on that now. Would you like to start?",
    "Client: Okay, um... \"Amira, there's something I've been wanting to talk to you about for a long time...\" No, that sounds too serious. Maybe, \"Hey, remember that therapy I've been doing? It's bringing up some stuff about the break-in...\" Is that better?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good start. How does it feel saying it out loud?",
    "Client: It's... it's scary, but also a relief. Like I'm finally letting go of a breath I've been holding for years. I think... I think I can do this.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Shall we practice a bit more?"
