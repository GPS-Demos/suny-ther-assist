    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your current SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10. My heart's beating a little faster than usual.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and begin describing the event.",
    "Client: Alright... I was hiking in the nearby nature reserve. It was a beautiful day, sunny and warm. I remember feeling so peaceful... Then I heard a growl. I turned and saw a large dog, unleashed, baring its teeth at me. My heart started racing...",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's increased to a 6. My palms are getting sweaty as I recall the dog's aggressive stance.",
    "Therapist: Keep going. You're doing well.",
    "Client: The dog lunged at me suddenly. I tried to back away, but I tripped over a root. I fell hard on my back, and the dog was on top of me in seconds. Its jaws clamped down on my arm, and I screamed in pain. I could feel its teeth tearing into my skin...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. My arm is actually throbbing right now, like I can feel the bite again. My breathing is getting faster.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: I was thrashing around, trying to push the dog off me. I could hear people shouting in the distance, but it felt like an eternity before anyone reached me. The dog kept shaking its head, making the pain worse. I remember thinking I might die there...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's still an 8. My heart is pounding so hard. I feel... I feel like I'm back there.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: Finally, someone pulled the dog off me. I saw blood everywhere - on my arm, on my clothes, on the ground. I was sobbing uncontrollably. A stranger was pressing something against my wound, telling me help was coming. But all I could focus on was the pain and the fear that the dog might attack again...",
    "Therapist: How about your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down a bit. Maybe a 7? I'm starting to feel a little calmer, remembering that I survived it.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue with what happened next.",
    "Client: The ambulance arrived. The paramedics were so kind, trying to distract me as they cleaned and bandaged my arm. I remember feeling embarrassed about crying in front of everyone. They kept asking if I had any other injuries, but I was in shock and couldn't really process what they were saying...",
    "Therapist: And your current SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5 now. Talking about the aftermath is easier than the attack itself.",
    "Therapist: That's common. Keep going.",

    "Client: It's a 4. I'm feeling more distant from the memory now, like I'm observing it rather than reliving it.",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. How do you feel about the exercise overall?",
    "Client: It was intense, but... I feel like I handled it better than I expected. It's strange how the fear ebbed and flowed throughout the retelling.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal experience. Well done for today."
