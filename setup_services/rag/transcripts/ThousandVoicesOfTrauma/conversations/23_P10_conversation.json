    "Therapist: Welcome, Priya. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a part of me that wants to get this over with, but another part that's terrified of going back there. My hands are a bit shaky.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in our living room. It's late afternoon, and the sunlight is streaming through the curtains. I can smell the jasmine incense my mother always burns. I'm sitting on the floor, playing with my dolls, when I hear the front door slam.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: My father storms in. He's... he's drunk again. I can smell the alcohol on him from across the room. His face is red, and he's mumbling under his breath. My mother comes out of the kitchen, wiping her hands on her apron. She looks... scared.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, Priya?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I feel small and helpless, just like I did then.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 60?",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're doing well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: My father... he starts yelling at my mother. Something about dinner not being ready. His words are slurred, but his anger is clear. I'm frozen, clutching my doll tightly. My mother tries to calm him down, speaking softly, but that only seems to make him angrier.",
    "Therapist: What do you see and hear?",
    "Client: I see my father's face contort with rage. He... he raises his hand and... *voice breaks* ...he slaps my mother hard across the face. The sound echoes through the room. I hear my mother cry out in pain, and I flinch.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it, Priya. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I want to run, to hide, but I can't move. My father grabs my mother's arm, twisting it. She's begging him to stop, tears streaming down her face. I'm shaking, tears in my eyes too. I want to help her, but I'm so scared.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's higher. Maybe 80?",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. Remember, you're here in the present, observing the past.",
    "Client: *takes a shaky breath* Okay... My father pushes my mother, and she stumbles, hitting her head on the edge of the coffee table. There's a sickening thud, and she crumples to the floor. I hear myself scream, but it sounds far away, like it's not really me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Priya. Keep going.",
    "Client: My father turns to me, his eyes wild. He yells at me to shut up, that this is all my fault. I'm sobbing now, scrambling backward until my back hits the wall. My mother is groaning on the floor, a small trickle of blood running down her forehead.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. I can hardly breathe. My hands are clenched so hard they hurt.",
    "Therapist: Remember to stay present. What happens next in the memory?",
    "Client: My father stumbles towards my mother. For a moment, I think he's going to help her up, but instead, he kicks her in the stomach. She cries out in pain, and I feel like I'm going to be sick. I want to run to her, to protect her, but I'm paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Priya. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's really high. Maybe 90?",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe with me. In... and out. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *breathes deeply* Okay... I'm watching as my father continues to yell and kick my mother. She's curled up in a ball, trying to protect herself. I can hear her whimpering, begging him to stop. The room feels like it's spinning. I can smell the metallic scent of blood mixing with the jasmine incense.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I finally find my voice. I scream at my father to stop, to leave her alone. He turns to me, his eyes unfocused and full of rage. For a terrifying moment, I think he's going to come after me next. But then... then he just storms out of the house, slamming the door behind him.",
    "Therapist: And then?",
    "Client: The silence afterward is deafening. I can hear my own heart pounding in my ears. Slowly, I crawl over to my mother. She's still curled up, shaking and crying softly. I touch her shoulder, and she flinches. When she looks up at me, her face is bruised and bloody. I've never felt so helpless in my life.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, Priya?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel sick to my stomach. My chest hurts. I'm angry and scared and... and so sad.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: Still... still around 90.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you survived this. You're safe now.",
    "Client: *takes a shaky breath* I help my mother sit up. She winces in pain with every movement. I run to get a wet cloth to clean her face. As I'm dabbing at the cut on her forehead, she looks at me with such sorrow in her eyes. She whispers, \"I'm sorry, beta. I'm so sorry.\" And I... I just break down crying. We hold each other, both of us shaking and sobbing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Priya. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: I can hear the neighbors' TV through the walls, the sound of normal life continuing while our world has shattered. My mother strokes my hair, trying to comfort me even though she's the one who's hurt. I feel so angry at my father, at the world, at myself for not being able to stop it.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: We... we stay like that for a long time. Eventually, my mother gets up, wincing in pain. She goes to the bathroom to clean up properly. I follow her, afraid to let her out of my sight. As she looks in the mirror, assessing the damage, I see a change come over her face. She looks... determined. She turns to me and says, \"We can't live like this anymore, beta. We have to leave.\"",
    "Therapist: How do you feel hearing those words?",
    "Client: I feel... relieved, but also terrified. The idea of leaving is both exciting and scary. I nod, unable to speak. My mother hugs me tightly, and for the first time that day, I feel a glimmer of hope.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well, Priya. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. My heart is still racing, but I feel... I don't know, maybe a little lighter?",
    "Therapist: And your distress level?",
    "Client: It's come down a bit. Maybe 70 now?",
    "Therapist: That's good. Let's take a few deep breaths together. You're safe here in the present.",
    "Client: *takes several deep breaths* Thank you. I... I've never talked about that day in so much detail before.",
    "Therapist: You showed incredible strength today, Priya. How do you feel about the experience you just shared?",
    "Client: It was... intense. Painful. But also... I don't know, maybe a little empowering? Like, I survived that. We survived that.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves back in the present.",
    "Client: Okay. *takes another deep breath* I can feel the chair beneath me, the coolness of the air conditioning. I'm here, now. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. You've done remarkable work today, Priya. How are you feeling as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm drained, but... I think I feel a bit stronger. Like I've faced something I've been running from for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. Remember, you're not alone in this journey. We'll continue to work through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I'm ready to go home now. Maybe take a long bath and just... process everything.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Take care of yourself, and we'll talk more in our next session.",
    "Client: Thank you. I will."
