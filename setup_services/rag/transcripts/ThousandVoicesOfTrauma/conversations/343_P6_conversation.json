    "Therapist: Alright, Maria. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your current SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and recall the memory we discussed.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) I'm at my friend's house. We're having coffee in her kitchen. It's a sunny afternoon. Suddenly, we hear shouting from next door. It's getting louder...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: The shouting turns into screaming. I hear a loud crash, like something breaking. My friend looks scared. We both freeze, not knowing what to do. Then we hear a woman crying...",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 6. My heart is beating faster.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Keep going.",
    "Client: We decide to check what's happening. As we approach the window, we see the neighbor's wife stumbling out of their house. She's holding her face, and there's blood... (voice trembles)",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel helpless, scared. My stomach is in knots. We should have called the police immediately, but we just stood there, watching...",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's an 8 now. This is hard...",
    "Therapist: I know. You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The husband comes out, yelling at her. He's so angry... I've never seen someone look like that. He grabs her arm, and she screams. I want to do something, but I'm paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens in your body?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking. I feel cold all over. I can barely breathe. It's like I'm there again...",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. (voice breaks) I can't...",
    "Therapist: You can. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) Okay... The neighbor sees us watching. He glares at us, and I feel this intense dread. He drags his wife back inside. We hear more yelling, more crashes. My friend is crying next to me, and I'm just... frozen.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking?",
    "Client: That I should do something, call someone. But I'm terrified he'll come after us if we interfere. I feel so ashamed...",
    "Therapist: SUDS now?",
    "Client: Still a 9. My chest feels tight. I can hardly breathe...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: We finally call the police. It feels like forever before they arrive. When they do, everything gets quiet. Too quiet. They go inside, and... and...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're safe here.",
    "Client: They bring him out in handcuffs. His wife comes out later, her face swollen. She looks at us, and I feel this overwhelming guilt. Why didn't we act sooner?",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's going down a bit. Maybe a 7? I feel drained.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You did well. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Sad. But also... a little relieved? Like I've let something out.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay. I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. You did great, Maria."
