    "Therapist: Good morning, Mrs. Patel. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: Good morning, Dr. Chen. To be honest, I'm feeling a bit... uneasy. It's not easy to revisit that night, you know? But I understand why we're doing this, so I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your willingness. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm ready. Where should I start?",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes and take us to that evening. What do you see?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in my living room. It's about 9 PM, and I'm watching the news. My husband, Raj, is upstairs in his study. The house is quiet, just the low murmur of the TV. I'm... I'm feeling relaxed, sinking into our old leather sofa. The lamp next to me casts a warm glow...",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear a noise. At first, I think it's just Raj coming downstairs, but then... there's a loud crash from the kitchen. My heart starts racing. I... I stand up, my legs feeling shaky. \"Raj?\" I call out, but there's no answer. I'm scared, but I need to know what's happening.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um... about a 6, I'd say. My palms are getting sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Alright. I... I start walking towards the kitchen. The house feels so big suddenly, every shadow seems threatening. I can hear my own heartbeat in my ears. As I get closer, I hear hushed voices. Men's voices. Strangers. Oh god, I remember feeling so terrified...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I freeze. For a second, I can't move. But then I think of Raj upstairs, unaware. I need to warn him. I turn to run up the stairs, but I'm shaking so much... I knock over a vase. The crash seems so loud in the quiet house.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. It's hard to breathe. I... I can feel the panic rising, just like that night.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Focus on your breathing. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: *breathing exercises* Okay... okay. I'm alright.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens after you knock over the vase?",
    "Client: Everything happens so fast. I hear shouts from the kitchen, footsteps rushing towards me. I run up the stairs, calling for Raj. \"Intruders! Call the police!\" I'm yelling. I can hear them behind me, their heavy footsteps on the stairs. I make it to our bedroom, slamming the door shut. Raj is there, looking confused and scared.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about an 8. My heart is pounding just like it did that night.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. This is just a memory. Take another deep breath.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Thank you. I... I can continue.",
    "Therapist: Alright. What happens in the bedroom?",
    "Client: Raj rushes to lock the door. We can hear the men outside, shouting at us to open up. Raj is on the phone with the police, speaking quickly. I'm... I'm huddled in the corner, shaking. The men are pounding on the door now. Each thud makes me flinch. I'm terrified they'll break through...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking this can't be real. This doesn't happen to people like us. I'm scared for our lives, for what they might do if they get in. I feel so helpless, so vulnerable. All I can do is pray the police arrive in time.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How long does this go on?",
    "Client: It feels like forever, but I think it was only about 10 minutes. Suddenly, we hear sirens in the distance. The pounding on the door stops. There's shouting, running footsteps down the stairs. I... I start crying with relief. Raj comes over and holds me, but I can feel him shaking too.",
    "Therapist: What happens when the police arrive?",
    "Client: We hear them enter downstairs. There are shouts, more running. An officer calls up to us, telling us it's safe to come out. But... but I can't move. I'm frozen in place, still terrified. Raj has to coax me to stand up, to open the door. When we finally do, I see police everywhere. Our home... it's a mess. Drawers pulled out, things scattered everywhere. I feel... violated. Like our safe space has been destroyed.",
    "Therapist: That must have been overwhelming. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaken. My hands are trembling. But... I also feel a strange sense of relief. Like I've faced it again and survived.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 6 now. Still anxious, but not as intense.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: Okay... *deep breath* I can feel the chair beneath me. I can hear the clock ticking. I'm here, in your office. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Can you tell me three things you see in the room?",
    "Client: I see... your degrees on the wall. The potted plant in the corner. And the blue pen on your notepad.",
    "Therapist: Very good. Now, let's reflect on what you've just shared.",
    "Client: It's... it's still hard to talk about. But I notice I was able to go through it without feeling completely overwhelmed this time. Is that... is that progress?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You showed great courage. How do you feel about your ability to cope?",
    "Client: I... I feel stronger than I expected. It's still scary, but I didn't completely fall apart. Maybe... maybe I'm more resilient than I thought.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. What else did you notice?",
    "Client: I noticed that even in my fear, I acted to protect Raj. I didn't just freeze completely. And... and we got through it together. Maybe that's something I can hold onto.",
    "Therapist: These are valuable insights. How might they change your perspective?",
    "Client: I think... I think it helps me see that while it was a terrible experience, it didn't break us. We survived, we're still here. Maybe I can focus more on that strength instead of just the fear.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful shift. How does it feel to look at it that way?",
    "Client: It feels... hopeful. Like maybe I don't have to be defined by that night. It's still part of me, but it doesn't have to control me.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent perspective. As we end this session, what's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: I'd say it's down to a 3. I feel... drained, but also a bit lighter. Like I've set down a heavy load I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: You've made significant progress today. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm nervous about diving in again, but I can see how it might help. If I could feel this way about that night all the time, instead of just the fear... I think it would make a big difference.",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal to work towards. We'll continue at your pace. For now, let's focus on self-care for the rest of the day.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Chen. This wasn't easy, but... I'm glad we did it. I feel like I understand myself a little better now.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today, Mrs. Patel. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later. We'll discuss this further in our next session.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again. I... I think I'm starting to see a way forward now.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful to hear. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
