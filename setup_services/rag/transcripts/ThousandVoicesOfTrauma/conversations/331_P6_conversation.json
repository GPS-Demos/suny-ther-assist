    "Therapist: Alright, Mr. Patel, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I understand this is part of the process.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the incident.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm at the grocery store. It's busy, lots of people around. I'm in the produce section, picking out some vegetables for dinner. Then I hear raised voices... a man is yelling at an elderly Asian woman. He's... he's saying terrible things, racist slurs. My heart starts racing. I feel frozen.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: It's about a 6... maybe 7. I can feel my palms getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: Keep going. You're doing well.",
    "Client: The man is getting more aggressive. He's in her face, screaming. She looks so scared, hunched over her cart. I want to help, but I'm... I'm terrified. What if he turns on me? I'm shaking. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. God, I feel so ashamed. I should have done something.",
    "Therapist: It's okay. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: People are staring, but no one's stepping in. I hear someone whisper, \"Someone should call security.\" But no one moves. The woman is crying now. I feel sick to my stomach. I... I turn away. I can't watch anymore. I abandon my cart and practically run out of the store.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's a 9. I'm... I'm having trouble breathing. My heart's pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (deep breath) I'm in my car now. I can't stop shaking. I feel like such a coward. I should have helped her. What if it had been my mother? Or my wife? I... I can't stop replaying it in my head.",
    "Therapist: How about your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's still high... maybe 8.5. I feel so angry at myself, and at that man. And scared. What if it happens again? What if next time, I'm the target?",
    "Therapist: These feelings are valid. Keep going.",
    "Client: I drive home, but I can't focus. I nearly miss a stop sign. At home, I don't tell my wife what happened. I feel... ashamed. Weak. I go to bed early, but I can't sleep. I keep seeing that woman's face, hearing those slurs. I feel... I feel helpless.",
    "Therapist: And your current SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe a 7 now. I'm feeling drained, but my heart isn't racing as much.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's start winding down. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Sad. But... also a bit relieved? Like... like I've finally told someone. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You've done great work today."
