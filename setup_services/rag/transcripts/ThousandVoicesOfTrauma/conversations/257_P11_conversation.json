    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all kind of jumbled up in my head right now. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved? It's weird.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The smell. I hadn't remembered that before, but it was so strong this time. Like, um, incense and sweat. It made me feel nauseous all over again. And the way he looked at me... God, I can still see his eyes.",
    "Therapist: How did revisiting those sensations affect you?",
    "Client: It was intense. My heart was racing, and I felt like I couldn't breathe for a moment. But then... I don't know, it's like I started to separate myself from it? Like I was watching it happen to someone else. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Many people experience that. How do you feel about it?",
    "Client: I guess it's a relief in a way. It's like... maybe I'm starting to process it? But then I feel guilty for feeling relieved. Like I'm betraying myself or something. Does that make any sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. Can you tell me more about that guilt?",
    "Client: It's just... for so long, this has been such a huge part of me. The pain, the fear, the anger. It's all I've known. And now that I'm starting to feel different, it's like... who am I without it? What if I forget what happened? What if I let them off the hook by moving on?",
    "Therapist: How does that connect to your recovery goals?",
    "Client: I... I guess I never thought about it that way. I want to be free from this, but I'm scared of what that freedom might mean. But maybe... maybe moving on doesn't mean forgetting. Maybe it means I get to choose how it affects me now?",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful perspective. How does it feel to consider that?",
    "Client: It's... liberating, I think. Scary, but also exciting. Like maybe I can take back some control. I've felt so powerless for so long, you know? But this... this feels like a step towards something better.",
    "Therapist: What might that \"something better\" look like?",
    "Client: I think... maybe being able to trust people again? Not flinching every time someone touches me. Being able to sleep through the night without nightmares. Just... living, I guess. Actually living instead of just surviving.",
    "Therapist: Those are powerful goals. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's hard. Really hard. But... I think I'm starting to see that it's worth it. I want that life we just talked about. I want to be able to look in the mirror and not see a victim. I want to be... me. Just me.",
    "Therapist: That's a brave commitment. What's one thing you can do this week to support that?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I could try writing about how I felt during today's session? Like, get it all out on paper. And maybe look at it again before our next session, see if anything's changed?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great idea. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired. Really tired. But also... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful? Like maybe I can actually do this. It's a weird feeling, but I think I like it.",
    "Therapist: It's a big step. How will you take care of yourself today?",
    "Client: I think I might call my sister. She's been really supportive, and I haven't talked to her in a while. Maybe we could watch a movie or something. Just... something normal, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Is there anything else you want to discuss?",
    "Client: No, I think... I think I'm good for now. This was a lot, but I feel okay. Better than I expected, actually. Thank you for... for helping me through this.",
    "Therapist: You did the hard work. I'll see you next week?",
    "Client: Yeah, I'll be here. Thanks again. See you then."
