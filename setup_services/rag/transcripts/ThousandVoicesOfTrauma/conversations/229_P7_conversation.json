    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Can you describe the natural disaster you experienced?",
    "Client: It was during the tsunami in 2004. I was visiting family in Thailand. We were at the beach when suddenly the water started receding. It was eerie, like nothing I'd ever seen before.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you saw.",
    "Client: People started pointing and shouting. Then we saw this massive wall of water coming towards us. It was terrifying. I froze for a moment, but then my survival instinct kicked in. I started running as fast as I could, away from the beach.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What were you feeling?",
    "Client: Pure panic. My heart was racing, and I could barely breathe. I kept thinking, \"This can't be real.\" The roar of the water was deafening. I saw people being swept away, and I felt so helpless.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I managed to grab onto a sturdy tree and held on for dear life. The water rushed past me, and I could feel the force trying to pull me away. I was certain I was going to die. The water was full of debris \u2013 cars, parts of buildings, and... and bodies.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: After what felt like an eternity, the water started to recede. I was covered in cuts and bruises, and my clothes were torn. I climbed down from the tree, and the devastation was... indescribable. It looked like a war zone.",
    "Therapist: How were you feeling at this point?",
    "Client: Numb. Shocked. I couldn't process what had just happened. I started wandering, looking for my family. The streets were unrecognizable. I saw injured people everywhere, crying out for help. The smell was... I'll never forget it.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. Take a deep breath if you need to.",
    "Client: I searched for hours. My phone wasn't working, and I had no idea if my family had survived. I kept thinking about the last time I saw them, wondering if that was it. The guilt was overwhelming \u2013 why did I survive when so many others didn't?",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those thoughts. Remember, you're not responsible for what happened.",
    "Client: Eventually, I made it to a makeshift rescue center. The relief when I saw my family there... I can't even describe it. We all broke down crying. But even in that moment of relief, I couldn't shake the images of what I'd seen. The destruction, the loss of life... it haunts me to this day.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength recounting this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. Talking about it brings everything back so vividly. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe release? Like I'm finally letting some of it out.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. You're doing well processing these memories.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still difficult to believe I went through that. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever truly feel safe again, especially near the ocean. But I'm trying to work through it, day by day.",
    "Therapist: Your resilience is admirable. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: Okay. [Deep breath] It helps to remind myself that I'm here, safe, and that it's in the past. But the memories are so vivid, especially the sounds and smells. It's like my brain won't let me forget.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience with trauma. You're handling it well.",
    "Client: I think what affects me most now is the unpredictability of life. One moment everything was normal, and the next... chaos. It's changed how I view the world, how I plan for the future. I'm always on edge, waiting for the next disaster.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. We'll work on managing those anxieties.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's been a long journey, and I know I still have a way to go. But being able to talk about it like this, it feels like a step forward. Even if it's painful, it's also... I don't know, empowering in a way?",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. Shall we conclude for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. Thank you for guiding me through this. It's never easy, but I feel like each time I talk about it, it becomes a little more manageable.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. We'll continue next session."
