    "Therapist: How are you feeling after going through that memory today?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving that earthquake, it just... it brings everything back so vividly. The shaking, the noise, the fear... it's like I'm right there again.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. There was this moment when I realized I couldn't do anything to stop what was happening. I remember looking at my coworkers, and we all had the same terrified expression. It's... it's hard to shake that feeling of complete powerlessness.",
    "Therapist: How does that connect to your day-to-day life now?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... I'm always on edge, you know? Like I'm waiting for the next disaster to strike. It's probably why I haven't been able to hold down a job. I'm constantly anticipating something terrible happening, and it's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: I see. What else did you notice during the exposure?",
    "Client: The guilt. God, the guilt is overwhelming. I made it out okay, but some of my coworkers didn't. I keep thinking, \"Why me? Why did I survive when others didn't?\" It's... it's eating me up inside.",
    "Therapist: That's a heavy burden. How do you cope with those feelings?",
    "Client: I don't, really. I try to avoid thinking about it, but it's always there, lurking in the background. I've been having nightmares, and sometimes during the day, I'll just... zone out, lost in those memories. My husband tries to understand, but... how can he? He wasn't there.",
    "Therapist: It sounds isolating. What support do you have?",
    "Client: Not much, if I'm being honest. My family tries, but they don't really get it. And the chronic pain doesn't help. It's like a constant reminder of that day. I feel like I'm trapped in my own body sometimes.",
    "Therapist: That's tough. What gives you hope?",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I have much hope right now. But... I guess the fact that I'm here, trying this therapy. That's something, right? I want to get better, for myself and for my family. I'm just... I'm so tired of feeling this way.",
    "Therapist: Your effort is commendable. What's one small step you can take?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I could try talking to my husband more about what I'm going through. He wants to help, I know he does. And possibly looking into some pain management techniques? I've been putting that off, but I know it could help.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like positive steps. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Drained, but... maybe a little lighter? Talking about it, even though it's hard, it feels like I'm not carrying it all alone anymore. It's still there, but... I don't know, maybe there's a glimmer of hope after all.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to work on managing my anxiety day-to-day. The constant fear of another disaster, it's... it's crippling. And maybe we could talk more about the guilt? I know it's not rational, but I can't seem to shake it.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a good plan. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I guess. For listening, for not judging. It's... it's not easy to talk about this stuff, but I think... I think it might be helping. Slowly, but... yeah. I'm glad I came today.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue working together. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yeah, I'll be here. Thanks again. It's... it's a long road, isn't it? But I'm trying to believe it's worth it. One day at a time, right?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. Take care, and remember to practice self-care.",
    "Client: I will. Or at least, I'll try. Baby steps, I guess. See you next week."
