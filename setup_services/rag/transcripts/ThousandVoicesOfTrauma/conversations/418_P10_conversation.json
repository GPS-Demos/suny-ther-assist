    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Patel. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit uneasy, to be honest. Talking about the dog attack still makes my heart race, even after all these years.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm ready. Where should I start?",
    "Therapist: Start from the beginning of the incident. Use present tense, as if it's happening now.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm walking down the street near my house. It's a warm day, and I can feel the sun on my skin. I'm thinking about the groceries I need to buy when I hear a loud bark. I turn and... oh god, there's this massive dog running towards me. Its teeth are bared, and it looks angry.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, about a 6... maybe 7.",
    "Therapist: Okay, keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: The dog is getting closer. I can hear its paws pounding on the pavement. I'm frozen in place, I can't move. My heart is pounding so hard I can hear it in my ears. The dog lunges at me, and I feel its teeth sink into my arm. The pain... it's excruciating.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I'm... I'm screaming. I can taste blood in my mouth from biting my lip. I'm trying to push the dog away, but it's so strong. Its claws are digging into my legs as it pulls me down. I fall onto the ground, and the impact knocks the wind out of me. The dog is on top of me now, still biting and growling. I can smell its hot breath... it smells like... like death.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you survived this. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm thrashing around, trying to get the dog off me. My clothes are torn, and I can feel blood trickling down my arm and leg. I'm crying and screaming for help, but the street seems empty. The dog's growling is so loud, it's all I can hear. I manage to grab a rock from the ground and... and I hit the dog with it. It yelps and backs off for a moment.",
    "Therapist: Good. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Terrified, but... also a little relieved that I fought back.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Continue with what happens next.",
    "Client: I try to get up, but my legs are shaking so badly. The dog is circling me, still growling. I'm holding the rock tightly, ready to defend myself again. My vision is blurry from tears and sweat. I can hear someone shouting in the distance, and the dog looks away for a moment. That's when I make a run for it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still at 8. My hands are shaking just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you... Okay, I'm running as fast as I can. My legs are burning, and I can hear the dog behind me. I'm gasping for air, and my lungs feel like they're on fire. I see my neighbor's house and start screaming for help. The dog is so close, I can feel its breath on my legs. Just as I reach the gate, I hear the dog yelp. My neighbor has come out with a broom and is swinging it at the dog.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Relieved, but still terrified. My SUDS is maybe a 7 now.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're making progress. What happens next?",
    "Client: I collapse on my neighbor's porch. I'm sobbing uncontrollably, and my whole body is shaking. My neighbor is calling for an ambulance, but her voice sounds far away. I look down at my arm and leg, and there's so much blood. I feel dizzy and nauseous. The adrenaline is wearing off, and the pain is becoming unbearable.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I'm trying... The ambulance arrives, and the paramedics are talking to me, but I can barely focus on what they're saying. They're cleaning my wounds, and it stings so badly. I keep looking around, afraid the dog will come back. As they lift me onto the stretcher, I see the dog's owner running towards us, looking panicked. I feel a surge of anger and fear.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 6. Talking about it is helping, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Continue with what happens in the ambulance.",
    "Client: In the ambulance, everything feels surreal. The sirens are so loud, and the lights are blinding. I'm still shaking, and I can't stop crying. The paramedic is asking me questions, but I'm having trouble focusing. My arm and leg are throbbing with pain. I keep replaying the attack in my mind, wondering if I could have done something differently.",
    "Therapist: It's common to have those thoughts. Remember, it wasn't your fault.",
    "Client: I know, but... it's hard not to think about it. In the hospital, everything is a blur of doctors, nurses, and tests. They're cleaning my wounds, and it hurts so much. I can hear them talking about possible infections and rabies shots. The reality of what happened is starting to sink in, and I feel overwhelmed and scared.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, reliving this memory?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. My heart is racing, but I also feel... I don't know, maybe a bit stronger? My SUDS is around 5 now.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Keep going.",
    "Client: The doctors are stitching up my wounds. The local anesthetic helps with the pain, but I can still feel the tugging and pressure. I'm exhausted, but I can't relax. Every time I close my eyes, I see the dog's face. The nurse is kind and tries to distract me with conversation, but I can barely engage. I just want to go home, but I'm also terrified of leaving the safety of the hospital.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. What happens next?",
    "Client: They keep me overnight for observation. The hospital room is dark and quiet, but I can't sleep. Every little noise makes me jump. I keep thinking I hear the dog's growl. When I do drift off, I have nightmares about the attack. I wake up in a cold sweat, my heart pounding. The night seems to last forever.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe now. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 4 now. Talking about it is helping, even though it's hard.",
    "Therapist: You're making great progress. Continue with what happens the next day.",
    "Client: The next morning, I'm discharged. My husband comes to pick me up, and I burst into tears when I see him. I feel so vulnerable and scared. The walk to the car is terrifying - every dog bark in the distance makes me flinch. At home, I can't relax. I keep checking the windows and doors, afraid the dog will somehow find me. The pain medication makes me groggy, but I'm too afraid to sleep.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, remembering these moments?",
    "Client: It's... it's not as overwhelming as before. My SUDS is maybe a 3 now. I remember feeling so helpless and afraid, but I also remember the support from my family and friends.",
    "Therapist: That's fantastic progress. Let's continue.",
    "Client: The days after the attack are a blur of doctor's appointments, dressing changes, and sleepless nights. I'm jumpy and irritable. My husband is supportive, but I can see the worry in his eyes. I can't bring myself to go for walks anymore, and I have panic attacks when I hear dogs barking in the neighborhood. I feel like my life has been completely upended.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. It's still hard to talk about, but I feel like I'm looking at it from a distance now. My SUDS is about a 2.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. Can you tell me about any positive changes or growth you experienced after this incident?",
    "Client: Well... it took time, but I eventually started therapy. That was a big step for me. I learned coping mechanisms for my anxiety and PTSD. I also became an advocate for responsible pet ownership in our community. In a way, the attack made me stronger and more resilient. I still get nervous around large dogs, but I've learned to manage my fear.",
    "Therapist: That's really inspiring. How do you feel now, having gone through this memory?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, I think. Like I've faced something I've been avoiding for a long time. My SUDS is down to a 1 now. It's still a difficult memory, but it doesn't have the same power over me that it used to.",
    "Therapist: You've done an amazing job today. How would you like to end our session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge how far I've come. From being terrified of leaving my house to being able to talk about the attack like this... it's a big change. I'm proud of myself.",
    "Therapist: You should be. You've shown incredible strength and resilience. Let's take a few deep breaths together to close out the session.",
    "Client: Thank you. This has been challenging, but also really helpful.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Remember to be kind to yourself for the rest of the day. We'll discuss this further in our next session."
