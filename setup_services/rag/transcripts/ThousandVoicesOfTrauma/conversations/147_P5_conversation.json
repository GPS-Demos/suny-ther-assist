    "Therapist: Good morning, Mr. Rodriguez. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Buenos d\u00edas, Doctor. I'm... well, I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. This whole therapy process is still new to me, and I'm not sure what to expect today.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We'll take it step by step.",
    "Client: Gracias. I appreciate your patience. It's not easy for a man my age to open up about these things, you know? Especially coming from my background. We don't usually talk about our feelings or... or the bad things that happened in our homes.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. Shall we discuss today's session?",
    "Client: S\u00ed, por favor. What exactly are we going to do? You mentioned something about... imaginal exposure, was it?",
    "Therapist: Correct. It's a technique to help process traumatic memories.",
    "Client: Process traumatic memories? That sounds... intense. Will it hurt? I mean, emotionally?",
    "Therapist: It may be challenging, but I'll guide you through it.",
    "Client: I see. And you think this will help with my... my anxiety? The nightmares I've been having about... about her and the things she used to say?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it's designed to reduce PTSD symptoms over time.",
    "Client: PTSD? I... I never thought of it that way. I always just assumed I was being weak, you know? That I should've been stronger, should've stood up to her more.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. This isn't about weakness.",
    "Client: That's... that's good to hear, Doctor. So, what exactly will I need to do during this... imaginal exposure?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount a traumatic memory in detail. I'll support you throughout.",
    "Client: Dios m\u00edo... That sounds terrifying. I've spent years trying to forget those memories. Are you sure this is necessary?",
    "Therapist: It's a crucial step in healing, but we'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: I understand. I trust you, Doctor. But... what if I can't handle it? What if I break down or... or have a panic attack?",
    "Therapist: We have coping strategies in place. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay, okay. I'll try my best. It's just... it's hard, you know? Thinking about those times, remembering her words, her anger... it makes me feel so small again.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are normal. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: Gracias, Doctor. I appreciate your support. I... I want to get better. For myself, and for my children. They worry about me, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful motivation. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. Yes, I'm ready. Just... please be patient with me if I struggle. This isn't easy for an old man like me.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great strength. Let's start slowly."
