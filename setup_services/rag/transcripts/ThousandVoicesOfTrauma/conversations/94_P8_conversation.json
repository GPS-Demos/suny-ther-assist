    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. My heart is still racing, and I feel a bit shaky. The memory of that accident, it just... it feels so vivid now, like I'm right back there again.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: Well, I can still hear the screeching of tires and the sound of metal crunching. It's making me feel... anxious, I suppose. My palms are sweaty, and I have this tightness in my chest. I keep thinking about how helpless I felt in that moment, trapped in the car, not knowing if help would come.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I'm surprised by how angry I feel. Not just about the accident itself, but about how the police handled it. They were so... dismissive. It's like they didn't believe me when I told them what happened. I remember one officer saying, \"Lady, are you sure you weren't just distracted?\" as if it was my fault. That really stung, you know? I've been driving for over 60 years without any issues, and suddenly I'm treated like I'm senile or incompetent.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a hot knot in my stomach. My jaw is clenched, and I notice I'm gripping the armrests of this chair pretty tightly. I just... I feel so disrespected. I've lived a long life, contributed to society, and in that moment, I felt like I was nothing. Just another old lady causing trouble.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why didn't they believe me?\" and \"Am I really too old to be trusted?\" It's making me doubt myself, which I hate. I've always been independent, you know? But now, every time I get behind the wheel, I hear that officer's voice in my head. It's... it's affecting my confidence, my sense of who I am.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your overall experience?",
    "Client: I suppose... well, it's made me feel vulnerable in a way I'm not used to. I've always been the one taking care of others, but now I feel like I need protection. And it's not just about driving. It's like... like I'm suddenly aware of how the world sees older people. We're often invisible or seen as a burden. This experience just brought all of that into sharp focus.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I... I'm realizing how much this has affected my relationship with my husband. He's been so supportive, but I can see the worry in his eyes every time I leave the house. It's changing our dynamic, and that scares me. We've been equals for so long, and now... now I feel like he sees me as someone who needs looking after.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... it's uncomfortable. Part of me wants to push back against it, to prove that I'm still capable. But another part... another part is tired. Tired of fighting, tired of trying to prove myself. I'm wondering if maybe it's time to accept that I'm getting older, that I might need help sometimes. But that feels like giving up, you know?",
    "Therapist: I hear you. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to feel heard. To know that my experience matters, that what happened to me wasn't okay. And maybe... maybe I need to find a way to reconcile the strong, independent woman I've always been with this new reality I'm facing. It's not easy, but... but I want to try.",
    "Therapist: That's very insightful. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm actually feeling a bit lighter. Still shaky, still angry, but... but also like I understand myself a bit better. It's strange, isn't it? How talking about something so difficult can actually make you feel... I don't know, more whole somehow?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful observation. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I think... I think I want to work on rebuilding my confidence. Maybe find ways to feel empowered again, even if things are different now. And... and I want to talk to my husband. Really talk to him about how all of this is affecting me, affecting us. It's scary, but... but I think it's necessary.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive step. How can we support that?",
    "Client: Well, maybe we could... could we work on some strategies for those conversations? And perhaps... perhaps we could explore ways for me to advocate for myself better, especially in situations where I feel dismissed or invisible. I don't want to let one bad experience with the police define how I interact with authority figures going forward.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll focus on that next time. How are you feeling about ending here?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay with that. It's been intense, but good. Thank you for listening, for helping me make sense of all this. I feel... I feel like I'm starting to see a way forward, even if it's still a bit foggy.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Take care."
