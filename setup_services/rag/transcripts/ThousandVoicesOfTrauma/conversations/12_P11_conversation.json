    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Jake?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. It's a lot to process. Going through that memory of my sister's death again, it's like... it's like reopening a wound, you know? I can still see her face so clearly, and it just... it hurts.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The silence. It's weird, but what I remember most is the silence in the hospital room after... after she was gone. It was so loud, if that makes sense. And then there's this guilt, like maybe if I had visited her more often, things would have been different.",
    "Therapist: How did reliving that moment feel today?",
    "Client: It was intense. My heart was racing, and I felt this tightness in my chest. But... it's strange. It wasn't as overwhelming as I thought it would be. Like, I could breathe through it this time.",
    "Therapist: That's progress, Jake. How does this connect to your current struggles?",
    "Client: I guess... I've been avoiding anything that reminds me of her. Social media, especially. It's where I see all these memories pop up, and then there's the cyberbullying stuff... It's like I can't escape the pain, so I just shut down.",
    "Therapist: What insights have you gained from this experience?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I don't need to run from the memories. They're painful, yeah, but they're also a part of me. And dealing with them head-on, it's tough, but it feels... I don't know, necessary? Like I'm finally facing something I've been avoiding for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How might this affect your daily life?",
    "Client: I think... I might try looking at some old photos of us. Just a few at first. And maybe I'll stop muting all those Facebook memories. It's scary, but if I can handle reliving her death here, maybe I can handle seeing her smile on my phone, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a brave step. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's daunting, for sure. But I also feel... hopeful? Like, for the first time in a while, I can see a path forward. It's not going to be easy, but I think I'm ready to keep going. I want to be able to remember her without falling apart.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable, Jake. What's one thing you'll take away from today?",
    "Client: I think... it's okay to feel the pain. It doesn't mean I'm weak or failing. It's part of healing, right? And maybe, just maybe, by facing it, I can start to move forward without leaving her behind. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How will you care for yourself after this session?",
    "Client: I think I'll go for a walk in the park. It's where we used to hang out, and I've been avoiding it. But today, I feel like I can handle it. Maybe even enjoy the memories it brings up. And if it gets too much, I'll use those breathing exercises we practiced.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great plan. Anything else you want to discuss?",
    "Client: No, I think... I think I'm good for now. This was tough, but I feel... lighter? Like I've taken a step in the right direction. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know we have more work to do, but I'm starting to believe I can get through this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work, Jake. I'll see you next week?",
    "Client: Yeah, definitely. I'll be here. Thanks again, doc. This... it means a lot."
