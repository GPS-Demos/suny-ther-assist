    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart is still racing, and I feel... shaky. That memory of the dog attack, it's so vivid. I can still hear the growling, feel the pain... (deep breath) It's like I'm right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: Fear. Intense fear. I keep seeing those teeth, feeling so helpless. I was just walking home from the grocery store, you know? And then suddenly... (voice trembles) I couldn't do anything. I couldn't protect myself. I feel so weak, so... vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: It sounds incredibly frightening. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: My hands are clammy, and there's this tightness in my chest. I feel... ashamed, I guess. I'm a grown woman, and here I am, terrified of a memory. It's silly, isn't it? But I can't seem to shake it off.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. How do these sensations compare to when it first happened?",
    "Client: They're... less intense now, I suppose. Back then, I couldn't even leave the house for weeks. I was constantly on edge, jumping at every little noise. Now, it's more... contained? But it's still there, lurking. I hate feeling this way.",
    "Therapist: I hear your frustration. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... why me? Why did this have to happen to me? And then I feel guilty for thinking that because, well, why not me? It could happen to anyone. But then I wonder if I could have done something differently. Maybe if I had been more aware of my surroundings, or if I had... I don't know, fought back harder? (sighs) It's all so confusing.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to process. How do these thoughts affect you?",
    "Client: They make me feel... stuck. Like I'm trapped in this cycle of fear and self-doubt. I want to move on, to feel normal again, but these thoughts keep pulling me back. And it's not just about dogs anymore. I feel anxious in so many situations now, always waiting for something bad to happen.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does this connect to other experiences in your life?",
    "Client: Well... (long pause) I guess it reminds me of how I felt after my husband passed away. That same sense of helplessness, of the world being unpredictable and dangerous. It's like... life keeps throwing these curveballs at me, and I don't know how to handle them anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful connection. What else comes to mind?",
    "Client: I think about my childhood, too. My parents were... well, they weren't very attentive. I often felt alone, like I had to fend for myself. This attack, it's brought all those feelings back. Like I'm that scared little girl again, with no one to protect me.",
    "Therapist: How does recognizing these connections make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... eye-opening, I suppose. And a bit sad. I never realized how much that neglect affected me. But it also makes me angry. I've spent so much of my life feeling afraid and alone. I don't want to feel that way anymore. I want to feel strong, to feel... safe.",
    "Therapist: That desire for change is important. What do you think could help you feel safer?",
    "Client: I'm not entirely sure. Maybe... learning some self-defense techniques? Or finding ways to feel more in control of my surroundings. And... (hesitates) maybe talking more about my childhood? I've always avoided that, but now I'm wondering if it might help.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like thoughtful ideas. How are you feeling now compared to when we started?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, honestly. But also a bit lighter? Like I've unpacked some heavy baggage I've been carrying around. There's still fear there, but it doesn't feel quite as overwhelming. And I think... I think I feel a glimmer of hope. That maybe, just maybe, I can work through this.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant shift. What do you want to remember from today's session?",
    "Client: I want to remember that I'm not alone in this. That these feelings, as intense as they are, are normal responses to trauma. And that there's hope for healing. It won't be easy, but... I think I'm ready to face this head-on.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing so openly. How would you like to close our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to take a few deep breaths. To ground myself before I leave. And maybe... could you remind me of that grounding technique we talked about last time? I think it might be helpful to practice that this week.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's do that together now."
