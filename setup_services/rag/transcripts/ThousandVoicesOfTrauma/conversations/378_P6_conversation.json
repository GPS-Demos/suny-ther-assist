    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important. Let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day of the hostage situation. Describe what you see and feel.",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in the bank. It's busy, people are queuing. Suddenly, there's shouting. Two men with masks burst in, waving guns. My heart starts racing. I can feel sweat on my palms. Everyone's screaming and ducking down. I'm frozen, can't move.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably a 6. It's intense, but I know I'm safe here.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: The men are yelling at everyone to get down. I slowly sink to the floor, my legs feel weak. I can smell the fear in the air, it's suffocating. One of the men grabs a woman near me, she's crying. I want to help her, but I'm paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to an 8. My heart's pounding just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: Time seems to stand still. I can hear sirens outside, getting louder. The robbers are getting agitated, pacing around. One of them keeps looking at me, and I'm terrified he'll grab me next. My mouth is dry, I can barely breathe.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here with me, safe.",
    "Client: (taking a deep breath) Okay. The police are outside now. I can hear them on a megaphone. The robbers are arguing, one wants to give up, the other doesn't. Suddenly, there's a loud bang - I think it's a flash grenade. Everything's chaotic. People are screaming, running. I'm being pushed and shoved. I fall and hit my head on something hard. Everything goes blurry...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: (voice shaking) It's... it's a 10. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here in my office.",
    "Client: (breathing deeply) Right, yes. I'm here. I'm safe. (pause) The next thing I remember is a police officer helping me up. My head hurts, I'm disoriented. People are crying, hugging each other. The robbers are being led away in handcuffs. I feel... numb. Like it's not real.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's come down to about a 7. I feel drained, but relieved it's over.",
    "Therapist: You did very well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Shaky. But... also kind of proud that I got through it.",
    "Therapist: That's completely understandable. Well done."
