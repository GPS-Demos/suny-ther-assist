    "Therapist: Alright, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Can you bring to mind the memory of the airplane crash and start describing it? Remember to give me your SUDS rating when I ask.",
    "Client: Okay, I'll try. I'm at the airport, waiting to board my flight. The atmosphere is busy, people rushing around. I can smell coffee and hear announcements over the speakers. My heart is already starting to race a bit...",
    "Therapist: How would you rate your SUDS right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 3 out of 10. I'm nervous, but it's manageable.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: We're boarding now. I'm walking down the jet bridge, and my palms are getting sweaty. I'm gripping my carry-on tightly. As I step onto the plane, the confined space hits me. It's like the walls are closing in...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's climbed to a 5. My chest feels tight, and I'm starting to breathe faster.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Keep going, you're doing well.",
    "Client: I find my seat and sit down. The plane starts to fill up. I'm trying to distract myself by looking out the window, but I can't shake this feeling of dread. We start taxiing, and I'm gripping the armrests. My whole body is tense...",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's a 7 now. I feel like I might be sick. My stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) We're taking off now. The engines are roaring, and we're climbing. Suddenly, there's a loud bang, and the plane shudders. People are screaming. I can't breathe. The oxygen masks drop down...",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I'm reliving it all over again. My heart is pounding so hard...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it.",
    "Client: The plane is nosediving. I can see the ground coming up fast through the window. I'm frozen in terror. I can't even scream. The impact is coming, and I...",
    "Therapist: SUDS level now?",
    "Client: (Voice shaking) It's a 10. I feel like I'm there again. I can't... I can't do this...",
    "Therapist: You can. You're safe here. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: (Taking deep breaths) Okay... okay. The crash didn't happen. We made an emergency landing. But I was sure we were going to die. I've never been so scared in my life.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's coming down... maybe an 8? My heart is still racing, but I know I'm here with you.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're doing really well. Keep describing.",

    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6 now. I'm starting to feel a bit calmer, but I'm exhausted.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're processing the memory.",
    "Client: As we're evacuating, I see the damage to the engine. It hits me how close we came to disaster. I'm overwhelmed with relief, but also this intense anxiety...",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's a 5 now. I'm feeling drained, but the panic is subsiding.",
    "Therapist: You've done an excellent job. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Honestly? Wrung out. But also... maybe a little proud? I got through it without completely falling apart.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant achievement. Well done."
