    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's like I'm back there, you know? Reliving those moments when I'd open my computer and see all those hateful messages. My heart's racing a bit, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's like a weight pressing down on me.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. Like, no matter what I did, the cyberbullying just wouldn't stop. There's this voice in my head saying, \"You should have been stronger. You should have handled it better.\" But then another part of me is angry, you know? Angry that I had to go through that in the first place. It's... it's a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does your body feel as you're experiencing these thoughts?",
    "Client: My shoulders are tense, and I've got this knot in my stomach. It's like my body's bracing for another attack, even though I know I'm safe here. My hands are a bit clammy too. It's weird how vivid these physical sensations are, even though the actual events happened years ago.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's shame. There's this overwhelming sense of shame that I let it affect me so much. I was a grown man, you know? I should have been able to brush it off, but instead, it consumed me. I stopped socializing, I dreaded going online for work, I... I even considered changing careers just to escape it all. And now, reliving it, I feel ashamed that I let it have so much power over me.",
    "Therapist: Hmm. How does acknowledging that shame feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a bit liberating, in a strange way. Like, by saying it out loud, it loses some of its power. But it's also painful. It makes me realize how much I've been carrying around all this time. I've never really talked about the shame before. I always focused on the anger or the fear, but the shame... that's been there all along, hasn't it?",
    "Therapist: Indeed. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm noticing that as we talk about it, the physical sensations are changing. The tightness in my chest is easing a bit. And I'm... I'm starting to feel a little sad. Not the overwhelming, paralyzing sadness I used to feel, but a gentler kind. Like I'm mourning for the person I was before all this happened. The person who trusted people online, who enjoyed social media. It's like I'm grieving for a part of myself that I lost.",
    "Therapist: How does that sadness compare to what you felt during the bullying?",
    "Client: It's different. Back then, the sadness was all-consuming. It was mixed with fear and anger and hopelessness. This sadness now feels... cleaner, if that makes sense? Like it's just sadness, without all the other emotions clouding it. And it feels... necessary, somehow. Like I need to feel this to move forward.",
    "Therapist: Mm. What do you make of that difference?",
    "Client: I think... I think it means I'm healing. Slowly, but surely. The fact that I can separate these emotions now, that I can talk about them without feeling overwhelmed... that's progress, right? It's like I'm finally starting to unpack this huge, messy emotional suitcase I've been lugging around for years.",
    "Therapist: Indeed. How does recognizing that progress feel?",
    "Client: It feels... good. Really good, actually. There's a spark of hope there that I haven't felt in a long time. Like maybe I can actually get past this, you know? Not just cope with it, but actually move beyond it. It's scary, but also exciting. I'm starting to see a future where this experience doesn't define me anymore.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you think about that future?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a mix of excitement and apprehension. There's a part of me that's eager to embrace that future, to reclaim the parts of myself that I lost. But there's also fear. What if I open myself up again and get hurt? What if I can't sustain this progress? It's like I'm standing on the edge of something new, and I want to step forward, but I'm also terrified of falling.",
    "Therapist: How might you support yourself in taking that step?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to be kinder to myself. To acknowledge that it's okay to be scared, but not let that fear hold me back. Maybe I can start small, you know? Like, engaging in online communities that feel safe, or sharing my experience with others who've been through similar things. And I think I need to keep reminding myself of how far I've come. To use sessions like this as proof that I'm stronger than I sometimes give myself credit for.",
    "Therapist: That sounds thoughtful. How are you feeling now, compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter. Like I've set down a heavy backpack I've been carrying for miles. I'm tired, but it's a good kind of tired. Like I've done important work. And I feel more... I don't know, more whole? Like I've reconnected with parts of myself that I'd shut away. It's not all sunshine and roses - there's still a lot to work through. But for the first time in a long while, I feel like I'm on the right path.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think that would be good. This has been intense, but in a productive way. I feel like I've made some real breakthroughs today. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know we still have a long way to go, but I'm feeling more optimistic than I have in a long time.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Take care, and we'll continue next week."
