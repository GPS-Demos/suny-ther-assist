    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Johnson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. I know we've talked about doing this imaginal exposure thing, but now that we're here, I'm not sure I'm ready. My anxiety is acting up, and I can feel my heart racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: I understand. It's normal to feel anxious. Can you tell me more?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... I've spent so long trying to avoid thinking about what happened at work. The idea of purposely revisiting it feels overwhelming. I'm worried I might fall apart or have a panic attack. And... I'm not sure how this will help me in the long run. It seems counterintuitive to deliberately bring up those memories.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. Shall we discuss the purpose?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think that might help me feel a bit more at ease. I want to understand why we're doing this and how it's supposed to help me. Sometimes I feel like I'm making progress, but then something triggers me at work, and I'm right back where I started. It's frustrating, and I worry that focusing on the trauma might make things worse instead of better.",
    "Therapist: The goal is to process the memory safely, reducing its power over time.",
    "Client: I see. So, it's like facing my fears head-on instead of running from them? That makes sense, but it's still scary. How exactly will this work? Will I have to describe everything in detail? I'm worried about getting too emotional or not being able to handle it. And what if I can't remember everything clearly? Some parts of that day are a bit fuzzy in my mind.",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. You control how much detail to share.",
    "Client: That's a relief to hear. I appreciate that you're letting me have some control over the process. It's just... I've never really talked about this in detail before, not even with my husband. I'm worried about how I'll react. What if I start crying and can't stop? Or what if I freeze up and can't say anything at all? I don't want to disappoint you or waste our session time.",
    "Therapist: Your reactions are all valid. We'll manage them together.",
    "Client: Thank you, that's reassuring. I guess I'm also wondering about what happens after the session. Will I be okay to drive home? I'm concerned that I might be too upset or disoriented. And what about the days following? I have work and family responsibilities. I don't want this to disrupt my life or make my anxiety worse. How do other people usually cope after these sessions?",
    "Therapist: We'll debrief and ensure you're grounded before leaving. Follow-up support is available.",
    "Client: Okay, that's good to know. I appreciate your thoroughness in addressing my concerns. I'm still nervous, but I feel a bit more prepared now. I suppose one last thing I'm curious about is how long this process usually takes. Will we need to do this multiple times? And how will we know if it's working? I want to believe that this will help, but part of me is skeptical.",
    "Therapist: Progress varies. We'll monitor your symptoms and adjust as needed.",
    "Client: I understand. Thank you for being patient with all my questions. I know this isn't easy, but I'm willing to try. Your support means a lot to me. I've come this far in my recovery, and even though it's scary, I want to keep moving forward. Is there anything else I should know or prepare for before we start?",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Remember, we're in this together."
