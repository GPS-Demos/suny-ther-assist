    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart is still racing, and I feel this tightness in my chest. The memories, they were so vivid. I could almost smell the musty air of that place where they kept us.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Anger. Shame. It's like I'm that helpless child again, trapped in that dark room. I keep thinking about the other children, their faces... God, they were so young. We were all so young.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What physical sensations are you noticing?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking. I feel nauseous, and there's this... this heaviness in my stomach. It's like my body remembers even when I try to forget. I can feel the cold floor beneath my feet, just like back then.",
    "Therapist: How do these sensations relate to your memories?",
    "Client: They... they transport me back. It's like I'm there again, you know? The fear, the uncertainty. I remember feeling so small, so powerless. My body tenses up, preparing for... for whatever might happen next. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why me? Why us?\" And then I feel guilty for even asking that because... because so many others suffered too. I wonder what happened to the other kids. Did they make it out? Are they okay? And then there's this voice in my head saying I should have done more, should have been stronger.",
    "Therapist: How do those thoughts make you feel?",
    "Client: Angry. Sad. Frustrated. It's like a storm inside me. I want to scream, to fight back against those memories. But I also feel this deep sadness for that little boy I was, for all of us. And then there's this... this guilt. Like I don't deserve to be here, talking about it, when others might not have made it.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about how you're coping now?",
    "Client: I... I guess I'm doing better than I thought. I mean, I'm here, talking about it. That's something, right? A few years ago, I couldn't even think about it without having a panic attack. Now, it's still hard, but... I'm facing it. I'm not running away anymore.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually kind of empowering. Don't get me wrong, it's still terrifying to revisit those memories. But there's a part of me that feels... I don't know, stronger? Like I'm taking back some control. It's small, but it's there.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I... I feel a bit lighter. Like sharing this burden somehow makes it easier to carry. And there's this... this spark of hope. It's tiny, but it's there. Maybe... maybe I can get through this. Maybe I can have a life that isn't defined by what happened to me.",
    "Therapist: How does that hope feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's warm. Like a small flame in my chest. It's fragile, but it's there. My breathing feels a bit easier, and my shoulders aren't as tense. It's like... like maybe I can start to let go, just a little bit.",
    "Therapist: What does this experience mean for your journey?",
    "Client: I think... I think it means I'm stronger than I thought. That maybe, just maybe, I can face these memories and come out the other side. It's scary, and it hurts, but... but I'm doing it. I'm here, I'm talking about it. That has to count for something, right?",
    "Therapist: How might this strength impact your future?",
    "Client: I... I never really thought about the future before. It was always about surviving the present. But now... maybe I can start to plan. To dream, even. Maybe I can use this strength to help others who've been through similar experiences. I don't know. It's all still so uncertain, but... but there's a possibility there that wasn't before.",
    "Therapist: What support do you need moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to keep talking about it. To keep facing these memories, as hard as it is. And maybe... maybe to connect with others who've been through similar experiences. I've always felt so alone in this, you know? But I'm starting to realize that I don't have to be.",
    "Therapist: How can we build on this progress?",
    "Client: I... I want to keep doing these exercises. They're tough, but I can feel them making a difference. And maybe... maybe we could work on some strategies for when the memories hit me outside of our sessions? I want to feel more in control, more prepared.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm... I'm exhausted, to be honest. But it's a different kind of tired. Like I've done something important, you know? Thank you for... for guiding me through this. It means more than I can say.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Take care of yourself."
