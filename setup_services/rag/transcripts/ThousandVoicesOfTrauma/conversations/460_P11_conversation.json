    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Ahmed?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. Reliving that moment when I found out about my father's death... it's still so raw, even after all these years. I can feel my heart racing, and my palms are sweaty. It's like I'm right back there in that moment, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The overwhelming sense of disbelief, I think. I remember standing there, phone in hand, and just... not being able to comprehend what I was hearing. It's like my brain just couldn't process the information. And then this wave of guilt hit me because I hadn't spoken to him in weeks. I was so caught up in my own life, my work, and... and now he was gone. Forever.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... difficult. Really difficult. But also, in a strange way, kind of cathartic? I've spent so long trying to avoid thinking about that day, but facing it head-on like this... it's like I'm finally allowing myself to feel everything I've been suppressing. The grief, the anger, the regret - it's all there, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming as I thought it would.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. How does this connect to your recovery goals?",
    "Client: I guess... it's helping me realize that I can face these painful memories without falling apart. For so long, I've been afraid to even think about my dad or that day, worried that it would trigger a panic attack or send me into a spiral of anxiety. But going through this exposure, as hard as it is, is showing me that I'm more resilient than I thought. Maybe... maybe I can start to process my grief in a healthier way now, instead of just trying to push it down all the time.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What strategies helped you during the exposure?",
    "Client: The breathing exercises we practiced were really helpful. When I felt myself starting to get overwhelmed, I focused on my breath, just like we've been working on. And reminding myself that I was safe, that this was just a memory and not happening in real-time... that grounded me. It's still hard, but I feel like I have more tools to cope now.",
    "Therapist: You're making great progress. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: It's... it's scary, to be honest. Part of me wants to run away from all of this. But I also know that I can't keep living with this weight on my shoulders. My anxiety, the nightmares, the constant fear - it's affecting my marriage, my work, everything. So yeah, I want to keep going. It's not easy, but I think it's necessary. I want to be able to remember my dad without feeling like I'm drowning in guilt and grief. I want to be present for my wife and actually enjoy our life together without this constant shadow hanging over me.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is admirable. What's one thing you'd like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to try to focus on some of the good memories of my dad. We've been so caught up in the trauma of his death, but there were so many good times too. Maybe revisiting those could help balance out some of the pain? I don't know if that's how this works, but... I'd like to try.",
    "Therapist: That's a great idea. We'll explore that next session. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, but... okay. Better than I expected, actually. It's like a weight has been lifted, even if it's just a little bit. I know we have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this. Thank you for guiding me through this. It means more than I can express.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss today?",
    "Client: No, I think I need some time to process all of this. It's a lot to take in. But I'm glad we did this. It's tough, but I think it's what I need. I'm looking forward to our next session, even though I know it won't be easy. But I'm starting to believe that it'll be worth it in the end.",
    "Therapist: You're showing real courage. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
