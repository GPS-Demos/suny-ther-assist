    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Can you share your SUDS rating before we start?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say it's about a 4 right now. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but okay.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Start describing the memory, and I'll check in periodically.",
    "Client: Okay... I was at the hospital visiting my grandmother. The smell of disinfectant was so strong, it made me nauseous. I remember walking down the long corridor, my heart pounding. As I approached her room, I heard machines beeping. I hesitated at the door, my hand shaking as I reached for the handle.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. My palms are getting sweaty, and I can feel my heart racing.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Keep going.",
    "Client: I walked in, and she looked so small in that hospital bed. Tubes were everywhere. Her skin was pale, almost gray. I could hear her labored breathing. The doctor was there, talking to my parents. Their faces were so serious. I felt like I couldn't breathe.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. I feel like I'm back there. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Take a deep breath. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The doctor said something about \"terminal\" and \"not much time left.\" My mom started crying silently. I felt so helpless. I wanted to run, but I couldn't move. The room started spinning, and I felt like I was going to pass out.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel overwhelmed. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: I... I remember grabbing the edge of the bed to steady myself. The metal was cold. My grandmother opened her eyes and looked at me. She tried to smile, but she looked so weak. I felt a wave of guilt for wanting to leave. I should have been stronger for her.",
    "Therapist: Current SUDS?",
    "Client: Still a 9. I feel tears coming. My throat feels tight.",
    "Therapist: It's alright to cry. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I sat down next to her and held her hand. It felt so fragile. I wanted to say something, but no words came out. The machines kept beeping, reminding me that her time was limited. I felt so angry at the unfairness of it all.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down a bit. Maybe an 8 now. I feel drained.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Keep going.",
    "Client: We sat there for what felt like hours. I tried to memorize every detail of her face. The wrinkles around her eyes, the gray of her hair. I knew it might be the last time I'd see her like this. Eventually, a nurse came in to check her vitals. I had to step out of the room. In the hallway, I finally broke down and cried.",
