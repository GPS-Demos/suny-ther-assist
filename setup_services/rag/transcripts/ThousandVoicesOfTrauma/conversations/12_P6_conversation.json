    "Therapist: Alright, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the cyberbullying incident.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm scrolling through my social media feed, and suddenly I see a post about me. It's... it's a photo of me at my friend's funeral, but someone's edited it to make it look like I'm laughing. The caption says, \"Look who's enjoying the attention.\" I feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably a 6 out of 10. My heart's racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue with the memory.",
    "Client: I start reading the comments, and they're horrible. People are calling me heartless, saying I never cared about my friend. I can feel my face getting hot, and my hands are shaking. I want to throw my phone across the room, but I can't stop reading.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to an 8. I'm feeling really anxious and angry.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I try to defend myself in the comments, but it just makes things worse. More people join in, bringing up old posts and twisting my words. It feels like everyone I know is turning against me. I'm struggling to breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. I feel overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: I shut off my phone and curl up on my bed. I can't stop crying. All I can think about is how much I miss my friend and how unfair this all is. I feel so alone and misunderstood.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Still a 9. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: I... I start to remember the good times with my friend. How he would've stood up for me. The pain starts to dull a little, but I still feel so hurt and angry at those people online.",
    "Therapist: How about your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone down to a 7. I'm still upset, but the memory isn't as intense.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're processing it well.",
    "Client: I decide to reach out to my sister. Talking to her helps me feel less alone. She reminds me that the people who really know me understand the truth.",
    "Therapist: And your current SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5 now. I'm feeling calmer, but still sad.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... kind of relieved too. It wasn't easy, but I made it through the memory.",
    "Therapist: You did well. Let's take a moment to breathe before we discuss further."
