    "Therapist: Good morning, Mrs. Thompson. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Oh, hello there, Dr. Evans. I... I'm not quite sure how I feel, to be honest. A bit jittery, I suppose. My arthritis is acting up something fierce today, which isn't helping matters.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's start with a brief relaxation exercise. Are you comfortable?",
    "Client: As comfortable as I can be, dear. These old bones don't cooperate like they used to.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Now, let's begin. Can you describe where you were when the hostage situation started?",
    "Client: I... (deep breath) I was at the bank. It was a Tuesday morning, I remember because I always did my banking on Tuesdays after Harold... after he passed. The queue was longer than usual, and I was getting impatient. Then suddenly, there was this loud bang, and everyone started screaming.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see people ducking, some running towards the exit. There's a young man, couldn't be more than 25, waving a gun around. His face is... it's contorted, almost like he's in pain. He's shouting something, but I can't quite make it out over the commotion.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My heart's racing, just like it did then. My hands are clammy, and I feel this tightness in my chest. It's... it's hard to breathe.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 70. It's... it's quite intense.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Take another deep breath. What happens next?",
    "Client: The young man, he's herding us all into a corner. I can smell his sweat, it's... pungent. Mixed with something else. Gunpowder, maybe? I'm trying to stay calm, but my knees are shaking something awful.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: There's a young mother next to me. Her little boy is crying, and she's trying to shush him. I... I reach out and hold her hand. It feels clammy, just like mine. The gunman, he keeps pacing, muttering to himself. I catch bits and pieces... something about needing money, about how 'they' forced him to do this.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Scared, but... also angry. I keep thinking about Harold, how he would've handled this. He was always so brave. I... I miss him so much in that moment.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those feelings. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I try to catch the gunman's eye. When I do, I speak to him. My voice is shaky, but I manage to say, \"Son, whatever trouble you're in, this isn't the way out.\" He looks at me, and for a moment, I see something in his eyes. Confusion? Regret? But then it's gone, replaced by that wild look again.",
    "Therapist: That was very brave of you. How does your body feel as you're saying this?",
    "Client: My throat is dry, and my voice comes out all croaky. But there's this... warmth in my chest. Like maybe I can make a difference.",
    "Therapist: And what's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down a bit. Maybe a 60?",
    "Therapist: Good. You're doing great. What happens after you speak to him?",
    "Client: He... he starts yelling at me. Telling me to shut up, that I don't understand. But I can see his hand shaking. The gun... it's wavering. I keep talking, telling him about my Harold, how he always said there was good in everyone. I... I don't know why I'm saying this, but it feels right.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The room is so quiet now. Everyone's watching us. I can hear the little boy sniffling, but he's not crying anymore. The air feels thick, like you could cut it with a knife. And then... then we hear sirens.",
    "Therapist: How does the gunman react?",
    "Client: He panics. Starts waving the gun around again, shouting that we're all hostages now. But... but he keeps looking at me. Like he's searching for something. I... I stand up. My legs are shaking so badly, I think I might fall.",
    "Therapist: That must have been terrifying. What made you stand up?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It was like Harold was there with me, giving me strength. I tell the young man that it's not too late, that he can still make this right. I... I offer to walk out with him, to talk to the police.",
    "Therapist: That was incredibly brave. What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he starts crying. Just breaks down right there. The gun clatters to the floor, and I... I walk over and put my arm around him. He's just a boy, really. Scared and lost. We walk out together, into the blinding sunlight. There are police everywhere, but they let me stay with him until they take him away.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, as you recall this?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. But also... proud? Is that the right word? I never thought I could do something like that. Harold would've been proud, I think.",
    "Therapist: Those are very valid feelings. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 40 now. I... I feel like I've run a marathon, but in my mind.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you tell me five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: Yes, I... I see your degrees on the wall, the plant in the corner, the box of tissues, your blue tie, and the clock ticking away.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Now, three things you can hear?",
    "Client: The air conditioning humming, cars outside, and my own breathing.",
    "Therapist: Perfect. Lastly, one thing you can smell?",
    "Client: That lovely lavender air freshener you always have.",
    "Therapist: Great job. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Better. Calmer. It's... it's strange, reliving it like that. But I feel... lighter, somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's good to hear. You showed incredible strength and compassion in a terrifying situation. How do you think this experience has affected you?",
    "Client: I... I suppose it's made me realize I'm stronger than I thought. After Harold died, I felt so lost, so helpless. But that day... it showed me I could still make a difference. It's... it's given me a new perspective, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How has it impacted your daily life?",
    "Client: Well, I've started volunteering at the community center. Talking to troubled youth. It's... it's not always easy, but I feel like I can relate to them now. And maybe, just maybe, I can help prevent someone else from feeling so desperate.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful, Mrs. Thompson. You've turned a traumatic experience into something positive. How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Grateful, I suppose. And... hopeful. Like maybe there's still more for me to do in this world.",
    "Therapist: That's a beautiful sentiment. As we wrap up, how are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Tired, but... good. Like I've faced something I've been avoiding for a long time.",
    "Therapist: Your progress is commendable. Remember to be kind to yourself this week. We'll continue next session.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Evans. I... I appreciate your help more than I can say.",
    "Therapist: You're very welcome. Take care, Mrs. Thompson."
