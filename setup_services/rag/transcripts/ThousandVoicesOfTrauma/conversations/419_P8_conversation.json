    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. My heart's still racing, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's like I'm right back there, you know? The screeching tires, the smell of burning rubber... it's all so vivid. I can't seem to shake it off.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. I saw the car coming towards us, and I just... froze. I couldn't do anything. And then the impact... God, the sound of metal crunching. I keep wondering if I could have done something, anything, to prevent it. Maybe if I had reacted faster, or if I had insisted we take a different route... I don't know. It's just... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does your body feel as you're recalling these details?",
    "Client: It's like my whole body is on high alert. My muscles are tense, especially in my shoulders and neck. I feel this weird tingling sensation in my fingertips, and my mouth is dry. It's almost like... like I'm preparing to run or fight, even though I know I'm safe here. It's exhausting, really.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are coming up for you?",
    "Client: Mostly fear, I think. But there's also this intense guilt. I mean, I walked away with just a few bruises, but the driver of the other car... he didn't make it. I know logically it wasn't my fault, but emotionally? I can't help feeling responsible somehow. And then there's anger too - at the situation, at the unfairness of it all. It's like this cocktail of emotions swirling around inside me.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when the accident first happened?",
    "Client: They're... they're not as intense now, I suppose. When it first happened, I was in shock. I couldn't process anything. It was like I was watching everything from outside my body. Now, it's more... I don't know, tangible? Like I can actually feel the emotions instead of just being numb. It's progress, I guess, but it's also terrifying to feel everything so strongly.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your ability to sit with these feelings now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard, but I'm doing it, aren't I? Before, I would have tried to push these feelings away, distract myself, or just shut down completely. Now, I'm actually talking about it, feeling it. It's uncomfortable, yeah, but... I'm here. I'm present. That's... that's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How does this realization make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of things. There's a part of me that feels proud, I guess? Like, I'm facing this head-on instead of running away. But there's also this sadness, you know? Sadness for what happened, for the pain I've been carrying around. And maybe a little hope too? Like, maybe if I can face this, I can eventually move past it. It's scary, but... maybe it's necessary.",
    "Therapist: What do you think this means for your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I think... I think it means I'm making progress, even if it doesn't always feel like it. It's like, every time we do this, every time I face these memories, I'm chipping away at their power over me. It's exhausting and sometimes I wonder if it's worth it, but then I have moments like this where I can see how far I've come. I'm not there yet, but... I'm on my way, aren't I?",
    "Therapist: Indeed. How does that realization sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... it's comforting, in a way. Like, even though this is hard and painful, it's serving a purpose. I'm not just suffering for no reason. There's a light at the end of the tunnel, even if I can't always see it. And knowing that... it gives me strength to keep going, you know? To keep facing these memories, keep working through this. It's not easy, but... I think it's worth it.",
    "Therapist: What do you need right now to feel grounded?",
    "Client: I think... I think I just need a moment to breathe. To remind myself that I'm here, in this room, safe. Maybe... could we do that grounding exercise we've done before? The one where we focus on things we can see, hear, and touch? I find that really helps bring me back to the present.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's do that now.",
    "Client: Okay... *deep breath* I can see the painting on your wall, the green plant in the corner, and the sunlight coming through the window. I can hear the ticking of the clock, the faint sound of traffic outside, and my own breathing. I can feel the softness of this chair, the coolness of the air conditioning on my skin, and... and my feet firmly planted on the ground. *another deep breath* That... that helps. I feel a bit more... here.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... calmer. Still a bit shaky, but more grounded. It's like... the memory is still there, but it's not as overwhelming. I can separate myself from it a bit more. I'm proud of myself for getting through that, even though it was tough. And... I'm grateful. For this space, for your guidance. It means a lot to have someone to walk through this with me.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. What would you like to focus on for the rest of our session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to talk about some strategies for managing these intense emotions when they come up outside of our sessions. Sometimes they hit me out of nowhere, you know? Like when I'm driving, or when I hear a loud noise. I want to be better prepared to handle those moments. Can we work on that?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's explore some coping strategies.",
    "Client: Great, thank you. I'm ready to learn. I know it's not going to be easy, but I'm committed to this process. I want to get better, to not let this trauma control my life anymore. So... where do we start?",
    "Therapist: Let's begin with some simple grounding techniques you can use anywhere."
