    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is buzzing, you know? My heart is still racing a bit, and my hands feel clammy. I can't seem to shake off the tension in my shoulders. It's strange because I'm here, safe in your office, but part of me still feels like I'm back there in that hospital room, waiting for news about my husband.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep replaying the moment when those men burst into the room. The look on their faces... so angry, so desperate. I remember thinking, \"This can't be happening. Not here, not now.\" It's like my brain is stuck on that moment, you know? I was already so worried about Carlos after his surgery, and then suddenly, we were all hostages. It feels surreal, even now.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does recalling that memory affect you physically?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. My chest feels tight, like I can't get enough air. And there's this knot in my stomach that won't go away. I notice I'm clenching my jaw too. It's like my body is preparing for something bad to happen again, even though I know I'm safe here.",
    "Therapist: And emotionally?",
    "Client: I feel... scared. No, terrified is more accurate. But also angry. So angry that those men put us through that, that they threatened the lives of sick people and their families. And guilty too. I keep thinking about the other patients and visitors who were there. Did I do enough to help them? Could I have done more?",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when it first happened?",
    "Client: They're... they're not as overwhelming now. When it first happened, I felt completely paralyzed by fear. I couldn't think straight, couldn't process what was happening. Now, it's like... I can feel the fear, but I'm not drowning in it, if that makes sense? But the guilt... that feels stronger now. I have more time to think about everything that happened, to second-guess my actions.",
    "Therapist: I see. What's the most challenging part for you right now?",
    "Client: The most challenging part... I think it's the unpredictability. I never expected something like this to happen in a hospital, you know? It was supposed to be a safe place. Now, I find myself constantly on edge, especially in public places. I'm always looking for exits, watching people's behavior. It's exhausting, but I can't seem to stop.",
    "Therapist: How has this experience affected your daily life?",
    "Client: It's... it's changed everything. I used to be so carefree, but now I feel like I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop. I struggle to sleep at night, and when I do, I often have nightmares about what happened. I've been avoiding hospitals altogether, which is a problem because Carlos still needs follow-up care. And my relationship with my family... I love them, but I feel like they can't understand what I'm going through. I find myself pulling away, even though I know they want to help.",
    "Therapist: What do you think about your progress so far?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Some days, I feel like I'm making progress. I can talk about what happened without breaking down, which is a big step. But other days, it feels like I'm right back where I started. It's frustrating, you know? I want to move past this, to feel normal again, but it's like taking one step forward and two steps back sometimes.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with these difficult moments?",
    "Client: I've been trying those breathing exercises you taught me. They help sometimes, especially when I feel a panic attack coming on. And I've been journaling, which helps me process my thoughts. But honestly, sometimes I just cry. It's like I need to let it all out. And talking to you... it helps. It's hard, but it helps to put words to what I'm feeling.",
    "Therapist: What gives you hope for your recovery?",
    "Client: Hope... that's a tough one. I guess... seeing small improvements gives me hope. Like, last week, I was able to visit Carlos at his doctor's appointment without having a full-blown panic attack. It was hard, but I did it. And my family... even though it's difficult, their support means everything. They remind me that I'm still me, that this experience doesn't define me. That gives me hope that one day, I'll feel like myself again.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired, but in a good way, I think. Like I've done something important, even though it was hard. My heart isn't racing as much anymore, and I feel a bit lighter. Talking about it... it's painful, but it also feels like I'm slowly taking back control. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Is there anything else you'd like to add?",
    "Client: I just... I want to thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this. It's scary, but I'm starting to believe that I'm stronger than I thought.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength today. How would you like to end our session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to do one of those grounding exercises we've practiced. Just to help me transition back to the present moment. And maybe we could talk about some strategies for the week ahead? I have to go to the hospital for Carlos's check-up, and I'm feeling a bit nervous about that.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's start with the grounding exercise..."
