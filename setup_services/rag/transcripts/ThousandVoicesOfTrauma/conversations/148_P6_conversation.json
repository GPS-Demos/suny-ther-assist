    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I understand why we're doing this.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your current SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10. My stomach feels a bit tight, but I'm managing.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Please begin describing the memory.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm standing in the prison visiting room. The walls are a dull gray, and there's this constant hum of fluorescent lights overhead. I can smell disinfectant... It's overpowering. I see my brother sitting across from me in his orange jumpsuit. He looks... defeated. His eyes are sunken, and he's lost weight. I feel a lump forming in my throat as I realize how much he's changed.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. My chest feels tight, and I'm starting to sweat a little.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: He tries to smile at me, but it doesn't reach his eyes. I want to hug him, but we're not allowed to touch. I feel so helpless... angry at the system, angry at him for making the choices that led him here. I'm struggling to find words. The guard nearby is watching us, and it makes me feel on edge. I can hear other conversations around us, but they're just a blur of noise.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. My heart is racing, and I feel like I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (inhales deeply) Okay... My brother starts telling me about his life inside. How he's scared all the time, how he regrets everything. I want to tell him it'll be okay, but the words stick in my throat. I know it won't be okay. He's going to die in here, and there's nothing I can do. I feel this overwhelming sense of loss... like I'm grieving for him even though he's sitting right in front of me.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: The SUDS is still at an 8. My hands are shaking, and I feel nauseous.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The guard announces that visiting time is almost over. I panic, realizing I haven't said any of the things I wanted to say. I start talking faster, telling him I love him, that I'll visit again soon. But it feels hollow. He reaches out as if to touch my hand, then remembers he can't. I see tears in his eyes, and it breaks me. The guard calls time, and I have to leave. Walking away from him feels like I'm abandoning him all over again. I turn back one last time, and the look on his face... it haunts me. I feel like I've failed him.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel overwhelmed, like I can't breathe. My chest hurts.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) I... I can still see his face. The despair, the resignation. It's like I lost him twice - once when he went to prison, and again when I realized he'd never be the same. I feel so guilty for not doing more, for not being able to save him. The weight of it all... it's crushing me.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS?",
    "Client: Still a 9. I feel dizzy, and my hands won't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: I... I make it to my car, but I can't drive. I just sit there, sobbing. I feel so alone, so helpless. The prison looms behind me, this massive, oppressive building that's swallowed my brother. I want to scream, to break something, but I just sit there, paralyzed by grief and anger. I keep replaying his face in my mind, wondering if I'll ever see him smile genuinely again.",
    "Therapist: And now? Your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down. Maybe an 8 now. I still feel shaky, but the tightness in my chest is easing a bit.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're processing this well.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's... it's hard to revisit this. But I know it's necessary. I just... I miss him so much. Even now, years later, it still hurts like it happened yesterday.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: The SUDS is down to a 7. I feel drained, but... maybe a little lighter? Like I've let some of it out.",
