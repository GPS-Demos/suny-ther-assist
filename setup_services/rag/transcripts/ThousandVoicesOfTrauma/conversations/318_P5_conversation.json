    "Therapist: Let's discuss the imaginal exposure we'll be doing today. How are you feeling about it?",
    "Client: I'm not sure, to be honest. I've been trying not to think about the earthquake too much. It's been easier to focus on my breakup with Maria. That's been hard enough to deal with.",
    "Therapist: Understandable. The exposure might be challenging, but it's crucial for healing. Ready to learn more?",
    "Client: I guess so. It's just... the earthquake was so terrifying. I lost friends, my home... everything changed in minutes. And now with Maria gone too, I feel like I'm losing everything all over again.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. This exercise will help process both traumas. Shall I explain how?",
    "Client: Yeah, please do. I want to understand how reliving it could possibly help. It seems counterintuitive, you know?",
    "Therapist: It helps by allowing you to process the memory safely. We'll go through it step-by-step. Any questions so far?",
    "Client: Well, what exactly will I have to do? And... will it make me feel worse before I feel better?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the experience in detail. It may be uncomfortable initially, but it'll improve with time. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It sounds scary, to be honest. I've been having nightmares about the earthquake, and sometimes I feel like I'm right back there when I hear loud noises. Will this make those symptoms worse?",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel apprehensive. The exposure might temporarily intensify symptoms, but ultimately reduces them. Trust the process?",
    "Client: I want to trust it, but it's hard. I've been trying so hard to move forward, especially after Maria left. She couldn't handle how much I'd changed after the earthquake. I'm worried this might set me back.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. This process is about moving forward, not backward. Shall we discuss coping strategies?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I need to know I'll be able to handle this. Sometimes I feel like I'm barely holding it together as it is.",
    "Therapist: We'll use grounding techniques and take breaks as needed. You're in control. How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: A little better, I suppose. It's good to know I have some control. I've felt so out of control since the earthquake, and then with the breakup... it's like the ground keeps shifting under me, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful metaphor. This exercise will help stabilize that ground. Ready to take this step?",
    "Client: I think so. It's scary, but if you think it'll help... I'm willing to try. I just want to feel normal again, to not jump at every loud noise or see destruction every time I close my eyes.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Remember, we're in this together. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Okay, let's do it. I trust you, and I'm ready to face this. I know it won't be easy, but if it helps me move past the trauma and maybe even understand why Maria left... it'll be worth it.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's start by focusing on your breath. When you're ready, describe the day of the earthquake."
