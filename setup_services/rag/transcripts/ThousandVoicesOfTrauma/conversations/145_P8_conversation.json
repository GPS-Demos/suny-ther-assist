    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. My heart is still pounding. I can feel the sweat on my palms. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's like I'm right back there in that room, surrounded by the other cult members. I can smell the incense, hear the chanting. It's... it's suffocating.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What thoughts are accompanying that fear?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"I can't escape. I'm trapped.\" Even though I know I'm here, safe in your office, part of me still feels like I'm there. It's... it's hard to shake that feeling of powerlessness.",
    "Therapist: How does that powerlessness manifest in your body?",
    "Client: My muscles are so tense. Especially in my shoulders and jaw. I realize I've been clenching my teeth. And my stomach... it's in knots. Like I'm bracing for something bad to happen.",
    "Therapist: I see. What else comes up for you?",
    "Client: Anger. I'm angry at myself for staying as long as I did. For believing their lies. For... for letting them hurt me. But I'm also angry at them. For manipulating me, for the physical abuse. I trusted them, and they... they broke that trust in the worst ways possible.",
    "Therapist: How does acknowledging that anger feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a relief. For so long, I've been scared to be angry. Like it wasn't allowed. But now, feeling it... it's like a weight is lifting. I have a right to be angry, don't I?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: Shame. There's still so much shame. I feel like I should have known better, should have been stronger. I keep thinking about my family, how disappointed they must have been in me. How could I have been so stupid?",
    "Therapist: Hm. Where do you think that shame comes from?",
    "Client: I guess... I guess it's from the cult's teachings. They always made us feel like everything was our fault. If something went wrong, it was because we weren't devoted enough, pure enough. And I internalized that. Even now, it's hard to shake.",
    "Therapist: How does that internalized shame affect you today?",
    "Client: It... it holds me back. I second-guess every decision. I'm afraid to trust my own judgment. And relationships? Forget about it. I'm terrified of letting anyone get close. What if I fall for something like that again?",
    "Therapist: What would it mean if you could trust yourself again?",
    "Client: Freedom. It would mean freedom. To live without constant fear and doubt. To maybe... maybe even be happy. But I don't know if I can ever get there.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you could take towards that trust?",
    "Client: I... I guess talking about it like this is a step. Being honest about what happened, how I feel. Maybe... maybe I could start journaling? Get my thoughts out somewhere safe?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great idea. How are you feeling now compared to when we started?",
    "Client: Still shaky, but... clearer, I think. Like I've let out some of the pressure that's been building up. It's exhausting, but also... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful? Is that crazy?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. What gives you that hope?",
    "Client: The fact that I can talk about it now. That I'm here, doing this work. A year ago, I couldn't even say the word 'cult' without having a panic attack. Now I'm facing it head-on. That's... that's progress, right?",
    "Therapist: It certainly is. What does that progress mean to you?",
    "Client: It means I'm stronger than I thought. That maybe, just maybe, I can overcome this. It's scary, and it hurts, but... I'm doing it. I'm facing it. And that... that feels powerful.",
    "Therapist: How can you carry that feeling of strength with you?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to remind myself of it. Maybe I can write down moments like this, when I feel strong. Something to look at when I'm doubting myself. And maybe... maybe I can start challenging those negative thoughts more. Question them instead of just accepting them.",
    "Therapist: That's a wonderful idea. How do you feel about ending our session here today?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm okay with that. It's been intense, but good. Thank you for... for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone listen without judgment.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care of yourself this week, and we'll continue next time.",
    "Client: Thank you. I will. See you next week."
