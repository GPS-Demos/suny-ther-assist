    "Therapist: Hello, Mrs. Johnson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this session all week. The idea of revisiting those workplace experiences makes my stomach churn.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's talk about what we'll be doing.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm listening, but I'm not sure I'm ready for this. It's been years since I left that job, but the memories still feel so fresh.",
    "Therapist: The goal is to help you process those memories safely. Are you open to trying?",
    "Client: I suppose so. But what if I can't handle it? What if I break down or panic?",
    "Therapist: I'll be here to support you throughout. We can pause anytime. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's somewhat reassuring. I've spent so long trying to forget everything that happened. The constant belittling, the sabotage of my work, the whispered comments... It's like a dark cloud that's followed me even into my self-employment. I'm not sure I want to open that door again.",
    "Therapist: Facing these memories can help dispel that cloud. Shall we start slowly?",
    "Client: I guess so. But can you explain more about what exactly we'll be doing? I'm still not clear on the process.",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit the memories gradually, at your pace. You'll describe them aloud.",
    "Client: Describe them aloud? That sounds terrifying. I've never really talked about the details with anyone, not even my husband. I'm worried I might fall apart if I start speaking about it.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Remember, you're safe here. How can I help you feel more comfortable?",
    "Client: I appreciate that. Maybe... could we have a code word if I need to stop? And could you remind me where I am if I seem too lost in the memory?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's use \"pause\" as our code word. I'll ground you regularly.",
    "Client: Thank you. That helps a bit. I'm still scared, but I trust you. I know you've been guiding me through this process for a while now. It's just... confronting these memories feels like opening Pandora's box.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. This work is challenging but can be very healing.",
    "Client: I hope you're right. I'm tired of feeling haunted by my past. If this can help me move forward and feel stronger in my current work, then I'm willing to try. But please, be patient with me. This isn't easy.",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll move at your pace. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do this before I lose my nerve. Just... stay close, okay?",
    "Therapist: I'm right here with you. Let's start with a deep breath..."
