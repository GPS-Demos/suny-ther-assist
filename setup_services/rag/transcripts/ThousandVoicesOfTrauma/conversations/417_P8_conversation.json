    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. My heart's still racing, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's like I'm right back there, you know? The sounds, the smells... they're all so vivid.",
    "Therapist: What's the most prominent sensation you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: The smell of smoke and jet fuel. It's... it's overwhelming. I can taste it in the back of my throat. And there's this ringing in my ears, like the aftermath of the crash. I keep seeing flashes of the chaos, people screaming, luggage scattered everywhere.",
    "Therapist: How are those sensations affecting you emotionally?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. My hands are shaking, and I feel this intense urge to run, to get away. But there's also this... this guilt. I made it out, but so many others didn't. I keep thinking about the family that was sitting a few rows ahead of me. I don't know if they... if they survived.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind as you recall these details?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why me? Why did I survive?\" And then I feel awful for even having that thought. There's this voice in my head saying I should have done more to help others. But I was so paralyzed with fear. I couldn't move, couldn't think. I just... I just acted on instinct.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts relate to your everyday life now?",
    "Client: They... they're always there, lurking in the background. Every time I hear a loud noise or smell something burning, I'm right back on that plane. It's affecting my work, my relationships. I've been using alcohol to numb these feelings, to forget. But it's not helping. If anything, it's making everything worse.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your body as you share this?",
    "Client: My muscles are so tense. My jaw is clenched, and I realize I'm gripping the armrests of this chair. It's like my body is preparing for impact all over again. And there's this hollow feeling in my stomach, a mix of dread and nausea.",
    "Therapist: How does talking about this experience make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's difficult. Part of me wants to shut down, to avoid thinking about it altogether. But there's also a sense of... relief? Like I'm finally letting out something I've been holding in for so long. It's painful, but it also feels necessary, if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: What's the hardest part about revisiting this memory?",
    "Client: The guilt. Definitely the guilt. I keep replaying moments where I could have helped someone, could have done something differently. And then there's this fear that it could happen again. I haven't been on a plane since the crash. The thought of it makes me break out in a cold sweat.",
    "Therapist: How has this experience changed your perspective on life?",
    "Client: It's... it's made me realize how fragile life is. How everything can change in an instant. I find myself appreciating small moments more, but I'm also constantly on edge, waiting for the next disaster. It's like I'm living in two worlds - the one where I'm grateful to be alive, and the one where I'm terrified of what might happen next.",
    "Therapist: What coping strategies have you found helpful?",
    "Client: Honestly, not many. That's why I'm here. The alcohol... it numbs things for a while, but it's not a solution. I've tried meditation, but sitting still with my thoughts often makes things worse. Sometimes, talking to other survivors helps. There's a sense of understanding there that I don't find anywhere else.",
    "Therapist: How do you see your recovery journey moving forward?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me hopes that by facing these memories head-on, like we're doing now, I can start to process them better. I want to be able to live my life without this constant fear and guilt. I want to be able to fly again, to not flinch at every loud noise. But it feels like such a long road ahead.",
    "Therapist: What gives you hope in this process?",
    "Client: The fact that I'm here, I guess. That I'm willing to face this. And... and the small moments when I feel okay, when I can go a few hours without thinking about the crash. They're rare, but they're there. It makes me think that maybe, just maybe, I can get through this.",
    "Therapist: How can we build on those positive moments?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe by acknowledging them more? By trying to understand what makes those moments possible? And perhaps... perhaps by trying to create more of those moments intentionally. It's just... it's hard to allow myself to feel okay sometimes. Like I don't deserve it.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to allow yourself to feel okay?",
    "Client: It would mean... letting go, I suppose. Letting go of the guilt, of the constant vigilance. It would mean accepting that what happened wasn't my fault, that surviving doesn't make me a bad person. But that feels so difficult. It's like I'm betraying those who didn't make it if I allow myself to move on.",
    "Therapist: How might your recovery impact those around you?",
    "Client: I... I hadn't really thought about that. I guess it would make things easier for my friends and family. They worry about me, I know they do. And at work... maybe I could focus better, be more present. It might even help other survivors if I can show that it's possible to get better. But it all seems so far away right now.",
    "Therapist: What small step could you take this week towards healing?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I could try to have one day without drinking. Or I could reach out to that support group for survivors I heard about. It's scary, but... but maybe talking to others who understand could help. And perhaps I could try writing down those moments when I feel okay, to remind myself that they exist.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about our session today?",
    "Client: It's been... intense. Draining, but also somewhat cathartic. I feel raw, exposed, but also like maybe I've taken a small step forward. There's a part of me that's terrified of what other memories might surface as we continue this process, but another part that's... hopeful? Is that the right word? Hopeful that maybe, just maybe, I can learn to live with this.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for your courage today. We'll continue next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's not easy, but... I think I needed this. I'll try to work on those small steps we talked about. See you next week."
