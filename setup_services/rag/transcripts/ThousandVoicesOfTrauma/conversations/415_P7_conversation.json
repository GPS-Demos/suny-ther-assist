    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the situation with your severe illness?",
    "Client: It was about two years ago. I had been feeling unwell for weeks, and finally went to see my doctor. They ran some tests and... (voice trembles) they found a tumor. It was advanced stage cancer. I remember sitting in the doctor's office, feeling like the world was crumbling around me. My hands were shaking as I held the test results.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I felt so alone. My parents were there, but they're elderly and I didn't want to burden them. The doctor was talking about treatment options, but all I could hear was a buzzing in my ears. I kept thinking, \"This can't be happening to me.\" I felt like I was watching myself from outside my body.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) The worst part was telling my parents. They've always relied on me, and now I was going to be a burden. I remember my mother's face crumpling when I told her. She tried to hide it, but I could see the fear in her eyes. My father just stood there, silent. I felt like I had failed them somehow.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. Continue.",
    "Client: The treatments were brutal. I lost my hair, my appetite, my strength. Some days, I couldn't even get out of bed. My parents tried to help, but they're not young anymore. I felt so guilty watching them struggle to care for me. There were moments when I wished... (voice breaks) I wished it would just end. The pain, the fear, the burden I had become.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: One night, I overheard my parents talking. My mother was crying, saying she couldn't bear to lose me. My father was trying to comfort her, but his voice was shaking too. I lay there in the dark, feeling utterly helpless and alone. I wanted to comfort them, but I had no strength left. It was like I was already gone, just a shell of who I used to be.",
    "Therapist: That must have been so difficult. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: (wiping tears) The worst was when my hair started falling out. It was coming out in clumps, and I decided to shave it all off. As I looked at myself in the mirror, bald and gaunt, I didn't recognize myself anymore. I felt like I had lost my identity, my femininity, everything that made me... me.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel emotional. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The treatments seemed endless. Each day was a struggle to find hope, to keep fighting. I felt like I was letting everyone down - my parents, my doctors, myself. There were days when I just wanted to give up, to stop the treatments and let nature take its course. The guilt of those thoughts ate away at me.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. Continue.",
    "Client: As time went on, I started to improve, but the fear never really left. Every check-up, every scan, I was terrified they'd find something. Even now, years later, I still have nightmares about it coming back. I feel like I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop. Like I can never truly relax or feel safe in my own body again.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Sometimes, I look at my parents and feel this overwhelming guilt. They've aged so much in the past few years. I know the stress of my illness took a toll on them. I worry about what will happen to them if the cancer comes back. Who will take care of them? I feel like I've robbed them of their peace in their golden years.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have these feelings. Keep going.",
    "Client: (sighs deeply) I try to stay positive, to be grateful for each day, but it's hard. The experience has left me feeling vulnerable and afraid. I struggle with depression, always second-guessing every ache or pain. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel truly healthy or normal again. It's like there's always this dark cloud hanging over me, reminding me of my mortality.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted, honestly. Talking about it brings back so many emotions. But... also a bit relieved, I think. It's been a while since I've allowed myself to really remember all of it. It's still painful, but maybe a little less overwhelming than before.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You've done very well today."
