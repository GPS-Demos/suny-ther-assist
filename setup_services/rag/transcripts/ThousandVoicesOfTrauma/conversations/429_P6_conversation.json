    "Therapist: Alright, Sarah. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your current SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that memory.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) I'm back in my childhood home. It's dark, and I can hear shouting downstairs. My heart is racing, and I'm hiding under my bed. The floorboards are cold against my skin.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My palms are sweating, and I feel a knot in my stomach. The shouting is getting louder, and I'm terrified he'll come upstairs.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 7 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I hear heavy footsteps on the stairs. My whole body is shaking. I'm trying not to make a sound, but my breathing feels so loud. The door creaks open, and I see his shadow. I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel like I can't breathe. My chest is so tight. I want to run, but I'm paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. (Voice trembling) I don't know if I can do this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: (Breathing heavily) He's... he's yanking me out from under the bed. His grip is so tight on my arm. I can smell the alcohol on his breath. I'm crying, begging him to stop.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. What's happening in your body?",
    "Client: My arm hurts where he's gripping it. I feel nauseous, and my head is spinning. I'm so scared and helpless.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Still a 9. Maybe even a 9.5. It's so intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Keep going.",
    "Client: (Sobbing) He's yelling at me, calling me worthless. I can feel his spit on my face. I'm trying to pull away, but he's so strong. I just want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Taking deep breaths) I... I can feel myself starting to dissociate. It's like I'm watching it happen from outside my body.",
    "Therapist: Try to stay present. What do you notice?",
    "Client: The room is spinning. I feel lightheaded. But the fear is still there, raw and overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe an 8?",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing it.",
    "Client: (Sighs) He finally lets go of my arm. I curl up in the corner, sobbing. My whole body is shaking. I feel so small, so powerless.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm starting to feel a bit more grounded. The memory is still there, but it feels less overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 6 now.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. Let's start to bring you back.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay. I'm... I'm back in the room with you. My heart is still racing a bit, but I feel more present.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... also a bit relieved? Like I've faced something I've been running from for a long time.",
