    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Ali. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a part of me that wants to get this over with, but another part that's... well, hesitant. It's not easy to revisit these memories.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start slowly. Can you close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day?",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Alright... I'm closing my eyes now. It's... it's a sunny afternoon. I can feel the warmth on my skin. I'm walking down the street near my old neighborhood...",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: There are small shops lining the street. The smell of fresh bread from the bakery... It's familiar, comforting. But then I notice... I notice a police car parked at the corner. My heart... it starts beating faster.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'd say... about 30. It's uncomfortable, but manageable.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: As I get closer to the police car, I see two officers step out. They're looking in my direction, and I can feel my palms getting sweaty. I try to look calm, but inside, I'm... I'm terrified.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: One of the officers approaches me. He's asking for my ID. His tone is... it's harsh, accusatory. I reach for my wallet, but my hands are shaking. I can barely get it out of my pocket.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My anxiety is climbing. Maybe... 50? My mouth is dry, and I'm struggling to speak clearly as I hand over my ID.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Inhales deeply) The officer is scrutinizing my ID. His partner joins him, and they're whispering to each other. I can't hear what they're saying, but their expressions... they're full of suspicion. I feel so... so powerless.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind at this moment?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why me? What have I done wrong?\" I've lived here for decades, I'm a respected member of the community. But in their eyes, I'm... I'm just a potential threat.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those thoughts. What happens next?",
    "Client: The first officer starts questioning me. \"What are you doing in this area? Where are you going?\" His voice is getting louder, more aggressive. People on the street are starting to stare. I feel... I feel so humiliated.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 70. My heart is pounding in my ears.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Take another deep breath if you need to.",
    "Client: (Breathes shakily) I try to explain that I live nearby, that I'm just out for a walk. But the officer cuts me off. He's accusing me of acting suspiciously. I don't understand... I haven't done anything wrong!",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel at this moment?",
    "Client: My legs feel weak, like they might give out. My stomach is in knots. I want to run, but I know that would only make things worse.",
    "Therapist: Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: The second officer starts searching me. His hands are rough, invasive. I feel... violated. They're treating me like a criminal. I can hear people whispering, see them pointing. The shame... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's at 85. I can feel tears forming in my eyes.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're here in a safe place.",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) They find nothing, of course. But instead of apologizing, they warn me to \"stay out of trouble.\" As if I'm some kind of... of delinquent. I'm a 71-year-old man! I've never broken a law in my life!",
    "Therapist: How do you feel towards the officers at this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm angry. Furious, actually. But also terrified. I want to yell at them, tell them how wrong this is. But I can't. I just... I just nod and try to look submissive. I hate myself for it, but I'm too scared to do anything else.",
    "Therapist: That's a complex mix of emotions. How does it feel to acknowledge them?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually somewhat liberating. I've never really allowed myself to feel the full extent of my anger before. It's always been overshadowed by fear.",
    "Therapist: Continue with what happens next.",
    "Client: The officers finally let me go. As they walk away, I hear one of them laugh. It's... it's like a knife in my gut. I stand there for a moment, trying to compose myself. People are still staring. I feel... exposed, vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: What do you do then?",
    "Client: I... I start walking home. My legs are shaky, and I feel dizzy. The familiar streets suddenly seem hostile. I keep looking over my shoulder, afraid the officers might come back.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's still high... maybe 80. The immediate danger is gone, but the fear and humiliation linger.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: When I get home, I... I break down. My wife finds me crying in the hallway. I feel so... so emasculated. I'm supposed to be strong, to protect my family. But in that moment, I felt utterly powerless.",
    "Therapist: How does your wife react?",
    "Client: She's... she's supportive. She holds me, lets me cry. But I can see the worry in her eyes. She's scared too. We both know that this could happen again, at any time, for no reason.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind as you're with your wife?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... how can I keep my family safe? How can I protect them when I couldn't even protect myself? I feel like I've failed them somehow.",
    "Therapist: Those are heavy thoughts. How does your body feel now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. My whole body feels heavy. The adrenaline is wearing off, and I'm left feeling... hollow.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level at this point?",
    "Client: It's come down a bit... maybe 60? The immediate panic has subsided, but there's this... this residual anxiety that just won't go away.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Can you describe what happens in the days following this incident?",
    "Client: I... I become withdrawn. I stop going for walks. I make excuses to avoid leaving the house. When I do go out, I'm constantly on edge, watching for police cars. I have trouble sleeping, plagued by nightmares of being arrested, of being powerless.",
    "Therapist: How does this affect your daily life?",
    "Client: It... it changes everything. I start to isolate myself from friends. I'm irritable with my family. I feel like I'm constantly looking over my shoulder. The world doesn't feel safe anymore.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly challenging. What's your distress level now as you reflect on these changes?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 70. Talking about the long-term impact is... it's hard. It makes me realize how much this incident has affected my life.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you tell me three things you can see in this room right now?",
    "Client: (Opens eyes, looks around) I see... the painting on your wall, the plant in the corner, and... and your desk lamp.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, take a deep breath. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling a bit calmer. My heart rate has slowed down. But there's still this... this heaviness in my chest.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've just revisited a very difficult experience. How do you feel about having shared this today?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of emotions. Part of me feels drained, but another part feels... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've finally let some of this out.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. Remember, healing is a process. We'll continue to work through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I never thought I'd be able to talk about this in such detail. It's still painful, but... but maybe there's hope for moving past it.",
    "Therapist: There absolutely is. You've shown incredible strength today. How would you like to close our session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to sit quietly for a moment, if that's okay. Just to... to process everything we've talked about.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take all the time you need. I'm here if you need anything."
