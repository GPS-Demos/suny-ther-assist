    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm at the park near my apartment. It's a sunny afternoon, and I'm walking my neighbor's dog. The grass is really green, and there are kids playing on the playground nearby. I can hear their laughter...",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue.",
    "Client: As we're walking, I see this big dog in the distance. It's not on a leash, and it starts running towards us. My heart begins to race, and I feel my palms getting sweaty. The dog I'm walking starts barking and pulling on the leash...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10. I'm starting to feel anxious, but it's manageable.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Keep going.",
    "Client: The big dog is getting closer, and I can see its teeth. It's growling, and I'm frozen in place. I want to run, but I can't move. My legs feel weak, and I'm struggling to breathe. The dog lunges at us, and I hear myself screaming...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to a 7. My heart is pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: The big dog attacks the smaller dog I'm walking. There's so much noise - barking, growling, yelping. I'm crying and yelling for help, but no one seems to hear me. I can see blood on the grass, and I feel so helpless...",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can continue. My chest feels tight, and I'm shaking.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: Okay... The attack feels like it's lasting forever. Finally, someone hears and comes running. They manage to pull the big dog away, but the smaller dog is badly hurt. I'm sobbing uncontrollably, feeling guilty and terrified...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's still at a 9. I can't seem to calm down.",
    "Therapist: That's alright. Let's pause here. Open your eyes and look around.",
    "Client: (opens eyes, breathing heavily) That was... intense.",
    "Therapist: You did well. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: A bit shaky, but my SUDS is dropping. Maybe a 6 now?",
    "Therapist: Good. What helped you get through it?",
    "Client: Knowing you were here, I guess. And reminding myself it's just a memory.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's take a break before we continue."
