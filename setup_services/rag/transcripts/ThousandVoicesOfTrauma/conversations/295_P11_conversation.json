    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Patel?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. It's strange, Dr. Johnson. Even though it's been years since the earthquake, reliving it through this exercise brought back so many intense emotions. My heart is still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sounds. I could hear the rumbling of the earth and the crashing of buildings so clearly. It was like I was right back there in Mumbai, watching our neighborhood crumble. I keep thinking about how helpless I felt, unable to do anything but watch.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... overwhelming. I felt the same fear and panic I did back then. But there was also this strange sense of... I don't know, maybe control? Because I knew I was here, safe in your office, even as I was reliving it. It's confusing.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. How does this connect to your daily life now?",
    "Client: Well, I've noticed that loud noises still startle me easily. And I'm always on edge, especially in tall buildings. I guess... I'm always waiting for the next disaster to strike. It's exhausting, really.",
    "Therapist: I see. What insights did you gain from this experience?",
    "Client: I realized that... maybe I'm not as over it as I thought I was. I've been trying to push these memories away for so long, telling myself I should be fine by now. But clearly, there's still work to do. And... I think I understand now why I've been so anxious about my children's safety. I'm constantly worried something will happen to them.",
    "Therapist: That's a valuable insight. How might this affect your goals moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I need to be more patient with myself. And maybe... maybe it's time I talk to my family about what I'm going through. I've been keeping it all inside, trying to be strong for them. But that's not really helping anyone, is it?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive step. What else?",
    "Client: I want to work on feeling safer in my daily life. Maybe... maybe we could practice some techniques for when I start feeling panicky? And I'd like to be able to enjoy going out with my family without constantly scanning for danger.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent goals. How are you feeling about continuing with the exposures?",
    "Client: It's scary, I won't lie. But... I think I see the value now. If facing these memories can help me live a fuller life, then I'm willing to keep trying. It's just... it's not easy, you know?",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. Any other thoughts?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking about my late husband. He was my rock during the earthquake and its aftermath. Facing these memories without him... it brings up a whole different kind of pain. I miss him so much, especially in moments like these.",
    "Therapist: That's a natural response. How can we incorporate that?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe we could explore how to draw strength from his memory? He always believed in my resilience. I think he'd be proud of me for doing this work. It's just... it's hard to face it all alone.",
    "Therapist: You're not alone. What support can we build?",
    "Client: I have my children, and my sister. Maybe I could open up to them more about what I'm going through. And... I've been thinking about joining a support group for widows. I've been hesitant, but maybe it would help to connect with others who understand.",
    "Therapist: That sounds positive. Anything else you'd like to share?",
    "Client: I... I'm grateful for this space to process everything. It's painful, but I think it's necessary. And... thank you for your patience with me, Dr. Johnson. I know I'm not the easiest client, with all my anxiety and hesitation.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work. How shall we proceed?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to continue with the exposures. And maybe we could spend some time on coping strategies for when the memories and anxiety get overwhelming? I want to feel more in control, both during our sessions and in my daily life.",
    "Therapist: Excellent plan. Let's wrap up for today. Final thoughts?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired, but I feel a glimmer of hope. It's like... maybe I can actually work through this and come out stronger on the other side. It's a long road ahead, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I might actually be able to walk it."
