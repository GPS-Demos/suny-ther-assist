    "Therapist: Today, we'll be doing an imaginal exposure exercise. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: I'm not sure, to be honest. I've been dreading this part of therapy. The idea of reliving that moment... it's terrifying. Can you explain why we need to do this?",
    "Therapist: Of course. It helps process the trauma memory. What concerns you most?",
    "Client: I'm worried I'll fall apart completely. I've spent years trying to avoid thinking about losing my father. What if I can't handle it? And... I'm scared of disappointing you if I can't go through with it.",
    "Therapist: Your fears are valid. We'll go at your pace. How can I support you?",
    "Client: I appreciate that. Maybe... could you remind me that I'm safe here? And perhaps we could have a signal if I need a break? I'm just so anxious about this whole process.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll use hand signals. What else might help you feel secure?",
    "Client: Having some water nearby would be good. And... is it okay if I bring out the worry stone my father gave me? It's silly, but it comforts me.",
    "Therapist: Not silly at all. It's a great coping tool. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Just... promise me you won't judge me for whatever comes out? Sometimes I feel so angry about what happened, and then I feel guilty for being angry. It's all so confusing.",
    "Therapist: There's no judgment here. All your feelings are valid. Shall we start?",
    "Client: Okay. Yes, let's do this. I'm scared, but I know it's important. Can you walk me through what's going to happen exactly? I think having a clear picture might help ease my nerves a bit.",
    "Therapist: Sure. We'll start with relaxation, then gradually revisit the memory. Ready?",
    "Client: As ready as I'll ever be, I suppose. Thank you for being so patient with me. It means a lot, especially given how difficult this is. I just hope this helps in the long run.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. This work is challenging but can be very healing. Let's begin."
