    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit jittery, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about my illness, and that always makes me feel on edge.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. How would you rate your distress from 0 to 100?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 60? My stomach's in knots just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Let's do this before I lose my nerve.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I'm in my apartment. It's early morning, and I'm getting ready for work. But something feels off. My head is pounding, and I'm so dizzy. I stumble to the bathroom, and when I look in the mirror, my face is pale and sweaty. God, I look awful.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I try to brush my teeth, but my hands are shaking so badly. The toothbrush clatters into the sink. I'm scared. This isn't normal. I fumble for my phone and call my boss, tell her I can't come in. My voice sounds weird, all raspy and weak.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, Sarah?",
    "Client: Anxious. My heart's racing just thinking about it. It's like I'm there again.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: Maybe... 70? It's getting harder.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... I... I crawl back to bed. Everything's spinning. I'm so thirsty, but I can't get up. Hours pass, I think. It's getting dark outside. I'm drifting in and out of consciousness. I'm alone, and I'm terrified. What if I die here and no one knows?",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What do you hear? Smell?",
    "Client: I hear... I hear my neighbor's TV through the wall. Some game show. And I smell... sweat. My own sweat. It's sour and sickly.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I manage to reach my phone. My vision's blurry, but I call 911. The operator's voice sounds far away. I'm trying to explain, but my words are slurred. I'm so ashamed. What if they think I'm drunk? But I haven't touched alcohol in months...",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Frustrated. Angry. I've worked so hard to stay sober, and now this? It's not fair!",
    "Therapist: I hear your frustration. What happens after the call?",
    "Client: I... I wait. It feels like forever. I hear sirens, then pounding on my door. I can't get up to answer it. They break in. Paramedics. They're asking questions, but I can barely respond. One of them mentions something about my pupils. They look worried. I'm lifted onto a stretcher. The movement makes me nauseous.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 80. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Remember, you're safe now. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... We're in the ambulance. The lights are so bright. I'm shivering uncontrollably. Someone's putting an IV in my arm. It hurts, but I can't even flinch. I hear them talking about my vitals. Words like \"critical\" and \"organ failure\" float around. I'm... I'm so scared. I don't want to die.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. This is a memory. Can you feel the chair you're sitting in?",
    "Client: Y-yes. I can feel it. It's... it's grounding. Thank you.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: We arrive at the hospital. It's chaos. Bright lights, people shouting. I'm wheeled into a room. Doctors and nurses swarm around me. They're cutting off my clothes, attaching monitors. Someone's talking to me, asking about drug use. I try to tell them I'm clean, but I don't think they believe me. I feel so... so powerless.",
    "Therapist: How does that powerlessness feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a weight on my chest. Like I can't breathe. My muscles are tense, and I want to run, but I can't move.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: They... they're running tests. Blood draws, scans. I'm in and out of consciousness. Time blurs. At some point, a doctor tells me they think it's meningitis. They need to do a spinal tap. I'm terrified, but I can't even protest. The needle... oh god, the needle in my spine. It hurts so much. I cry out, but it's just a whimper.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Sarah. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's 90. I feel like I'm there again. It's so real.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here in my office. You're safe. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *inhales shakily* Okay... After the spinal tap, everything's a blur. I'm moved to the ICU. Machines beeping, tubes everywhere. I drift in and out. Sometimes I hear voices - doctors, nurses. They sound concerned. I catch phrases like \"touch and go\" and \"next 24 hours critical.\" I'm too weak to be scared anymore. I just... exist.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel in those moments?",
    "Client: Empty. Like I'm floating outside my body. But also... angry. Why is this happening to me? I've tried so hard to turn my life around, and now this?",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel angry. What else do you remember?",
    "Client: I... I remember waking up one day feeling slightly more aware. A nurse is there, smiling. She tells me I'm improving, that I've turned a corner. But I don't feel relief. I just feel... numb. And then the shame hits. What if someone from work finds out? What if they think I relapsed? My whole life feels like it's falling apart.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those emotions. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still around 85. My heart's pounding.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Remember, you survived this. You're here now.",
    "Client: Yeah... you're right. I did survive. But recovery was so hard. Weeks in the hospital, then rehab. Learning to walk again, to take care of myself. And the whole time, I'm terrified of relapsing. The pain, the meds... it would be so easy to fall back into old habits. But I didn't. I fought through it.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to acknowledge that strength?",
    "Client: It's... it's complicated. I'm proud I made it through, but I'm also angry it happened at all. And scared. What if it happens again? What if next time I'm not strong enough?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Drained. Emotionally and physically. But also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like talking about it made it less scary somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's often how it works. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 65. Still anxious, but not as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Sarah. How about we start winding down? Can you tell me three things you see in this room?",
    "Client: Um, your desk lamp, the plant in the corner, and the clock on the wall.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, two things you hear?",
    "Client: The hum of the air conditioner and traffic outside.",
    "Therapist: And one thing you can touch?",
    "Client: The soft fabric of this chair.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Take a deep breath. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Better. Tired, but... okay. Like I can face the rest of my day.",
    "Therapist: You did wonderfully, Sarah. We'll talk more about this next time, but for now, be proud of the work you've done today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I needed this more than I realized.",
    "Therapist: That's often the case. Remember to be kind to yourself this week. Do you have any questions before we wrap up?",
    "Client: No, I don't think so. Just... thank you for helping me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Sarah. I'll see you next week."
