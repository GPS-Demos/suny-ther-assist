    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I think so... I mean, yes. I'm feeling a bit jittery, to be honest. But I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. How would you rate your distress from 0 to 100?",
    "Client: Uh, probably around a 60 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we're focusing on the incident of witnessing violence. Close your eyes and describe what you see.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Alright... I'm... I'm in my old neighborhood. It's late afternoon, the sun's starting to set. I can hear kids playing nearby, but it feels... tense. Like something's off.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you notice around you?",
    "Client: There's graffiti on the walls, trash on the sidewalk. I see my neighbor's house... God, I remember how afraid I was of his temper. The curtains are drawn, but I can hear shouting inside.",
    "Therapist: What's happening now?",
    "Client: The shouting's getting louder. I... I can make out words now. He's yelling at his wife, calling her names. I hear something crash. My heart's racing...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My palms are sweaty. I feel like I can't move. I want to do something, but I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: That's it. You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: The front door bursts open. He's dragging her out by her hair. She's crying, begging him to stop. I can see blood on her face. I... I feel sick.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I hide behind a parked car. I'm shaking. I want to help her, but I'm terrified he'll see me. He's so much bigger than me.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 80. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Carlos. Stay with the memory. What happens next?",
    "Client: He throws her onto the sidewalk. She's not moving much. He's screaming at her to get up, kicking her. I can hear her whimpering. I feel so helpless...",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. This is just a memory. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I see an old lady from across the street. She's yelling at him to stop. He turns towards her, swearing. For a second, I think he might go after her too.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Guilt. Shame. I should be doing something. But I'm just a kid, and I'm so scared.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What happens next?",
    "Client: Someone must have called the cops. I hear sirens in the distance. He hears them too. He spits on his wife and runs back inside. She's just lying there, sobbing.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you notice?",
    "Client: The silence. It's so quiet now, except for her crying. I can smell the garbage from the alley. My legs are cramping from crouching so long.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still around 80. My heart's pounding.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Take a deep breath. What happens as the police arrive?",
    "Client: Two cop cars pull up. Officers jump out, guns drawn. They're yelling for him to come out. I'm still hiding, watching everything unfold like a horrible movie.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking?",
    "Client: That it's my fault. If I had been braver, maybe I could have stopped it sooner. But I was just a coward.",
    "Therapist: Those are tough feelings. Remember, you were just a child. What happens next?",
    "Client: They bring him out in handcuffs. He's still yelling, threatening everyone. The paramedics arrive and start helping his wife. I... I finally come out from behind the car.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel seeing him arrested?",
    "Client: Relieved, but also... angry. At him, at myself, at the world. Why did this have to happen?",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to process. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I walk over to the old lady. She's crying too. She puts her arm around me, tells me it's over now. But I know it's not. Not really.",
    "Therapist: What do you mean by that?",
    "Client: This... this scene. It's burned into my memory. I can't unsee it. I can't unhear those screams. It's like... it changed something in me.",
    "Therapist: That's a profound realization. How does it affect you now?",
    "Client: I... I guess it's why I'm always on edge. Always expecting the worst. It's like I'm still that kid, hiding behind the car, waiting for the next explosion.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 70. Still high, but... I feel drained.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today, Carlos. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you name five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: (Opens eyes, looks around) Uh... your desk, the bookshelf, the clock, the plant in the corner, and... the painting on the wall.",
