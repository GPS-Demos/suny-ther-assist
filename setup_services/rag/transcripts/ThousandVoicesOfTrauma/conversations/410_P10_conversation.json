    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to dive in, but another part is hesitant. It's like my stomach is doing flips.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in our old apartment. It's small, cramped. The walls are this dingy yellow color. I can smell dinner cooking - beans and rice. My little sister is playing with her dolls on the floor.",
    "Therapist: Good. What time of day is it?",
    "Client: It's evening. The sun is setting, casting long shadows through the window. I remember feeling... uneasy. Like something was off.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear shouting outside. It's getting louder. My sister looks up at me, her eyes wide. I tell her to keep playing, that everything's okay. But my heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 40? It's building.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The shouting is right outside our door now. I recognize one of the voices - it's our neighbor, Mr. Rodriguez. He sounds angry, slurring his words. There's a loud bang, like something hit the wall. My sister starts crying.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. My hands are shaking. I want to comfort my sister, but I'm frozen in place. The door flies open, and Mr. Rodriguez stumbles in. His face is red, his eyes unfocused. He's yelling at someone behind him.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 60. My heart is pounding just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Maria. Remember, you're here in the office with me. Take another deep breath.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm trying to stay calm, but it's hard. Mr. Rodriguez is waving his arms wildly, knocking things over. I can see his wife in the doorway, pleading with him to stop. She has a bruise forming on her cheek. I feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I grab my sister and pull her into the corner. I'm trying to shield her, to cover her ears. But she's crying so hard. I can feel her little body shaking against mine. Mr. Rodriguez turns towards us, and for a moment, I think he's going to come at us.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 75 now. I can feel my palms sweating.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Maria. Keep going.",
    "Client: Mrs. Rodriguez grabs his arm, trying to pull him away. He spins around and... and he hits her. Hard. She falls to the ground. I hear myself scream, but it sounds far away, like it's not really me. My sister is wailing. I want to help Mrs. Rodriguez, but I'm paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I feel so helpless. So angry. Why isn't anyone helping? Where are my parents? I should do something, but I'm too scared. I'm failing everyone.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you were just a child. How's your distress?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 85 now. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. Feel your feet on the ground.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm here. I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: Mr. Rodriguez is yelling incoherently now. He's smashing things, throwing plates. The noise is deafening. Mrs. Rodriguez is crying on the floor, not moving. I'm pressed against the wall, holding my sister so tight it must hurt her, but she's clinging to me just as hard.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's another voice. It's my dad. He must have just gotten home from work. He rushes in, takes in the scene. For a moment, everything freezes. Then he's moving, putting himself between us and Mr. Rodriguez.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel seeing your dad?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm relieved, but still terrified. What if Mr. Rodriguez hurts him too? Dad's talking calmly, trying to de-escalate the situation. I can see the strain in his face, the tension in his shoulders.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 80? My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Maria. Keep going.",
    "Client: Dad manages to get Mr. Rodriguez to sit down. He's still muttering angrily, but the energy has shifted. Dad turns to check on us, and I can see the worry in his eyes. He mouths \"It's okay\" to me, but I don't believe him. Nothing feels okay.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling towards your dad in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm grateful he's there, but also... angry? Why didn't he come sooner? Why didn't he stop this from happening in the first place? I know it's not fair, but...",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are valid, Maria. How does the scene continue?",
    "Client: Dad helps Mrs. Rodriguez up. She's sobbing quietly now. My mom arrives - she must have heard the commotion. She rushes to us, wrapping her arms around me and my sister. I can smell her perfume, feel the softness of her sweater. For a moment, I feel safe.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe 70? I'm still shaken, but not as panicked.",
    "Therapist: Good. Take another deep breath. What happens next?",
    "Client: Everything becomes a blur of activity. Someone's called the police. There are flashing lights outside. Officers come in, start asking questions. I'm trying to answer, but my voice sounds strange, far away. My sister has stopped crying, but she's eerily quiet, her face buried in Mom's shoulder.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel as this is happening?",
    "Client: I feel... numb. Like I'm watching everything from outside my body. There's this heavy weight in my chest. I keep replaying Mr. Rodriguez hitting his wife, the sound of it. I can't shake it.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response to trauma. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 65. The immediate danger is gone, but I still feel on edge.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Maria. Keep going.",
    "Client: The police take Mr. Rodriguez away. He goes quietly now, all the fight drained out of him. Mrs. Rodriguez is sitting on our couch, holding an ice pack to her face. She looks... broken. I want to go to her, but I can't make myself move.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm wondering if this has happened before. If it will happen again. I'm scared for Mrs. Rodriguez, for my family. The world suddenly feels so much more dangerous.",
    "Therapist: Those are very understandable thoughts. How does the scene end?",
    "Client: Eventually, things calm down. The police leave. Dad walks Mrs. Rodriguez back to her apartment. Mom is cleaning up the mess, trying to restore some normalcy. I'm still holding my sister. She's fallen asleep, exhausted from crying. I wish I could sleep too, but I know I won't be able to for a long time.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 50. The immediate panic is gone, but there's this lingering dread, this heaviness.",
    "Therapist: You've done an incredible job, Maria. How are you feeling now, back in the present?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. Shaky. But also... I don't know, maybe a little proud? For getting through it?",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You showed incredible strength, both then and now. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you... this was hard, but I think it helped.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Maria. Remember, you're safe now. We'll work through this together."
