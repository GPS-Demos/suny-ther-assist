    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the event?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in my dorm room. It's late at night, and I'm scrolling through social media. I come across this post about a racial incident on campus. My heart starts racing as I read the comments. They're full of hate and ignorance. I feel so alone and scared.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I want to speak up, but I'm afraid. What if they target me next? I remember all the times I've been treated differently because of my race. The subtle looks, the \"jokes,\" the way people avoid sitting next to me in class. It all comes flooding back.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. You're safe here.",
    "Client: My hands are shaking. I feel this overwhelming sense of anger and sadness. Why do I have to deal with this? Why can't I just be seen as a person? I think about my parents and how hard they've worked to give me this opportunity. But now I feel like I don't belong here.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Continue.",
    "Client: I close my laptop, but I can't sleep. My mind keeps racing. I think about all the times I've had to explain my culture, defend my presence, prove that I belong. It's exhausting. I feel so small, so powerless. I want to call my parents, but I don't want to worry them.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I curl up in my bed, trying to make myself as small as possible. I can hear my roommate snoring in the other bed, completely oblivious to what I'm going through. I feel so isolated. I start to question everything - my choice of school, my friends, my future. Will I always feel this way? Will I ever truly fit in?",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Keep going.",
    "Client: The next morning, I have to go to class like nothing happened. I put on a smile, but inside I'm screaming. I see the person who made the post walking across campus, laughing with their friends. They have no idea how much pain they've caused. I want to confront them, but I'm afraid. I feel like a coward.",
    "Therapist: You're not a coward. You're very brave for sharing this.",
    "Client: Throughout the day, I'm hyperaware of every interaction. Are people treating me differently? Do they know how I feel? I'm exhausted from constantly second-guessing everything. By the time I get back to my room, I'm drained. I feel like I'm carrying this huge weight that no one else can see or understand.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job describing your experience.",
    "Client: I decide to reach out to the campus diversity office, but their response feels generic and unhelpful. It's like they don't really understand the depth of what I'm feeling. I start to feel hopeless, like nothing will ever change. I wonder if I should just transfer to a different school, somewhere I might fit in better. But then I feel angry at myself for even considering that. Why should I have to leave?",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those thoughts. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: As the days go by, the incident fades from everyone else's memory, but it stays with me. Every time I walk into a classroom or a party, I wonder if people are judging me based on my race. I feel like I'm constantly on guard, waiting for the next hurtful comment or ignorant question. It's so draining, and I don't know how long I can keep this up.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible resilience. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... overwhelmed. Talking about this brings back all those emotions - the fear, the anger, the loneliness. But there's also a small part of me that feels relieved to finally be sharing this. It's like I've been carrying this burden alone for so long, and now someone else knows how heavy it is.",
    "Therapist: That's a very insightful observation. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. I guess I never realized how much this experience affected me. It's not just about that one night or that one post. It's about all the little moments that add up over time. The constant feeling of being \"other.\" The exhaustion of always having to prove myself. The fear that no matter how hard I work or how successful I become, some people will always see me as less than because of my race.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great courage today. How are you feeling about our session?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but also a little lighter. It's hard to revisit these memories, but there's something cathartic about finally putting them into words. I've never really talked about this with anyone before. I always felt like I had to be strong, like admitting how much it hurt me would somehow prove that I didn't belong. But sharing it with you... it makes me feel less alone.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think I am proud. It's not easy to be this vulnerable. But I also feel a glimmer of hope. Maybe by talking about this, by acknowledging these experiences, I can start to process them better. Maybe I can find ways to cope that don't involve just pushing everything down and pretending I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent perspective. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. This was intense, but I'm glad we did it. I feel like I understand myself a little better now. And even though revisiting these memories was painful, I feel like I handled it better than I expected. Maybe I'm stronger than I thought.",
    "Therapist: You absolutely are. We'll end here. Well done today."
