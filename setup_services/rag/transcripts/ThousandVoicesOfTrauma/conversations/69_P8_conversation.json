    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also kind of blank at the same time. The memory of that airplane crash news... it's so vivid now. I can feel my heart pounding in my chest, just like it did when I first heard about it.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you noticing right now?",
    "Client: My palms are sweaty, and there's this tightness in my throat. It's hard to swallow. I keep seeing flashes of the news footage in my mind - the wreckage, the crying families. It's like I'm right back there in that moment, you know? And there's this heaviness in my stomach, like a rock just sitting there.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... what if that had been my family on that plane? What if I lose someone I love like that, so suddenly? It's irrational, I know, but I can't shake this feeling of... vulnerability, I guess. Like the world isn't safe. And then I feel guilty for making it about me when so many people actually lost their loved ones.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your experiences of neglect?",
    "Client: I... wow, I hadn't thought about that. But yeah, I guess it does connect. When I was younger, I always felt like I had to fend for myself, you know? My parents were physically there, but emotionally... it was like I was on my own. And now, when I think about that crash, it's like... it brings up all those feelings of being alone, of not having anyone to protect me from the bad things in the world.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are coming up for you as you make that connection?",
    "Client: It's a mix of things. There's sadness, definitely. Like, a deep, aching kind of sadness for that little kid who felt so alone. But there's also anger, you know? Anger at my parents for not being there for me emotionally, anger at the world for being such a scary place sometimes. And then... and then there's this weird sense of relief, I guess? Like, finally understanding why this particular event affected me so much.",
    "Therapist: How does recognizing this connection make you feel about your recovery journey?",
    "Client: It's... it's eye-opening, honestly. I never realized how much my past experiences were coloring my reactions to things like this. It's like... it's like I'm seeing my own thoughts and feelings more clearly now. And that's scary, but also kind of empowering? Like, maybe if I can understand why I react this way, I can start to change it. Maybe I can start to feel safer in the world.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I think... I think I just need to sit with these feelings for a bit. To really let myself feel them, you know? For so long, I've tried to push them away or ignore them. But maybe that's part of the problem. Maybe I need to acknowledge them, to really look at them head-on. It's not comfortable, but... but I think it might be necessary.",
    "Therapist: How can we support you in that process?",
    "Client: I'm not sure, to be honest. Maybe... maybe just having a space where I can talk about these things without judgment? Where I can explore these connections and feelings without feeling like I'm being irrational or overly dramatic? And maybe some guidance on how to... how to sit with these uncomfortable feelings without getting overwhelmed by them?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling now compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, honestly. But also like something has shifted. Like I've taken a step forward, even if it's a small one. There's still this residual anxiety, this lingering unease from reliving that memory. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe hope? Like maybe I'm starting to understand myself a little better. It's exhausting, but also kind of liberating in a way.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to explore more about how my past experiences of neglect are affecting my current reactions and relationships. Maybe we could dig deeper into that connection we made today? And perhaps... perhaps we could talk about some strategies for managing these intense emotions when they come up outside of our sessions? I feel like I need some tools to help me navigate this process.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Is there anything else you'd like to add before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I just... I want to say thank you. For creating this space where I can be vulnerable and explore these difficult memories and feelings. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm making progress. And that... that means a lot to me. I'm nervous about what might come up next, but I'm also kind of looking forward to it, in a weird way. Is that strange?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a normal part of the healing process.",
    "Client: Okay, good. I'm glad to hear that. I guess... I guess I'm ready to end for today then. It's been intense, but I feel like we've made some real progress. Thank you again.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
