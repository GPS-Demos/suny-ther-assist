    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. The memory of that accident... it's so vivid now. I can still hear the screeching tires, the shattering glass. My heart is pounding, and I feel this tightness in my chest.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's like I'm right back there, watching it all unfold again. I keep thinking about how helpless I felt, just standing there as the cars collided. And then the silence afterward... it was deafening. I feel so guilty, you know? Like maybe I could have done something to prevent it.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How does that guilt manifest for you?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a weight on my shoulders. I keep replaying the scene in my head, thinking of all the what-ifs. What if I had yelled a warning? What if I had stepped into the street? It's irrational, I know, but I can't shake the feeling that I should have done more. And now, every time I cross a street or hear a car horn, I tense up. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: I see. What physical sensations are you noticing as you talk about this?",
    "Client: My palms are sweaty, and I feel this knot in my stomach. It's like my body is preparing for something bad to happen, even though I'm safe here. I'm also noticing that my breathing is shallow, and I'm clenching my jaw. It's crazy how vivid these sensations are, even though the accident happened months ago.",
    "Therapist: That's common. How do these reactions impact your daily life?",
    "Client: They're... they're pretty disruptive. I've been avoiding busy intersections, which makes getting to my classes a nightmare. I'm constantly on edge when I'm outside, always scanning for potential dangers. It's affecting my sleep too. I have nightmares about the accident, and sometimes I wake up in a cold sweat, heart racing. It's hard to focus on my studies when I'm this anxious all the time.",
    "Therapist: I understand. What thoughts come up when you reflect on these changes?",
    "Client: I... I feel angry. Angry at myself for not being able to \"get over it,\" you know? And frustrated that this one moment has changed so much in my life. I worry that I'll never feel normal again, that I'll always be this anxious, jumpy person. Sometimes I think about dropping out of school, just hiding away somewhere. But then I feel weak for even considering that.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid feelings. How do you cope with these thoughts?",
    "Client: Honestly? Not very well. I've been isolating myself a lot. It's easier to stay home than to deal with the anxiety of going out. I've started drinking more than I used to, just to quiet my mind enough to sleep. I know it's not healthy, but it feels like the only way to get some relief. I've also been avoiding any news about car accidents or violence. It's like I'm trying to pretend that bad things don't happen, even though I know that's not reality.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your honesty. What would feeling \"better\" look like to you?",
    "Client: God, I don't even know anymore. I guess... being able to walk down the street without constantly looking over my shoulder. Being able to sleep through the night without nightmares. Not feeling this constant dread in the pit of my stomach. Maybe being able to talk about what happened without feeling like I'm right back there in that moment. And... and not feeling so alone in all of this. It's like the accident has put this invisible barrier between me and everyone else.",
    "Therapist: Those are important goals. How do you feel after sharing all of this?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of things. Part of me feels drained, like I've just run a marathon. Talking about it brings up all these intense emotions, and that's exhausting. But there's also a small part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe relieved? Like I've been carrying this huge secret, and now someone else knows. It doesn't fix anything, but it makes me feel a little less alone. And maybe... maybe a tiny bit hopeful? Like, if I can talk about it here, maybe someday I'll be able to process it and move forward. I don't know if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: It does. What's one small step you could take this week?",
    "Client: I... I guess I could try to take a short walk every day. Just around the block, nothing too ambitious. And maybe... maybe I could try writing down some of my thoughts when I'm feeling anxious, instead of reaching for a drink. It's not much, but it's something, right?",
    "Therapist: That's a great start. How are you feeling now, as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm tired, but... okay, I think. A bit raw, like I've exposed a wound. But also like maybe, just maybe, it might start to heal. Thank you for listening. It means more than you know.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue next week. Take care."
