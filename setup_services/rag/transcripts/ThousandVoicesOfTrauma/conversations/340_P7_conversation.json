    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure exercise. Can you describe the car accident for me?",
    "Client: Okay... I was driving home from work, it was raining heavily. The roads were slippery, and visibility was poor. I remember gripping the steering wheel tightly, trying to focus on the road ahead. Suddenly, I saw headlights coming towards me in my lane. My heart started racing, and I...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I swerved to avoid the oncoming car, but I lost control. The car started spinning, and I felt completely helpless. Everything was a blur of lights and rain. I heard the screeching of tires and then a loud crash. The impact was so strong, it felt like my whole body was being shaken apart. I remember the airbag deploying, and the smell of burning rubber...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that memory. You're safe here.",
    "Client: It's hard... After the crash, there was this eerie silence. I could hear the rain pattering on the roof of the car, and my own labored breathing. I tried to move, but I was in so much pain. My chest hurt from the airbag, and my neck was stiff. I could taste blood in my mouth. I was so scared, thinking I might be seriously injured or that the car might explode...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: I fumbled for my phone, but my hands were shaking so badly. I managed to call 911, but I could barely speak. I was gasping for air, feeling like I was suffocating. The operator kept asking me questions, but I couldn't focus. All I could think about was whether I was going to die there, alone in my car. The wait for help felt like an eternity...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: When the paramedics arrived, they had to use the jaws of life to get me out. The sound of metal being torn apart was terrifying. They put a neck brace on me and strapped me to a backboard. I remember looking up at the sky, feeling the rain on my face, and thinking how surreal it all was. In the ambulance, the pain really set in. Every bump in the road was agony...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: At the hospital, everything was a blur of tests and doctors. They told me I had a concussion, whiplash, and some broken ribs. But all I could think about was how close I came to dying. I kept replaying the accident in my mind, wondering if I could have done something differently. The guilt and fear were overwhelming...",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those feelings. You're processing it well.",
    "Client: The recovery was slow and painful. Physical therapy helped with the injuries, but the emotional scars were harder to deal with. I couldn't sleep without nightmares of the crash. Driving became a source of constant anxiety. Even as a passenger, I'd flinch at every sudden movement or sound. It felt like the accident had stolen my sense of safety and control...",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Talking about it... it's bringing back a lot of those intense emotions. My heart is racing, and I feel a tightness in my chest. But at the same time, there's a sense of relief in sharing this. It's like I'm finally letting out something I've been holding in for so long. It's painful, but also... freeing, in a way.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to believe sometimes that I survived that. The accident changed me in ways I'm still discovering. I find myself being more cautious, more appreciative of life. But there's also this underlying fear that something terrible could happen at any moment. It's a constant battle between gratitude for being alive and anxiety about what could happen next...",
    "Therapist: You're showing great insight. Let's continue.",
    "Client: The hardest part has been dealing with the chronic pain. It's a constant reminder of that night. Some days are better than others, but it's always there, lurking in the background. It affects my sleep, my work, my relationships. I've had to learn new ways to manage it, both physically and mentally. Sometimes I feel angry that this happened to me, that I have to deal with this pain every day...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have those feelings. You're coping admirably.",
    "Client: But I'm trying to focus on the positive. I've learned a lot about myself through this experience. I've discovered strength I didn't know I had. My relationships with my family and friends have deepened. They've been so supportive throughout this whole ordeal. And in a strange way, the accident has given me a new perspective on life. I don't take things for granted anymore. Every day feels like a second chance...",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also lighter. Talking about it in such detail, it's like I'm seeing the whole experience from a different angle. There's still pain and fear, but also a sense of pride in how far I've come. I realize now that surviving wasn't just about that night, but about every day since then. Each day I choose to keep going, to face my fears, to live my life despite the trauma and pain \u2013 that's its own kind of victory.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable resilience. Well done."
