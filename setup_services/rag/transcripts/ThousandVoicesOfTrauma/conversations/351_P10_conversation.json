    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is dreading it. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0-100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: Uh... probably around a 40. It's not terrible, but I can feel the tension building.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we're here to work through this together. Are you ready to begin the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I guess so. Yeah, let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day in Vietnam. What do you see?",
    "Client: (deep breath) I'm... I'm in the jungle. It's hot, so damn hot. The air is thick with humidity, and I can smell the damp earth. We're on patrol, moving slowly through the dense foliage. I can hear the crunch of leaves under our boots and the distant calls of unfamiliar birds.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: We're all on edge. There's been reports of enemy activity in the area. I'm gripping my rifle tightly, my eyes scanning every shadow, every movement. Suddenly, I hear a twig snap to my left. I spin around, my heart racing...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe a 60?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going. What do you see when you turn?",
    "Client: I... I see a flash of movement. Before I can even process what's happening, gunfire erupts all around us. The air is filled with the deafening sound of automatic weapons. I dive for cover behind a fallen tree, my ears ringing.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Terror. Pure, unadulterated terror. My hands are shaking so badly I can barely hold my rifle. I'm trying to return fire, but I can't see the enemy. They're ghosts in the jungle.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: (voice trembling) It's... it's up to 80 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Carlos. Remember, you're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (inhales deeply) Okay... okay. I'm still behind the log. The firefight is intensifying. I can hear screams from my squad mates. Oh God, I see Johnson go down. He's hit... there's so much blood...",
    "Therapist: Stay present in the memory. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I crawl towards him. Bullets are whizzing over my head, kicking up dirt all around me. I reach Johnson, and I can see the fear in his eyes. He's gasping for air, clutching at his chest. I'm yelling for a medic, but I can barely hear my own voice over the gunfire.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling as you try to help Johnson?",
    "Client: Helpless. Absolutely helpless. I'm pressing my hands against his wound, but the blood won't stop. It's warm and sticky on my hands. Johnson's eyes are locked on mine, pleading... and then... and then they just... go blank.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: (choked voice) It's... it's at 95. I can't... I can't do this...",
    "Therapist: You can, Carlos. You're safe here. Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) Okay... okay. I'm... I'm still there, but I can feel the floor. I'm... I'm alive.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Johnson's gone. I know he's gone, but I can't leave him. The gunfire is still raging around us. I hear someone shouting orders to fall back. I grab Johnson's dog tags, and I... I have to leave him. God, I have to leave him there...",
    "Therapist: What happens as you move away?",
    "Client: I'm crawling back, dragging my rifle. My uniform is soaked with Johnson's blood. I make it back to our lines, and someone's pulling me to my feet. We're retreating, running through the jungle. Branches are whipping at my face, but I barely feel it. All I can think about is Johnson's face.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 85?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Carlos. Keep going.",
    "Client: We finally make it to a clearing where the choppers are waiting. As we're lifting off, I can see the jungle below. Somewhere down there, Johnson's body is lying in the dirt. I failed him. I failed him...",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What are you experiencing?",
    "Client: Guilt. Overwhelming guilt. And anger. Why him? Why not me? I keep replaying those moments in my head, wondering if there was something more I could have done.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe 75 now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's stay with the memory a bit longer. What happens when you land?",
    "Client: We touch down at base. Everyone's quiet. Shell-shocked. I stumble off the chopper, and suddenly I'm throwing up. My sergeant puts a hand on my shoulder, tells me I did good out there. But how can that be true? Johnson's dead.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I go to clean up. In the makeshift shower, I watch Johnson's blood wash off my hands, swirling down the drain. I can't stop shaking. Later, I sit on my bunk, holding his dog tags. I should write to his family, but what can I possibly say?",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, in that moment on your bunk?",
    "Client: Empty. Just... empty. Like a part of me died out there in the jungle with Johnson. I keep thinking about his family, how they'll get the news. Will they hate me for surviving when he didn't?",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to about 60 now. The intensity is fading, but the guilt... the guilt is still there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Carlos. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (inhales deeply) Okay... I'm here. I'm in your office.",
    "Therapist: Good. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. Emotionally exhausted. But... also a bit lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. Your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: I'd say it's down to about 40 now. Same as when we started, but it feels different.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today, Carlos. How do you feel about the session?",
    "Client: It was tough. Really tough. But... I think it was necessary. I've never talked about that day in such detail before.",
    "Therapist: That's the power of this process. We'll continue to work through this memory in future sessions. For now, let's do a quick grounding exercise before we end.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Great. Let's start by focusing on five things you can see in this room..."
