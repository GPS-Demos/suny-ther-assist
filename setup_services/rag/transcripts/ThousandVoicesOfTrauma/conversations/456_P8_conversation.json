    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. I can still hear the wind howling from the typhoon, you know? It's like it's still happening right now.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you noticing?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking a bit. And my heart... it's beating so fast. I feel cold, even though it's not cold in here. It's like I'm back there, huddled in the dark, waiting for the storm to pass.",
    "Therapist: And what thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"What if it happens again?\" I mean, I know I'm safe now, but... what if another typhoon hits? What if next time, my apartment doesn't hold up? I feel so... vulnerable. Like nature could just sweep me away at any moment.",
    "Therapist: How does that vulnerability feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a heaviness in my chest. Like I can't take a full breath. And my shoulders are so tense, like I'm bracing for impact. I just want to curl up into a ball and hide.",
    "Therapist: What else comes up for you?",
    "Client: I... I feel guilty. So many people lost everything in that typhoon, and here I am, still struggling with it. My family back home, they were hit harder than I was. I should be over this by now, shouldn't I?",
    "Therapist: How do those thoughts of guilt affect you?",
    "Client: They make me feel weak. Like I'm not strong enough to handle this. I came here to study, to make a better life, and instead I'm... I'm falling apart over a storm that happened months ago. It's embarrassing.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about those self-judgments?",
    "Client: I... I guess they're pretty harsh. I wouldn't say those things to a friend who went through this. But it's different when it's me. I just feel like I should be doing better, you know?",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to recognize that difference?",
    "Client: It's... surprising, actually. I never thought about it that way before. Maybe I am being too hard on myself. But it's hard not to be. I feel like I'm always on edge now, waiting for the next disaster.",
    "Therapist: Can you tell me more about that feeling of being on edge?",
    "Client: It's exhausting. I check the weather obsessively now. Any time the wind picks up, I start to panic. I've packed an emergency bag that I keep by my door. I can't sleep through the night anymore because I'm always listening for... I don't know, the sound of danger, I guess.",
    "Therapist: How has this affected your daily life?",
    "Client: It's... it's changed everything. I used to love rainy days, but now they terrify me. I've missed classes because I couldn't bring myself to leave my apartment on stormy days. My grades are slipping. I feel so isolated because I don't want to explain to my classmates why I'm acting so strange.",
    "Therapist: What do you think might help you feel more secure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to move somewhere inland, far from the coast. But that feels like running away. I guess... maybe if I understood more about typhoons, about how buildings are designed to withstand them? Knowledge might help. And... maybe talking to other survivors. Knowing I'm not alone in this.",
    "Therapist: How does the idea of connecting with others make you feel?",
    "Client: It's scary, but... also a little hopeful? I've been so caught up in my own fear, I haven't really thought about how others might be coping. Maybe they have strategies I haven't thought of. Or maybe just knowing other people understand would help me feel less... broken.",
    "Therapist: What else comes to mind as you reflect on this?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to be kinder to myself. This isn't just about being scared of storms. It's about feeling powerless, about facing how fragile life can be. That's... that's a big thing to grapple with. Maybe it's okay that I'm still struggling. Maybe that doesn't make me weak.",
    "Therapist: How does that perspective shift feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a relief, actually. Like I can take a deep breath for the first time in months. I'm still scared, but... maybe I don't have to be scared of being scared, if that makes sense? Maybe this is just part of the process of healing.",
    "Therapist: What do you think your next step might be?",
    "Client: I think... I think I want to learn more. About typhoons, about trauma, about coping strategies. And maybe... maybe reach out to some support groups. Just knowing they exist makes me feel a little less alone. And I want to work on being gentler with myself. This isn't something I can just \"get over,\" and that's okay.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, compared to when we started?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, I think. Still shaky, but like I can see a path forward now. It's not just an endless storm anymore. There's... there's hope. And that feels really good.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. This was intense, but... helpful. Thank you for guiding me through this. I feel like I understand myself a little better now.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Take care of yourself."
