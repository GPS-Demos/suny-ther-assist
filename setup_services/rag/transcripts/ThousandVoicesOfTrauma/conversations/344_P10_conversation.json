    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Thompson. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Oh, well... I suppose I'm a bit nervous, if I'm honest. It's not easy talking about these things, you know. But I've come this far, haven't I? Might as well keep going.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. Are you ready to begin the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I think so. Yes, let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes, take a deep breath, and describe the scene.",
    "Client: (inhales deeply) Okay... I'm in our old house. It's evening, and I'm in the kitchen. I can smell the roast I've just taken out of the oven. The radio's on in the background, playing some old tune. I'm... I'm nervous because I hear his car pull up in the driveway. The gravel crunches under the tires.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: The front door slams shut. I flinch a little. His footsteps are heavy, coming towards the kitchen. I'm trying to look busy, arranging the plates on the counter. He... he comes in. I can smell the alcohol on him before I even turn around.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My heart's racing. I'm... I'm scared, but also angry. Why does he have to come home like this? Why can't he just...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: He grunts something about dinner being late. I try to explain that I've just taken it out, but he's not listening. He grabs my arm, spins me around. His face is so close to mine, all red and sweaty. I can see the veins in his neck pulsing.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling?",
    "Client: Oh, um... about 70, I'd say.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember to breathe. What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he starts yelling. Calling me useless, lazy. Says I can't do anything right. I try to pull away, but his grip tightens. It hurts. I can feel my arm bruising already.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I tell him he's hurting me. Ask him to let go. But that just makes him angrier. He shoves me, hard. I stumble back, hit the counter. The pain shoots through my hip. I... I can't help it, I start to cry.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My... my hands are shaking. My stomach's in knots. I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) He... he sees me crying and it's like something snaps. He grabs a plate from the counter and throws it. It shatters against the wall, pieces flying everywhere. I cover my face, afraid he'll throw something at me next.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 85.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, you're here in the room with me. You're safe. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I try to run past him, to get out of the kitchen. But he catches me, grabs my hair. Yanks me back. The pain... it's so sharp. I cry out. He's shouting in my ear, but I can barely make out the words over the ringing in my head.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're doing well.",
    "Client: I... I manage to twist away, but I slip on some of the broken plate. I fall, hard. My elbow hits the floor first, then my hip again. The pain is... it's intense. I can taste blood in my mouth. I must have bit my cheek when I fell.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Terrified. Helpless. I... I want to fight back, but I'm afraid it'll just make things worse.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he stands over me. For a moment, I think he might help me up. But then he just... he just steps over me. Grabs a beer from the fridge. I hear him mutter something about me being pathetic as he walks out of the kitchen.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still pretty high. Maybe 90.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. Remember you're here with me, safe in this room.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) Right. Yes. I'm... I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I stay on the floor for a while. I'm afraid to move. My whole body aches. I can hear the TV in the living room. He's acting like nothing happened. Like I'm not lying here, hurt and scared. Eventually, I manage to pull myself up. My legs are shaky. I... I look at the mess in the kitchen. The broken plate, the spilled food. I should clean it up, but I just... I can't.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in that moment?",
    "Client: Defeated. Tired. So, so tired. And... and angry. Why do I let this happen? Why don't I leave?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid feelings. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I go to the bathroom. Lock the door behind me. I look in the mirror and... (voice breaks) I barely recognize myself. There's a red mark on my cheek where he grabbed me. My hair's a mess from when he pulled it. I... I start to cry again, but quietly. I don't want him to hear.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe 75 now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Take another deep breath. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I clean myself up as best I can. Put some cold water on my face. Try to fix my hair. I... I tell myself it won't happen again. That he'll be sorry in the morning. That things will get better. But... but deep down, I know it's not true.",
    "Therapist: What do you do after that?",
    "Client: I... I go to our bedroom. He's still in the living room. I change into my nightgown, wincing as I move. My hip and elbow are already starting to bruise. I... I get into bed, curl up on my side. I can hear the TV downstairs, the occasional clink of a beer bottle. I... I lie there, wide awake, for hours. Afraid to sleep. Afraid of what might happen if he comes upstairs.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, both in the memory and here in the room?",
    "Client: In the memory, I feel... trapped. Hopeless. Here... I'm sad. Angry at myself for not leaving sooner. But also... I don't know, maybe a little proud that I survived it? That I'm here now, talking about it?",
    "Therapist: That's a very insightful observation. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 60, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You've done really well today. How do you feel about ending the exposure here?",
    "Client: I... I think that would be okay. It's exhausting, reliving it all.",
    "Therapist: I understand. You've shown incredible strength today. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end.",
    "Client: (takes several deep breaths) Thank you. I... I never thought I'd be able to talk about this.",
    "Therapist: You've made significant progress. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... maybe a little lighter? Like I've set down a heavy load I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after these sessions. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: I... I think I am. It's still hard, but... but I'm glad I'm doing this.",
    "Therapist: That's great to hear. Let's end our session here. Remember to use the coping strategies we've discussed if you feel overwhelmed later.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you... for listening, for helping me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
