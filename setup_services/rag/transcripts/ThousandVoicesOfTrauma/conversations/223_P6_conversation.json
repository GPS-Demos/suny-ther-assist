    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's begin. Close your eyes and describe the memory.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in the hospital room. The lights are so bright, and there's a constant beeping from the machines. I can smell the antiseptic in the air. The doctor is standing over me, telling me about the cult's influence on my health. I feel so confused and scared.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: It's about a 6. My heart is starting to race a bit.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The doctor keeps talking about how the cult's practices have affected my body. I can feel the cold metal of the bed rail in my hand. My throat feels tight, and I'm struggling to breathe normally. I keep thinking, \"How could I have been so foolish?\"",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to an 8. I feel so ashamed and angry at myself.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. These feelings are normal. Keep going.",
    "Client: I see my husband's face. He looks so worried and disappointed. I want to disappear. The doctor is explaining the treatment plan, but all I can focus on is the overwhelming guilt. My body feels heavy, like I can't move.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating at this moment?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: I'm trying, but it's so hard. I can hear the nurses whispering outside. They're probably talking about me, about how stupid I was to fall for the cult's lies. My chest feels so tight, and I'm starting to sweat.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: Still a 9. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) The doctor is leaving now. I'm alone with my husband. He's holding my hand, but I can't look at him. I feel so ashamed and scared about what's going to happen next.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's gone down a bit, maybe to a 7. I'm starting to feel a little calmer.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: I'm trying to process everything the doctor said. My mind is racing with thoughts about how I'll recover, how I'll face my family and friends. The room feels smaller somehow. I can hear other patients in the hallway, and it makes me feel so isolated.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's back up to an 8. I'm feeling overwhelmed again.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. These fluctuations are normal.",
    "Client: I'm looking at the IV in my arm, and it's a stark reminder of how much damage the cult has done. I feel so weak and vulnerable. My husband is trying to comfort me, but his words aren't really reaching me. I'm lost in my own thoughts and fears.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating at this point?",
    "Client: It's still an 8. I feel stuck in this moment.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: A nurse comes in to check my vitals. She's kind, but I can see the pity in her eyes. It makes me feel even worse. I'm wondering how I'll ever trust myself again, how I'll rebuild my life after this.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's starting to come down, maybe a 6. I'm feeling a bit more detached from the memory.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Let's start wrapping up. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: (Opens eyes) I'm... I'm okay. It was intense, but I feel like I got through it.",
    "Therapist: You did very well. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted, but also a bit relieved. My SUDS is down to a 4 now.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end."
