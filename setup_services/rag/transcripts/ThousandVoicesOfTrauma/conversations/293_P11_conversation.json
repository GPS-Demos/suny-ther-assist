    "Therapist: How are you feeling after going through that memory today?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. The memory of that animal attack, it just... it feels so vivid now. I can still hear the growling, you know? And the screams... God, the screams. It's like I'm right back there again.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. Watching it happen and not being able to do anything. I keep replaying it in my mind, wondering if I could have done something differently. Maybe if I had reacted faster or... I don't know. It's just... it's hard not to feel guilty, you know?",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How does that guilt affect you now?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a weight, you know? Always there. I find myself being overly cautious now, always on edge. I can't even watch nature documentaries anymore without feeling this... this panic rising in my chest. It's affecting my sleep, my work... everything, really.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does this connect to your overall symptoms?",
    "Client: I guess... I guess it's all tied together, isn't it? The nightmares, the flashbacks, the constant anxiety... it all stems from that moment. I've been trying to avoid anything that reminds me of it, but that's not really living, is it? It's like I'm stuck in that moment, and I can't move forward.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What do you think about that?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm tired of letting it control me. Going through this memory today, as hard as it was, it made me realize that I can face it. It's still terrifying, but... but I survived it once, right? Maybe I can learn to live with it, instead of running from it.",
    "Therapist: That's a brave perspective. How might this help your recovery?",
    "Client: Well, maybe if I can face this memory, I can start facing other things too. Like, maybe I could try going to the park again, or watching a nature show. Baby steps, you know? It's scary to think about, but... but I want my life back. I'm tired of feeling like a prisoner in my own mind.",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's... it's tough, I won't lie. But I think it's worth it. I mean, I've already come this far, right? And even though it's painful, I feel like I'm finally starting to understand myself better. It's like... like I'm putting the pieces of a puzzle together. I want to keep going, to see what the full picture looks like.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to work on some coping strategies. You know, for when the memories hit hard. And maybe... maybe we could talk more about that guilt. I know logically that it wasn't my fault, but emotionally... that's a different story. I'd like to work on that.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Is there anything else you'd like to add?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I guess. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but... but I feel like I'm not alone in this anymore. And that... that means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue this journey together."
