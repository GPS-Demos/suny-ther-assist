    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the scene when you witnessed the violence?",
    "Client: Okay... I was walking home from work, it was late evening. The street was dimly lit, and I could hear raised voices coming from an alley up ahead. As I got closer, I saw two men arguing. Their voices were getting louder, more aggressive. I felt my heart start to race...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Suddenly, one of the men pushed the other against the wall. I froze, not knowing what to do. The man who was pushed stumbled but then lunged forward, and I saw something glint in his hand. Oh God, it was a knife. I wanted to run, but my feet felt like lead.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The man with the knife slashed at the other one. There was a terrible scream, and I saw blood. So much blood. It was like time slowed down. I could smell the metallic scent of it in the air. I felt dizzy, nauseous. I wanted to help, but I was terrified.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: I finally managed to move. I ran to a nearby store and told them to call the police. When I went back out, the attacker was gone, and the victim was on the ground, moaning in pain. I took off my scarf and pressed it against his wound, trying to stop the bleeding. My hands were shaking so badly...",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: I kept talking to the man, telling him help was coming. But his eyes were glazing over, and I was afraid he might die right there in my arms. I felt so helpless, so scared. When the ambulance finally arrived, I was covered in his blood. I couldn't stop shaking. Even after they took him away, I just stood there, unable to move.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I... I feel shaky. My heart is racing, just like it did that night. I can still smell the blood, see the fear in that man's eyes. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) It's hard to talk about this. I've never told anyone all the details before. I keep thinking, what if I had gotten there sooner? What if I had been able to stop it somehow?",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. You did what you could.",
    "Client: I know that logically, but emotionally... I still feel guilty. And scared. Every time I walk down a street at night, I'm on edge. I keep expecting to see violence around every corner. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. You're making progress.",
    "Client: Sometimes I have nightmares about it. In my dreams, I'm the one being attacked, and no one comes to help me. I wake up in a cold sweat, feeling so alone and vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: You're not alone. We're here together.",
    "Client: Thank you. It helps to talk about it, even though it's painful. I want to move past this, to feel safe again. But it's so hard.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great strength. How are you feeling now?",

    "Therapist: Yes, that's very common. You've done well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I know we still have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe I can get through this. It won't be easy, but I'm willing to keep trying.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent attitude. We'll end here for today."
