    "Therapist: Welcome, Priya. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a mix of emotions. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is terrified of revisiting that day. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm ready. Or as ready as I'll ever be.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I'm walking down a busy street in Mumbai. It's hot, really hot. The air is thick with humidity and the smell of spices from nearby food stalls. I can hear horns honking, people shouting... it's chaotic.",
    "Therapist: Good. What time of day is it?",
    "Client: It's late afternoon. The sun is still strong, but starting to dip. I'm... I'm on my way home from work. I remember feeling tired, just wanting to get home and relax.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I notice a commotion up ahead. There's a group of people gathered around something. At first, I think it might be a street performance or maybe an accident. But as I get closer, I... oh god...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it, Priya. You're doing well. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 7. My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... As I get closer, I see... it's not a performance. There's a young girl, she can't be more than 15 or 16. She's crying, struggling against two men who are trying to force her into a van. I... I freeze. I can't believe what I'm seeing.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in that moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. Shocked. There's this sick feeling in my stomach. I want to help her, but I'm paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What's happening around you?",
    "Client: People are just... walking by. Some are watching, but no one's doing anything. I hear the girl screaming for help in Hindi. \"Bachaao! Bachaao!\" Her voice is so desperate. I... I can still hear it in my nightmares.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Priya. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to an 8. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: One of the men notices me staring. He... he looks right at me. His eyes are cold, threatening. I feel like I can't breathe. The girl is still struggling, crying. They're pushing her into the van now. I... I want to scream, to call for help, but no sound comes out.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I turn away. I'm ashamed to say it, but I just keep walking. My legs are moving on their own. I hear the van door slam shut, the engine start. I don't look back. I just... I just keep walking.",
    "Therapist: It's okay, Priya. You're safe now. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... God, I feel so guilty. So helpless. I should have done something. Anything. But I just... I just walked away.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're not responsible for what happened. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still at an 8. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a few deep breaths. Focus on the present moment.",
    "Client: *breathing deeply* Okay... I'm... I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens after you walk away?",
    "Client: I... I practically run home. I lock the door behind me and just... collapse on the floor. I'm shaking, crying. I can't get the image of that girl out of my head. Her screams... they just keep echoing in my mind.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What thoughts are going through your head?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking I should have done something. Called the police, shouted for help, anything. But I was so scared. And now... now I don't know what happened to her. Is she okay? Is she even alive? It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Priya. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 7. I'm still shaky, but... but I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's stay with this moment. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I eventually get up off the floor. I feel numb, like I'm moving in slow motion. I turn on the TV, trying to distract myself, but I can't focus. Every sound makes me jump. I keep replaying the scene in my head, thinking of all the things I could have done differently.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: Tense. So tense. My shoulders are up to my ears, my jaw is clenched. I feel like I can't relax, like I'm constantly on edge.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to release that tension. Breathe deeply.",
    "Client: *exhales slowly* It's... it's hard to let go.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Just notice the tension. What happens as the evening progresses?",
    "Client: I... I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see that girl's face. I toss and turn all night. When I finally do drift off, I have nightmares. I wake up in a cold sweat, heart pounding.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's back up to an 8. Talking about the nightmares... it brings it all back.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Priya. Remember, you're safe here. What happens the next day?",
    "Client: I... I call in sick to work. I can't face going outside. I spend the day obsessively checking news websites, looking for any reports of a kidnapping. But there's nothing. It's like... like it never happened. And that almost makes it worse.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Angry. Frustrated. I... I want to do something, anything. But I don't know what. I feel so... so powerless.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What do you do with that anger?",
    "Client: I... I start researching human trafficking. I spend hours reading about it, trying to understand. It's horrifying, but... but I can't stop. It's like I'm punishing myself, forcing myself to face the reality of what I saw.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 6. Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also... I don't know, cathartic maybe?",
    "Therapist: That's good, Priya. You're processing the experience. How do the next few days unfold?",
    "Client: I... I eventually go back to work, but I'm not really there. I'm jumpy, distracted. I take a different route home, avoiding that street. I start having panic attacks. Sometimes I'll be fine, and then suddenly I'll smell something that reminds me of that day, and I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with these moments?",
    "Client: I... I try to breathe through them. Sometimes I call a friend, just to hear another voice. But mostly, I... I isolate myself. I'm afraid to go out, afraid of what I might see. I feel... I feel like I can't trust the world anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response to trauma. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hovering around a 5. Talking about it... it's still hard, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming as it did at first.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress, Priya. How do you see this experience affecting your life now?",
    "Client: It's... it's changed everything. I'm more cautious, more aware of my surroundings. But I'm also... I don't know, more driven to make a difference. I've started volunteering with an organization that works to prevent human trafficking. It's small, but it feels like I'm doing something.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive way to channel your experience. How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's complicated. Sometimes I feel empowered, like I'm taking back control. Other times, it feels like it's never enough. But overall, I think it's helping me heal.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent, Priya. What's your SUDS level as we finish up?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 4. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, lighter somehow.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today. How are you feeling about the session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, but I think it was good. Talking about it... it's hard, but it feels like I'm finally starting to process what happened.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. We'll end here for today. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I'm starting to see that it wasn't my fault. I still wish I could have done more, but... but I understand why I reacted the way I did.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant realization, Priya. We'll continue to work on this in our next session."
