    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit jittery. I didn't sleep well last night thinking about this.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Just give me a moment to... to collect myself.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. When you're ready, close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Okay... I'm... I'm in the emergency room. The lights are so bright, and there's this constant beeping from machines. I can smell antiseptic, you know? That hospital smell. I'm sitting on this uncomfortable bed, and my whole body is just... aching.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's happening around you?",
    "Client: There are nurses rushing back and forth. I can hear them talking, but it's all jumbled. I'm... I'm holding my arm. It hurts so much. I can see bruises forming, and there's a cut on my forearm that's still bleeding a little.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably a 6? Maybe 7? My heart's racing just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: A doctor comes in. He's asking me questions, but I can barely focus. I keep seeing... seeing his face. My boyfriend's face when he... when he pushed me. (Voice trembles) I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Sarah. Take a deep breath. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see the doctor's concerned face. He's gentle as he examines my arm. I wince when he touches the bruises. God, it hurts so much. And I'm so... so ashamed. How did I let this happen?",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault, Sarah. Stay in the moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... scared. Angry. Confused. My mind keeps replaying the fight, how it escalated so quickly. I never thought he'd actually hit me, you know? (Starts crying) I trusted him...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're doing great. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to an 8. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe with me. In... and out. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Breathing steadies) Okay... okay. I'm... I'm still in the ER. The doctor is explaining that they need to do some x-rays. I'm nodding, but I barely hear him. All I can think about is how I'm going to hide this from my friends, my family. I feel so alone.",
    "Therapist: You're not alone now. Keep going. What happens after the x-rays?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm back in the exam room. The nurse comes in with some forms. She's asking if I want to file a report. I... I freeze up. I don't know what to do. Part of me wants to protect him, isn't that crazy? But I'm also terrified of what he might do if I report it.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. How are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: Overwhelmed. Scared. Like I'm at a crossroads and I don't know which way to turn. My arm is throbbing, and I just want to curl up and disappear.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What do you decide?",
    "Client: I... I tell her I need time to think. She gives me some pamphlets about domestic violence. Just seeing that term makes me feel sick. This isn't me. This isn't supposed to be my life.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Sarah. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's still high... maybe a 7? My stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take another deep breath. What happens as you're preparing to leave?",
    "Client: They're giving me care instructions, prescriptions for pain meds. I'm nodding, but it all feels surreal. Like I'm watching it happen to someone else. As I'm getting ready to leave, I see my reflection in a window. My eye is starting to swell, and there's a cut on my lip I didn't even notice before. I barely recognize myself.",
    "Therapist: That must have been shocking. How does seeing yourself make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a wake-up call. I feel angry. At him, at myself for letting it get this far. But also... determined? Like, this can't happen again. I won't let it.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I call my sister. I've been avoiding her calls all day, but I can't do this alone. My voice is shaking as I ask her to pick me up. I don't tell her why, but I think she knows something's wrong.",
    "Therapist: That took courage. How does it feel to reach out?",
    "Client: Scary. But also... a relief? Like I'm finally admitting this is real, and I need help. I'm sitting on a bench outside the ER, waiting for her. The sun is setting, and I'm watching people come and go. I wonder how many of them are here for the same reason I am.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe a 5? I feel drained, but also... I don't know, like I've taken a step towards something.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. Let's stay with this moment. What are you thinking as you wait?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about what I'm going to tell my sister. How I'm going to explain the bruises, the cuts. I'm worried she'll judge me, but I also know she loves me. I'm thinking about my boyfriend, wondering if he's tried to call, if he's sorry or angry. And I'm thinking... I'm thinking that I can't go back. This has to be the end.",
    "Therapist: Those are important realizations. How does that decision make you feel?",
    "Client: Scared. But also... relieved? Like a weight is lifting. I know it won't be easy, but for the first time in hours, I feel like I can breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. What happens when your sister arrives?",
    "Client: I see her car pull up, and my heart starts racing again. She gets out, and the moment she sees me, her face just... crumples. She runs to me, and I just break down. I'm sobbing in her arms, right there in the parking lot. I can feel people staring, but I don't care. I just let it all out.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a powerful moment. How does it feel to be held by your sister?",
    "Client: It's... it's comforting. Safe. For the first time since it happened, I feel like maybe things will be okay. She's not judging me, she's just... there. Holding me, telling me it's going to be alright.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Sarah. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 4, I think. I feel exhausted, but also... lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's stay with this moment a bit longer. What happens next?",
    "Client: My sister helps me into the car. She's asking questions, but not pushing too hard. I tell her bits and pieces as we drive. It's getting dark now, and the streetlights are coming on. I'm watching them blur past the window, feeling... I don't know, like I'm moving towards something new. Scary, but... necessary.",
    "Therapist: You're showing a lot of insight. How do you feel about the future in this moment?",
    "Client: Uncertain. Afraid. But also... hopeful? Like, for the first time in a long time, I can see a future that doesn't include him. It's terrifying, but also... freeing.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Take a few deep breaths.",
    "Client: (Deep breaths) Okay... I'm here. Back in the room with you.",
    "Therapist: Well done, Sarah. That was intense. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. Drained, but... okay. It's still hard to talk about, but it feels different now. Less overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You did excellent work today. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we end?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. I know there's still a long way to go, but I feel like I've taken a big step today.",
    "Therapist: You absolutely have. We'll continue to work through this together. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later. I'm proud of the work you did today, Sarah.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I'm starting to feel proud of myself too.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful to hear. We'll pick up here next session. Take care of yourself this week."
