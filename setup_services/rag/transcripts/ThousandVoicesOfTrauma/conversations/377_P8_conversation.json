    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. It's like I'm right back there in that moment, you know? My heart is racing, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's as if I can still hear the muffled voices outside the room where I was being held.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are coming up for you now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. There was this overwhelming sense of... of not knowing what was going to happen next. I remember thinking, \"Is this how it ends for me?\" It's strange, but I also felt a deep sadness for my family, imagining them worrying about me. And then there's this... this anger that bubbles up. Why did this have to happen to me?",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How are you experiencing those emotions in your body right now?",
    "Client: Well, the anger... it's like a heat in my stomach. It's making me feel restless, like I want to get up and pace around. But at the same time, there's this heaviness in my limbs, probably from the sadness. And the fear... it's making my mouth dry and my palms sweaty. It's almost like I'm back there, you know?",
    "Therapist: I see. What's the most vivid part of the memory for you right now?",
    "Client: The most vivid part... it's the sound of the door opening. Every time I heard that sound, my whole body would tense up. I didn't know if it meant food was coming, or if... if something worse was about to happen. It's like that sound became a trigger for instant panic. Even now, just thinking about it, I can feel my muscles tightening.",
    "Therapist: How does recalling this memory now compare to when it first happened?",
    "Client: It's... it's different. Back then, everything felt immediate and overwhelming. Now, it's like I'm watching it happen from a distance. The emotions are still intense, but I feel like I have a bit more control. I can recognize that I'm here, in this room, and that I'm safe now. But it's still hard, you know? It's like my body hasn't quite caught up with what my mind knows.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your ability to cope with these memories now?",
    "Client: I guess I'm... I'm stronger than I thought. I mean, I'm sitting here, talking about it without completely falling apart. That's something, right? But it's also frustrating. I wish I could just... move on, you know? But then I remind myself that it's a process. I'm learning to be more patient with myself, to recognize that healing takes time.",
    "Therapist: How has this experience changed your view of yourself?",
    "Client: That's a tough one. In some ways, I feel more vulnerable now. Like the world isn't as safe as I once thought it was. But on the other hand, I've discovered a resilience I didn't know I had. I survived something terrible, and I'm still here, still fighting. It's made me more aware of my own strength, but also more compassionate towards others who might be struggling. It's a strange mix of feeling both stronger and more fragile at the same time.",
    "Therapist: What helps you feel grounded when these memories surface?",
    "Client: I've found that focusing on my breath really helps. Just taking a moment to breathe deeply and remind myself that I'm here, in the present. Sometimes I'll touch something nearby - the arm of a chair or the fabric of my clothes - just to connect with the physical world around me. And, you know, talking about it like this... it helps too. It's like each time I share the story, it loses a little bit of its power over me.",
    "Therapist: How do you see this experience fitting into your broader life story?",
    "Client: I've been thinking about that a lot lately. It's... it's a part of me now, whether I like it or not. But I'm trying to see it as a chapter in my life, not the whole book. It's shaped me, sure, but it doesn't define me. I want to use this experience to become more empathetic, to maybe help others who've gone through similar things. It's like... like I'm trying to find meaning in something that seemed so senseless at the time.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to work more on coping strategies. Maybe we could explore some techniques for when I feel overwhelmed by memories or emotions? And... and maybe we could talk about how to share this experience with my family. They've been supportive, but sometimes I feel like they don't really understand what I'm going through. I want to find a way to bridge that gap, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. We'll pick up there next time.",
    "Client: Thank you. This... this isn't easy, but I feel like I'm making progress. It's slow, and sometimes it feels like two steps forward, one step back. But I'm grateful for this space to work through it all. I just hope that one day, this memory won't have such a hold on me. That I'll be able to think about it without feeling like I'm right back in that room. Is that... is that a realistic goal?",
    "Therapist: It is. We'll work towards that together.",
    "Client: Okay. That... that gives me hope. I'm trying to hold onto that hope, you know? Some days it's harder than others, but sessions like this remind me that I'm not alone in this journey. It's exhausting, reliving these memories, but I can also feel that it's... it's necessary. Like I'm slowly untangling a knot inside me. I just need to remember to be patient with myself, right?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. You're doing great. We'll continue next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'll see you then. And... and thank you for listening, for helping me make sense of all this. It means more than I can express."
