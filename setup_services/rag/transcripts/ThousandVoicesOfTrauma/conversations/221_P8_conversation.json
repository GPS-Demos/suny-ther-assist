    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I'm back there, you know? The sounds of the protests, the shouting, the chaos. I can still smell the tear gas.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's like this cold grip around my chest. I keep thinking about how quickly things escalated. One minute we were peacefully protesting, and the next... it was just chaos. I can't shake the image of the officer raising his baton.",
    "Therapist: How does that fear manifest in your body?",
    "Client: My muscles are tense, especially in my shoulders and jaw. I feel like I can't catch my breath properly. There's this knot in my stomach that won't go away. It's like my body is preparing to run or fight, even though I know I'm safe here.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"This isn't right. This isn't what I signed up for when I joined the military.\" I went from defending my country to feeling threatened by the very people who are supposed to protect us. It's... it's a betrayal, you know? And I feel so helpless. I was trained to handle combat situations, but this... this was different.",
    "Therapist: How does that sense of helplessness compare to your experiences in combat?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually worse in some ways. In combat, I had my training, my unit, my weapons. But here, I was just a civilian. I couldn't fight back, couldn't protect myself or others. It makes me angry, you know? And ashamed. I should have been able to do something.",
    "Therapist: What do you mean by \"should have been able to do something\"?",
    "Client: I... I guess I feel like I failed. As a veteran, I'm supposed to be brave, to protect people. But in that moment, I was just as scared and helpless as everyone else. I couldn't stop the police from hurting peaceful protesters. I couldn't even protect myself. It's like... like all my training meant nothing in that moment.",
    "Therapist: How does that belief impact you now?",
    "Client: It makes me doubt myself. I used to feel confident in my abilities, but now... now I'm always on edge. I avoid crowds, I'm suspicious of police. I feel like I can't trust my own judgment anymore. And it's affecting my work, my relationships. I'm pushing people away because I don't want them to see how broken I feel.",
    "Therapist: What do you think would happen if others saw that part of you?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me thinks they'd lose respect for me. That they'd see me as weak or a failure. But another part... another part of me wonders if maybe they'd understand. Maybe they'd even relate. I don't know. It's scary to even think about opening up like that.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to share these thoughts with me now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of things. There's relief, like I'm finally letting out something I've been holding in for so long. But there's also fear. I'm worried about being judged, even though I know that's not your role. And there's sadness too. Saying it all out loud makes it feel more real, you know? It's like I'm finally admitting to myself how much this has affected me.",
    "Therapist: What's the hardest part about admitting that impact?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's accepting that I'm not as invincible as I thought I was. For so long, I've prided myself on being strong, on being able to handle anything. But this experience... it shattered that illusion. It's forcing me to confront my own vulnerability, and that's terrifying. It's like I don't know who I am anymore without that armor of invincibility.",
    "Therapist: How might accepting that vulnerability change things for you?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me thinks it would be freeing, you know? To not have to pretend to be strong all the time. But it's also scary. If I'm not the tough, unbreakable veteran, then who am I? And how do I navigate the world without that identity to protect me? It's like... like I'm learning to walk all over again, but without the safety net I've always relied on.",
    "Therapist: What would it look like to start building a new safety net?",
    "Client: I... I guess it would start with being more honest. With myself and with others. Maybe... maybe reaching out to other veterans who've had similar experiences. Or joining a support group for protesters affected by police brutality. It's scary to think about, but... but maybe sharing my story could help others feel less alone. And maybe it could help me feel less alone too.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... it's both exciting and terrifying. The thought of connecting with others who understand... it's appealing. But it also means being vulnerable, admitting that I'm struggling. It's a big step. But... but maybe it's a necessary one. I'm tired of feeling isolated, of carrying this burden alone. Maybe... maybe it's time to try a different approach.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you could take in that direction?",
    "Client: I... I think I could start by looking up local support groups. Just looking, not necessarily committing to anything yet. Or maybe... maybe I could reach out to one of my old military buddies. Someone I trust. Just to test the waters, see how it feels to open up a little. It's not much, but... but it's a start, right?",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that plan?",
    "Client: I feel... cautiously optimistic, I guess. It's scary, but there's also a sense of hope. Like maybe this could be the beginning of something better. It's a small step, but it feels like a step in the right direction. And honestly... it feels good to have a plan, to feel like I'm taking some control back.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling a bit lighter, actually. Talking about all this, making a plan... it's like I've set down a heavy weight I've been carrying. I'm still anxious, still scared, but... but there's a glimmer of hope now. And I'm realizing that maybe I'm stronger than I thought. Not in the way I used to define strength, but in my ability to face this, to talk about it, to consider change. That's... that's its own kind of strength, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How would you like to close our session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to take a moment to just breathe. To sit with this new feeling, this mix of hope and anxiety and possibility. And maybe... maybe to thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's been hard, but... but I think it's been important. I feel like I've taken a step forward today, even if it's just a small one.",
