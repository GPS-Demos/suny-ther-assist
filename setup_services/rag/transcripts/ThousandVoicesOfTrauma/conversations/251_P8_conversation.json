    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing but also blank at the same time. I can feel my heart pounding, and there's this tightness in my chest. The memories... they felt so real, like I was right back there in the middle of it all.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: (exhales slowly) It's... it's the sounds. The shouting, the sirens, the chaos. I keep hearing them echoing in my head. And I can't shake this feeling of... helplessness. Like I'm frozen, watching everything unfold around me, but I can't do anything to stop it.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking. I... I can feel the adrenaline coursing through my body, just like that day. It's like my body is preparing for a fight that's not even happening. And there's this overwhelming sense of anger and injustice. Why did it have to happen like that? Why couldn't they just listen?",
    "Therapist: How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a fire in my stomach. Hot and intense. But it's mixed with this deep sadness too. I feel it in my throat, like I want to scream and cry at the same time. It's just... it's not fair. None of it is fair.",
    "Therapist: You're processing a lot. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how different things could have been if... if the police had just taken a moment to listen, to understand. I wonder if I could have done something differently, said something to de-escalate the situation. But then I remind myself that it wasn't my fault. I didn't cause this. But still, the guilt creeps in, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. How do you feel about those thoughts now?",
    "Client: It's... it's complicated. Part of me knows logically that I couldn't have changed anything. But there's still this nagging voice that says maybe if I had been braver, or smarter, or... I don't know. It's exhausting, constantly second-guessing everything. And then I feel angry at myself for even thinking that way because I know it's not productive.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I think I need reassurance. That it's okay to feel this way, that healing takes time. And maybe... maybe some hope that it won't always feel this intense. That one day, I'll be able to think about what happened without feeling like I'm right back there in the middle of it all.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid needs. How can we work towards that?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe by continuing to face these memories head-on, like we're doing now. It's hard, and it hurts, but I think it's helping. And maybe by reminding myself that my reactions are normal, that I'm not weak for struggling with this. I want to learn how to be kinder to myself, I guess.",
    "Therapist: That's a great insight. What else?",
    "Client: I think I also need to find ways to channel this anger and sadness into something positive. Maybe getting involved in community activism or support groups for others who've been through similar experiences. I don't want what happened to define me, but I also don't want to forget it or pretend it didn't happen.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea make you feel?",
    "Client: It makes me feel... hopeful, I think. Like maybe there's a way to turn this pain into something meaningful. But it's also a little scary. Opening up to others, being vulnerable... it's not easy for me. Especially after everything that's happened. But I want to try. I want to believe that there's still good in the world, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's your next step?",
    "Client: I think... I think I want to start small. Maybe look into local support groups or community organizations. Just to see what's out there. And I want to keep working on processing these memories, as hard as it is. Because I can feel that it's helping, even if it doesn't always feel like it in the moment.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. Emotionally drained. But there's also this strange sense of... I don't know, accomplishment? Like I've faced something really difficult and come out the other side. It's not easy, and I know there's still a long way to go, but I feel like I've taken a step forward today. And that feels good, even amidst all the other complicated emotions.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. This was intense, but... good. Thank you for guiding me through it. I know it's not easy to hear all this either, so I appreciate your support. I'm looking forward to our next session, even though I know it'll be challenging. But I feel like I'm starting to see a path forward, you know? It's faint, and there are still a lot of obstacles, but it's there. And that gives me hope.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Take care."
