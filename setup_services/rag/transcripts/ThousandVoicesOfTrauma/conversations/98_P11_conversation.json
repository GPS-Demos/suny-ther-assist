    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, John?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. But also... maybe a little relieved? It's weird. I didn't think I could actually get through talking about that memory without completely falling apart.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The guilt, I think. Reliving that moment when I froze... I couldn't protect myself. I've always blamed myself for not fighting back harder. But now, I'm starting to wonder if maybe... maybe it wasn't my fault after all? I don't know. It's confusing.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant realization. How does it feel to consider that perspective?",
    "Client: It's... liberating, in a way. But also terrifying. If it wasn't my fault, then I have to face the fact that sometimes bad things just happen, and we can't always control them. That's a scary thought. But it also means I don't have to carry this weight of guilt anymore. I'm not sure I know how to let it go, though.",
    "Therapist: It's a process. What else did you notice during the exposure?",
    "Client: The fear. God, the fear was overwhelming. I could feel it in my chest, like I couldn't breathe. But... I got through it. I didn't think I could, but I did. And now, talking about it, I feel... stronger, somehow. Like if I could face that memory, maybe I can face other things too.",
    "Therapist: That's powerful. How might this relate to your current struggles?",
    "Client: I think... maybe it's connected to my anxiety about my relationship. I've always been so scared of being vulnerable, of being hurt again. But if I could face this memory, maybe I can start opening up more to my partner. Maybe I don't have to always be on guard.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful connection. What's one small step you could take?",
    "Client: I could... maybe try to share something small with my partner tonight. Something I've been keeping to myself. It's scary, but I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: That's brave. How do you feel about continuing with the exposures?",
    "Client: Honestly? Terrified. But also... determined. I want my life back. I want to feel safe in my own skin again. So yeah, I'm in. It's hard, but I think it's worth it.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Shall we schedule our next session?",
    "Client: Yes, please. And... thank you. For helping me through this. I know it's your job, but... it means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, John. Your hard work is making the difference."
