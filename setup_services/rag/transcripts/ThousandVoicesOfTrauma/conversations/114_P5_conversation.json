    "Therapist: Welcome, John. Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm honestly pretty nervous. I've been dreading this since you mentioned it last week. The idea of reliving those bullying experiences... it's making my stomach churn. And with all the recent news about police brutality, I'm feeling even more on edge. Is this really necessary?",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... I've spent so long trying to forget those memories. The thought of purposely bringing them back up feels counterintuitive. And I'm worried about how I'll react. What if I completely fall apart? Or what if it makes my anxiety worse? I'm already struggling to keep it together with all the stress from my studies and living alone.",
    "Therapist: I understand. How do you think this might help?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe it could help me process what happened? But I'm not sure. It feels like opening Pandora's box. And with everything going on in the news about police brutality, it's bringing up a lot of feelings about powerlessness and fear that I experienced during the bullying. I'm just not sure I'm ready to face all of that.",
    "Therapist: Your hesitation is normal. How can I support you?",
    "Client: I think I just need reassurance that you'll be here with me through it. And maybe some explanation about how this is supposed to help? I mean, I trust you, but it's hard to wrap my head around how reliving trauma could be beneficial. Also, what exactly am I supposed to do during this exposure?",
    "Therapist: I'll guide you through it. What do you hope to gain?",
    "Client: I suppose I'm hoping to feel less controlled by these memories. It would be nice to not have them pop up unexpectedly and derail my day. And maybe... maybe I could feel stronger, knowing I can face these memories and get through them. But it's scary to think about. How long will this process take? Will I have to do this multiple times?",
    "Therapist: It's a process. Shall we start with a brief exercise?",
    "Client: Okay, I think I can handle that. A brief exercise sounds less daunting. What do I need to do? And what should I expect to feel? I'm still pretty nervous about this whole thing.",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes. Breathe deeply. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Alright, I'm closing my eyes. My heart's racing a bit, but I'm trying to breathe deeply like you said. I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. What's next?"
