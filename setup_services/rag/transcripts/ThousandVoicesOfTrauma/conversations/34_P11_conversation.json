    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Chen?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's hard to revisit those memories of being bullied because of my race. I can still hear their taunts and see their mocking faces. It's like I'm back in that school hallway, feeling so small and helpless.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really difficult. What stood out to you most about revisiting that experience?",
    "Client: The overwhelming sense of isolation, I think. Even though it happened decades ago, I can still feel how alone I felt. No one stood up for me, not even the teachers. It's like I was invisible, except when they wanted to make fun of me.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. My heart was racing, and I felt that familiar knot in my stomach. But... it's strange. It wasn't as overwhelming as I thought it would be. I mean, it was still hard, but I felt more in control this time.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant observation. What do you make of that?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... maybe I'm starting to see that memory as just that - a memory. It's not happening to me right now. I'm safe here, even when I remember those painful moments.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How does this connect to your everyday life?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe it means I don't have to be so afraid of those memories anymore. They've been controlling me for so long, making me anxious in social situations, especially around non-Asian people. But if I can face them here and survive, maybe I can face other challenges too.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent connection. How might this affect your goals moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I might be ready to push myself a bit more. Maybe try that community art class I've been avoiding. I've always loved painting, but I've been too scared to join a group. Now, I feel like I might be able to handle it, even if I feel anxious at first.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great step. What else comes to mind?",
    "Client: Well, I've been thinking about my granddaughter. She's starting school soon, and I've been so worried about her experiencing what I did. But now, I'm wondering if I could use my experience to help her be stronger. Maybe teach her to be proud of her heritage instead of ashamed like I was.",
    "Therapist: That's a wonderful idea. How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: It makes me feel... hopeful, I guess. And a little scared too. But mostly, I feel like I have a purpose. Like maybe all this pain wasn't for nothing if I can use it to help her.",
    "Therapist: That's really powerful. What do you think helped you get to this point?",
    "Client: I think... it's been the consistent work we've been doing. Facing these memories head-on instead of avoiding them. And... your support, honestly. Knowing that someone believes in me and doesn't judge me for my struggles. It's made a big difference.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad you feel supported. What's your takeaway from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I'm stronger than I realized. These memories are painful, but they don't have to control my life anymore. I can face them, process them, and maybe even use them to help others. It's not easy, but I'm starting to believe it's possible.",
    "Therapist: That's an incredible insight. How do you want to build on this?",
    "Client: I want to keep pushing forward. Maybe we could work on some strategies for handling anxiety in social situations? And I'd like to start planning how I might approach that art class. Baby steps, but... I feel ready to take them.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a solid plan. Shall we focus on that next time?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be really helpful. Thank you for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I'm starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work. We'll continue next session."
