    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. But at the same time, there's this weird sense of relief? Like, I got through it, you know? It's hard to put into words.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sound of the crash. It was so loud in my head, even though it was just a memory. I could hear the screeching tires, the crunch of metal... and then the silence right after. That moment of silence before people started screaming and car alarms went off. It's like time stood still for a second.",
    "Therapist: How did reliving that moment make you feel?",
    "Client: Terrified, at first. My palms got all sweaty, and I felt like I couldn't breathe. But as I kept going through it, something shifted. It's like... I realized I was here, safe, talking to you. The fear was still there, but it wasn't as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant observation. How does this compare to your daily experiences?",
    "Client: Well, usually when I think about the accident or see something that reminds me of it, I completely freeze up. I can't function. But this time, even though it was intense, I felt more... I don't know, more in control? Like I could observe the memory without getting completely lost in it.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress, Sarah. What do you make of that difference?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe it's because I knew what to expect this time? Or because you were here guiding me through it? It's still scary, but it feels a little less like this big, uncontrollable thing looming over me.",
    "Therapist: How might this experience impact your day-to-day life?",
    "Client: That's a good question. I think... maybe I'll be less afraid of my own thoughts? Like, if I can face the worst of it here and survive, then maybe the random flashbacks won't be so terrifying. And maybe I'll be able to drive again someday without panicking.",
    "Therapist: That's a hopeful perspective. What was most challenging today?",
    "Client: Definitely the part where I described the injured people. Seeing their faces in my mind, remembering how helpless I felt... that was tough. I wanted to stop, to run away from the memory. But I kept going, and... I made it through.",
    "Therapist: You showed real courage. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's scary, but... I want to keep going. I'm tired of letting this control my life. Today was hard, but I feel like I've taken a step forward, you know? Like maybe there's light at the end of this tunnel after all.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... maybe we could work on the aftermath? Like, dealing with the police report and the hospital visits. That still gives me a lot of anxiety, especially when I have to talk to insurance companies or doctors.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Any final thoughts about today's session?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For being here, for guiding me through this. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe I can actually get through this. It's a small step, but it feels important.",
    "Therapist: It is important, Sarah. You've done great work today. How will you take care of yourself for the rest of the day?",
    "Client: I think I'll call my sister. She's been really supportive through all of this. And maybe take a long bath, try to relax a bit. Oh, and I'll do those breathing exercises you taught me if I start feeling anxious again.",
    "Therapist: Those all sound like excellent ideas. I'm proud of your progress today, Sarah."
