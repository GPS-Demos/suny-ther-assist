    "Therapist: Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: I'm not sure, to be honest. I've been dreading this part. The idea of reliving that day... it's terrifying. Can you tell me more about what to expect?",
    "Therapist: Of course. It's natural to feel apprehensive. Imaginal exposure helps process traumatic memories. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about losing control. What if I can't handle it? And... I don't want to disappoint you if I can't go through with it.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace, and you're in control. There's no disappointment here. How else can I support you?",
    "Client: That helps, thank you. I guess I'm wondering how this will actually help me. It seems counterintuitive to deliberately think about something I've been trying to avoid for so long.",
    "Therapist: Great question. Avoidance often maintains PTSD symptoms. Exposure helps your brain process the memory. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It makes sense, but it's still scary. I keep thinking about that day, seeing my brother... (voice breaks) I'm sorry, it's just so hard to talk about.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. Your emotions are completely understandable. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: Just... maybe a moment to collect myself. (deep breath) Okay. I think I'm ready to try. But what if I start panicking during the exercise?",
    "Therapist: We have strategies in place. We can pause, use grounding techniques. Remember, you're safe here. How does that reassure you?",
    "Client: It helps. I appreciate your patience. I know this is important for my healing, but it's so difficult to face. The police brutality my brother experienced... it's changed everything.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. This work isn't easy, but it's crucial. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm ready. But can we start slowly? And if I need to stop, that's okay, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll start gently and you can stop anytime. How would you like to begin?",
    "Client: Maybe... could you guide me through some breathing exercises first? Just to help me feel more centered before we start?",
    "Therapist: Excellent suggestion. Let's do that now. Follow my lead..."
