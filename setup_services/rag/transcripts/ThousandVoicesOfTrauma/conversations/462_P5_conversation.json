    "Therapist: Welcome back, Arjun. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Patel. I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been thinking a lot about our last session and the cult experiences we discussed.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. Are you ready to learn more?",
    "Client: I think so. But to be honest, I'm not sure what to expect. Can you explain what imaginal exposure is exactly?",
    "Therapist: Of course. It's a technique where you'll revisit your cult experiences in your mind, describing them out loud. This helps process the trauma.",
    "Client: That sounds... intense. I'm not sure if I can handle reliving those memories. What if I panic or lose control?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace, and I'll be here to support you throughout. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It's reassuring to know you'll be here. But I'm still worried about how I'll feel afterward. Will this make my depression worse?",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel apprehensive. Many find it challenging at first, but it often leads to symptom improvement. Shall we discuss coping strategies?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think that would help me feel more prepared. I've been using some breathing techniques we talked about before, but I'm not sure if they'll be enough for this.",
    "Therapist: Those techniques are a great start. We can also establish a safe word if you need a break. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's a good idea. Maybe we could use \"pause\" as the safe word? It feels less... dramatic than \"stop,\" if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: \"Pause\" works well. Remember, you're in control. What other concerns do you have?",
    "Client: I'm worried about how detailed I need to be. There are some parts of my experience that I've never told anyone, not even my wife. Do I have to share everything?",
    "Therapist: You decide how much to share. The goal is to process the trauma, not to force disclosure. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: That's a relief. I think I can handle sharing more now, knowing I have some control over the process. It's still scary, but I feel a bit more prepared.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. This work is challenging but can lead to significant healing. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think I am. Thank you for explaining everything and addressing my concerns. It means a lot to have your support through this. I know it won't be easy, but I'm hopeful that it will help me move forward from these experiences. I've carried them for so long, and the weight of keeping everything inside has been overwhelming. Even though I'm nervous, I'm also feeling a glimmer of hope that this might be a turning point for me.",
    "Therapist: Your resilience is inspiring. Shall we start with a grounding exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, that sounds good. I could use something to help center myself before we dive in. What kind of grounding exercise did you have in mind?",
    "Therapist: Let's try a brief sensory awareness exercise. Can you name five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: Okay, I can do that. I see... the green plant in the corner, your desk lamp, the abstract painting on the wall, the tissue box, and the window with raindrops on it. That does help me feel more present.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Now, are you ready to begin the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm still nervous, but I feel more grounded now. Where should I start? Should I begin with my first day in the cult, or is there a specific point you want me to focus on?",
    "Therapist: Start wherever feels right for you. Remember, we can pause anytime.",
    "Client: Alright. I think I'll start with the day I first arrived at the compound. It was a sunny day, which seems ironic now considering how dark things became..."
