    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not really sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart is still racing, and I feel kind of dizzy. The memories were so vivid this time, like I was right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I think. No, maybe more like... terror. It's like my body is frozen, but my mind is screaming to run away. I can still hear the gunshots and smell the smoke from the burning buildings. It's so real.",
    "Therapist: And what thoughts are accompanying that terror?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"I'm not safe. It's going to happen again.\" I know I'm here in your office, but part of me is still there, waiting for the next attack. I feel so helpless, like I did back then.",
    "Therapist: How does that helplessness manifest in your body?",
    "Client: My muscles are all tense, especially in my shoulders and jaw. I'm clenching my fists without even realizing it. And there's this heavy feeling in my chest, like I can't breathe properly. It's like I'm ready to fight or run at any moment.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I... I feel guilty. There were so many people I couldn't help. Women and children being taken away, and I just stood there, paralyzed. I should have done something, anything. But I was too scared. And now, even here, safe in Australia, I still feel like a coward for not doing more.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt connect to your present life?",
    "Client: I guess... it makes me push myself really hard now. I volunteer at the refugee center, I'm always trying to help others. It's like I'm trying to make up for what I couldn't do back then. But it never feels like enough. And it's affecting my marriage too. I have trouble letting my guard down, even with my husband.",
    "Therapist: What comes up for you when you think about letting your guard down?",
    "Client: Panic, honestly. The idea of being vulnerable terrifies me. What if something happens and I'm not prepared? But at the same time, I'm so tired of always being on edge. I want to feel safe, to trust that the war is over and I'm not in danger anymore. But it's like my body and mind won't let me believe it.",
    "Therapist: How does this impact your day-to-day life?",
    "Client: It's exhausting. I have trouble sleeping, always waking up from nightmares. I struggle to concentrate at work and school. And I feel so disconnected from people around me, like they could never understand what I've been through. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel normal again.",
    "Therapist: What does \"normal\" mean to you in this context?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. I guess being able to relax, to enjoy simple things without constantly looking over my shoulder. To not feel guilty for surviving when so many others didn't. To be able to plan for the future without fear that everything could be taken away in an instant.",
    "Therapist: How do these experiences relate to your depression?",
    "Client: They're definitely connected. The constant fear and guilt, feeling isolated... it all feeds into this deep sadness. Some days it's hard to even get out of bed. I feel hopeless, like I'll never escape the shadow of what happened. And then I feel guilty for feeling depressed when I should be grateful to be alive and safe.",
    "Therapist: What gives you hope in those moments?",
    "Client: That's... that's a tough question. I guess... small moments of connection. When I'm able to help someone at the refugee center and see a glimmer of hope in their eyes. Or when my husband holds me after a nightmare without asking questions. Those moments remind me that there's still good in the world, that maybe healing is possible.",
    "Therapist: How does that possibility of healing feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like a tiny warmth in my chest. A moment where the tightness eases just a bit. My breathing gets a little easier. It doesn't last long, but it's... it's something to hold onto. A reminder that maybe, just maybe, I can get through this.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to work on ways to ground myself when the memories and fear become overwhelming. And maybe... maybe start talking about how to share some of this with my husband. I'm scared, but I think I need to let someone in if I want to truly heal.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Still shaky, but... a bit lighter, I think. Talking about it, even though it's hard, helps make it feel less overwhelming. Thank you for listening and for helping me make sense of all this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll end here for today. Take care of yourself."
