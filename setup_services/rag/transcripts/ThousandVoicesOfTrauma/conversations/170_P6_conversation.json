    "Therapist: Alright, Rajesh, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember to describe the car accident in detail, as if it's happening now. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Before we begin, what's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: I'd say it's about a 4 out of 10. My hands are a little clammy.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath and start when you're ready.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm driving home from work. It's late, around 9 PM. The road is dark, and there's a light drizzle. I'm tired after a long day at the office. I'm thinking about the dinner my wife promised to keep warm for me. Suddenly, I see headlights in my rearview mirror. They're coming up fast, too fast. My heart starts racing. I grip the steering wheel tighter. The car behind me is swerving. I try to move to the side, but it's too late. There's a loud crash, and my car spins. I feel a sharp pain in my chest as the airbag deploys. The world is spinning, and I can smell burning rubber and gasoline.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 7. My heart is pounding, and I feel sweaty.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The car finally stops spinning. I'm disoriented, everything hurts. I hear someone shouting, but it sounds far away. I try to move, but my leg is trapped. Panic sets in. What if the car catches fire? I can't get out. I'm struggling to breathe. The smell of gasoline is overwhelming. I hear sirens in the distance, but they seem so far away. Will they get here in time? I'm thinking about my wife, my children. What if I never see them again?",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I'm at a 9. My chest feels tight. It's hard to breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Try some deep breaths. You're doing great.",
    "Client: (takes a few deep breaths) Okay... I'm trying. The paramedics arrive. They're talking to me, but I can barely focus. They're using some tool to cut me out of the car. The sound is deafening. I feel a sharp pain as they move me onto a stretcher. Everything's a blur of lights and noise. I keep asking about the other driver, but no one answers. In the ambulance, I'm fighting to stay conscious. The paramedic is saying something about internal bleeding. I'm terrified. I don't want to die.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's still at a 9. My hands are shaking. I can almost smell the hospital.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're safe here. Keep going if you can.",
    "Client: At the hospital, everything is chaos. Doctors and nurses everywhere. They're cutting off my clothes, sticking needles in me. I hear someone say \"collapsed lung.\" The pain is excruciating. I'm trying to ask about my family, but no one's listening. I'm scared and alone. Then everything goes black. When I wake up, I'm in a hospital room. My wife is there, crying. I try to speak, but I can't. There's a tube in my throat. I feel helpless, trapped all over again.",
    "Therapist: Take a breath. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm at an 8. My throat feels tight, like the tube is still there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here now, safe.",
    "Client: (nods) The next few days are a blur of pain and medication. I keep having nightmares about the crash. Every time I close my eyes, I see those headlights coming at me. The doctors tell me I'm lucky to be alive, but I don't feel lucky. I feel broken. When I finally go home, I can't bring myself to get in a car. The thought of driving terrifies me. I feel like a burden to my family. My business is suffering because I can't work. I'm angry at the other driver, at myself for not reacting faster. Sometimes I wish I hadn't survived.",
    "Therapist: I hear your pain. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 7. I feel drained, but also... relieved somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's common. You've been very brave. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... lighter? Like I've let something go. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You've done excellent work today, Rajesh."
