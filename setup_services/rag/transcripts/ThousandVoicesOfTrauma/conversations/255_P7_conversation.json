    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Can you describe the traumatic event?",
    "Client: Okay... I was at the hospital for a routine check-up. Everything seemed normal at first, but then I heard shouting from the hallway. I remember feeling my heart start to race...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: I saw a man burst into the waiting room. He was yelling and waving something in his hand. It took me a moment to realize it was a knife. I froze in my seat, unable to move or speak. The receptionist tried to calm him down, but he lunged at her...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What did you see?",
    "Client: I... I saw the knife connect with her arm. There was blood, so much blood. She screamed, and I felt like I couldn't breathe. I wanted to help, but I was paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Security guards rushed in, tackling the man to the ground. But I couldn't stop staring at the receptionist. She was clutching her arm, and there was blood seeping through her fingers. I felt so helpless, so useless...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The room was chaos. People were crying, shouting, trying to leave. I remember the smell of antiseptic mixed with the metallic scent of blood. It made me nauseous. I wanted to run, but my legs wouldn't move.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. What happened next?",
    "Client: A nurse came to help the receptionist. She was trying to stop the bleeding, but her hands were shaking. I could see the fear in her eyes. It made everything feel so much more real, so much more terrifying.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel scared. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I finally managed to stand up, but my legs felt like jelly. I stumbled towards the exit, desperate to get away. But as I reached the door, I heard more shouting. The man had broken free and was coming towards me with the knife...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing well.",
    "Client: I felt the blade graze my arm as I tried to dodge. The pain was sharp, but the fear was overwhelming. I thought I was going to die right there in that hospital waiting room.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Security tackled him again, this time more forcefully. I slid down the wall, clutching my arm. The cut wasn't deep, but I couldn't stop shaking. A doctor came to check on me, but all I could focus on was the man being restrained on the floor, still shouting and struggling.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. Scared. But also... I don't know. Maybe a little stronger? Like I can face this memory without completely falling apart.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to talk about, but it feels a little less overwhelming each time. I just wish I could shake this feeling of helplessness that comes with the memory.",
    "Therapist: It's a process. You're making great strides.",
    "Client: I suppose so. It's just... I keep thinking about what I could have done differently. Should I have tried to help the receptionist? Should I have run sooner? I feel guilty for being so paralyzed by fear.",
    "Therapist: Those thoughts are normal. Be kind to yourself.",
    "Client: You're right. I know logically that there wasn't much I could have done. But emotionally, it's hard to accept. I keep replaying those moments in my head, wondering if I could have changed the outcome somehow.",
    "Therapist: Your reactions were natural. You survived.",
    "Client: I did survive. And I guess that's what matters in the end. It's just hard to shake the feeling that I should have done more. But I'm trying to be easier on myself. This therapy is helping me see things from a different perspective.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... tired, but also a bit lighter. Like I've released some of the weight I've been carrying. It's still painful to remember, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming as it used to. I think I'm starting to accept that my reactions were normal, even if they weren't heroic.",
    "Therapist: Excellent insight. You've done well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your guidance through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm making progress. I'm learning to face these memories without letting them control me. It's a slow process, but I'm beginning to see a light at the end of the tunnel.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself. Let's end here.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you again. I'm looking forward to our next session, even though I know it will be challenging. I feel like I'm finally starting to move forward instead of being stuck in that moment. It's a good feeling, despite the difficulty of the process."
