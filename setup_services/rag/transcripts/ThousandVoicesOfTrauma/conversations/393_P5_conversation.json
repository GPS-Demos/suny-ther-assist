    "Therapist: Good morning, Mr. Johnson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Good morning, Doctor. I'm... I'm alright, I suppose. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. My arthritis is acting up a bit too, which doesn't help my mood.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's discuss today's session.",
    "Client: Okay... I've been dreading this, to be honest. The idea of reliving those memories... it's terrifying. I've spent decades trying to forget.",
    "Therapist: Your fear is normal. Imaginal exposure helps process trauma.",
    "Client: Process trauma? I'm not sure I follow. How does putting myself through that pain again help anything?",
    "Therapist: It allows you to confront and reprocess the memory safely.",
    "Client: Safely? There's nothing safe about those memories, Doctor. They've haunted me my entire life. They've affected my relationships, my work... even led to my divorce. How can revisiting them be safe?",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. I'm here to support you.",
    "Client: I appreciate that, but... God, I'm 70 years old. Isn't it too late for this? Shouldn't I just try to enjoy my retirement instead of dredging up the past?",
    "Therapist: It's never too late for healing. This can improve your quality of life.",
    "Client: Improve my quality of life? That's... well, that's something to consider. I've been struggling with depression for so long. Do you really think this could help with that too?",
    "Therapist: Yes, addressing trauma often helps alleviate depression symptoms.",
    "Client: I see. Well, that's certainly motivating. But what exactly will happen during this... imaginal exposure? Will I have to describe everything in detail?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the memory. I'll guide you through it supportively.",
    "Client: That sounds intense. I'm worried I might break down or... I don't know, have some sort of panic attack. What happens if it becomes too much?",
    "Therapist: We can pause anytime. Your safety and comfort are priorities.",
    "Client: Okay, that's reassuring. I suppose I should also ask... what are the expected outcomes? What should I be hoping to achieve through this?",
    "Therapist: Reduced PTSD symptoms and better emotional processing of the memory.",
    "Client: I see. That would be... well, that would be life-changing, to be honest. I've carried this burden for so long. The idea of it having less power over me is appealing, but also hard to imagine.",
    "Therapist: It's a courageous step. How are you feeling about starting?",
    "Client: I'm still nervous, but... I think I'm ready. Or as ready as I'll ever be. Your confidence in this process helps. I trust you, Doctor. Let's... let's give it a try.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. We'll begin slowly. Remember, you're in control.",
    "Client: Alright. I appreciate your guidance and support. I guess there's no time like the present, even at my age, to face these demons. Let's proceed."
