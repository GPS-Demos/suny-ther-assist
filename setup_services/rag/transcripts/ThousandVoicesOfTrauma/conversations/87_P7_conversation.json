    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Can you describe the home invasion incident?",
    "Client: Alright... It was a quiet evening, around 9 PM. I was watching TV in my living room when I heard a strange noise coming from the kitchen. At first, I thought it might be the wind, but then I heard it again, louder this time. My heart started racing...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: I got up slowly, trying not to make any noise. As I approached the kitchen, I saw a shadow moving. That's when I realized someone was in my house. I froze, unable to move or breathe. The intruder was a tall man, dressed in dark clothes. He turned and saw me...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What happened next?",
    "Client: He lunged at me. I tried to run, but my legs felt like lead. I stumbled and fell, hitting my head on the corner of the coffee table. The pain was sharp, and I felt dizzy. I could hear him coming closer...",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: I managed to crawl behind the couch, hoping he wouldn't find me. I could hear him ransacking the house, opening drawers, throwing things around. Every sound made me flinch. I was trembling uncontrollably, trying to hold my breath...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How were you feeling?",
    "Client: Terrified. Absolutely terrified. I thought I was going to die. I kept thinking about my late wife, wishing she was there with me. Then I heard him enter the living room...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: He was so close. I could hear his breathing. Suddenly, he grabbed my ankle and pulled me out from behind the couch. I screamed, trying to fight him off, but he was much stronger. He had a knife...",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The knife... it glinted in the dim light. He held it to my throat and demanded money and valuables. I couldn't speak, I was paralyzed with fear. He started shouting, pressing the knife harder...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing well.",
    "Client: I managed to stammer out where I kept some cash. He dragged me to my bedroom, keeping the knife at my back. I fumbled with the drawer, my hands shaking so badly I could barely open it...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: After he took the money, he shoved me to the ground. I thought it was over, but then he started tying my hands with a cord from my bedside lamp. I felt so helpless, so vulnerable...",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel that way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: He left me there, tied up on the floor. I could hear him continuing to search the house. Every minute felt like an hour. I was sure he would come back and kill me. The fear was overwhelming...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How did it end?",
    "Client: Eventually, I heard the front door slam. The house went quiet, but I was too afraid to move. I lay there for hours, unable to free myself, terrified he might come back. It wasn't until morning when my neighbor noticed my door ajar and found me...",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Drained... and still scared. Talking about it brings it all back. I can almost feel the knife at my throat again. But... I guess I also feel a bit relieved to have shared it.",
    "Therapist: That's completely normal. You did very well today.",
    "Client: Thank you... It's still hard to believe it happened to me. I used to feel so safe in my home. Now, every little noise at night makes me jump. I've been drinking more to help me sleep, but it doesn't really help...",
    "Therapist: We'll work on coping strategies. You're not alone in this.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. Sometimes I feel so isolated, especially living alone now. I miss my wife terribly. She would've known how to comfort me. Now, I just feel... lost.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable. We'll address these feelings together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I hope I can find a way to feel safe again. This fear... it's exhausting. But talking about it, even though it's hard, makes me feel like maybe there's hope.",
    "Therapist: There absolutely is. You've taken an important step today."
