    "Therapist: Alright, Maria. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's perfectly normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day...",
    "Client: Okay... I'm at home, watching TV. The phone rings. It's my daughter. She's crying... I can barely understand her. She says, \"Mom, there's been an accident. Dad's plane...\" My heart starts racing. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 6? I feel anxious just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I remember asking her to slow down. To explain. She tells me the plane crashed shortly after takeoff. No survivors. I... I dropped the phone. My legs gave out. I collapsed on the floor, screaming. I couldn't believe it. My ex-husband, the father of my children... gone. Just like that.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's higher now. Maybe an 8. My hands are shaking. I feel that same tightness in my chest.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep going if you can.",
    "Client: I... I remember the next few hours were a blur. My son came over. We sat together, crying. I kept hoping it was a mistake. That they'd call back and say they were wrong. But... but they didn't. The pain was unbearable. I felt so lost, so... empty.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe a 9. I feel like I'm reliving it all over again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Maria. Remember, you're here with me. You're safe.",
    "Client: Thank you... I... I remember the funeral. Seeing the closed casket. Knowing he was in there, but not being able to see him one last time. It felt so... final. I kept thinking about our last conversation. If only I'd known...",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7 now. I feel... I feel sad, but also... I don't know, maybe a little calmer?",
    "Therapist: That's good. Keep going.",
    "Client: In the weeks after, I couldn't sleep. I'd wake up thinking I heard his voice. The house felt so empty. I... I started having these terrible headaches. The doctor said it was stress. I felt so alone, even with my children around. It was like... like a part of me died with him.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: I... I think it's a 6 now. I still feel sad, but... but I can talk about it without feeling like I'm going to fall apart.",

    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 5. I feel sad, but also... grateful? Is that strange?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a natural part of healing. We'll stop here for today. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. It was hard, but... I think it helped. Thank you.",
    "Therapist: You did wonderfully, Maria. We'll talk more next session."
