    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Maria?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's strange, you know? I've lived through so many things in my 70 years, but reliving that hurricane... it's like I'm right back there. The sound of the wind, the creaking of the house... it's all so vivid.",
    "Therapist: What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The fear. It was overwhelming. I remember huddling in the bathroom with my family, my grandchildren crying. I felt so... helpless. Like I couldn't protect them, you know? And that feeling, it's stayed with me all these years.",
    "Therapist: How does that helplessness connect to your life now?",
    "Client: Well, I... I guess I've always tried to be in control since then. Maybe that's why I turned to drinking for a while. It numbed that feeling of powerlessness. But it didn't really help, did it?",
    "Therapist: What insights are you gaining from this?",
    "Client: I'm realizing that... maybe I've been running from that feeling of vulnerability. But facing it head-on like this, it's tough, but... it's also kind of freeing? Like, I survived it once, I can face it again.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it feel to acknowledge that?",
    "Client: It's... a mix of emotions, really. There's some sadness, thinking about all the time I've spent trying to avoid these feelings. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, strength maybe? Like I'm finally confronting something I've been afraid of for so long.",
    "Therapist: What's giving you that strength?",
    "Client: I think... it's partly this process. Talking about it, facing it. And partly it's remembering how we all came together after the hurricane. The community, my family... we supported each other. I wasn't alone then, and I'm not alone now.",
    "Therapist: That's a beautiful connection. How might this help moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I can start relying on others more. I've always tried to be the strong one, you know? But it's okay to need help sometimes. And maybe... maybe I can start dealing with stress in healthier ways. Without the alcohol.",
    "Therapist: Excellent insight. What's your next step?",
    "Client: I want to... practice opening up more. Maybe start with my husband. He's always been supportive, but I've kept a lot bottled up. And I want to keep working on these memories. It's hard, but I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm tired, but... good. Like I've done something important. It's strange, isn't it? Facing your fears is exhausting, but it also gives you energy in a way. I feel... I don't know, maybe a little lighter?",
    "Therapist: That's common. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... maybe we could delve into how the hurricane affected my relationships? I've always been a bit overprotective since then, especially with my kids and grandkids. I'd like to work on finding a balance.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. We'll explore that next session. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. This isn't easy, but I feel like I'm finally making progress. It's like... I'm reclaiming parts of myself that I thought were lost in that storm. It's painful, but... it's also healing, you know?",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work, Maria. See you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you, Doctor. I'll see you then. And... I'll try to practice what we talked about. Opening up a bit more, maybe even tell my husband about today's session. It's a small step, but... it's a start, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Every step counts. Take care.",
    "Client: You too, Doctor. Goodbye."
