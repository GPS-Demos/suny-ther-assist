    "Therapist: Good morning, Mr. Garcia. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Buenos d\u00edas, doctor. I'm... well, I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. My back's been acting up again, and I'm not sure what to expect from today's session.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's discuss today's plan.",
    "Client: Okay, I'm listening. Is it going to be like our previous sessions?",
    "Therapist: Not exactly. We'll be doing imaginal exposure today.",
    "Client: Imaginal exposure? That sounds... intimidating. What does that mean exactly?",
    "Therapist: It's revisiting your trauma memory in a safe environment.",
    "Client: Revisit the accident? I... I don't know if I can do that. It's been years, but thinking about it still makes my heart race.",
    "Therapist: Your reaction is normal. This helps process the memory.",
    "Client: Process it? But I've been trying to forget it all these years. How is remembering supposed to help?",
    "Therapist: Confronting the memory can reduce its power over you.",
    "Client: I see... But what if I panic? Or what if the pain gets worse? You know how my back gets when I'm stressed.",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. I'll be here to support you.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I trust you, doctor. But can you tell me more about what to expect? Will I have to close my eyes? Will you be asking me questions?",
    "Therapist: Yes, eyes closed. You'll describe the memory. I'll guide you.",
    "Client: Describe it? Out loud? That's... that's going to be hard. I've never really talked about it in detail before. Not even to my wife.",
    "Therapist: It's challenging, but it can be very healing.",
    "Client: I believe you. It's just... after the accident, with all the legal issues and then getting involved in that trafficking case... it's been a lot to handle.",
    "Therapist: Your experiences are complex. This helps unpack them.",
    "Client: I suppose that makes sense. And you really think this will help with the nightmares and the jumpiness?",
    "Therapist: Yes, many find relief from PTSD symptoms this way.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm willing to try. But... can we stop if it gets too overwhelming?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're in control. We can pause anytime.",
    "Client: Thank you, that helps. I'm still nervous, but I'm ready to give it a shot. You know, my wife has been so supportive through all of this. I want to get better for her too.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is admirable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm ready. Just... be patient with me if I struggle, okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Your courage is commendable. Let's start."
