    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Thompson. I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been thinking about it a lot since our last session.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... the idea of reliving those moments at work, when my boss would berate me in front of everyone. It makes my stomach churn. I've spent so long trying to forget those experiences, and now we're going to purposely bring them up? I'm worried it might set me back.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your honesty. Let's discuss the purpose of this exercise.",
    "Client: Okay, I'm listening. But I have to admit, I'm still skeptical. How is revisiting these painful memories supposed to help me? Won't it just make things worse?",
    "Therapist: It may feel challenging initially, but it's designed to reduce your PTSD symptoms over time.",
    "Client: Reduce my symptoms? How? I mean, I've been having nightmares and flashbacks about those incidents for months now. And the anxiety... it's been crippling at times. Especially when I'm in new work environments or around authority figures. I just don't see how reliving it all could possibly help.",
    "Therapist: By facing the memories in a safe environment, we can process them differently.",
    "Client: Process them differently? What do you mean by that exactly? Because right now, whenever those memories come up, I feel like I'm right back there in that moment, feeling small and worthless all over again.",
    "Therapist: We'll work through the emotions together, helping you gain new perspectives.",
    "Client: New perspectives... that sounds nice in theory, but I'm worried about how intense it might get. What if I have a panic attack during the session? Or what if I just shut down completely? I've done that before when things get too overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: I'll be here to support you throughout. We can pause anytime you need.",
    "Client: Okay, that's... that's good to know. I appreciate that. Can you tell me a bit more about what to expect? Like, what am I supposed to do exactly? And how long does this usually take?",
    "Therapist: You'll describe a specific traumatic event in detail. We'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: Describe it in detail? That sounds... challenging. There's so much I've tried to forget. But I guess that's the point, isn't it? To face it head-on? I'm just worried about getting too emotional or not being able to articulate everything clearly.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel emotional. Your reactions are valid and important.",
    "Client: Thank you for saying that. It helps to know that whatever I'm feeling is okay. I guess I'm just used to trying to keep it all together, you know? Especially after spending so long in an environment where showing any emotion was seen as a weakness.",
    "Therapist: Your strength in facing this is commendable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: I... yes, I think I'm ready. Or as ready as I'll ever be. Just... promise me you'll stop if it gets too much? And maybe remind me to breathe if I look like I'm getting too worked up?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Your well-being is my priority. Let's start when you're comfortable.",
    "Client: Okay. Here goes. I'm taking a deep breath. Where should I start? Should I pick a specific incident or just start talking about the general work environment?",
    "Therapist: Start with a specific incident that stands out to you.",
    "Client: Alright. I think... I think I'll start with the day of the big presentation. It was supposed to be my moment to shine, to prove my worth to the company. I had worked on it for weeks..."
