    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. It's like I'm right back there, you know? The memory of that animal attack during the cyclone... it's so vivid. I can still hear the wind howling and feel the rain pelting against my skin. My heart's racing just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's like this cold grip around my chest. I keep thinking about how helpless I felt when that wild dog came at me. I was already terrified because of the cyclone, and then suddenly there was this... this snarling beast. I thought I was going to die.",
    "Therapist: How does that fear manifest in your body?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking, and I feel this tightness in my throat. It's hard to swallow. My back is killing me too - I think I'm tensing up without realizing it. It's like my body's preparing to run or fight, even though I know I'm safe here.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"Why me?\" Why did I have to go through that? And then I feel guilty because so many others suffered worse during that disaster. But I can't shake this feeling that I'm not safe, that danger could come out of nowhere at any moment. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts and feelings compare to when the event first happened?",
    "Client: They're... they're not as overwhelming as they were initially. Right after it happened, I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat. I jumped at every little noise. Now, it's more like... a constant undercurrent of anxiety. But when I really think about it, like during this exercise, it all comes flooding back.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your ability to cope with these memories now?",
    "Client: I suppose... I can talk about it more easily now. Before, I'd just shut down. And I'm here, doing this therapy, which is something I couldn't have imagined doing a year ago. But it's still so hard. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel truly normal again.",
    "Therapist: What helps you feel grounded when these memories surface?",
    "Client: Deep breaths help a bit. And... and reminding myself that I survived. That I'm here, now, safe. Sometimes I touch something solid, like the arm of the chair, just to anchor myself in the present. Oh, and thinking about my partner - their support means everything.",
    "Therapist: How do you see this experience fitting into your broader life story?",
    "Client: That's... that's a tough one. I guess it's made me more aware of how fragile life can be. But also how resilient we are as humans. I never thought I could survive something like that, but I did. It's changed me, for sure. I'm more anxious, but also more appreciative of the good moments.",
    "Therapist: What strengths have you discovered in yourself through this process?",
    "Client: I've realized I'm stronger than I thought. And more resilient. I'm here, doing this difficult work, facing these terrifying memories. That takes courage, right? And I've learned to ask for help, which was never easy for me before. I guess... I guess I'm proud of that.",
    "Therapist: How does your chronic pain interact with these trauma memories?",
    "Client: It's... it's complicated. Sometimes the pain flares up when I'm stressed about the memories, which then makes me more anxious, and it becomes this vicious cycle. But oddly enough, dealing with chronic pain has also taught me some coping strategies that help with the trauma too. Like mindfulness and focusing on the present moment.",
    "Therapist: What hope do you have for your continued recovery?",
    "Client: I hope... I hope I can get to a place where these memories don't have such power over me. Where I can think about what happened without feeling overwhelmed. And maybe... maybe even use this experience to help others who've been through similar things. Is that realistic?",
    "Therapist: What makes you feel it could be possible?",
    "Client: Well, I'm here, aren't I? Talking about it, working through it. A year ago, I couldn't even say the words 'animal attack' without having a panic attack. Now, it's still hard, but I can do it. And each time we do these exercises, it gets a tiny bit easier. It's slow progress, but it is progress.",
    "Therapist: How has this session been for you?",
    "Client: It's been intense. Draining, but also... I don't know, maybe cathartic? Talking about it, really diving into those memories and feelings... it's exhausting, but I also feel a bit lighter. Like I'm not carrying it all alone anymore. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to work more on coping strategies. Ways to ground myself when the memories hit unexpectedly. And maybe... maybe we could talk more about how this has affected my relationship? My partner's been so supportive, but I know it's been hard on them too.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling now, as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm tired, really tired. But also... kind of proud? Like I've climbed a mountain or something. My heart's still racing a bit, but not as bad as before. I think I'll go home and do something relaxing, maybe watch a movie with my partner. Just... try to be present in the moment, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent idea. Take care of yourself, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. Really, thank you for helping me through this. I know we have a long way to go, but I feel like I'm finally moving forward. See you next week."
