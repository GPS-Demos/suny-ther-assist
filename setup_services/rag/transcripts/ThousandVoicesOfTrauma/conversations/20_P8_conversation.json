    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. My heart's still pounding a bit. I can feel this tightness in my chest, you know? It's like I'm right back there, watching it all happen again.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep seeing their faces. The attackers, the victims... God, there was so much blood. I remember thinking, \"Why isn't anyone helping?\" But I... I didn't do anything either. I just stood there, frozen. I feel so ashamed about that.",
    "Therapist: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of guilt. Can you tell me more about that?",
    "Client: Yeah, it's... it's overwhelming sometimes. I mean, I was just a bystander, but I feel like I should have done something. Anything. Called for help, tried to intervene... But I was so scared. I keep thinking about how those people must have felt, seeing me just standing there. They probably thought I didn't care.",
    "Therapist: How does that belief impact you now?",
    "Client: It... it makes me feel worthless, you know? Like I'm not a good person. I've always tried to help others, but when it really mattered, I failed. It's hard to reconcile that with who I thought I was.",
    "Therapist: I see. What else are you noticing in your body right now?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking a bit. And I feel this knot in my stomach. It's like my body's still in fight-or-flight mode, even though it happened years ago. Sometimes I get these flashbacks, and it feels just as real as it did then.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with those sensations when they arise?",
    "Client: I... I try to distract myself. Watch TV, listen to music, anything to drown out the memories. But it doesn't always work. Sometimes I end up drinking just to numb myself. I know it's not healthy, but... it's the only thing that seems to help in the moment.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts come up when you drink to cope?",
    "Client: I guess... I feel like a failure. Like I can't handle my own emotions without a crutch. But at the same time, there's this relief. For a little while, I don't have to think about what happened. I don't have to feel the guilt or the fear. It's a temporary escape.",
    "Therapist: How does that align with your goals for healing?",
    "Client: It doesn't, really. I know that. I want to be able to face this head-on, to process it and move forward. But it's so hard. Every time I think about that day, it's like I'm right back there. I can smell the blood, hear the screams... It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What do you think might help you face those memories?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe talking about it more? I've kept it bottled up for so long. This is the first time I've really described it in detail to anyone. It's scary, but... there's a part of me that feels a little lighter, you know? Like maybe if I keep talking about it, it'll lose some of its power over me.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. How does that idea sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... it's both terrifying and hopeful. I'm scared of reliving it all, but I'm also tired of letting it control my life. I want to be able to think about that day without falling apart. To remember the people who were hurt and honor them, instead of just feeling paralyzed by guilt and fear.",
    "Therapist: What small step could you take towards that goal?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I could start by writing about it? Just for myself, to get the thoughts out of my head. Or... I don't know, maybe look into support groups for witnesses of violence? I've always been hesitant because I feel like I don't deserve support, but... maybe it would help to talk to others who've been through similar experiences.",
    "Therapist: How does the idea of connecting with others make you feel?",
    "Client: It's scary, but... there's a part of me that feels hopeful. Like maybe I'm not as alone in this as I thought. And maybe... maybe talking to others who've been through it might help me forgive myself a little. I don't know if I'll ever completely get over the guilt, but... I want to try to move forward.",
    "Therapist: That's a courageous perspective. What else is coming up for you?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much this has affected every part of my life. My relationships, my studies... I've been so focused on just getting through each day that I haven't really been living, you know? I want to change that. I want to be present again, to enjoy life without this constant shadow hanging over me.",
    "Therapist: How might your life look different if you could achieve that?",
    "Client: I... I think I'd be more open with people. More willing to form close relationships. Maybe I'd finally finish my degree, pursue a career I'm passionate about. I'd like to travel again without being paralyzed by fear every time I'm in a crowded place. Just... live without constantly looking over my shoulder or waiting for something bad to happen.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a meaningful goal. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired, but in a good way, I think. Like I've finally started to unpack this heavy load I've been carrying. There's still a lot to work through, but... I feel a glimmer of hope. Like maybe, with time and work, I can get to a better place. It's scary, but... I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. We'll continue this journey together."
