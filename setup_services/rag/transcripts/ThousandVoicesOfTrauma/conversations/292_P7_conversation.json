    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and take a deep breath. When you're ready, describe the scene of witnessing violence.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm walking home from the library late at night. It's dark, and the streetlights are flickering. I hear shouting coming from an alley up ahead. My heart starts racing, but I keep walking. As I get closer, I see two men fighting. One of them has a knife...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The man with the knife lunges forward, and I hear a scream. There's blood... so much blood. I freeze, unable to move or look away. The attacker sees me and starts running in my direction. I want to run, but my legs won't move. I'm terrified...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I can't. It's too much. I feel like I'm back there again. My chest is tight, and I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) Okay... The attacker runs past me, bumping my shoulder. I stumble and fall to the ground. I can hear sirens in the distance, getting closer. The victim is on the ground, not moving. There's so much blood... I feel helpless and guilty for not doing anything.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. Keep going.",
    "Client: I finally manage to stand up and run to the victim. I try to help, but I don't know what to do. My hands are shaking, and I'm crying. The police arrive, and everything becomes a blur of lights and noise. They ask me questions, but I can barely speak. I just keep seeing the knife, the blood...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... overwhelmed. My heart is racing, and I'm sweating. It's like I'm reliving it all over again. I hate feeling so powerless and scared.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel that way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I know, but it feels so real. After that night, I couldn't sleep for weeks. I kept having nightmares about the attack, about being chased. I was afraid to go out at night, always looking over my shoulder. I felt guilty for not doing more to help, for being frozen in fear.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage. Continue.",
    "Client: The worst part is the constant feeling of danger. Even now, years later, I get anxious in crowded places or when I hear loud noises. I feel like I lost my sense of safety that night. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel completely safe again.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to talk about, but I know it's important. I just wish I could forget it all, you know? But at the same time, I feel like it's changed me. I'm more cautious now, more aware of my surroundings. Sometimes I think that's good, but other times it feels like a burden.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: A bit drained, to be honest. Talking about it brings up all those emotions again. But... I also feel a little lighter, like I'm not carrying it all alone anymore. It's still scary, but maybe a little less overwhelming than before.",
    "Therapist: That's natural. You've done well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I know we've been working on this for a while now, but it still surprises me how vivid the memories are. Sometimes I worry that I'll never be able to move past this. Will I always react this way when I think about that night?",
    "Therapist: It's a process. You're showing strength.",
    "Client: I hope so. It's just... sometimes I feel like I'm stuck. Like that night defined who I am now. I want to move forward, to feel safe again, to not let this control my life. But it's hard. Every time I close my eyes, I can still see it all so clearly.",
    "Therapist: Your progress is significant. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm trying. I really am. I've been using some of the techniques we've talked about - the breathing exercises, the grounding techniques. They help sometimes, especially when I feel like I'm about to panic. But other times, it feels like nothing can stop the flood of memories and emotions.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... maybe a little stronger? Talking about it is exhausting, but I think it helps. It's like... each time I face it, it loses a tiny bit of its power over me. I'm still scared, still affected by it, but I'm also here, talking about it. That's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You've shown remarkable resilience.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your support through this. It's not easy, but I'm starting to believe that maybe, just maybe, I can get through this. It might take time, and it might always be a part of me, but perhaps I can learn to live with it without letting it control me.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive outlook. You've done well today.",
    "Client: Thanks. I think I'm ready to stop for now. It's a lot to process, and I'm feeling pretty drained. But I'm glad we did this. It's hard, but I think it's helping. Is it okay if we end here for today?",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've made excellent progress."
