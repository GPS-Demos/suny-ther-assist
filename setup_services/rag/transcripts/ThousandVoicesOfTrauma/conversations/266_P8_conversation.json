    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is buzzing, you know? My hands are a bit shaky, and my heart's still racing. That memory of the earthquake, it just... it felt so real again. I could almost feel the ground moving beneath my feet.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What's going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: It's a jumble, really. Part of me is relieved it's over, but another part is still there, in that moment. I keep thinking about how powerless I felt. The noise, the chaos... and then seeing my workplace, this place I spent so much time in, just... crumbling. It's hard to shake that image.",
    "Therapist: I see. What emotions are coming up for you?",
    "Client: Fear, definitely. A lot of fear. But also... guilt, I think. I made it out okay, but some of my colleagues didn't. And there's this anger too, which sounds ridiculous because who can you be angry at for a natural disaster? But I am. I'm angry that it happened, that it changed everything.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. How does your body feel as you talk about this?",
    "Client: Tense. Really tense. My shoulders are up to my ears, I think. And there's this knot in my stomach that won't go away. It's like my body is still bracing for impact, even though I know I'm safe now.",
    "Therapist: Hmm. What do you notice about those physical sensations?",
    "Client: They're... familiar. It's how I felt that day, and how I feel every time I think about it. But, you know, there's something different this time. It's intense, but it's not overwhelming me like it usually does. I'm noticing the sensations without feeling like I'm drowning in them. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. How do you make sense of that difference?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe I'm starting to separate the memory from the present moment? Like, I can remember the fear and the chaos, but I also know that I'm here now, in this room, and I'm safe. It's still uncomfortable, but it feels... I don't know, manageable somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's an interesting observation. What thoughts come up as you reflect on that?",
    "Client: Well, it makes me wonder if maybe I'm making progress. For so long, thinking about the earthquake would send me into a panic. But now, even though it's still painful, I can talk about it without feeling like I'm right back there. It's like... like I'm starting to see it as something that happened to me, not something that defines me. Is that... is that normal?",
    "Therapist: There's no \"normal\" in healing. What matters is your experience. How does this shift feel to you?",
    "Client: It feels... good, actually. A bit scary, because it's new, but good. Like maybe I'm taking back some control. I've spent so long trying to avoid thinking about it, but now that I'm facing it, it's like the memory is losing some of its power over me. Don't get me wrong, it's still hard, but... I don't know, there's a glimmer of hope there that wasn't before.",
    "Therapist: I'm hearing a sense of empowerment. Can you tell me more about that?",
    "Client: Yeah, I suppose that's what it is. It's like... for the first time since the earthquake, I feel like I might be able to move forward. Not forget it, because I don't think I ever will, but maybe... integrate it? Learn to live with it without letting it control me. I never thought I'd feel this way. It's... it's actually quite emotional to realize this.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling as you share this realization?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tearing up a bit, to be honest. It's a mix of relief and... I don't know, gratitude maybe? Like I'm grateful to myself for doing this work, even though it's been so hard. And there's this sense of... possibility. Like maybe I can start thinking about the future again, instead of being stuck in that moment.",
    "Therapist: That sounds powerful. What do you want to do with this new awareness?",
    "Client: I think... I want to keep going. Keep facing these memories, keep processing them. It's not easy, but if I can feel this difference after just a few sessions, maybe there's more healing ahead. And maybe... maybe I can start thinking about going back to work. Not the same building, obviously, but the same field. I've been avoiding it, but I miss my work. I miss feeling useful.",
    "Therapist: It sounds like you're considering some significant steps. How does that feel?",
    "Client: Scary, but in a good way. Like... like when you're about to do something you know is right, even though it's challenging. I feel... I feel hopeful, I think. And that's not something I've felt in a long time.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to explore this idea of going back to work. Maybe we could work on some strategies for managing anxiety in a workplace setting? And... and maybe continue with these exposure exercises. They're tough, but I can see now that they're helping.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up?",
    "Client: No, I think that covers it. I just... I want to say thank you. For guiding me through this. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I might actually get there.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your courage and hard work are commendable. I'll see you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, definitely. Thank you again. See you next week."
