    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. But also... maybe a little relieved? It's hard to put into words.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The vivid details, I guess. The way the room smelled, the texture of the carpet under my hands. It's like I was right back there, you know? And the feeling of helplessness... that really hit me hard this time.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. Scary, but also... different somehow. Like, I knew I was here, safe, even while remembering. That's new. Usually, I feel completely lost in the memory.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant change. What do you make of that?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe I'm starting to separate the past from the present? It's still awful, but it feels a tiny bit less overwhelming. Like, I can observe it without being completely consumed by it. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. How might this relate to your PTSD symptoms?",
    "Client: Well, I've been having fewer flashbacks lately. And when they do happen, they're not lasting as long. I wonder if this is connected? Like, maybe I'm learning to ground myself better?",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. How does this progress make you feel?",
    "Client: Hopeful, I think. And proud, in a way. It's been so hard, and there's still a long way to go, but... yeah, I feel like I'm making progress. It's empowering, you know?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What strategies have you found helpful?",
    "Client: The breathing exercises have been a game-changer. And... this might sound silly, but I've started carrying a small stone in my pocket. When I feel anxious, I touch it, and it reminds me I'm safe now. It's like a physical anchor to the present.",
    "Therapist: That's a creative coping strategy. How else has this impacted your daily life?",
    "Client: I've been more open with my partner about what I'm going through. It's scary, but also... freeing? And I think it's helping our relationship. I feel less alone in this.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful. What's been challenging recently?",
    "Client: The nightmares are still pretty bad. And... um... I've been struggling with some anger lately. Especially around the racial aspects of what happened. It's like, now that I'm processing the trauma, I'm also confronting how my race played into it all. It's... it's a lot.",
    "Therapist: That's a complex layer. How are you managing those feelings?",
    "Client: I've been journaling a lot. And I joined an online support group for BIPOC trauma survivors. It helps to know I'm not alone in these experiences. But sometimes... sometimes I still feel so angry and helpless.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid feelings. What helps when you feel that way?",
    "Client: Honestly? Sometimes I just need to cry. Or scream into a pillow. But then I try to do something that makes me feel strong, like working out or practicing my self-defense moves. It... it reminds me that I have power now.",
    "Therapist: That's a great balance. What's your focus for the coming week?",
    "Client: I want to keep working on staying present. Maybe try extending my meditation practice? And... I think I'm ready to start talking more about the racial aspects of my trauma. It's scary, but I think it's important.",
    "Therapist: That shows real courage. How can we support that in our next session?",
    "Client: Could we... could we maybe spend some time specifically addressing the racial trauma? I know it's all connected, but I feel like I need to give that aspect some focused attention.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll make that a priority. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. This is hard, but I feel like I'm finally starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel. I couldn't have gotten this far without your support.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work. I'm here to support you. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, definitely. Thank you again."
