    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the memory?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm standing in the airport. It's crowded, and I see my sister walking towards the security checkpoint. She's about to leave for her humanitarian work overseas. I have this sinking feeling in my stomach...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: She turns and waves at me one last time. Her smile is bright, but I can see worry in her eyes. I force myself to smile back, but inside I'm screaming for her not to go. I knew about the risks, the human trafficking problems in that region, but I didn't say anything...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you experiencing?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I feel like I can't breathe. I want to run after her, to stop her from going, but my feet are glued to the floor. I'm watching her disappear into the crowd, and I have this overwhelming sense of dread...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I can't shake this feeling that it's the last time I'll see her. And then... then I'm back home. The phone rings. It's been weeks since she left. My hands are shaking as I pick up the receiver. I hear a stranger's voice, telling me she's missing. They suspect human trafficking. I... I can't...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. You're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (audible deep breath) I feel like I'm suffocating. The guilt is crushing me. I should have stopped her. I should have said something. Now she's gone, and it's my fault. I failed her...",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're not responsible for what happened. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: I see myself collapsing on the floor, the phone clattering beside me. I'm sobbing uncontrollably. My mind is racing with horrible images of what might be happening to her. I feel so helpless, so angry at myself, at the world...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The days after that are a blur. I can't eat, can't sleep. I'm constantly checking my phone, hoping for news. I start having nightmares about her, seeing her scared and alone. I wake up in cold sweats, feeling like I can't breathe...",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel this way. You're safe now. Continue.",
    "Client: I throw myself into trying to find her. I contact embassies, NGOs, anyone who might help. But it feels like screaming into a void. No one has answers. The guilt and fear are eating me alive. I start drinking to numb the pain...",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel like I'm back there. My chest is tight, and I'm struggling to breathe. The guilt is overwhelming. I keep seeing her face, imagining what she might be going through. It's... it's too much...",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're here, you're safe.",
