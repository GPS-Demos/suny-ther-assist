    "Therapist: Alright, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's begin. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that memory.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm there. I can see our living room. The TV is on, but the volume is low. My wife is sitting on the couch, and I'm standing near the doorway. We've just had an argument about... about me working late again. I can feel the tension in the air.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: The argument is escalating. My wife is raising her voice, saying I don't care about our family. I'm... I'm getting angry. I can feel my face getting hot, my fists clenching. I want to yell back, but I'm trying to keep my cool.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up. Maybe a 6?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Keep going. You're doing well.",
    "Client: I... I lose it. I start shouting back, telling her she doesn't understand the pressure I'm under at work. My heart is racing now, I can feel it pounding in my chest. I'm gesticulating wildly, and I accidentally knock over a vase. It shatters on the floor. The sound... it's so loud. Everything goes quiet for a moment.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. I feel awful. The look on my wife's face... she's scared. I've never seen her look at me like that before.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to feel distressed. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: I remember feeling so ashamed. I start apologizing, trying to clean up the mess. My hands are shaking. I can't believe I lost control like that. I... I start crying. I've never cried in front of my wife before.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Still an 8. Maybe even a 9. I feel so overwhelmed reliving this.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. You're doing great.",
    "Client: My wife... she comes over and helps me clean up. We're both crying now. I keep apologizing, telling her I'll get help, that I'll do better. I can feel this mix of relief and shame washing over me.",
    "Therapist: And now? How would you rate your distress?",
    "Client: It's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7? I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful? We made it through that moment.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Let's stay with the memory a bit longer.",
    "Client: We sit on the couch together, not talking, just... being there. I can feel my heartbeat slowing down. I'm still upset, but I'm starting to calm down. I remember thinking that we need to change, that I need to change.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5, I think. I feel exhausted, but also determined.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. Let's start to bring you back to the present.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm... I'm opening my eyes now. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've let something out that I've been holding onto for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. How are you doing now?",
    "Client: I'm okay. My SUDS is probably around a 3 now. I feel tired, but also... relieved, I guess?",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's take a moment to process what you experienced."
