    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mr. Lim?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. My heart is still racing a bit. It's like I'm right back there, you know? I can still hear the sound of glass breaking downstairs. It's so vivid.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: Fear. Intense fear. I remember freezing in place when I heard those footsteps coming up the stairs. I couldn't move, couldn't breathe. My mouth went dry, and I felt this cold sweat all over my body. Even now, I can feel my palms getting clammy just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: You're noticing physical sensations. What else?",
    "Client: I... I feel ashamed. I was supposed to protect my wife, but I couldn't move. I just stood there, paralyzed. What kind of man does that make me? I keep thinking, \"If only I had done something...\" Maybe things would have been different.",
    "Therapist: How do those thoughts affect you?",
    "Client: They make me feel... worthless. Weak. I've always prided myself on being strong, you know? Taking care of my family. But in that moment, when it really mattered, I failed. It's like everything I believed about myself just... crumbled.",
    "Therapist: I see. What else are you experiencing?",
    "Client: Anger. I'm angry at those men who broke in, of course. But I'm also angry at myself. Why couldn't I do something? Anything? And then there's this... guilt. My wife was so scared, and I couldn't comfort her. I couldn't even look at her. I feel like I let her down in her final moments.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt manifest for you?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a heavy weight on my chest. Sometimes I find it hard to breathe when I think about it. And there's this constant knot in my stomach. I can't enjoy things anymore. Everything reminds me of what happened, of what I didn't do.",
    "Therapist: Mm. What thoughts come with these feelings?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"I should have been braver. I should have fought back.\" But then another part of me says, \"What if fighting back would have made things worse?\" It's this constant battle in my head. I can't seem to find peace with any of it.",
    "Therapist: How do these conflicting thoughts impact you?",
    "Client: They... they exhaust me. I'm tired all the time. I can't sleep well because these thoughts keep circling in my mind. During the day, I find it hard to concentrate on anything. It's like I'm stuck in that moment, reliving it over and over again.",
    "Therapist: What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I feel so alone. Even though it happened years ago, it's like I'm still in that house, isolated and terrified. I've withdrawn from my friends and family. I can't bear to see the pity in their eyes. And I'm afraid... afraid that if they knew how I froze, they'd judge me too.",
    "Therapist: How does this isolation affect you?",
    "Client: It's... it's suffocating. I miss my old life, my connections. But at the same time, I feel like I don't deserve them. Like I'm tainted by what happened. And there's this constant anxiety, you know? I'm always on edge, always waiting for something bad to happen again.",
    "Therapist: What do you make of that anxiety?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's my mind trying to protect me. If I'm always alert, always prepared, maybe next time I won't freeze. But it's exhausting living like this. I can't relax, can't enjoy simple things anymore. Everything feels like a potential threat.",
    "Therapist: How does recounting this memory affect you now?",
    "Client: It's... it's strange. Part of me feels drained, like I've run a marathon. But there's also a small sense of... relief? Like I've finally let out something I've been holding in for so long. It still hurts, but maybe... maybe a little less than before?",
    "Therapist: That's interesting. Can you elaborate?",
    "Client: Well, I've never really talked about this in such detail before. It's always been this big, scary thing in my mind. But saying it out loud... it's still painful, but it feels a bit more manageable. Like maybe I'm not alone in carrying this burden anymore.",
    "Therapist: How does that shift feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a bit overwhelming, to be honest. There's a part of me that feels lighter, but another part that's scared of letting go of the guilt. It's been a part of me for so long. But I think... I think I want to try. To see if I can find a way to live with what happened without it consuming me.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I... I'm not entirely sure. But I think I want to try reconnecting with my family. Maybe... maybe share some of this with them. It's scary, but I'm tired of being alone. And perhaps... perhaps it's time I start forgiving myself, even if it's just a little bit at a time.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a meaningful step. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: Nervous, definitely. But also... hopeful? For the first time in a long while, I feel like there might be a way forward. It won't be easy, I know that. But talking about it today, facing those memories... it's shown me that maybe I'm stronger than I thought.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant insight. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. This has been... intense. But good, I think. Thank you for listening, for guiding me through this. I feel... I feel like I've taken a small step forward today.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today, Mr. Lim. Take care."
