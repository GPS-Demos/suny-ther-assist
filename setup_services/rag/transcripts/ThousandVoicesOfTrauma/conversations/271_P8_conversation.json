    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like my body is vibrating with tension. The memory of fleeing our home in the middle of the night... it's so vivid now. I can still hear the sound of distant explosions, and my heart is racing just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you emotionally?",
    "Client: Fear. Overwhelming fear. But also... guilt? I remember looking back at our neighborhood as we drove away, knowing that some of our friends and neighbors were still there. I feel guilty for leaving them behind, even though logically I know we had no choice.",
    "Therapist: How do those emotions sit in your body right now?",
    "Client: The fear is like a knot in my stomach, twisting tighter and tighter. The guilt... it's heavy on my chest, making it hard to breathe. And there's this underlying anxiety that's making my hands tremble. It's like my body is reliving that night all over again.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are accompanying these sensations?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"What if we had stayed? What if we had convinced others to leave with us?\" And then I remind myself that we might not have survived if we'd stayed. But then I feel selfish for prioritizing our own survival. It's this constant cycle of \"what ifs\" and self-doubt.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your broader experience?",
    "Client: I think... it's at the core of my struggle to feel settled here. Every time I start to feel comfortable or happy in our new life, these memories and feelings resurface. It's like I'm not allowed to move on because I left so much behind.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I need to feel grounded. To remind myself that we're safe now. But I also need to acknowledge the pain and loss we've experienced. It's hard to balance those two things \u2013 feeling grateful for our safety but also honoring the trauma we've been through.",
    "Therapist: How can you support yourself right now?",
    "Client: I think... taking some deep breaths might help. And maybe... maybe reminding myself that it's okay to have these conflicting feelings. That healing isn't linear, and some days will be harder than others.",
    "Therapist: That's a great insight. How does it feel to recognize that?",
    "Client: It's... oddly comforting. Like I'm giving myself permission to just be where I am right now, without judgment. It doesn't make the feelings go away, but it makes them feel more manageable somehow.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm noticing that as we talk, the physical sensations are starting to ease a bit. The knot in my stomach is loosening, and my breathing feels a little easier. It's like... by facing the memory head-on, it's losing some of its power over me.",
    "Therapist: How does that shift feel?",
    "Client: It feels... empowering, in a way. Like I'm reclaiming some control over my own narrative. The memory is still painful, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming as it did at first. There's a small sense of accomplishment in being able to sit with these difficult emotions without being completely overtaken by them.",
    "Therapist: What does this tell you about your resilience?",
    "Client: I suppose it shows that I'm stronger than I often give myself credit for. That I can face these memories and work through them, even when it's uncomfortable. It's a reminder that I've already survived so much, and that I have the capacity to heal and grow from these experiences.",
    "Therapist: How might you carry this forward?",
    "Client: I think... I can try to approach other difficult memories with this same mindset. To remind myself that it's okay to feel whatever comes up, but also that I have the strength to work through it. And maybe... maybe I can start to be a little kinder to myself in the process.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a powerful intention. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... tired, but in a good way. Like I've done some important emotional work. There's still sadness and anxiety lingering, but they feel more manageable now. And there's a glimmer of hope there too \u2013 hope that I can continue to process these experiences and find more peace with them over time.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to explore more about how to balance honoring my past experiences with building a new life here. How to integrate both parts of my identity \u2013 who I was before and who I'm becoming now. And maybe work on some more grounding techniques for when these memories and emotions feel overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great plan. How would you like to close our session today?",
    "Client: Could we... could we end with a short grounding exercise? Something to help me transition back into the present moment before I leave?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's do that now..."
