    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, you're in control. Can you describe the animal attack, starting from the moment you first noticed the animal?",
    "Client: Okay... I was hiking in the woods near my cabin. It was a sunny day, and I remember feeling so peaceful. Then... I heard a rustling sound. I turned and saw this massive brown bear, maybe 20 feet away. My heart just stopped.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now? Can you give me a SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10. I'm a bit tense, but okay.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue with what happened next.",
    "Client: The bear... it stood up on its hind legs. It was so tall, at least 7 feet. I froze. I couldn't move, couldn't breathe. It let out this deafening roar, and I... I just panicked. I tried to run, but I tripped over a root.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Maybe a 6? My hands are getting clammy.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: I fell hard, and before I could get up, the bear was on me. Its claws... they tore into my back. The pain was excruciating. I screamed, but no one was around to hear. I could feel its hot breath on my neck, smell its fur... I thought I was going to die.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. My heart's racing. I can almost feel the pain again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you survived this. You're here now, safe.",
    "Client: I... I curled into a ball, trying to protect myself. The bear kept swatting at me, its claws ripping through my clothes, my skin. I don't know how long it lasted. It felt like forever. Then suddenly, it just... stopped. The bear sniffed me and then lumbered away.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's still high... maybe a 7. I feel shaky.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Take a deep breath. You're doing well.",
    "Client: I lay there for what felt like hours, too terrified to move. When I finally did, the pain hit me full force. I somehow managed to drag myself back to my cabin and call for help. The rest is a blur of ambulances and hospitals.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 5? I feel drained.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You've just revisited a traumatic experience. How are you physically feeling?",
    "Client: My muscles are tense, especially in my back where the scars are. I feel... exhausted, but also kind of relieved? Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Many people feel relief after sharing. How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 3, I think. I'm feeling calmer.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How do you feel about the exercise overall?",
    "Client: It was... intense. Scary. But also... I feel like I faced something I've been avoiding for a long time. It's like... I can breathe a little easier now.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. You did very well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I didn't think I could do it, but I'm glad I did.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. Let's end here and discuss some self-care strategies for the rest of your day."
