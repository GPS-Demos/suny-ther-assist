    "Therapist: Today, we'll be doing an imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. To be honest, I'm a bit nervous. What exactly does that involve?",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel nervous. Imaginal exposure means revisiting the traumatic memory in a safe environment. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I've been trying so hard to avoid thinking about that night. The idea of purposely bringing it all back... it's scary. I'm worried I might fall apart or have a panic attack. And what if it makes things worse instead of better?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How do you think revisiting the memory might help?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe it could help me process what happened? But I'm still scared. It's been years since my husband passed, and this home invasion brought back so many feelings of vulnerability. I'm not sure I'm ready to face it all again.",
    "Therapist: Your insight is spot-on. Facing the memory can help process it. What support would you need to feel safe during this exercise?",
    "Client: I think I'd need to know that I can stop if it becomes too overwhelming. And maybe some reassurance that you'll be here to guide me through it? It's just... since that night, I've been so anxious, especially when I'm home alone. I keep checking the locks, and any small noise startles me.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're in control, and we can pause anytime. What else might help you feel secure?",
    "Client: Maybe if we could go over some grounding techniques before we start? And if you could remind me that I'm safe here in your office, not back in that moment. I'm also worried about how I'll feel afterward. Will I be okay to drive home?",
    "Therapist: Great suggestions. We'll use grounding techniques and reminders. How about we plan for aftercare too?",
    "Client: That would be really helpful. I appreciate your patience with all my questions. I guess I'm just trying to prepare myself as best I can. It's hard to imagine willingly thinking about something I've tried so hard to forget. But if it can help me feel safer in my own home again, I want to try.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Shall we review the process step-by-step?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think having a clear idea of what to expect would help calm my nerves a bit. And maybe we could talk about what I should do if I start feeling overwhelmed during the exposure? I want to push myself, but I'm also scared of pushing too far.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's outline a plan for managing overwhelm. What coping strategies have worked for you in the past?",
    "Client: Deep breathing has been helpful, and sometimes focusing on a specific object in the room. Oh, and I find it calming when I can describe what I'm seeing or feeling in detail. It helps me stay present. Do you think we could incorporate some of those?",
    "Therapist: Excellent strategies. We'll definitely use those. Any other questions before we begin?",
    "Client: I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Just... thank you for being so patient and understanding. This isn't easy, but I'm hopeful it will help. Can you remind me one more time why we're doing this and how it's supposed to help with my PTSD symptoms?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Exposure helps process the memory and reduce its power. Ready to start?",
    "Client: Okay, I'm ready. I'm still nervous, but I trust you, and I'm committed to this process. Let's do it. Just... please stay close, alright?"
