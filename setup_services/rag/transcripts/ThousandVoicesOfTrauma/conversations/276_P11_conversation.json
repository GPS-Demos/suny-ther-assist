    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Maria?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Revisiting that hostage situation... it brings back so many intense emotions. My heart is still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The fear. It was so palpable. I could almost smell it in the air again, you know? I remember thinking about my family, wondering if I'd ever see them again. And then there was this moment of complete helplessness when I realized I had no control over what was happening.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... difficult. But different from before. I noticed I could breathe through it this time. There were moments when I wanted to stop, but I kept going. I think... I think I'm getting stronger.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant observation. What do you make of that?",
    "Client: I guess it means I'm making progress? It's still painful, but I feel like I'm starting to regain some control. Like, even though I'm revisiting this terrifying experience, I'm choosing to do it. I'm not just a victim anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How does this relate to your daily life?",
    "Client: Well, I've noticed I'm less jumpy at work. Yesterday, a customer dropped something, and it made a loud noise. Before, that would have sent me into a panic. But this time, I was able to take a deep breath and remind myself I was safe.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. What else have you noticed?",
    "Client: I'm sleeping better too. The nightmares are less frequent. And when I do have them, I'm able to calm myself down faster. It's like... I'm starting to believe that I'm actually safe now.",
    "Therapist: How does this progress make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... liberating, I think. And a little scary too. Part of me is afraid to hope, you know? What if I slip back? But mostly, I feel proud. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart.",
    "Therapist: Your resilience is remarkable. What's helping you move forward?",
    "Client: I think... it's a combination of things. This therapy, for sure. But also, my family's support. And I've started meditating. It helps me stay grounded when memories pop up unexpectedly.",
    "Therapist: Those are great coping strategies. What's been challenging recently?",
    "Client: Sometimes I still feel guilty. Like, why did I survive when others didn't? And there are days when I'm angry - at the world, at the people who put us in that situation. I know it's not productive, but those feelings creep in.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to have those feelings. How do you handle them?",
    "Client: I try to acknowledge them without letting them take over. I remind myself that I can't change what happened, but I can choose how I respond now. Sometimes I write in my journal or go for a run. It helps clear my head.",
    "Therapist: Those are healthy ways to process your emotions. What's your goal for next week?",
    "Client: I want to try going to the mall. I've been avoiding crowded places, but I think I'm ready to challenge myself. Maybe just for a short time at first.",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. How can you prepare for that?",
    "Client: I'll probably use some of the breathing exercises we've practiced. And I'll ask my sister to come with me for support. Oh, and I'll remind myself that it's okay to leave if it gets overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Excellent plan. How are you feeling about our session today?",
    "Client: Drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense? Like I've done something difficult but important. And hopeful. I'm starting to see a future where this trauma doesn't define me.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful perspective. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: No, I think I'm good for today. Thank you for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I'm glad I'm doing it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work, Maria. I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. See you then."
