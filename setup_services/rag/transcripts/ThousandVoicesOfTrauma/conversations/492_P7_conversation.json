    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Abadi. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about some difficult things, and I'm not sure I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We'll take it step by step.",
    "Client: Okay... I suppose we should start with the day my ex-husband told me he wanted a divorce. It was about three years ago. I remember I was in the kitchen, preparing dinner as usual. He came home earlier than expected, and I could tell something was wrong from the look on his face.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: He sat down at the kitchen table and asked me to join him. My heart started racing. I knew whatever he was about to say wasn't good. He looked at me and said, \"Fatima, I want a divorce.\" Just like that. No explanation, no warning. I felt like the ground had disappeared from under my feet.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I couldn't breathe. It felt like someone had punched me in the stomach. I remember gripping the edge of the table so hard my knuckles turned white. I kept thinking, \"This can't be happening. Not after 45 years of marriage.\" I wanted to scream, to cry, to beg him to reconsider, but no words came out.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I just sat there, staring at him. He tried to explain something about growing apart and wanting different things, but I couldn't really hear him. All I could think about was how I'd failed. How I'd let down my family, my children, my community. In our culture, divorce is... it's shameful, especially for a woman my age.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're very brave.",
    "Client: I started to shake uncontrollably. I felt so cold suddenly, even though it was summer. I wrapped my arms around myself, trying to hold myself together. I felt like I was falling apart, literally crumbling into pieces. And then... then I thought about my childhood, about my father leaving us when I was young. It was happening all over again.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) I... I started to cry. Not just cry, but wail. It was like all the pain from my childhood came rushing back. I felt like that little girl again, abandoned and unloved. I remember thinking, \"Why am I never enough? Why does everyone leave me?\"",
    "Therapist: Those are powerful emotions. You're doing great expressing them.",
    "Client: It's hard to talk about this. I feel so ashamed. I should have seen it coming, should have done something to prevent it. Maybe if I had been a better wife, if I had been more attentive or more interesting... maybe he wouldn't have wanted to leave.",
    "Therapist: Remember, it's not your fault. Keep going.",
    "Client: I just felt so lost. Our whole life together, everything we'd built, it was all crumbling around me. I couldn't imagine a future without him. Who was I if I wasn't his wife? What would I do? Where would I go? I felt so old and useless. And I was terrified of being alone.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Continue.",
    "Client: I remember looking at him through my tears and asking, \"Is there someone else?\" He hesitated before answering, and that hesitation told me everything. It felt like another blow. Not only was he leaving me, but he had found someone else. Someone younger, probably. Someone better than me.",
    "Therapist: That must have been very painful. You're doing well.",
    "Client: It was devastating. I felt betrayed, humiliated. I thought about all the times he had been working late or going on business trips. Had he been with her then? How long had this been going on? I felt so stupid for not realizing sooner.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those thoughts. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I think I started to hyperventilate. The room was spinning, and I couldn't catch my breath. I remember sliding off the chair onto the floor, hugging my knees to my chest. I felt like I was drowning in sorrow and fear. My whole world was collapsing, and I didn't know how to stop it.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. Take your time.",
    "Client: I don't know how long I sat there on the floor, crying and gasping for air. My ex-husband tried to comfort me, but I couldn't bear for him to touch me. His touch, which had once been so comforting, now felt like it was burning my skin. I pushed him away and told him to leave. I couldn't look at him anymore.",
    "Therapist: You handled a difficult situation. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Talking about it brings back all those feelings of fear and abandonment. But... I also feel a little lighter, like I've let go of some of the weight I've been carrying. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You've done excellent work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to think about, but I'm glad I could share it with you. I've never really talked about it in detail before. I've always been afraid that if I started talking, I'd never stop crying.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. We'll end here for today.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you for listening and for your support. I think... I think this might be helping, even though it's difficult. Same time next week?",
    "Therapist: Yes, I'll see you then. Take care, Mrs. Abadi."
