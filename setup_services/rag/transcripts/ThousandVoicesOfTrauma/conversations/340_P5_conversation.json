    "Therapist: Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: Honestly, I'm a bit nervous. I've been trying to avoid thinking about the car accident for so long. The idea of deliberately focusing on it makes me uncomfortable. Can you explain why we need to do this?",
    "Therapist: I understand your concern. This exercise helps process the trauma. It may be challenging, but I'll support you throughout.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's just... every time I think about the accident, I feel my heart racing and my palms get sweaty. I'm worried I might completely fall apart if I have to relive it.",
    "Therapist: Those reactions are normal. We'll go at your pace, and you can pause anytime. What other concerns do you have?",
    "Client: Well, I'm also worried about how this might affect my chronic pain. Sometimes when I get stressed or anxious, the pain flares up. Do you think this exercise could make it worse?",
    "Therapist: That's a valid concern. We'll monitor your pain levels and can adjust as needed. How else can I address your worries?",
    "Client: I guess I'm just wondering how this is different from the flashbacks I already experience. Won't this just be another way of torturing myself with these memories?",
    "Therapist: Unlike flashbacks, this is controlled. You'll process the memory in a safe environment, helping reduce its power over you.",
    "Client: That makes sense. I'm still scared, but I trust you. Can you tell me exactly what I need to do during this exercise?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the accident in detail, in the present tense, as if it's happening now. I'll guide you through it.",
    "Client: Okay, I think I can do that. Will you be asking me questions throughout, or do I just keep talking?",
    "Therapist: I'll mainly listen, occasionally asking for more detail. Remember, you're in control and can pause anytime.",
    "Client: Alright. I'm nervous, but I'm ready to try. How long will this session last?",
    "Therapist: We'll aim for about 30-45 minutes. How does that sound to you?",
    "Client: That's longer than I expected, but I'll do my best. Can we start with a shorter time and work up to that?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We can start with 15 minutes and gradually increase. Your comfort is important.",
    "Client: Thank you, that makes me feel better. I appreciate your flexibility and understanding. I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be to start this process.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Shall we begin with some deep breathing exercises?",
    "Client: Yes, please. That would help calm my nerves a bit. I'm glad you're here to guide me through this."
