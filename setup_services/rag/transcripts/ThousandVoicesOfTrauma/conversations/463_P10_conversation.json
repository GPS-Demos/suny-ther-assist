    "Therapist: Welcome, Rahul. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I... I think so. It's a bit daunting, to be honest. I've been feeling on edge all morning just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control. Let's start with your SUDS level.",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 6 or 7 out of 10. My palms are already sweaty.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. When you're ready, close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Alright... I'm... I'm 10 years old. We're visiting my grandparents in Chennai. It's a hot, sticky evening. The air feels heavy, like something's coming.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue in the present tense.",
    "Client: Right, sorry. I'm sitting on the veranda with my cousins. We're playing carrom, but I keep getting distracted by the wind. It's picking up, making the trees sway violently. My grandmother calls us inside. She sounds... worried.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... confused. A bit scared. The adults are rushing around, closing windows, gathering supplies. My little cousin starts crying, and I feel this knot forming in my stomach.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: The... the power goes out suddenly. It's pitch black, and I hear this... this roaring sound outside. Like a freight train, but louder. So much louder. I'm trembling. My dad pulls me close, and I can feel his heart racing too.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe an 8 now. God, I can almost smell the fear in that room.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're safe here. What do you see?",
    "Client: Flashes of light through the cracks in the shutters. The wind is howling, and there's this... this constant banging. Like the house is under attack. I hear glass shattering somewhere, and my mom lets out a scream. I've never heard her sound like that before.",
    "Therapist: Focus on your breathing. In and out. What else?",
    "Client: *voice shaking* Water. There's... there's water seeping under the door. It's rising so fast. My uncle is yelling something about getting to the roof, but I'm frozen. I can't move. The water's at my knees now, and I'm panicking. I can't... I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're safe, Rahul. Take a moment. Breathe with me.",
    "Client: *taking shaky breaths* Okay... okay. The water's so cold. We're wading through the house, and I'm clinging to my dad. The current is strong, pulling at my legs. I'm terrified I'll be swept away.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What's happening now?",
    "Client: We're... we're climbing onto the roof. The rain is pelting us, stinging my skin. I can hear people screaming from other houses. There's so much chaos. I see... oh god, I see a body floating by in the street below. I think it's our neighbor.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. Maybe higher. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Rahul. Remember, you survived this. What happens next?",
    "Client: We're huddled together on the roof. The wind is so strong, I'm afraid we'll be blown off. My mom is praying loudly, over and over. I'm shivering, soaked to the bone. The night seems endless. I keep thinking, \"This is how we die.\"",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What do you see, hear, feel?",
    "Client: I see... destruction everywhere. Trees uprooted, cars overturned. The water level keeps rising. I hear the creaking of our house, like it might collapse any moment. I feel... helpless. Completely at the mercy of nature.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. Take a deep breath. Continue.",
    "Client: As dawn breaks, the storm starts to subside. The water begins to recede, but the damage... it's unbelievable. Our neighborhood is unrecognizable. There's debris everywhere. The smell is awful - a mix of seawater, sewage, and... something worse.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm numb. Shocked. We climb down carefully, and I see my grandmother crying over her ruined family photos. It hits me then - we've lost everything. Our home, our possessions, our sense of security. I feel... hollow.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7 now. The immediate danger is past, but the aftermath... it's almost worse.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens in the days that follow?",
    "Client: It's... it's chaos. No electricity, no clean water. We're living off rations provided by relief workers. The heat is unbearable, and there's a constant fear of disease. I have nightmares every night, reliving the storm.",
    "Therapist: How does this experience affect you?",
    "Client: I... I become hyper-vigilant. Always watching the weather, panicking at the slightest rain. I struggle to sleep, afraid I'll wake up to another disaster. It's... it's like I lost my childhood that night. My sense of safety.",
    "Therapist: That's a heavy burden. How do you cope?",
    "Client: I... I try to control everything. My environment, my emotions. I become obsessed with being prepared for any emergency. But it never feels like enough. I'm always... always waiting for the next catastrophe.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about a 5. Talking about it... it's hard, but it also feels like releasing some pressure.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great courage. How do you feel about the experience now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still painful. But I can see how it shaped me. Made me resilient in some ways, but also left me with this constant anxiety. I guess... I'm still learning to feel safe again.",
