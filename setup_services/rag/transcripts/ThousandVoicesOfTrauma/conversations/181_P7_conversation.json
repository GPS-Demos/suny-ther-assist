    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the scene when you witnessed the violence?",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. It was a warm evening, and I was walking home from work. The streets were pretty quiet, but as I turned the corner, I saw two men arguing loudly. They were shouting at each other in a language I didn't understand. I felt my heart start to race...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: One of the men suddenly pushed the other, and then... oh god, he pulled out a knife. I froze on the spot, unable to move. The other man tried to back away, but he stumbled and fell. I wanted to run, to scream, to do something, but I just stood there, paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe now.",
    "Client: The man with the knife lunged forward, and I heard a terrible scream. There was so much blood... I can still see it so vividly. I finally managed to move, and I ran as fast as I could, not looking back. I felt so guilty for not helping, for not calling for help sooner. I... I can't shake that feeling.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: When I got home, I was shaking uncontrollably. I couldn't tell my husband what happened. I just locked myself in the bathroom and cried. For weeks after, I couldn't sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that man's face, the fear in his eyes. I kept thinking, what if that had been me? What if it had been someone I loved?",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Continue.",
    "Client: I started having nightmares. In them, I'm always the one with the knife, but I can't control my actions. I wake up in a cold sweat, feeling like a monster. It's affected my work, my relationships. I find myself constantly looking over my shoulder, expecting danger at every turn. I feel like I can't trust anyone anymore.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here now.",
    "Client: The worst part is the guilt. I know logically that there was nothing I could have done, but I can't help feeling responsible somehow. Like if I had just been braver, or acted faster, maybe things would have turned out differently. It's eating me up inside, and I don't know how to let it go.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel this way. You're processing it well.",
    "Client: Sometimes, I find myself avoiding that street, taking long detours just so I don't have to pass by that corner. I've become hyper-aware of any arguments or raised voices around me. It's like I'm constantly on edge, waiting for something terrible to happen. I miss feeling safe in my own neighborhood, in my own skin.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. Keep going.",
    "Client: I've started to question everything. Why did this happen? Why did I have to witness it? It's made me realize how fragile life is, how quickly everything can change. I find myself hugging my kids tighter, telling my husband I love him more often. But at the same time, I'm terrified of losing them, of something happening to them that I can't prevent.",
    "Therapist: You're doing so well. Stay with these feelings.",
    "Client: Sometimes, I wonder about the men involved. Who were they? What led to that moment? I catch myself making up stories about their lives, trying to understand how people can do such violent things. It's like I'm obsessed with finding some kind of meaning in what happened, but I know there might not be any.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great insight. Continue exploring.",
    "Client: The hardest part is feeling like I've lost a part of myself. I used to be more carefree, more trusting. Now, I feel like I'm constantly on guard. I miss the person I was before this happened. I want to feel normal again, but I'm not sure if that's even possible. Will I ever be able to walk down a street without feeling afraid?",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have these questions. You're processing well.",
    "Client: I've tried to talk to friends about it, but they don't seem to understand. They tell me to just get over it, that it wasn't my fault. But they don't know what it's like to carry this weight, to see that scene play out in my mind over and over again. I feel so alone sometimes, like no one can really understand what I'm going through.",
    "Therapist: You're not alone. I'm here with you.",
    "Client: I know we're working on this, but sometimes I wonder if I'll ever truly heal. Will I always carry this with me? I want to move forward, to find a way to live with what happened without letting it control me. But right now, it feels like such an impossible task. I'm trying to be strong, but some days, it's just so overwhelming.",
