    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Going back to that moment in Afghanistan, reliving the chaos and fear... it's intense. I can still hear the explosions and smell the smoke. My heart is racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The faces. The terrified faces of the civilians we were trying to evacuate. Especially this young girl... she couldn't have been more than 10. Her eyes were so wide, so scared. And then when the mortar hit nearby... God, the screaming. I feel like I failed them somehow.",
    "Therapist: How does that feeling of failure connect to your daily life now?",
    "Client: I guess... I often feel like I'm not doing enough. Like I should be doing more to help people. It's probably why I throw myself into my work so much. But then I get overwhelmed and depressed because I can't save everyone. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: I see. How did it feel to share that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... hard. Really hard. But also, I don't know, maybe a little liberating? Like I've been carrying this weight for so long, and finally letting some of it out. I'm surprised I could talk about it without completely breaking down.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. What do you think made that possible?",
    "Client: I think... maybe it's because I feel safe here? With you? And also, I'm starting to realize that what happened wasn't my fault. I did everything I could in an impossible situation. It's still painful, but I'm beginning to see it differently.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. How might this new perspective affect you?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I can start being a little kinder to myself? Not push myself so hard all the time. And maybe... maybe I can start talking about my experiences more, especially with other veterans. I've been avoiding that for so long.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like positive steps. What else comes to mind?",
    "Client: I'm also thinking about the racial aspect of it all. Being a South East Asian woman in the military... it wasn't always easy. Sometimes I felt like I had to prove myself twice as much. And now, dealing with PTSD, I feel like there's this added layer of... I don't know, shame? Like I'm letting my community down by struggling.",
    "Therapist: How does that impact your healing process?",
    "Client: It makes it harder to reach out for help, that's for sure. There's this expectation to be strong, to not show weakness. But going through this therapy, I'm starting to see that asking for help is actually a sign of strength. It's just... it's a process, you know?",
    "Therapist: Indeed. What's one thing you'd like to focus on before our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I want to try talking to my sister about some of this. We've always been close, but I've kept my war experiences from her. Maybe sharing a little bit might help me feel less alone in this.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful goal. How do you feel about today's session?",
    "Client: Tired, but... good. Like I've done something important. Thank you for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I think it's helping. I'm starting to have hope that I can work through this and find some peace.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength today, Sarah. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: No, I think that's all for today. I'm looking forward to processing this more and seeing where it leads. It's scary, but I'm feeling more ready to face these memories and move forward.",
    "Therapist: You've made significant progress. We'll continue next week. Take care."
