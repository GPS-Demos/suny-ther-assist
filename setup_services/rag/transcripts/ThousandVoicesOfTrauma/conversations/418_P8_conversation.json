    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. My heart is still racing, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's like I'm right back there, you know? I can still hear the growling, the snarling... It's so vivid.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. How I froze when I saw that dog charging at me. I... I should have run, or fought back, or something. But I just stood there, paralyzed. And then the pain... God, the pain was excruciating. I can almost feel it now, you know? Like phantom pains where it bit me.",
    "Therapist: It sounds like you're experiencing some intense physical sensations. Can you tell me more about that?",
    "Client: Yeah, um... My palms are sweaty, and I feel this trembling in my legs. It's like my body wants to run, even though I know I'm safe here. And there's this knot in my stomach, like I might be sick. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: How does this compare to how you felt immediately after the attack?",
    "Client: It's... it's similar, but not as intense. Back then, I was in shock, I think. I couldn't process what had happened. Now, it's like... I'm reliving it, but I'm also aware that I survived. It's a strange mix of terror and... I don't know, maybe relief? But mostly, I just feel so angry. Angry at the dog, angry at its owner, angry at myself for not doing more.",
    "Therapist: What do you make of that anger?",
    "Client: I... I've never really let myself feel it before. I've always tried to be understanding, you know? Like, \"Oh, it was just an animal acting on instinct.\" But the truth is, I'm furious. That dog could have killed me. And its owner... they were so careless. They changed my life forever, and for what? Because they couldn't be bothered to use a leash?",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to acknowledge that anger?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually kind of liberating. I've spent so long trying to be the \"good victim,\" you know? Always understanding, always forgiving. But I have a right to be angry, don't I? This wasn't my fault. I didn't ask for this to happen to me.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing about your emotions right now?",
    "Client: I... I'm surprised by how much sadness I'm feeling. It's like... I'm mourning for the person I was before the attack. I used to love animals, you know? I had dreams of maybe opening a pet shelter someday. But now... now I can't even walk past a dog without panicking. It's like that attack stole a part of me, a part I'll never get back.",
    "Therapist: How does that loss feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like this heavy weight in my chest. Like I can't take a full breath. And there's this lump in my throat, like I want to cry but I can't. It's... it's suffocating, almost. Like I'm drowning in all these emotions I've been holding back for so long.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to let myself feel all of this. The anger, the sadness, the fear... I've been pushing it all down for so long. Maybe... maybe if I let myself really feel it, I can start to move past it? I don't know. It's scary to think about facing all of this head-on.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea of facing your emotions make you feel?",
    "Client: It's terrifying, honestly. But also... maybe a little hopeful? Like, maybe if I can face this memory, really process it, I can start to take back some control. Maybe I won't always feel this helpless. I... I want to be able to walk down the street without constantly looking over my shoulder, you know?",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to you to regain that sense of safety?",
    "Client: It would mean everything. I've felt so trapped since the attack, like I'm a prisoner in my own life. To be able to go out without this constant fear... to maybe even be around dogs again someday... it seems impossible right now, but God, I want that so badly. I want to feel like myself again.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about your progress in therapy so far?",
    "Client: I... I'm proud of myself, actually. A few months ago, I couldn't even talk about the attack without having a panic attack. And now... well, it's still hard, but I'm doing it. I'm facing it. That's... that's something, right? It's a start, at least.",
    "Therapist: What's giving you the strength to keep going?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's the hope that things can get better. That I don't have to live like this forever. And... and maybe a bit of anger, too. I don't want that dog, that attack, to have this much power over me anymore. I want my life back. I want to be able to go for walks without fear, to maybe even have a dog of my own again someday. I... I want to be whole again.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to express that desire?",
    "Client: It's... it's empowering, actually. Like I'm taking a stand. For so long, I've felt like a victim. But now... now I feel like I'm fighting back. Not against the dog, but against what the attack did to me. I'm... I'm reclaiming myself, I guess. It's scary, but it also feels right. Like this is the path I need to take to heal.",
    "Therapist: What do you want to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I... I think I want to dig deeper into this anger. It's still so new to me, allowing myself to feel it. Maybe we could explore where it's coming from, what it means? And... and maybe start talking about how I can feel safe again. Baby steps, you know? But... but steps forward.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, honestly. But also... lighter, somehow? Like I've set down a burden I've been carrying for too long. I'm nervous about what comes next, but... but I think I'm ready to face it. Thank you for... for helping me through this. For making me feel safe enough to confront these memories.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today. We'll end here for now. Take care of yourself this week.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I will. See you next week."
