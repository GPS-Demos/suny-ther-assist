    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart's still racing, and I feel kind of shaky. It's like I'm back there, you know? The comments, the threats... they all feel so real again.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: It's this intense feeling of fear and shame. I keep seeing those messages pop up on my screen, one after another. Each notification was like a punch to the gut. I remember feeling so exposed, like everyone could see all my vulnerabilities. It's... it's hard to shake that feeling, even now.",
    "Therapist: I hear how difficult that was. Can you tell me more about those physical sensations?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, like I can't get enough air. My hands are clammy, and there's this knot in my stomach. It reminds me of how I felt during my deployment, always on edge, never knowing when the next attack might come. But this... this was different. The attacks were coming from everywhere, from people I didn't even know.",
    "Therapist: How do those sensations compare to what you experienced during the actual event?",
    "Client: They're... they're similar, but not as intense. Back then, I couldn't eat or sleep for days. I was constantly checking my phone, my social media, dreading what I might find. Now, it's like an echo of that feeling. It's there, but I know I'm here in this room, safe. It's... it's strange how the body remembers.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how unfair it all was. I mean, I was just trying to share my experiences, to help other veterans. And suddenly, I was being called a liar, a fake, even a traitor. Part of me still wonders if I did something wrong, if I deserved it somehow. But then I get angry, because I know I didn't. It's... it's confusing.",
    "Therapist: It sounds like you're grappling with some complex emotions. How do you feel about confronting these memories?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. Really hard. But also, I don't know, maybe a little empowering? Like, I'm facing this thing that's had so much power over me. I've been avoiding anything to do with social media for so long, and now I'm talking about it. It's scary, but... maybe it's a step forward?",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much this experience has affected me. Not just the cyberbullying, but how it connected to my war experiences. Both left me feeling so... vulnerable and alone. But talking about it now, I'm starting to see that I'm stronger than I thought. I survived both of those things. Maybe... maybe I can get through this too.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it feel to acknowledge that strength?",
    "Client: It's... it's kind of surprising, actually. I've spent so long feeling weak and broken. But you're right, I did survive. I'm here, talking about it. That's... that's something, isn't it? It's like a tiny spark of hope. I haven't felt that in a long time.",
    "Therapist: Indeed it is. What do you think this means for your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I think... I think it means I'm not as stuck as I thought I was. Maybe I can start to reclaim some of the things I've lost. Like, maybe I can start connecting with people online again, but in a safer way. Or share my experiences without fear. It's scary to think about, but also... exciting? Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. How does this new perspective sit with you?",
    "Client: It feels... good. Uncomfortable, but good. Like I'm seeing a way forward for the first time in a long time. I know it won't be easy, and I'm sure I'll have setbacks. But just knowing that I can face these memories and not fall apart... it's huge. I feel like I'm starting to see myself as a survivor, not just a victim.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant shift. What do you think has contributed to this change?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's been a combination of things. These sessions, for sure. Being able to talk about my experiences without judgment has been really important. And I guess... time? Distance from the events has given me a different perspective. Also, maybe just the act of facing these memories head-on. It's like... the more I look at them, the less power they have over me.",
    "Therapist: That's a valuable insight. How might you apply this moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to keep facing these things, bit by bit. Maybe I can start small, like looking at social media for short periods, or sharing something small online. And reminding myself that I'm strong enough to handle whatever comes. It's scary, but... I think it's necessary. I don't want to let fear control my life anymore.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful approach. How are you feeling now, compared to when we started?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, I guess? Still a bit shaky, but not as overwhelmed. It's like I've put down a heavy backpack I didn't even know I was carrying. I'm tired, but it's a good kind of tired. Like I've accomplished something important. And I feel... I don't know, maybe a little proud of myself? Is that okay to say?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to work on some specific strategies for dealing with online interactions. Maybe we could talk about setting boundaries, or how to respond if I encounter negativity again? I want to feel more prepared, you know? And maybe we could explore more about how my war experiences and the cyberbullying are connected. I feel like there's more to unpack there.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Is there anything else you'd like to add before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I guess. For listening, for guiding me through this. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I might actually get there. It's... it's a good feeling.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. I'll see you next week."
