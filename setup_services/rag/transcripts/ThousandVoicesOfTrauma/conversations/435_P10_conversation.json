    "Therapist: Welcome, Amir. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a knot in my stomach. I know we're going to talk about my time in prison, and it's bringing up a lot of mixed emotions.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to work through this together. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see the cold, gray walls of the cell. The light is dim, filtering through a small, barred window. I can smell the mustiness of the place, mixed with disinfectant. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Um, maybe a 60? My heart's starting to race a bit.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. What's happening now?",
    "Client: I'm sitting on the hard bunk, my back against the wall. The mattress is thin, barely there. I can hear... I can hear footsteps echoing down the corridor. It's making me tense up.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking, \"How did I end up here?\" I'm innocent, but nobody believes me. I feel so... so helpless. My chest is tightening.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Amir. Remember, you're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: The footsteps are getting closer. I can hear keys jingling. Oh God, I'm starting to panic. What if they're coming for me? What if... what if they're going to hurt me?",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. Where are you right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in your office. I'm safe. Okay. Okay, I can do this.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, go back to that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: The cell door opens. A guard stands there, his face stern. He's telling me to come with him. I'm... I'm shaking as I stand up. My legs feel weak.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 75. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Amir. Keep going. What happens as you leave the cell?",
    "Client: We're walking down the corridor. The fluorescent lights are harsh, making everything look sickly. Other prisoners are watching from their cells. I can feel their eyes on me. It's... it's humiliating.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... I'm thinking about my parents. How disappointed they must be. How I've let everyone down. I... I feel so ashamed.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're observing these thoughts. They're not defining you.",
    "Client: Right. Okay. We're... we're entering a room now. It's the infirmary. The smell of antiseptic is strong. There's a doctor there, looking impatient.",
    "Therapist: What happens in the infirmary?",
    "Client: The guard tells me to sit on the examination table. The paper crinkles under me. The doctor... he barely looks at me. He's asking about my chronic pain, but he doesn't seem to care about my answers.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Angry. Frustrated. I want to yell at him, tell him to actually listen to me. But I... I can't. I just sit there, answering his questions quietly.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Amir. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 80. My hands are clenched. I can feel my nails digging into my palms.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: The doctor... he's prescribing something. But it's not what I need. I try to explain that it won't help with my specific pain, but he cuts me off. He's... he's treating me like I'm just trying to score drugs.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly frustrating. How do you react?",
    "Client: I... I feel this surge of anger. I stand up, my voice rising. I'm telling him that he's not listening, that he's not doing his job. The guard steps closer, looking threatening. I... I sit back down, deflated.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Amir. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My chest feels tight. It's hard to breathe.",
    "Therapist: Let's take a moment. Focus on your breath. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. That helps a bit.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue with what happened next.",
    "Client: The guard... he's escorting me back to my cell. I feel... I feel defeated. Hopeless. The pain in my body seems worse now, like it's amplified by the frustration and fear.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind as you walk back?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... I'm thinking that this is my life now. That I'll never be heard, never be believed. That I'll always be seen as just another criminal, even though I'm innocent.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those thoughts. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's at 85 now. My stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well, Amir. Keep going.",
    "Client: We're back at my cell. The door clangs shut behind me. The sound... it's so final. I sink onto the bunk, my head in my hands. I can feel tears starting to form, but I'm fighting them back.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to let those emotions out, Amir. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I start to cry. Quietly at first, then it turns into sobs. I'm thinking about my life before this, my family, my career. It all seems so far away now.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you feel in your body?",
    "Client: My shoulders are shaking. My throat feels tight. There's this... this heaviness in my chest. It's like I can't get enough air.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Amir. Take a deep breath. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I lie down on the bunk. The ceiling above me is cracked and stained. I trace the patterns with my eyes, trying to distract myself from the pain, both physical and emotional.",
    "Therapist: How long do you stay like that?",
    "Client: It feels like hours. The light from the window changes, getting dimmer. I can hear the sounds of the prison around me - distant shouts, the clang of metal doors.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 70. I feel... I feel drained.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Can you describe what you're feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel a strange mix of emptiness and resignation. Like... like I'm starting to accept this as my reality. But there's also this tiny spark of defiance left. A part of me that refuses to give up.",
    "Therapist: Hold onto that feeling. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I sit up slowly. My body aches. I reach under my pillow and pull out a small photo of my family. I look at their faces, trying to draw strength from them.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful image, Amir. How does looking at the photo make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's bittersweet. I miss them so much it hurts. But seeing their faces also reminds me of why I need to stay strong. Why I can't give up.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible resilience. What happens as the day comes to an end?",
    "Client: The lights in the corridor dim. It's time for lights out. I can hear the other prisoners settling down for the night. I... I curl up on my side, still holding the photo.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking as you try to fall asleep?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm making a promise to myself. That I'll fight this. That I'll prove my innocence. That this won't break me. It's... it's hard to believe it in this moment, but I'm trying.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful commitment, Amir. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Emotionally drained. But there's also this... this small sense of accomplishment. Like I've faced something difficult and made it through.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today, Amir. What's your distress level as we end this session?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 50 now. I feel wrung out, but... but also a bit lighter. Like I've let go of something I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's take a few deep breaths together as we close the session.",
    "Client: Okay. *takes deep breaths* Thank you... thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You did all the hard work, Amir. I'm proud of the courage you've shown today. How are you feeling about ending our session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. Tired, but okay. I think... I think this helped. It was hard, but I feel like I understand that experience better now.",
    "Therapist: That's great to hear. Remember to be kind to yourself for the rest of the day. We'll process this more in our next session.",
    "Client: Alright. I will. Thank you again.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Amir. Take care, and I'll see you next time."
