    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming right now. My heart's still racing, and I feel like I can't catch my breath. The memory of that animal attack... it's so vivid. I can still hear the growling, you know? It's like I'm right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... anger? I'm angry that I froze. I should have been able to do something, anything. I was trained for combat situations, for God's sake! But when that dog lunged at me, I just... I couldn't move. It's like all my training went out the window.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's hot. Like a burning in my chest. My fists are clenched, and I want to hit something. But at the same time, I feel this heaviness in my stomach. It's like disappointment and shame mixed together. I let myself down, you know?",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"I'm weak. I'm a coward.\" And then I hear my drill sergeant's voice in my head, telling me I'm a disgrace. But... but another part of me is trying to be rational. It's saying, \"You were caught off guard. It wasn't a combat situation. It's okay.\" But it doesn't feel okay. Nothing about this feels okay.",
    "Therapist: How do these conflicting thoughts affect you?",
    "Client: They're tearing me apart, honestly. It's like there's a war in my head. One side is beating me up, and the other is trying to defend me. But the critical voice is so much louder. It's exhausting. And it bleeds into everything else in my life. I feel like I can't trust myself anymore. How can I have a normal life if I can't even handle a dog attack?",
    "Therapist: What do you mean by \"normal life\"?",
    "Client: You know, like... having a relationship, maybe starting a family someday. Holding down a job without constantly looking over my shoulder. Being able to walk down the street without flinching at every loud noise. Just... being okay. But right now, that feels impossible. I'm always on edge, always waiting for the next attack. And it's not just about dogs anymore. It's everything.",
    "Therapist: How does this experience connect to your time in combat?",
    "Client: I... wow, I hadn't really thought about that connection before. But now that you mention it... it's like that dog attack brought back all the feelings of helplessness I experienced in combat. The unpredictability, the constant threat... it's all the same. And just like with the dog, there were times in combat when I froze. I've never told anyone that before. It feels... it feels shameful to admit.",
    "Therapist: What's it like to share that now?",
    "Client: It's... it's terrifying. But also... I don't know, maybe a little relieving? Like a weight I've been carrying for so long is finally being set down. I've been so scared of anyone finding out, of being judged. But saying it out loud... it doesn't feel as world-ending as I thought it would. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it does. How does this realization impact your view of yourself?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me still wants to judge myself harshly. But another part... it's like I'm seeing myself through new eyes. Maybe I'm not weak. Maybe I'm just human. And maybe... maybe that's okay? It's a strange feeling. Like, for the first time, I'm allowing myself to be imperfect. It's scary, but also... kind of freeing?",
    "Therapist: What does this mean for your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I think... I think it means I need to be kinder to myself. To recognize that what I've been through - both in combat and with the dog attack - it's a lot for anyone to handle. And maybe instead of beating myself up for how I reacted, I can focus on how I'm still here, still trying to get better. It's not going to be easy, but... I think I'm ready to try. To really try, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, honestly. But it's a different kind of tired. Not the heavy, hopeless kind I'm used to. It's more like... I've done something important. Like I've taken a step forward, even if it's a small one. I still feel shaky and a bit raw, but there's this tiny spark of... hope, maybe? It's small, but it's there. And that's... that's something new.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to explore this idea of self-compassion more. And maybe... maybe start looking at how I can apply it to other areas of my life? Like, how can I be kinder to myself at work, or in my relationships? It's all connected, isn't it? The combat experiences, the dog attack, my depression... it's all part of the same story. And if I can start changing how I see one part, maybe it can help with the rest?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great plan. How do you feel about ending our session here?",
    "Client: I think I'm ready. This was... intense. But good intense, you know? I feel like I've uncovered something important. Thank you for... for guiding me through this. For helping me see things differently. I know we have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can do this.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Take care of yourself, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. I will. See you next week."
