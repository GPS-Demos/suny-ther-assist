    "Therapist: Alright, Ms. Johnson, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day of imprisonment.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm there. The cell is cold and damp. The concrete walls feel like they're closing in on me. I can hear the distant sound of metal doors clanging shut.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: It's about a 5... no, maybe a 6.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: My heart is starting to race. I remember feeling so helpless, so alone. The guard's footsteps echo down the hallway, getting closer. I'm terrified of what might happen next.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. SUDS?",
    "Client: It's gone up to an 8. My palms are sweating, and I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Stay with it if you can.",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) The guard is yelling at me, calling me names. I feel so small, so worthless. I want to disappear into the wall. My whole body is shaking.",
    "Therapist: SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep going if you can.",
    "Client: (Sobbing) I can't take it anymore. The isolation, the constant fear. I feel like I'm losing my mind. Why is this happening to me? What did I do to deserve this?",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. SUDS?",
    "Client: Still a 9. My chest feels so tight. I can barely breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) The guard leaves, but the fear doesn't. I'm left alone with my thoughts, replaying every horrible moment. I feel so hopeless.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down a bit. Maybe an 8?",
    "Therapist: That's good. Keep describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The hours drag by. I try to distract myself, but the memories keep flooding back. I feel so angry at the injustice, but also so powerless.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 7 now. I'm starting to feel a little calmer, but still shaky.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Continue.",

    "Therapist: You should be proud. Let's end here. Open your eyes when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Opens eyes, wiping tears) That was intense. But I did it.",
    "Therapist: You did wonderfully. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Drained, but... lighter somehow. Like I've released something.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. We'll process this next time. Well done today."
