    "Therapist: Alright, Maria. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that moment in the hospital...",
    "Client: Okay... I'm there. The white walls, the beeping machines... I can smell the antiseptic. My heart's already racing.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's happening?",
    "Client: The doctor just walked in. He's holding my test results. His face is so serious... I knew something was wrong. I felt like I couldn't breathe.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um... probably a 6. My palms are sweating just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Keep going.",
    "Client: He told me I needed immediate surgery. I couldn't process it. I felt like the room was spinning. I remember thinking, \"This can't be happening to me.\" I was so scared of dying on the operating table.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. It's hard to breathe. Maybe a 7 or 8 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a deep breath. What happened next?",
    "Client: They rushed me to pre-op. Everything was a blur. I remember feeling so alone, even though my husband was there. The anesthesiologist came in, and suddenly it hit me - I might not wake up. I started crying...",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I can feel the panic rising, just like it did then.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep breathing. What do you notice in your body?",
    "Client: My heart's pounding. I feel dizzy, like I might faint. It's just like that day...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're doing well.",
    "Client: The nurse was trying to comfort me, but I couldn't stop shaking. They were about to wheel me into the OR, and I remember thinking about my kids, wondering if I'd ever see them again. It was terrifying.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: Still... still a 9. I feel so helpless, reliving this.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're safe here. What happened as they took you into the OR?",
    "Client: The lights were so bright. I was shivering, partly from fear and partly from the cold. The anesthesiologist put the mask on my face, and I panicked. I tried to push it away, but they held me down. I felt like I was suffocating...",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 10 now. I can barely breathe...",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe with me. You're here, you're safe.",
    "Client: (Taking deep breaths) Okay... okay. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's pause the memory here. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Shaken. My heart's still racing, but... I made it through. I didn't think I could face this memory.",
    "Therapist: You did incredibly well. How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's coming down... maybe a 7?",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What did you learn from this exercise?",
    "Client: I... I guess I'm stronger than I thought. Reliving it was awful, but... I survived it again, didn't I?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. You showed immense courage. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's tough, but... I think it's helping. I want to keep going.",
    "Therapist: I'm proud of you, Maria. We'll end here for today. Let's practice some grounding exercises before you leave..."
