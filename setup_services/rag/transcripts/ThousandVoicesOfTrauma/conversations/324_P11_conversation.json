    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving that plane crash... it's like I was right back there, you know? The screaming, the chaos, the smell of smoke... it's all so vivid. I can still feel my heart racing.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. Watching people panic, not being able to do anything... God, it was awful. And the guilt... I survived when others didn't. Why me? I keep seeing their faces, hearing their cries for help. It's... it's just too much sometimes.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your daily life now?",
    "Client: Well, I... I guess I'm always on edge, waiting for something terrible to happen. I avoid flying at all costs, which impacts my work. And I've been drinking more to numb these feelings. It's affecting my relationship with my husband too. He doesn't understand why I can't just \"get over it.\"",
    "Therapist: I see. How did today's session feel different?",
    "Client: It was... harder, but also... I don't know, maybe a bit cathartic? Talking about it here, in this safe space... it's different. I felt like I could let some of that pent-up emotion out without judgment. But it's still so raw, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. What's your takeaway?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe it's okay to feel these things? That I don't have to keep pushing it down or drowning it in alcohol. It's part of me now, but perhaps it doesn't have to control me. Is that... is that right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How might you apply this?",
    "Client: I could... maybe try talking to my husband about it more? And perhaps cut back on the drinking. It's not really helping anyway. But it's scary to face this head-on without that crutch.",
    "Therapist: That's brave. Any other thoughts?",
    "Client: I'm just... tired. Tired of carrying this weight. But also... maybe a little hopeful? Like maybe, just maybe, I can learn to live with this without it consuming me. Is that possible?",
    "Therapist: It is. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: Scared, but... I think I need to. For myself, for my husband. I can't keep living like this. It's hard, but... I want to try. I want to reclaim my life, you know? To be able to think about that day without falling apart. To maybe even fly again someday. Is that too much to hope for?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. What's your next step?",
    "Client: I think... I'll talk to my husband tonight. Really talk. And maybe look into some support groups for survivors? I've been avoiding those, but... maybe it would help to connect with others who understand. And I'll commit to our next session, even though it scares me. I need to keep pushing through this.",
    "Therapist: Excellent plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, but... okay. Better than I expected, actually. Thank you for... for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I think it's necessary. I just hope I can keep up this courage between sessions.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Anything else?",
    "Client: No, I... I think that's all for now. Just... thank you. For listening, for not judging. It means more than you know. I'll see you next week?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Take care, Mrs. Johnson."
