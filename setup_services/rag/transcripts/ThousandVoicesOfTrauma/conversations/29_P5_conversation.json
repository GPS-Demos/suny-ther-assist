    "Therapist: Good morning, Carlos. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Morning, Dr. Martinez. I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares lately about my time in combat, and it's affecting my sleep. My wife says I've been more irritable too.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you ready to discuss it?",
    "Client: I think so. What exactly does that mean, though? It sounds a bit intimidating.",
    "Therapist: It's revisiting your trauma memory in a safe environment. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: Honestly, doc? It scares me. I've spent years trying to forget those experiences. The idea of purposely remembering them... it's unsettling. But if you think it'll help, I'm willing to try. I'm just worried about how I'll react.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. Can you elaborate on your worries?",
    "Client: Well, what if I completely lose it? I mean, sometimes when I have flashbacks at home, I feel like I'm right back there in the war zone. My heart races, I start sweating, and I can even smell the gunpowder. What if that happens here? And... what if I can't pull myself out of it?",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace and I'll guide you throughout. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's somewhat reassuring. But still, it's a lot to process. I've been dealing with this for so long, and it's affected every aspect of my life - my work, my marriage, even how I interact with my kids. I guess I'm just hoping this will finally make a difference. Can you tell me more about what to expect during the session?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the memory in present tense. I'll support you throughout. Any questions?",
    "Client: Present tense? That sounds intense. I'm not sure I can do that without getting overwhelmed. And how long will we be doing this for? Also, what if I start to panic or feel like it's too much?",
    "Therapist: We'll start with 30 minutes. You can pause anytime. Your safety is priority.",
    "Client: Okay, that's good to know. I appreciate that you're looking out for my well-being. I have to admit, even though I'm nervous, there's a part of me that's hopeful. I'm tired of letting these memories control my life. If this can help me move past them, even a little, it'll be worth it. Is there anything I should do to prepare myself?",
    "Therapist: Just be open and honest. Your courage is admirable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Martinez. That means a lot coming from you. I know it won't be easy, but I'm ready to face this. Let's do it. I just hope... I hope this will help me be more present for my family. They've been so patient with me through all of this.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is inspiring. Remember, we're in this together. Ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I'm ready. Let's face these demons head-on. I trust you, doc. Lead the way."
