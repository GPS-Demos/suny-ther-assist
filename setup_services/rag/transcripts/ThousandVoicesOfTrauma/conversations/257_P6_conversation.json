    "Therapist: Alright, let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling pretty nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with your current SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10 right now. Just thinking about it is making me anxious.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath and begin describing the memory.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm back at the cult compound. It's late at night, and I'm in my small, dimly lit room. The air feels heavy, and I can hear muffled voices outside. Suddenly, there's a knock at my door. My heart starts racing because I know it's him - the leader. He comes in, smiling that fake, gentle smile of his. I feel frozen, unable to move or speak.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. My palms are getting sweaty, and I feel a knot in my stomach.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: He sits on the edge of my bed, telling me how special I am, how I've been chosen. His hand reaches out to touch my face, and I want to scream, but no sound comes out. I can smell his cologne, and it makes me feel sick. He starts to... to touch me, and I'm paralyzed with fear and confusion.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. I feel like I can't breathe. My chest is so tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (deep breath) Okay... He's undressing me now, and I'm silently crying. I feel so ashamed and helpless. I keep thinking, \"Why me? Why is this happening?\" The room feels like it's spinning, and I'm trying to disconnect from my body.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: Still an 8. My hands are shaking, and I feel nauseous.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: It hurts... physically and emotionally. I want it to be over. I'm staring at the ceiling, counting the cracks, trying to be anywhere else. When he finally leaves, I curl up into a ball and sob silently. I feel so dirty and used.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone down a bit, maybe a 7. I feel drained, but also angry.",
    "Therapist: That anger is a normal response. Continue.",

    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's back up to an 8. I'm feeling really overwhelmed and sad.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You're processing a lot.",
    "Client: Yeah... I keep replaying it in my mind, wondering if there was something I could have done differently. I feel guilty for not fighting back or telling someone. It's like I'm carrying this heavy secret that's eating me up inside.",
    "Therapist: Current SUDS?",
    "Client: It's stayed at an 8. My heart is still racing, and I feel kind of dizzy.",
    "Therapist: Take a few deep breaths. You're doing well.",
    "Client: (breathing deeply) It's hard to talk about this... but I also feel a sense of relief. Like I'm finally acknowledging what happened instead of trying to bury it.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's come down to a 6. I still feel shaky, but a bit calmer.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's start wrapping up the exercise.",
    "Client: Okay. As I think about it now, I realize how much that experience has affected me. It's why I have trouble trusting people and why I sometimes feel so anxious in social situations. But talking about it... it feels like I'm taking some of its power away.",
    "Therapist: And your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: I'd say it's at a 5 now. I feel exhausted but also a bit lighter.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful? Like maybe I can actually work through this.",
