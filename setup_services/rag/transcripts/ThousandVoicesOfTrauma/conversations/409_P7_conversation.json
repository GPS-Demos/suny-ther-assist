    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit anxious, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about my experiences as a refugee, and it's bringing up a lot of emotions.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We'll take it slow.",
    "Client: Okay. I guess I should start with the day we had to leave our home. It was early morning, and we could hear gunfire in the distance. My mother was frantically packing whatever she could into a small suitcase. I remember the fear in her eyes...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: We left everything behind. Our house, our memories, even my father's ashes. He had passed away just a year before, and leaving his urn felt like losing him all over again. As we were running towards the bus station, I kept looking back at our house, wondering if I'd ever see it again.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling.",
    "Client: It's hard. I feel a tightness in my chest, like I can't breathe. The guilt of leaving my father's ashes behind... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. It's okay to feel this way.",
    "Client: The journey was brutal. We were crammed into a small boat with dozens of other people. The smell of sweat and fear was suffocating. I held onto my mother's hand so tightly, afraid that if I let go, I'd lose her too. The waves were rough, and people were getting seasick. I remember a young child crying non-stop...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: We finally reached the shore after what felt like an eternity. But the relief was short-lived. We were herded into a refugee camp. The conditions were horrible - not enough food, no privacy, constant fear of violence. I felt so helpless, so angry at the world. Why did this have to happen to us?",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. Continue.",
    "Client: One night, I overheard my mother crying softly. She thought I was asleep. She was whispering my father's name, begging for forgiveness for leaving him behind. It broke my heart. I wanted to comfort her, but I felt so powerless. I just lay there, pretending to be asleep, tears silently rolling down my face.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. Reliving these memories is exhausting. But there's also a strange sense of relief, like I'm finally letting out something I've been holding in for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard, but I think it's helping. Can we take a short break?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's pause here."
