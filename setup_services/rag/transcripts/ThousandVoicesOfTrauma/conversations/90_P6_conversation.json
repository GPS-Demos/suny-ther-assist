    "Therapist: Alright, Mr. Johnson, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, you can stop at any time. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with your SUDS rating. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 40. My heart's beating a little faster than usual.",
    "Therapist: Okay, thank you. Now, close your eyes and bring yourself back to that night of the home invasion. Describe what you see and feel.",
    "Client: I... I'm in my living room. It's dark, maybe around 10 PM. I hear a noise at the back door. At first, I think it's just the wind, but then I hear it again. It's more distinct this time. My hands start to shake a little.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: The noise gets louder. I realize someone's trying to break in. I... I feel frozen. My throat's dry, and I can't seem to move. Then I hear glass breaking. Oh God, they're inside now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 65 now. My palms are sweating, and my heart's racing.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I see a shadow moving in the hallway. It's tall, menacing. I want to run, but my legs won't move. I'm trembling all over. The intruder enters the living room, and I can see the glint of a knife in his hand. I feel so helpless, so scared.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for facing this memory. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My SUDS is probably around 80. I feel like I can't breathe properly. My chest is tight.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. This is just a memory. Take another deep breath.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. The intruder sees me and starts moving towards me. I finally find my voice and yell for help. He lunges at me, and I manage to dodge, but I stumble and fall. I can smell his breath, feel his weight on me as he pins me down. I'm fighting, struggling, but he's so strong.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's 90. I feel like I'm right back there. My whole body's shaking.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're safe here. Can you tell me what happens next?",
    "Client: I... I hear sirens in the distance. The intruder panics and runs. I'm left there on the floor, gasping for air, feeling like my heart might burst out of my chest. I can't stop shaking. I feel so violated, so vulnerable in my own home.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My SUDS is still high, maybe 85. I feel drained, but also... relieved? Like I've faced something I've been avoiding for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. You've done excellent work today. Let's start winding down. Take some deep breaths with me.",
    "Client: (Breathing deeply) Okay... I think I'm starting to calm down a bit.",
    "Therapist: Good. As we end, what's your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's come down to about 60. I still feel shaky, but not as overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How are you feeling overall about this session?",
    "Client: It was tough, but... I feel like I've taken a step forward. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You did all the hard work. We'll continue to process this next time. For now, let's focus on grounding techniques to help you transition out of this memory."
