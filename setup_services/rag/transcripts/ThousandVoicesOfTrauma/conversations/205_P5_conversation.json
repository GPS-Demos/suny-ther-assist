    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares lately about my time in the war zone, and it's affecting my sleep and mood. My husband says I've been more irritable, too.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you familiar with it?",
    "Client: Not really. I've heard you mention it before, but I'm not sure what it involves. Is it going to make things worse?",
    "Therapist: It's a technique to process traumatic memories. Can you share your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about reliving those horrible experiences. I've spent years trying to forget them. Won't talking about them in detail just bring everything back and make me feel worse? I'm not sure I'm strong enough to handle that right now, especially with everything else going on in my life.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. The goal is to reduce PTSD symptoms over time. Shall I explain more?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I want to understand what I'm getting into. It's just... I've been feeling so low lately, and the idea of stirring up those memories is frightening. But I also know I can't keep going on like this. My work is suffering, and I'm not being the partner I want to be for my husband. So, I'm willing to listen and try to understand how this might help.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for your openness. We'll revisit memories gradually, in a safe environment. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It sounds scary, but also like it might be necessary. I've tried so many things to get past this, but nothing seems to work. Can you tell me more about what exactly we'll be doing? And how long will this process take?",
    "Therapist: We'll focus on one memory at a time. You'll describe it in detail while I guide you. It may take several sessions.",
    "Client: Okay, I think I understand. But what if I get overwhelmed? Sometimes when I think about those experiences, I feel like I can't breathe, and it's like I'm right back there again. How will you help me if that happens?",
    "Therapist: I'll be here to support you throughout. We can pause anytime you need. Remember your coping techniques?",
    "Client: Yes, the breathing exercises and grounding techniques we've practiced. Those have been helpful. I'm still nervous, but knowing I can use those makes me feel a bit more in control. Will we start with the most difficult memories, or will we build up to those?",
    "Therapist: We'll start with less intense memories and progress gradually. You're in control of the pace.",
    "Client: That's a relief. I appreciate your patience with all my questions. I think I'm ready to give this a try. It won't be easy, but if it can help me move past these experiences and improve my relationships and work, it'll be worth it. What should I expect to feel during and after these sessions?",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel anxious or emotional. We'll debrief after each session. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a mix of emotions. There's still some anxiety, but also a glimmer of hope. It's been so long since I've felt hopeful about my recovery. I'm grateful for your guidance and support. I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be to start this process. Is there anything I should do to prepare for our next session when we actually begin the exposure?",
    "Therapist: Just continue your self-care routines. Your courage is admirable. Any final questions before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Thank you, that means a lot to me. I don't think I have any more questions right now. I'll probably think of some later, but I feel much better about starting this process than I did when I walked in today. I'm going to focus on taking care of myself this week and try to come in with an open mind for our next session. Thank you for explaining everything so patiently.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Maria. I'm here to support you. See you next week."
