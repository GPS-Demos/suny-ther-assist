    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure exercise. Can you describe the animal attack you experienced?",
    "Client: Okay, I'll try. It was a sunny day at the beach. I was walking along the shore when I saw a large dog running towards me. At first, I thought it was just playing, but as it got closer, I realized it looked aggressive.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: The dog was barking and growling. I froze, not knowing what to do. It lunged at me and bit my leg. I screamed in pain and fear. People nearby started shouting, but it felt like everything was happening in slow motion.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. How did you feel?",
    "Client: I felt terrified and helpless. My heart was racing, and I couldn't breathe properly. I kept thinking, \"This is it, I'm going to die.\" The pain in my leg was excruciating, and I could feel warm blood trickling down.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. What happened next?",
    "Client: Someone managed to pull the dog away, but I was in shock. I collapsed on the sand, shaking uncontrollably. People gathered around me, asking if I was okay, but I couldn't speak. I just stared at my leg, seeing the torn flesh and blood.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel emotional. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) I... I can't believe how vivid this memory still is. I can almost feel the sand under me and smell the salty air mixed with the metallic scent of blood. I remember feeling so embarrassed and vulnerable, lying there with everyone staring at me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: An ambulance arrived, and the paramedics started treating my wound. The pain was intense, but I was still in shock. As they lifted me onto the stretcher, I caught a glimpse of the dog being restrained. It was still snarling, and I felt a new wave of fear wash over me.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, reliving this?",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) It's... it's intense. My heart is racing, and I feel a bit nauseous. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I'm facing it head-on this time.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive observation. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: At the hospital, they cleaned and stitched my wound. The doctor told me I was lucky it wasn't worse. But all I could think about was how unlucky I was that it happened at all. I kept replaying the attack in my mind, wondering if I could have done something differently.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those thoughts. What else do you remember?",
    "Client: The worst part was the aftermath. I developed a severe fear of dogs. I couldn't even walk down the street without panicking if I saw one. It affected my social life too. I avoided beach parties and outdoor events. I felt so isolated and ashamed of my fear.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage by sharing this. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: (sighs) Tired, but also... relieved? It's like a weight has been lifted. Talking about it is hard, but it also feels like I'm reclaiming some control over the memory.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent insight. Well done for today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still difficult, but I think I'm starting to see how this process might help. Can we... can we end here for today? I feel quite drained.",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've done very well. We'll continue next session."
