    "Therapist: Good morning, Mrs. Johnson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Good morning, Dr. Williams. I'm... I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about the hostage situation again, and it's still hard for me.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's just... every time I think about it, my heart starts racing. I was at the bank, you know, just a routine visit. I never imagined... (voice trembles)",
    "Therapist: Take your time. You're doing well.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) I was waiting in line when suddenly there was shouting. A man with a gun burst in, waving it around. Everyone started screaming and dropping to the floor. I... I couldn't move. I felt frozen.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: The gunman was yelling at the tellers, demanding money. I remember the smell of his sweat as he passed by me. My legs were shaking so badly, I thought I might collapse. Then he grabbed me... (starts breathing heavily)",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. Keep going, you're doing great.",
    "Client: He... he pulled me close, using me as a shield. The cold metal of the gun pressed against my temple. I could feel his ragged breathing on my neck. I thought... I thought I was going to die right there.",
    "Therapist: I can see this is difficult. You're very brave for sharing this.",
    "Client: (wiping tears) The police arrived, and everything became chaos. Shouting, negotiating... it felt like hours. My legs were numb from standing so long. I kept thinking about my late husband, my children... wondering if I'd ever see them again.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Eventually, the gunman started to panic. His grip on me tightened, and I could feel him shaking. That's when I heard a loud bang and felt myself falling. I thought I'd been shot, but it was the police. They'd taken him down.",
    "Therapist: You survived a terrifying situation. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Shaky, but... somehow lighter? It's still scary to remember, but talking about it... it helps, I think. It's not just trapped in my head anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: Thank you, doctor. It's still hard, but... I'm glad I can talk about it now. For a long time, I couldn't even think about that day without having a panic attack.",
    "Therapist: Your resilience is admirable. Shall we continue?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. There's more I want to process about that day. The aftermath was... challenging. When the police were helping me up, I realized I had wet myself during the ordeal. I felt so ashamed, even though logically I know it's a normal reaction to extreme stress.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. You have nothing to be ashamed of.",
    "Client: I know that now, but at the time... (sighs) I remember the kindness of a female officer who helped me. She shielded me from view and got me a blanket. Her gentleness made me break down completely. I think that was when it really hit me what I'd been through.",
    "Therapist: It's important to acknowledge those moments of support.",
    "Client: Yes, it is. In the following days, I couldn't sleep. Every little noise made me jump. I kept reliving those moments in the bank, feeling the gun against my head. My children wanted to stay with me, but I pushed them away. I didn't want them to see me like that.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that decision now?",
    "Client: (pauses) I regret it. I think I needed their support more than I realized. But at the time, I felt so... broken. Like I wasn't the strong mother they knew anymore. I didn't want to burden them with my fear.",
    "Therapist: It's never too late to reach out. You're showing strength by addressing this.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm trying to be more open with them now. It's not easy, but... I'm learning that vulnerability isn't weakness. That hostage situation... it changed me. But maybe not all of those changes are bad. I'm learning to appreciate life more, to cherish my relationships.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it make you feel?",
    "Client: Grateful, I suppose. And a little sad, that it took something so traumatic to make me see it. But mostly, I feel... hopeful. Like maybe I can use this experience to become stronger, to help others who've been through similar things.",
    "Therapist: That's an incredibly positive outlook. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you, doctor. I couldn't have gotten here without your help. There are still days when the memories overwhelm me, but they're becoming less frequent. I'm starting to feel like myself again, only... maybe a bit wiser?",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. This session was intense, but I'm glad we did it. Thank you for your patience and support, Dr. Williams. I'm looking forward to our next session, even if it's challenging.",
    "Therapist: You've done wonderfully today. Take care, Mrs. Johnson."
