    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares lately about the hostage situation, and I'm not sure I'm ready to face it head-on.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Your feelings are valid.",
    "Client: Thank you for acknowledging that. It's been tough, you know? Ever since losing my brother in that situation, I've been struggling to make sense of everything. The anxiety has been overwhelming at times, especially when I'm trying to run my business. It's like I'm constantly on edge, waiting for something terrible to happen again.",
    "Therapist: That sounds challenging. Today, we'll explore imaginal exposure.",
    "Client: Imaginal exposure? What exactly does that mean? It sounds a bit intimidating, to be honest.",
    "Therapist: It involves revisiting the traumatic memory in a safe environment.",
    "Client: Revisit the memory? I'm not sure I can do that. Just thinking about it makes my heart race. How is reliving that nightmare supposed to help me?",
    "Therapist: It helps reduce the power of the memory over time.",
    "Client: I see... but I'm worried about losing control. What if I panic or can't handle it? And how will this affect my anxiety? I'm already struggling to keep it together most days.",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. I'll be here to support you.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I appreciate your support, Dr. Johnson. It's just... this feels like such a big step. I've been trying so hard to avoid thinking about that day, and now you're asking me to dive right into it. How do you think this will help with my PTSD symptoms?",
    "Therapist: It can decrease avoidance and lessen the memory's impact.",
    "Client: I guess that makes sense. I have been avoiding a lot of things lately - certain places, conversations, even some of my family members who remind me of my brother. If this could help me face those things again, it might be worth trying. But what should I expect during the session?",
    "Therapist: You may experience strong emotions. We'll work through them together.",
    "Client: Strong emotions... that's what I'm afraid of. I've been trying so hard to keep it all together, especially for my family. They rely on me, you know? But I suppose if this is part of the healing process, I should give it a try. How long will the session last?",
    "Therapist: About 45 minutes. We can take breaks if needed.",
    "Client: Okay, that doesn't sound too overwhelming. I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still nervous, but I think I'm willing to give it a shot. You really think this will help me move forward?",
    "Therapist: Yes. Your courage in facing this is commendable.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Johnson. That means a lot to me. I've been feeling so stuck lately, like I'm not the same person I was before the incident. My partner has been incredibly supportive, but I know it's been hard on them too. I want to get better, not just for myself but for everyone around me. I guess I'm ready to take this step, as scary as it seems.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is inspiring. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm ready. Just... please be patient with me if I struggle. This isn't easy, but I trust you and I want to heal. Let's do this."
