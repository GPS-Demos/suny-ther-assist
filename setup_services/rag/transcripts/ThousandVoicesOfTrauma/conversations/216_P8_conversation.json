    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mr. Chen?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's a bit overwhelming, to be honest. I can still see my mother's face so clearly, you know? Her eyes... they were so full of love, even at the end. It's been decades, but reliving that moment in the hospital room... it's like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: A mix of emotions, really. There's this deep sadness, of course. But also... guilt? I keep thinking about all the things I didn't say, the time I didn't spend with her. And then there's this... this tightness in my chest. It's like I can't quite catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: How does that tightness feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's constricting. Like a weight pressing down on me. I notice my hands are shaking a bit too. I suppose that's the anxiety creeping in. It's funny, you know. I've faced so many challenges in my life, built a business from nothing, but this... this memory still has such power over me.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are accompanying these physical sensations?",
    "Client: I keep hearing her voice. She... she told me to be strong, to take care of my younger siblings. But I was only 15, how could I be strong enough? I feel like I've let her down somehow. And then I think about my own mortality. I'm 70 now, older than she ever got to be. It doesn't seem fair, does it?",
    "Therapist: How does reflecting on that unfairness impact you?",
    "Client: It makes me angry, to be honest. Angry at the world, at whatever higher power might be out there. But then I feel guilty for being angry. She wouldn't want that. She always told us to be grateful for what we have. But it's hard, you know? Especially living here, so far from where we grew up. Sometimes I wonder if I made the right choice, coming to this country.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I... I can smell the hospital. That antiseptic smell. It's so vivid. And I remember the sound of the machines beeping. It's like... like I'm there again. But there's something else too. A warmth. I remember holding her hand. It was so small, but it felt... strong somehow. Like she was trying to give me strength even then.",
    "Therapist: How does that memory of strength feel?",
    "Client: It's... comforting, in a way. Like maybe I'm not as alone as I sometimes feel. But it also makes me sad. I miss that connection, that unconditional love. I've never really found that again, you know? Maybe that's why I've stayed single all these years. No one could ever measure up to her.",
    "Therapist: What do you think your mother would say about that?",
    "Client: (Long pause) She... she'd probably tell me I'm being silly. That there's plenty of love in the world if I'd just open my eyes to it. (Chuckles softly) She always did have a way of cutting through my nonsense. I can almost hear her now, telling me to stop moping and go live my life.",
    "Therapist: How does imagining her saying that make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's bittersweet. There's a warmth there, a fondness. But also a deep ache. I wish... I wish I could talk to her one more time. Tell her about my life, my struggles, my successes. I want her to know that I did my best, even if it wasn't always enough.",
    "Therapist: What do you mean by \"not always enough\"?",
    "Client: Well, I... I've made mistakes. Who hasn't? But sometimes I wonder if I've lived up to her expectations. I've done well in business, but my personal life... it's been a bit of a mess. No wife, no kids. Just me in this shared apartment, trying to make sense of it all. Sometimes I feel like I've disappointed her somehow.",
    "Therapist: How does that belief affect you?",
    "Client: It... it weighs on me. Like a constant pressure to do better, be better. But at the same time, it's also been a driving force. It's pushed me to succeed, to keep going even when things got tough. I just... I wish I could know for sure that she'd be proud of me.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to you if she was proud?",
    "Client: (Voice cracking) Everything. It would mean everything. I... I've spent so much of my life trying to live up to this image I have of her expectations. If I knew she was proud... maybe I could finally relax a little. Maybe I could start to see myself the way she saw me.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... it's both scary and liberating. The idea that I could let go of some of this pressure, this guilt... it's almost too much to hope for. But at the same time, I feel a little lighter just thinking about it. Like maybe... maybe it's okay to be proud of myself too.",
    "Therapist: What's one thing you think your mother would be proud of?",
    "Client: (Long pause) I... I think she'd be proud of how I've never given up. Even when things were tough, when I first came to this country and could barely speak the language, I kept going. I built a life here, a business. It wasn't always easy, but I persevered. That's something she always valued - perseverance.",
    "Therapist: How does recognizing that make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's oddly comforting. Like maybe I've been carrying a piece of her with me all along. I can feel some of the tension in my chest easing a bit. It's still there, but... it's not as overwhelming. Maybe... maybe I haven't let her down as much as I thought.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling a bit drained, to be honest. But also... lighter? Like I've set down a heavy load I've been carrying for a long time. My hands have stopped shaking too. I hadn't even noticed when that happened. It's strange how talking about these memories can affect you physically.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about exploring these memories?",
    "Client: It's... it's difficult. Painful, even. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, relief? Like I'm finally facing something I've been running from for a long time. I'm not sure I'm ready to do it again right away, but... I think it might be helping. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Many find this process challenging but beneficial. How would you like to proceed?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to take some time to process this. Maybe we could talk about some coping strategies for when these memories come up outside of our sessions? I'm realizing I might need some tools to handle this on my own.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Shall we discuss some techniques?",
    "Client: Yes, I'd like that. And... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I think... I think it might be worth it. I'm starting to see my mother's memory in a different light. Less as a source of pain and more as... as a source of strength. Maybe that's what she wanted all along.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How does that shift feel?",
    "Client: It feels... hopeful. Like maybe I can start to heal, to move forward without leaving her behind. I know there's still a lot to work through, but for the first time in a long time, I feel like I might be on the right path. It's scary, but... it's also exciting. Like I'm finally starting to understand myself better.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. How would you like to end our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to take a moment to just sit with these feelings. To acknowledge them without trying to change or fix anything. And maybe... maybe to silently thank my mother. For everything she gave me, including the strength to be here today, working through this. Is it okay if we just sit quietly for a minute?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take that moment now."
