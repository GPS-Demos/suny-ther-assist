    "Therapist: Welcome back. Are you ready to continue our imaginal exposure work today?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here.",
    "Client: Okay. So, I'm back at my workplace. It's a busy day, and I can feel the tension in the air. My coworker, the one who's been bullying me, is approaching my desk. My heart starts racing, and I can feel my palms getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with that feeling.",
    "Client: He's standing over me now, looming. I can smell his cologne, it's overpowering. He starts criticizing my work, loudly enough for others to hear. I feel so small, so humiliated. My face is burning with shame.",
    "Therapist: That's it. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I want to disappear. I can hear others whispering, probably laughing at me. My chronic pain is flaring up, my back is on fire. I'm frozen, I can't even look up at him.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: He's saying I'm incompetent, that I don't belong here. That my \"lifestyle choices\" make me unfit for this job. I know he's referring to my gender identity. I feel sick to my stomach. I want to cry, but I'm holding it in.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I finally muster the courage to look up at him. His face is twisted in a sneer. I open my mouth to defend myself, but no words come out. My throat feels tight. The pain in my back is getting worse, it's hard to concentrate.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I'm shaking now. I can feel everyone's eyes on me. The room feels so hot, I can barely breathe. He's still talking, but his words are blurring together. I feel like I'm going to pass out.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember to breathe.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can continue. This feels too real. My chest hurts, and my pain is getting worse.",
    "Therapist: It's okay. You've done excellent work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's just... it's so hard to relive this. I feel so powerless, so ashamed.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. You're showing great strength.",
    "Client: I guess. It's just... every time I think about it, it's like I'm right back there. I can feel the same fear, the same humiliation. And my body reacts too, the pain gets so much worse.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. You're processing the trauma.",
    "Client: Is it? Sometimes I feel like I'm just getting worse, not better. Like I'll never be able to move past this.",
    "Therapist: Healing takes time. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I hope so. It's just... it's affected everything. My studies, my relationships, my sense of self. Sometimes I don't even recognize myself anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Change is part of healing.",
    "Client: I guess. It's just hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel sometimes. Especially when the pain is bad, it's like it brings all those memories flooding back.",
    "Therapist: Your resilience is admirable. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think I've had enough for now. Thank you for your support. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't judge me.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care of yourself this week.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again. See you next time.",
    "Therapist: Take care. Goodbye."
