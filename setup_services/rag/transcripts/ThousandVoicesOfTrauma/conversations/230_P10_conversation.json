    "Therapist: Welcome, Fatima. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is dreading it. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 6 right now. Just thinking about it is making me anxious.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: *deep breath* Yes, I think so.",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes and take us to that day.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm at the hospital. The fluorescent lights are so harsh, and there's that antiseptic smell everywhere. I'm sitting in the waiting room, and my hands are shaking. I can hear the muffled voices of nurses at the desk, and occasional beeping from somewhere down the hall.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: A doctor comes out. He looks serious, and my heart just drops. He asks to speak with me privately, and I... I can barely stand up. My legs feel like jelly.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe an 8?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: We go into a small office. The doctor sits behind the desk, and I'm perched on this uncomfortable chair. He starts talking, but it's like I can't process the words. I catch phrases like \"aggressive form\" and \"immediate treatment,\" but it's all a blur.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My chest is so tight. I can hardly breathe. And I feel cold, like all the blood has drained from my face.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *audible breath* It's just... it's overwhelming. The doctor is still talking, but all I can think is, \"This can't be happening.\" I want to run, to scream, to do something, but I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he hands me some pamphlets. I look down at them, and the word \"cancer\" jumps out at me. It's like a punch to the gut. I start to cry, and I can't stop. The doctor looks uncomfortable, offers me a tissue.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My SUDS is probably a 9. This is so hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Fatima. Remember, you've survived this.",
    "Client: Right, yes. *deep breath* Okay. I manage to ask some questions, but I can barely hear the answers. It's like there's a roaring in my ears. I keep thinking about my family, my job, my life. Everything feels like it's crumbling.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What do you see?",
    "Client: The doctor's face. He's trying to be kind, but I can see the concern in his eyes. There's a clock on the wall behind him, and I keep staring at it, watching the seconds tick by. It feels surreal, like time has both stopped and is racing by.",
    "Therapist: What happens as you leave the office?",
    "Client: I... I stumble out. The hallway seems impossibly long. People are walking past, but they're just blurs. I feel so alone, even though the hospital is bustling. I make it to the elevator and just lean against the wall, trying to breathe.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: Still high... maybe an 8? It's not as intense, but I feel drained.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: I get to my car, but I can't drive. My hands are shaking too much. I just sit there, staring at nothing. I should call someone, but I can't bring myself to do it. How do I tell people? How do I say those words out loud?",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in that moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm scared. Terrified, really. But there's also this weird sense of determination starting to form. Like, okay, this is happening, so what do I do now? But mostly, I just feel lost.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. How long do you sit there?",
    "Client: It feels like hours, but it's probably only about 20 minutes. I finally manage to call my husband. My voice breaks as soon as he answers, and I can barely get the words out.",
    "Therapist: How does he respond?",
    "Client: He's... he's amazing. Calm, supportive. He says he's coming right away. And hearing his voice, it's like a lifeline. I start sobbing again, but it feels different. Like I'm not alone anymore.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix. Still scared, but also grateful. My SUDS is down to maybe a 6?",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens when your husband arrives?",
    "Client: He gets there so quickly. As soon as I see him, I just collapse into his arms. We stand there in the parking lot, holding each other. He's whispering that it'll be okay, that we'll face this together. And for the first time since the doctor called me in, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can handle this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Fatima. Let's pause here. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Drained, but... okay. It's hard to revisit, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming as it did before.",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. Your SUDS?",
    "Client: Down to about a 4 now. It's still there, but not as intense.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's take a few deep breaths together.",
    "Client: *audible breathing*",
    "Therapist: Well done. We'll stop here for today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Tired, but... lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after these sessions. Remember to practice self-care tonight.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you... this was hard, but I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: You're making great progress, Fatima. We'll continue next time."
