    "Therapist: Welcome, James. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a part of me that wants to get this over with, but another part that's terrified of reliving it all. My stomach's in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess so. Where do you want me to start?",
    "Therapist: Start by closing your eyes and bringing yourself back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Okay... I'm at the airport. It's bustling, people everywhere. The smell of coffee and fast food... I can hear announcements over the speakers, but they're muffled.",
    "Therapist: Good. What time of day is it?",
    "Client: It's early morning. The sun's just coming up. I remember feeling groggy, wishing I'd had more sleep.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Uh, maybe a 30? It's uncomfortable, but manageable.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: I'm in line for security. There's a family in front of me - a mom with two young kids. They're fussing, and she looks stressed. I remember thinking how glad I was to be traveling alone.",
    "Therapist: What are you wearing?",
    "Client: Jeans, a t-shirt, and my favorite hoodie. It's chilly in the airport. I've got my backpack slung over one shoulder. It feels heavy.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I make it through security. No issues. I'm walking to my gate now. My heart's starting to beat faster. I've never been a fan of flying.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing well. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's creeping up. Maybe a 45 now?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Remember, you're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: I get to the gate. It's packed. Every seat is taken. I find a spot to lean against the wall. My palms are sweaty. I keep checking my boarding pass, making sure I'm in the right place.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about how I don't want to get on that plane. But I have to. This job opportunity... it's too important to miss.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What else?",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) I'm scared. I keep imagining the plane crashing. It's stupid, I know, but I can't shake it.",
    "Therapist: It's not stupid. Your feelings are valid. Take another deep breath.",
    "Client: (Inhales deeply) Okay... They're calling for boarding now. I'm in group 3. I watch as people start lining up. My legs feel weak.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's pretty high. Maybe 70?",
    "Therapist: That's alright. Remember, you're here in the room with me. You're safe. Can you feel the chair beneath you?",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, I can. It helps a little.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going when you're ready.",
    "Client: I'm... I'm boarding now. Walking down that narrow aisle. It feels claustrophobic. I find my seat - it's by the window. I usually prefer the aisle, but that's all that was left.",
    "Therapist: What do you do once you're seated?",
    "Client: I buckle up immediately. My hands are shaking. I'm trying to distract myself by looking out the window, but it's not helping. I can hear the engines starting up.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My heart's racing. I feel hot, sweaty. There's this pressure in my chest, like I can't breathe properly. I want to get up, to leave, but I'm trapped.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, James. Remember, this is just a memory. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (Breathing heavily) It doesn't feel like just a memory. It feels so real.",
    "Therapist: I know it does. That's part of the process. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. 85, maybe 90.",
    "Therapist: Okay, let's take a moment. Focus on your breathing. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: (Follows the breathing instruction)",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: We're... we're taking off now. The plane's accelerating down the runway. I'm gripping the armrests so hard my knuckles are white. We lift off, and my stomach drops.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking at this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking this is it. We're going to crash. I'm never going to see my family again. I didn't even say goodbye properly.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those thoughts. What happens next?",
    "Client: We're climbing. The plane's shaking. Every little bump feels like we're about to fall out of the sky. I can't look out the window anymore. I close my eyes, try to pretend I'm somewhere else.",
    "Therapist: How long does this last?",
    "Client: It feels like forever. Probably only a few minutes. Then... then it happens.",
    "Therapist: What happens, James?",
    "Client: (Voice breaking) There's this loud bang. The plane lurches. People are screaming. The oxygen masks drop down. I... I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, James. Remember, you're here with me. You're safe. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's maxed out. 100. I can't... I can't do this.",
    "Therapist: You can. You're stronger than you think. Take a deep breath. Feel the chair beneath you.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) Okay... okay.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, tell me what's happening on the plane.",
    "Client: It's chaos. The plane's nosediving. I can feel the g-force pushing me back into my seat. The flight attendants are yelling instructions, but I can barely hear them over the screaming and the roar of the engines.",
    "Therapist: What are you doing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm frozen. I can't move. I can't think. I'm just... waiting for it to be over.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The guy next to me is praying. There's a baby crying somewhere behind me. I can smell something burning. And then...",
    "Therapist: And then?",
    "Client: We hit. There's this deafening crash. Everything goes dark. I'm thrown forward, then back. My head slams against something. And then... nothing.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, James. You're safe. You survived.",
    "Client: (Breathing heavily) Yeah... yeah, I did.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Shaken. Drained. But... also kind of relieved? Like, I made it through telling it.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You did incredibly well. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down. Maybe 60?",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves. Can you name five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: (Looks around) Uh, the clock, your desk, the plant in the corner, the bookshelf, and the painting on the wall.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, four things you can touch?",
    "Client: The armrest of the chair, my jeans, the floor with my feet, and... my watch.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Three things you can hear?",
    "Client: The ticking of the clock, traffic outside, and the hum of the air conditioner.",
    "Therapist: Two things you can smell?",
    "Client: Coffee... and maybe some kind of air freshener?",
    "Therapist: And finally, one thing you can taste?",
    "Client: Just... the taste in my mouth, I guess.",
    "Therapist: Great job, James. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Better. Calmer. It's like... it's like the memory is still there, but it's not as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's exactly what we're aiming for. You did incredible work today. How would you rate your distress now?",
    "Client: It's down to maybe a 20 or 25.",
    "Therapist: That's fantastic progress. Remember, each time we do this, it gets a little easier. You're building resilience.",
    "Client: Yeah, I... I can see that. It was tough, but I feel... I don't know, stronger maybe?",
    "Therapist: That strength was always there. You're just learning to access it. We'll end our session here for today. Remember to practice your breathing exercises, and we'll pick this up next week. How does that sound?",
    "Client: Good. Yeah, good. Thank you.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, James. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
