    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken up, to be honest. It's like I was right back there on that plane, you know? My heart's still racing a bit, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's strange because I know I'm safe here, but my body doesn't seem to have caught up with that fact yet.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: Well, I keep replaying the moment when the plane started to shake violently. I remember thinking, \"This is it. We're going to crash.\" And then there's this overwhelming sense of helplessness. I couldn't do anything to save myself or anyone else. It's... it's frustrating and terrifying at the same time.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does that helplessness feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like... like a heaviness in my stomach. Almost as if there's a rock sitting in there. And my shoulders feel tense, like I'm bracing for impact all over again. It's exhausting, really. I find myself wanting to curl up into a ball and hide.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are coming up for you as you describe this?",
    "Client: Mostly fear, I think. But there's also this undercurrent of anger. I'm angry that this happened to me, that I had to go through something so terrifying. And then I feel guilty for being angry because I survived when others didn't. It's a mess of emotions, really.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when you first experienced the crash?",
    "Client: They're... they're not as intense now. During the actual crash, it was like my whole world was ending. The fear was all-consuming. Now, it's still there, but it's more manageable. I can recognize it for what it is, if that makes sense. It's like I'm observing the fear rather than being completely overwhelmed by it.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about that difference?",
    "Client: I suppose it shows that I've made some progress. Before, even thinking about the crash would send me into a panic attack. Now, I can talk about it without completely falling apart. It's still difficult, don't get me wrong, but it feels... I don't know, more distant somehow? Like I'm starting to separate myself from the event.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a bit of a relief, actually. It gives me hope that maybe one day this won't have such a strong hold on me. But it's also a little scary. Part of me feels like if I let go of this fear, I'm somehow forgetting what happened or dishonoring those who didn't make it. I know that's not rational, but it's there.",
    "Therapist: Can you tell me more about that fear of letting go?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... if I'm not constantly vigilant, constantly afraid, then something bad might happen again. As if my fear is somehow protecting me. And there's this guilt, too. Like, who am I to move on and be happy when others lost their lives? It feels selfish somehow.",
    "Therapist: How does that belief impact your daily life?",
    "Client: It's exhausting, really. I'm always on edge, always waiting for the other shoe to drop. I avoid flying, obviously, but it's more than that. I struggle to enjoy simple things because I'm always anticipating disaster. It's affected my relationships, my work... everything, really.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to you if you could let go of some of that fear?",
    "Client: God, it would be... liberating. To be able to live in the moment without constantly looking over my shoulder. To enjoy a trip without panicking about the travel. To not feel like I'm betraying the memory of the crash by being happy. It sounds wonderful, but also terrifying in its own way.",
    "Therapist: How so?",
    "Client: Well, the fear has been a constant companion for so long. It's familiar, you know? The idea of letting it go... it's like stepping into the unknown. What if I can't handle it? What if I forget important lessons from the crash? It's irrational, I know, but it's there.",
    "Therapist: What do you think those important lessons are?",
    "Client: I suppose... the fragility of life. How quickly things can change. The importance of telling people you love them. But also... the strength of the human spirit. I survived something I never thought I could. That has to count for something, right?",
    "Therapist: Indeed. How might you honor those lessons without holding onto the fear?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe by living more fully? By appreciating each day and the people in my life? It's a nice thought, but it feels so far away from where I am now. Like I'm reaching for something I can barely see.",
    "Therapist: What small step could you take towards that?",
    "Client: Hmm... maybe... maybe I could start by acknowledging one thing I'm grateful for each day. Something simple, you know? It might help me focus on the present rather than constantly worrying about the past or future. It's a tiny step, but it's something.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea sit with you?",
    "Client: It feels... doable. A little scary, but in a good way. Like I'm taking back some control. And I suppose that's what this is all about, isn't it? Regaining control over my life, bit by bit. It won't be easy, but... I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. Shall we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. This session has been intense, but also... hopeful? Thank you for guiding me through this. I feel drained, but also like I've made some progress. It's a strange mix of emotions.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Take care of yourself.",
    "Client: Thank you, I will. See you next week."
