    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Hernandez?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, Dr. Johnson. It's always intense, you know? Reliving that moment when I saw my neighbor being attacked... it's like I'm right there again. My heart's still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you this time?",
    "Client: The sounds. I could hear the attacker's angry shouts so clearly. And my neighbor's cries for help... they seemed louder than before. It's strange how these details come back.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was tough, really tough. I felt helpless all over again. But... I noticed something different this time. I didn't feel as frozen as I usually do when thinking about it. It's like... I could breathe a little easier, even though it was still scary.",
    "Therapist: That's an interesting observation. Can you tell me more?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... before, whenever this memory came up, I'd just shut down. But today, even though it was vivid and frightening, I felt more... present, I guess? Like I could acknowledge what was happening without completely losing myself in it. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. How do you think this relates to your recovery?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe it means I'm starting to process it better? It's still awful, but perhaps I'm learning to face it without completely falling apart. It gives me a bit of hope, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a valuable insight. How does this connect to your daily life?",
    "Client: Well, I've noticed I'm not as jumpy lately when I hear sudden noises. And I actually talked to my wife about the incident last week without having a panic attack. It's small, but it feels like progress.",
    "Therapist: Those are significant steps. What's helping you make this progress?",
    "Client: I think... it's facing the memory head-on in these sessions. It's terrifying, but each time, it loses a bit of its power over me. And the breathing exercises you taught me - they really help when things get overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad those techniques are helpful. What's been challenging recently?",
    "Client: The nightmares are still pretty bad. And I'm struggling with guilt. I keep thinking I should have done more to help my neighbor. It's... it's eating at me, Dr. Johnson.",
    "Therapist: That guilt seems to be a recurring theme. How do you cope with it?",
    "Client: I try to remind myself that I did call the police immediately. And logically, I know intervening might have made things worse. But emotionally... it's hard. I'm working on self-compassion, like we discussed, but it's a slow process.",
    "Therapist: It takes time. What would you like to focus on next?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to work more on managing the guilt. And maybe... maybe start thinking about how to feel safer in my neighborhood again. I've been avoiding going out, and I know that's not helping.",
    "Therapist: Those are great goals. How do you feel about continuing the exposures?",
    "Client: They're tough, but I can see they're helping. I'm... I'm ready to keep going. It's not easy, but I want to get better. For myself and for my family.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is commendable. Any final thoughts today?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, Dr. Johnson. This process is grueling, but I feel like I'm finally making some headway. It's a glimmer of hope, you know? And that means a lot.",
