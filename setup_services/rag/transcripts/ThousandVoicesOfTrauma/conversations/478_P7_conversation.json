    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the home invasion?",
    "Client: It was late at night, around 11 PM. I was watching TV in my living room when I heard a loud crash from the kitchen. At first, I thought maybe I'd left a window open and something fell, but then I heard hushed voices. My heart started racing immediately.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: I... I froze. I couldn't move. Then I heard footsteps coming towards the living room. I managed to turn off the TV and slide behind the couch. I was shaking so badly, I was afraid they'd hear my teeth chattering.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: Two men entered the room. They were wearing dark clothes and had masks on. One of them whispered, \"Check upstairs, I'll look down here.\" I could barely breathe. I was so scared they'd find me.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: As one of them went upstairs, the other started opening drawers and cabinets. He was so close to me, I could smell cigarette smoke on his clothes. I kept thinking about my late wife's jewelry upstairs and how I couldn't protect it.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that memory. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there was a loud thud from upstairs. The man near me cursed and ran up to check on his partner. I knew this was my chance. My legs felt like jelly, but I forced myself to move. I crawled to the kitchen, my hands shaking as I tried to find my phone.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Continue.",
    "Client: I managed to call 911, whispering as quietly as I could. The operator told me to stay on the line and that help was coming. But then I heard the men coming back downstairs. I was sure they'd find me. I... I can still feel that terror...",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: They were arguing about leaving, saying they hadn't found anything valuable. I was praying they'd just go. Then I heard sirens in the distance. The men panicked and ran out the back door. I stayed hidden until the police arrived, but I couldn't stop shaking for hours after.",
    "Therapist: You've done an excellent job describing this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. My heart is still racing a bit. But also... I feel a little proud that I managed to call for help. I've never really thought about that part before.",
    "Therapist: That's a great observation. Let's take a few deep breaths together.",
    "Client: (Takes deep breaths) Thank you. It's still hard to talk about, but it feels a little less overwhelming now.",
    "Therapist: You've made significant progress today. How about we end here?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. Thank you for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm starting to process it better.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable strength. We'll continue next session."
