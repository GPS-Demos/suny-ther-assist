    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you start describing the event?",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. It was a Tuesday morning when I got the call. My brother had been arrested. I remember feeling like the world had stopped spinning. My hands were shaking as I held the phone.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I couldn't believe it. My brother, always the responsible one, was in jail. I felt sick to my stomach. I had to sit down because my legs were weak. The person on the phone was still talking, but their words were just a blur.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I remember thinking about our parents. How disappointed they would be if they were still alive. The shame was overwhelming. I felt like I had failed them, failed to keep our family together.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: I didn't know what to do. Should I call a lawyer? Should I tell anyone? I felt so alone. The house suddenly felt too big, too empty. I wanted to scream, but no sound came out.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep describing what happened next.",
    "Client: I... I drove to the police station. My hands were gripping the steering wheel so tight, my knuckles were white. The drive felt like it took hours, even though it was only 20 minutes. When I arrived, I sat in the car for a long time, unable to move.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. You're safe here.",
    "Client: When I finally went in, the fluorescent lights were so harsh. Everything felt surreal, like I was in a bad dream. I remember the cold metal of the chair I sat on while waiting. The clock on the wall seemed to tick so loudly.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job describing the details. Continue.",
    "Client: They brought my brother out. He looked... broken. His eyes were red, and he wouldn't look at me. I felt a mix of anger and pity. How could he do this to us? But also, how could I help him?",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have conflicting emotions. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: We couldn't talk much. There was a guard nearby. I wanted to hug him, to tell him everything would be okay, but I couldn't. I just sat there, feeling helpless and scared. When it was time to leave, I felt like I was abandoning him.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: The drive home was a blur. I remember feeling numb. When I got home, I just sat in the dark for hours. I couldn't eat, couldn't sleep. All I could think about was my brother in that cold cell, and how our lives would never be the same.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an incredible job. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Reliving it brings back all those emotions. The helplessness, the fear, the shame. It's still so vivid.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I keep thinking about what I could have done differently. Maybe if I had been more involved in his life, this wouldn't have happened. The guilt is... it's overwhelming sometimes.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're not responsible for his actions. You're doing well.",
    "Client: I know, but it's hard not to blame myself. After that day, I couldn't concentrate at work. I'd find myself staring at the phone, dreading another call with bad news. My colleagues noticed, but I couldn't bring myself to tell them what was happening.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to feel that way. Continue.",
    "Client: The legal process was a nightmare. So many meetings, so much paperwork. I felt like I was drowning in it all. And all the while, I had to keep up appearances, pretend everything was fine. It was exhausting.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Keep going.",
    "Client: The worst part was the loneliness. I couldn't talk to anyone about it. I felt so isolated, like I was carrying this huge secret. Some nights, I'd wake up in a cold sweat, thinking it was all a bad dream, only to realize it was real.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: As the weeks turned into months, I felt like I was living two lives. One where I pretended everything was normal, and another where I was constantly worried about my brother, about our future. It was like living in a fog.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How do you feel now, talking about this?",
    "Client: It's... it's still painful. But somehow, talking about it makes it feel less overwhelming. Like I'm not carrying it all alone anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I think what scared me most was the uncertainty. Not knowing how long he'd be in there, how it would change him. I kept imagining worst-case scenarios. It was hard to find any hope.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Sometimes, I'd drive by the prison, just to feel closer to him. I never went in, just sat in the parking lot. It felt both comforting and heartbreaking at the same time. I felt so powerless.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. But also, I feel a bit lighter. Like talking about it has lifted some of the weight off my shoulders. It's still painful, but maybe... maybe not as overwhelming as before.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. You've done well today."
