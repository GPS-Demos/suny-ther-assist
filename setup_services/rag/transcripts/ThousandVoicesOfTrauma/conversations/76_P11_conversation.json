    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It was intense, reliving that car accident. My heart's still racing a bit. I can almost smell the burning rubber and hear the screeching tires. It's like... like I was right back there, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds overwhelming. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The fear. The absolute terror of realizing I couldn't control the car. It was skidding, and I... I thought I was going to die. I remember gripping the steering wheel so hard my knuckles turned white. And then the impact... God, the sound of metal crunching. It's all so vivid.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to share that now?",
    "Client: It's... strange. My heart's still pounding, but talking about it... it's like I'm releasing some of the pressure. Like I've been holding my breath for years and I'm finally exhaling. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How does this compare to your day-to-day experiences?",
    "Client: Well, usually I try to avoid thinking about it at all costs. I've been so anxious about driving, especially on highways. But going through it here... it's different. It's scary, but I feel... I don't know, maybe a little braver? Like I'm facing it head-on instead of running away.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant insight. How might this affect your recovery?",
    "Client: I think... maybe it'll help me regain some control? I've felt so powerless since the accident, both on the road and in life generally. But if I can face this memory here, maybe I can start facing my fears out there too. It's exhausting being anxious all the time.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I want to keep pushing forward. It's hard, and sometimes I feel like I'm right back in that moment of panic. But I also feel like I'm making progress. Maybe... maybe I could try driving on a quiet road soon? With someone I trust beside me?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful next step. How else can we support you?",
    "Client: I think... I need to work on grounding techniques. When the memories hit, I feel so overwhelmed. If I could learn to stay present, to remind myself I'm safe now... that would be huge. And maybe... could we talk more about how this connects to my childhood trauma? I feel like there might be a link there.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll explore that. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... lighter? Like I've set down a heavy backpack I've been carrying. I know there's still a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel... hopeful. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredible work today. What's one thing you'll take away?",
    "Client: That I'm stronger than I thought. That facing my fears, while terrifying, is possible. And that maybe, just maybe, I can reclaim the parts of my life that fear has stolen from me. It won't be easy, but... I think I'm ready to try."
