    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling today as we begin our session?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I know we're going to be talking about the hostage situation again, and it's not easy for me.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate that. It's just... every time I think about it, my heart starts racing, and I feel like I'm back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great by acknowledging those feelings.",
    "Client: Okay. Well, I guess we should start. I remember it was a Tuesday afternoon. I had just finished a meeting with a client at my office. As I was walking to my car in the parking garage, I heard footsteps behind me. I didn't think much of it at first, but then...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What happened next?",
    "Client: Suddenly, I felt something hard pressed against my back. A voice said, \"Don't turn around. Just get in your car and drive.\" I froze. My mind went blank. I couldn't believe this was happening to me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I fumbled with my keys. My hands were shaking so badly. I could hear my heart pounding in my ears. The person behind me kept pressing that object - I assumed it was a gun - into my back, telling me to hurry up.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I managed to unlock the car and get in. The person quickly slid into the back seat, still keeping the gun trained on me. They told me to drive out of the parking garage. I remember thinking about my wife and kids, wondering if I'd ever see them again.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: As I drove, they instructed me to head towards the outskirts of the city. My mind was racing, trying to think of a way out. But I was too scared to do anything. I kept imagining what would happen if I tried to escape or call for help.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have felt that way. You're doing great.",
    "Client: We drove for what felt like hours, but it was probably only about 45 minutes. The whole time, I was trying to memorize details about the person's voice, anything I could use later. But I was so terrified, it was hard to focus.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength by revisiting this.",
    "Client: Finally, we arrived at an abandoned warehouse. They forced me out of the car and into the building. Inside, there were two other men waiting. That's when I realized this wasn't just a random crime - it was planned.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: They tied me to a chair and started demanding information about my business, my clients, and my finances. I couldn't understand why they were targeting me. I'm just a small business owner, not some wealthy tycoon.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling anxious. My palms are sweating, and I can feel my heart racing again. It's like I'm back there, sitting in that chair, surrounded by those men.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Remember, you're here with me now.",
    "Client: Right, thank you. It helps to hear that. So, they kept me there for three days. They would take turns interrogating me, sometimes for hours on end. I was exhausted, hungry, and terrified. I kept thinking about my family, wondering if I'd ever see them again.",
    "Therapist: You're very courageous. Keep going.",
    "Client: On the third day, something changed. I overheard them arguing. It seemed like they weren't getting what they wanted from me, and they were disagreeing about what to do next. That's when I heard sirens in the distance.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What happened then?",
    "Client: Everything happened so fast after that. The men started panicking. Two of them ran out, leaving me with just one guard. I could hear the police getting closer. The remaining man was distracted, looking out the window. I saw my chance and started working on loosening my bonds.",
    "Therapist: That took a lot of courage. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... a mix of things. Scared, remembering it all. But also... maybe a little proud? I didn't give up, even when I thought all hope was lost.",
    "Therapist: That's a very valid feeling. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Just as I managed to free myself, the police burst in. The last man tried to use me as a shield, but I managed to duck away. The police subdued him quickly. I remember collapsing to the floor, overwhelmed with relief and exhaustion.",
    "Therapist: You showed incredible resilience. How do you feel about that now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still hard to process. I'm grateful to be alive, to be back with my family. But I also struggle with the aftermath. The nightmares, the anxiety, the constant feeling of looking over my shoulder.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You've been through a lot.",
    "Client: Sometimes I feel guilty for not being able to just \"get over it.\" My wife has been so supportive, but I can see the worry in her eyes. I want to be the husband and father I was before, but it's like there's this wall between me and my old life.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. Healing takes time.",
    "Client: I know you're right. It's just... hard. Some days are better than others. Today, talking about it... it's bringing up a lot of those feelings again. But I also feel like maybe... maybe I'm starting to process it a bit more?",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. You're making progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I need a moment. This has been intense, reliving it all again. But I'm glad I did it. I feel like each time we do this, it gets a tiny bit easier to face.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellently today. Let's take a break."
