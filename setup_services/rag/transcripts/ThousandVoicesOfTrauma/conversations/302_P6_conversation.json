    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and recall the medical trauma you experienced. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see the hospital room. It's so bright, and there are machines beeping everywhere. I'm lying on the bed, feeling so helpless. The doctors are rushing around, speaking quickly in a language I don't understand. I'm scared... so scared.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 6. My heart is starting to race.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: They're attaching wires to my chest. I don't know what's happening. I want to ask, but I can't speak the language. I feel so alone, so far from home. The refugee camp seems safer than this strange place.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to an 8. I'm feeling really anxious, my palms are sweaty.",
    "Therapist: That's natural. Stay with the memory. What do you notice around you?",
    "Client: The smell... it's so sterile. It reminds me of when I first arrived at the refugee camp. That same feeling of uncertainty. But here, it's worse. I can't breathe properly. They're putting an oxygen mask on me.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. I feel like I'm back there. My chest is tight.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep breathing. What happens next?",
    "Client: They're... they're wheeling me somewhere. The ceiling lights are flashing by. I hear urgent voices. I think... I think I'm dying. I never should have left my country. At least there, I understood what was happening to me.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm at a 10. I can barely speak. My whole body is shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here with me. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Audible deep breath) Okay... okay. They've stopped moving me. There's a kind nurse. She's holding my hand. She doesn't speak my language, but her eyes are gentle. It... it helps a little.",
    "Therapist: That's good. What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down to an 8. I still feel shaky, but that nurse... she reminds me of my daughter.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The doctor is explaining something. The nurse is trying to translate, but it's not clear. I catch words like \"heart\" and \"surgery.\" I'm terrified, but... but I also feel a glimmer of hope. Maybe they can help me.",

    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5. I feel... I feel drained, but also a bit relieved. Like I've lived through it again, but this time I know I survive.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... but stronger somehow. Like I faced the memory and came out the other side.",
    "Therapist: You did excellently. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Open your eyes when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Okay, I'm opening my eyes now. Thank you... that was intense, but I feel like I understood the experience better this time.",
    "Therapist: You showed great courage. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Drained, but also... lighter? Like I've let go of something heavy. My SUDS is probably around a 3 now.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. We'll end here for today. You've made significant progress."
