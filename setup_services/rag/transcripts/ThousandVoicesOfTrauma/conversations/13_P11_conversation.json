    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Singh?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. Revisiting that moment when I received my cancer diagnosis... it's brought back a lot of emotions I thought I had buried. My hands are still trembling a bit, and I feel this heaviness in my chest. It's as if I'm right back in that sterile hospital room, hearing those words that changed everything.",
    "Therapist: What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The doctor's face. I remember how his expression changed when he looked at my test results. There was this... this shift in his eyes. Before he even spoke, I knew it was bad news. And then the world just... stopped. I could hear him talking, but it was like I was underwater. Everything became muffled and distant. I keep replaying that moment over and over in my mind.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. Terrifying, really. I felt that same panic rising in my chest, the same disbelief. But... but there was something different this time. As I was describing it, I realized I'm not in that moment anymore. I've survived it. I'm here, talking about it. That's... that's something, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: Indeed. How does that realization impact you?",
    "Client: It's... empowering, in a way. Don't get me wrong, it's still painful to think about. But I feel like I can look at it from a different perspective now. I'm not just a victim of circumstance anymore. I'm a survivor. And that... that feels significant.",
    "Therapist: What emotions came up during the exposure?",
    "Client: Fear was the strongest, definitely. But there was also this overwhelming sadness. Not just for myself, but for my family, my friends. I remember thinking about all the things I might miss out on. And... and there was anger too. Why me? Why now? It felt so unfair. But beneath all that, there was also a strange sort of... determination. A part of me that refused to give up.",
    "Therapist: How do these emotions relate to your daily life?",
    "Client: I... I think they're still very much present. The fear shows up in my constant worry about my health. Every little ache or pain sends me into a spiral of anxiety. The sadness... it's there in the moments when I feel like I've lost so much time to illness. And the anger, well, that comes out sometimes when I'm frustrated with my limitations. But the determination... that's what gets me out of bed some days.",
    "Therapist: What have you learned from this experience?",
    "Client: I've learned that I'm stronger than I thought. That even in the darkest moments, there's a part of me that wants to keep fighting. And I've learned the value of support. My family, my friends... they've been my lifeline. I think I've also learned to appreciate the small things more. A good day, a moment of laughter... they mean so much more now.",
    "Therapist: How might this insight help moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I think it might help me face my fears more directly. Instead of trying to avoid thoughts of illness or mortality, maybe I can approach them with the same strength I found during my treatment. And perhaps I can be kinder to myself on the difficult days, knowing that I've overcome so much already.",
    "Therapist: Excellent reflection. What's your takeaway from today?",
    "Client: My main takeaway is that while the memory is still painful, it doesn't have the same power over me that it once did. I can talk about it, process it, without feeling completely overwhelmed. And that... that feels like progress. It's like I'm reclaiming a part of myself that I thought I'd lost to the trauma of the diagnosis. I'm not just a patient or a victim... I'm still me, with all my experiences, good and bad.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm nervous, but I'm also hopeful. It's not easy to face these memories, but I can see how it's helping. Each time we do this, I feel like I'm gaining a bit more control over my reactions. It's exhausting, but it's also... freeing, in a way. I want to keep going. I want to get to a place where I can think about my illness without it consuming me. I know it won't be easy, but I'm willing to put in the work.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. Anything else you'd like to share?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For guiding me through this. For helping me see things from a different perspective. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I'm moving forward instead of just treading water. It's... it's a good feeling."
