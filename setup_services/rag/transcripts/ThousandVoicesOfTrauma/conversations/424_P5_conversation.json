    "Therapist: Welcome back. Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm quite nervous, to be honest. Ever since you mentioned it last week, I've been feeling anxious. At my age, I'm not sure if I can handle reliving that terrible airplane crash. It's been years, but the memory still haunts me.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I worry that talking about it will make everything worse. I've spent so long trying to forget. And with my depression, I fear it might push me over the edge. My family has been so supportive, but they don't really understand what I went through.",
    "Therapist: I understand. How do you think this might affect you?",
    "Client: I'm afraid I'll have nightmares again, or that I won't be able to stop crying. As a South Asian elder, it's hard for me to show vulnerability. What if I can't control my emotions?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are normal. How can I support you today?",
    "Client: I appreciate your asking. Perhaps we could go slowly? And maybe you could remind me that I'm safe here, in the present. It's hard sometimes, with my age, to distinguish between memories and reality.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll go at your pace. What else might help you feel safe?",
    "Client: Could we have a code word? Something I could say if it becomes too overwhelming? And maybe you could explain again why we're doing this. I understand it's to help with my PTSD, but I'm still unsure about the process.",
    "Therapist: Great idea. Let's choose a code word. And I'd be happy to explain again.",
    "Client: Thank you. How about \"airplane\" as our code word? It's simple and relevant. Now, could you please remind me why we're doing this exposure therapy?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Imaginal exposure helps process traumatic memories. Shall I elaborate?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I want to understand how reliving this trauma could possibly help me. It seems counterintuitive, especially at my age.",
    "Therapist: It allows us to confront and process the memory safely. This can reduce its power over you.",
    "Client: I see. So, by facing it head-on, I might be able to regain some control? That's an appealing thought. After the crash, I felt so helpless. Even now, years later, I sometimes feel that same helplessness.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. Are you ready to begin, or do you have more questions?",
    "Client: I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. But could you tell me what to expect? Will I need to close my eyes? Will you be guiding me through it?",
    "Therapist: You can keep your eyes open or closed. I'll guide you. What else would help you feel prepared?",
    "Client: Maybe a reminder that I'm here, safe, in your office? And perhaps a reassurance that it's okay if I need to stop. I know you said we'd use the code word, but I'm worried I might freeze up.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'll provide reminders and support throughout. Your well-being is the priority.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot. I've lived a long life, seen many changes, but this crash... it's stuck with me in a way nothing else has. I'm nervous, but I'm also hopeful that this might help.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm ready. Thank you for your patience and understanding. Let's do this."
