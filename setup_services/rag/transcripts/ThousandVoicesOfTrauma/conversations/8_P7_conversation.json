    "Therapist: Hello, Maria. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit anxious, Dr. Rodriguez. I know we're going to talk about the earthquake again, and it's making me nervous.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: I know, I know. It's just... every time I think about it, my heart starts racing. It was so terrifying.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Okay... I remember it was early morning. I was getting ready for work when suddenly everything started shaking. The noise was deafening - like a freight train running through my house. I froze for a moment, then I heard my husband yelling for me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you recall?",
    "Client: I... I couldn't move at first. The floor was moving so much, I thought I'd fall if I tried to walk. I could hear things crashing all around me. Pictures falling off walls, glasses shattering in the kitchen. I was so scared.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: I managed to get under the doorframe, like they always tell you to do. But I was panicking because I couldn't see my husband. I kept calling his name, but the noise was so loud. I thought... I thought maybe something had fallen on him.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: The shaking felt like it lasted forever, but I guess it was only a minute or so. When it finally stopped, everything was a mess. There was dust everywhere, and I could smell gas. I was coughing and crying, stumbling through the debris, still calling for my husband.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I found him in the living room. He was okay, just a few cuts from broken glass. We hugged each other so tightly, both of us shaking. But then we realized we needed to get out of the house because of the gas smell. We grabbed our emergency bag and headed outside.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling as you recall this?",
    "Client: My heart is racing again, and my hands are sweaty. But... it's not as bad as before. Talking about it... it helps, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Outside was chaos. Our neighbors were all in the street, some crying, some injured. Cars were honking, alarms were going off everywhere. We could see smoke rising from downtown. It felt like the world was ending.",
    "Therapist: You're handling these memories well. Keep going.",
    "Client: We spent the next few hours in a daze, trying to contact our children, helping neighbors, listening to news on the radio. The aftershocks kept coming, each one sending a fresh wave of panic through everyone. I kept thinking about my mother, how she'd been through earthquakes before, and how she always seemed so calm. I wished I could be more like her.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel overwhelmed. You're doing great.",
    "Client: As the day went on, we learned how bad it really was. So many buildings collapsed, so many people hurt or... or worse. We were lucky, our house was still standing, but we couldn't go back inside for days. We slept in a tent in our backyard, jumping at every little sound, every tremor.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel now, talking about this?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard, but not as hard as I thought it would be. I feel sad, and a little shaky, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I survived it once, and I can survive talking about it too.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Rodriguez. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It still hurts, and I still get scared sometimes, but it's getting easier.",
    "Therapist: You've made excellent progress today, Maria.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I know we still have more work to do, but I'm feeling more hopeful now. Is it okay if we stop here for today? I'm feeling a bit drained.",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've done well. We'll continue next session.",
    "Client: Thank you, Doctor. See you next week.",
    "Therapist: Take care, Maria. Remember to use your coping strategies if needed."
