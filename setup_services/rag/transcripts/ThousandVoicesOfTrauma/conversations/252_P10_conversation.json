    "Therapist: Welcome, Amina. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit jittery. It's weird being here alone, you know? I keep thinking about my ex and how he used to come with me to appointments.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's start with a SUDS rating. How distressed are you, 0 to 100?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 40? My stomach feels kind of tight.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Let's begin. Close your eyes and describe the day of your medical procedure.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Alright... I'm in the hospital. It's early morning, and the corridors are so quiet. The fluorescent lights are harsh, making everything look pale and sickly. I can smell that distinct hospital scent - antiseptic and something else I can't quite place. My ex, James, is holding my hand, but it feels clammy and uncomfortable.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: A nurse calls my name. Her voice echoes in the waiting room. I stand up, and my legs feel wobbly. James tries to come with me, but the nurse says he has to wait outside. I... I remember feeling so alone as I walked down that corridor.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's going up. Maybe 55?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The exam room is cold. So cold. I'm shivering as I change into the gown. It's paper-thin and doesn't offer any comfort. The doctor comes in, and he barely looks at me. He's talking, but I can't focus on his words. All I can think about is how exposed I feel, how vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: What are you noticing in your body right now?",
    "Client: My heart's racing. I can feel it pounding in my chest. My palms are sweaty.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (inhales deeply) Okay... The procedure starts. There's pressure, then pain. Sharp, stabbing pain. I want to scream, but I can't. I'm frozen. The doctor's voice is muffled, like I'm underwater. I can hear the beeping of machines, and it's getting faster. Or maybe that's just my heartbeat? I don't know. I just want it to stop.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it. What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. Maybe 75? I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here in the room with me. Take a moment to ground yourself.",
    "Client: (takes several deep breaths) Okay... I'm here. I'm safe. (pause) After the procedure, I'm in recovery. I feel hollow, empty. James comes in, but he looks uncomfortable. He can't meet my eyes. I reach for his hand, but he pulls away. That's when I knew... I knew things would never be the same between us.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Sad. Angry. I trusted James to be there for me, and he couldn't handle it. It's like the procedure took away more than just my physical health. It took my relationship too.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to process. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's come down a bit. Maybe 60?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Let's continue.",
    "Client: The days after were a blur. I was in pain, physically and emotionally. James was distant. He'd make excuses not to come over, not to stay the night. I felt so alone. Every time my phone buzzed, I hoped it was him, but it never was. The silence was deafening.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What do you notice?",
    "Client: I feel this heaviness in my chest. Like I can't get enough air. And there's this knot in my stomach that won't go away.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Keep breathing. What happened next?",
    "Client: A week later, James came over. He sat on the edge of my bed, not touching me. He said he couldn't do this anymore. That seeing me in the hospital made him realize he wasn't ready for this level of commitment. I remember feeling like I was watching the scene from outside my body. Like it wasn't really happening to me.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up again. Maybe 70? I can feel the tears coming.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to cry. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice breaks) I begged him to stay. I told him I needed him. But he just... he just left. I remember the sound of the door closing behind him. It was so final. I curled up in my bed, still sore from the procedure, and cried until I couldn't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're doing great.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) The worst part was feeling like my body had betrayed me. Like if I hadn't needed the procedure, James would have stayed. I hated myself. I hated my body. I couldn't look in the mirror without seeing all the ways I'd failed.",
    "Therapist: Those are heavy feelings. How are you doing now?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. But I'm okay. Maybe a 65 on the SUDS?",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Let's continue.",
    "Client: The next few weeks were a haze of pain meds and tears. I missed classes. I stopped answering calls from friends. My mom tried to help, but I pushed her away. I couldn't stand the pity in her eyes. I felt so ashamed, like everyone could see how broken I was.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice in your body as you recall this?",
    "Client: My shoulders are tense. I can feel this tightness in my jaw. And my stomach... it's like there's a rock sitting in it.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What else do you remember?",
    "Client: I remember the follow-up appointment. Going back to that hospital... I nearly had a panic attack in the parking lot. The smell hit me as soon as I walked in, and I felt dizzy. The doctor was talking about recovery and future precautions, but all I could think about was James. How he should have been there, holding my hand. How alone I felt.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually coming down a bit. Maybe 55?",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: After that appointment, I decided I needed to make a change. I couldn't keep living in this fog of depression and anxiety. I started by telling my mom everything - about the procedure, about James leaving. It was hard, but it felt like the first step towards healing.",
    "Therapist: How did that feel?",
    "Client: Scary at first. But then... relieving? Like I was finally letting go of this secret I'd been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's a big step. What happened next?",
    "Client: I started therapy. Not this kind, just regular talk therapy at first. It was hard opening up, but it helped. I slowly started reconnecting with friends. Some days were better than others. Some days I still couldn't get out of bed. But I was trying.",
    "Therapist: You're showing a lot of resilience. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Better, actually. Maybe a 40 on the SUDS? Talking about it... it's hard, but it's not as overwhelming as it used to be.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's continue.",
    "Client: As time passed, I started to see things differently. I realized that James leaving wasn't about my worth as a person. It was about his own issues, his own inability to handle difficult situations. It still hurt, but I stopped blaming myself so much.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What else changed?",
    "Client: I started taking better care of myself. I went back to my classes. I joined a support group for people who'd been through similar medical experiences. It helped to know I wasn't alone. And slowly, I started to trust my body again. To see it as strong, as a survivor, rather than something that had betrayed me.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to talk about this now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually okay. There's still sadness there, and some anger. But it doesn't feel like it's crushing me anymore. My SUDS is probably around 30 now.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How do you see this experience now?",
    "Client: It's still a painful memory. But it's also... I don't know, a turning point maybe? It forced me to confront a lot of things - my health, my relationships, my self-worth. And while I wouldn't choose to go through it again, I can see how it's made me stronger in some ways.",
    "Therapist: That's a very insightful perspective. We're nearing the end of our time. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Tired, but... good? Like I've let go of something heavy. My SUDS is probably around 20 now.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today, Amina. Let's take a few deep breaths together to close out the session.",
    "Client: (takes several deep breaths) Thank you. This was hard, but... I think it helped.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great courage. We'll continue working through this in our next session."
