    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Johnson. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, honestly. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is terrified of reliving it all again. It's been five years since Sarah... since the incident, but it still feels so raw.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Let's do this before I lose my nerve.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: (deep breath) I'm... I'm at the farmer's market. It's a bright Saturday morning. Sarah and I... we're picking out vegetables for dinner. The air smells like fresh bread and flowers. I can hear children laughing nearby.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: We're walking towards the fruit stand. Sarah's telling me about a new recipe she wants to try. I'm only half-listening, distracted by how beautiful she looks in the sunlight. Then... then I hear tires screeching.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: Uh... maybe a 4? It's climbing though.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Keep going. What do you hear?",
    "Client: The screeching gets louder. People start shouting. I turn to look, and... oh God. (voice breaks) There's a car barreling through the market. It's knocking over stands, people are screaming and running.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember to breathe.",
    "Client: (shaky breath) Sarah... she doesn't see it. I grab her arm, try to pull her away, but it's too late. The car... it's coming right at us. I feel my heart pounding, my mouth is dry. I can't... I can't move fast enough.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe higher. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Can you describe what you see?",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) The car... it hits Sarah. I see her body... God, I see her fly through the air. There's a sickening thud when she lands. I'm screaming, but I can barely hear myself over the chaos.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I run to her. My legs feel like lead, but I force myself to move. There's blood... so much blood. Her eyes are open, but they're... they're empty. I'm calling her name, shaking her, begging her to wake up.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... helpless. Angry. Terrified. My hands are shaking, just like they did that day. I can smell the blood and gasoline. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here in the present. What's happening around you?",
    "Client: People are gathering around us. Someone's calling for an ambulance. I hear sirens in the distance. But I can't focus on anything except Sarah. Her skin is getting cold. I... I know she's gone, but I can't accept it.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a deep breath. What happens next?",
    "Client: The paramedics arrive. They try to pull me away from Sarah, but I refuse to let go. I'm sobbing, pleading with them to save her. But deep down, I know... I know it's too late.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What are you experiencing?",
    "Client: Guilt. Overwhelming guilt. I keep thinking if I had been faster, if I had noticed the car sooner... maybe I could have saved her. The pain in my chest is... it's unbearable.",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. You did everything you could.",
    "Client: (voice breaking) But it wasn't enough. I watched the love of my life die, and I couldn't do anything to stop it. I feel... I feel like I failed her.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's still... still a 9. My heart's racing. I can feel sweat on my palms.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep breathing. What happens after the paramedics arrive?",
    "Client: They... they pronounce her dead at the scene. I'm in shock. I can't process what's happening. The police are there, asking questions, but I can barely speak. Everything feels surreal, like a nightmare I can't wake up from.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel in that moment?",
    "Client: Empty. Completely and utterly empty. Like a part of me died with Sarah. I... I don't know how I'll go on without her.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep replaying the moment over and over. Wondering what I could have done differently. Wishing it was me instead of her. The guilt... it's crushing me.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here in the present. You're safe.",
    "Client: (deep breath) Right. I'm... I'm here. But it still hurts so much.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7?",
    "Therapist: That's good. Can you tell me what happens next?",
    "Client: The police take my statement. I'm... I'm barely coherent. They tell me the driver was drunk. He survived. I feel... I feel such intense anger. How could he be okay when Sarah's gone?",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel angry. How do you cope with that anger?",
    "Client: I... I don't. Not really. I shut down. The next few days are a blur. Planning the funeral, dealing with family... I'm just going through the motions. I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see her... see the accident.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, remembering all this?",
    "Client: It's... it's still painful. But... I don't know. Maybe a little less overwhelming? My SUDS is probably around a 6 now.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. Can you tell me about the funeral?",
    "Client: (sighs) It's a beautiful day. Sunny, just like the day of the accident. It feels... wrong. Like the world should be as dark as I feel inside. There are so many people. Sarah was... she was loved by everyone who knew her.",
    "Therapist: What do you remember most about that day?",
    "Client: I... I remember standing at the podium, trying to deliver the eulogy. My hands are shaking so badly I can barely hold the paper. I start to speak, but... I break down. I can't get the words out. Sarah's sister has to finish for me.",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly difficult. How did you feel in that moment?",
    "Client: Ashamed. Angry at myself for not being stronger. For not being able to honor Sarah the way she deserved. But also... also grateful for the support around me.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel all of those emotions. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 5, I think. Talking about it... it's hard, but it's not as overwhelming as before.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How do you feel about the work we've done today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. But also... maybe a little relieved? It's like... like I've been carrying this weight for so long, and now it's a tiny bit lighter.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. You've done very well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I didn't think I could do this. But maybe... maybe there's hope after all.",
    "Therapist: There absolutely is. We'll end here for today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Drained, but... okay. Better than I expected, honestly. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Remember to practice your breathing exercises. We'll continue next session."
