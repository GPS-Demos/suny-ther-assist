    "Therapist: Welcome, Aditya. Today, we'll prepare for imaginal exposure. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Chen. I'm... I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this session all week. The idea of revisiting those memories... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about losing control. What if I can't handle reliving the experience? I've worked so hard to keep those memories at bay. And... I'm embarrassed. Some of what happened... I've never told anyone.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How can I support you today?",
    "Client: I guess... I need to know that I'll be safe. That you won't judge me. And that if it gets too much, we can stop. Can you promise me that?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Your safety is my priority. We'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: Okay, that helps. Can you explain why we're doing this? It seems counterintuitive to purposely remember traumatic events.",
    "Therapist: It helps process the trauma and reduce its power over you. Thoughts on that?",
    "Client: I see. It's like facing a fear head-on, right? But what if it makes things worse? I'm already struggling with anxiety and nightmares.",
    "Therapist: That's a common worry. How do you usually cope with anxiety?",
    "Client: I try deep breathing, sometimes meditation. But when it's really bad, I tend to isolate myself. Being around people in my shared house can be overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Those are good strategies. We'll incorporate them here. What else might help you feel safe?",
    "Client: Maybe... having a stress ball to squeeze? And knowing I can take breaks if needed. Also, can we have some water nearby?",
    "Therapist: Excellent ideas. I'll arrange those. Any other questions before we start?",
    "Client: Yes, actually. How long will this take? And will we do this every session from now on?",
    "Therapist: It varies, but typically 30-45 minutes. We'll do it regularly, not every session.",
    "Client: Okay, that's not as bad as I feared. I think... I think I'm ready to try. But I'm still scared.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Remember, you're in control here.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Chen. That means a lot. I've been carrying this burden for so long, always afraid to look at it directly. But if this can help me move forward, to feel safer in my own skin and maybe even trust people again... then I want to try. I just hope I'm strong enough.",
    "Therapist: You are strong. We'll take this journey together, step by step.",
    "Client: Alright. I appreciate your guidance and support. Let's do this."
