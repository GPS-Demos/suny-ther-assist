    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also kind of numb at the same time. That memory of being locked in that tiny room... it's bringing up so much. My heart is still pounding, and I feel this tightness in my chest. It's like I'm right back there, you know?",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are coming up for you now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. How no one came when I called out. I was just a child, and they left me there for hours. I remember the panic setting in, wondering if I'd ever get out. And then... and then there's this overwhelming sense of shame. Like, maybe I deserved it somehow. God, why can't I shake that feeling?",
    "Therapist: It sounds really intense. How are you managing those feelings right now?",
    "Client: I'm trying to breathe through it, like we practiced. But it's hard. My hands are shaky, and I feel kind of dizzy. Part of me wants to just run out of here and forget about all of this. But another part knows I need to face it. It's just... it's so much. I keep seeing flashes of that room, the peeling wallpaper, the musty smell. It's like I'm suffocating all over again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I... I'm angry. Really angry. Not just at the people who locked me in there, but at everyone who should have protected me. Where were they? Why didn't anyone notice what was happening to me? And I'm angry at myself too, for still letting this affect me so much after all these years. Shouldn't I be over this by now?",
    "Therapist: How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like a fire in my stomach. My jaw is clenched, and I want to scream or hit something. But there's also this deep sadness underneath it all. Like a weight on my chest. I feel so small and vulnerable, just like I did back then. It's overwhelming, but... but I'm here. I'm actually talking about it. That feels... I don't know, important somehow?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What's it like to be sharing this now?",
    "Client: It's terrifying, honestly. But also... kind of liberating? I've kept this bottled up for so long. Talking about it, it's like I'm finally acknowledging that little girl who was so scared and alone. I feel exposed, but also... maybe a little stronger? Like I'm not carrying this secret anymore. It's out there, and I'm still standing. That's... that's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Indeed. How does this connect to your overall journey?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's helping me understand why I struggle with trust and anxiety so much. This fear of being trapped or abandoned, it's always there in the background. But facing it head-on like this, it's scary as hell, but it's also showing me that I can handle more than I thought. Maybe I'm not as helpless as I felt back then. It's a small step, but it feels like I'm starting to reclaim some power that was taken from me.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: A mix of things. There's still fear and sadness, but also a glimmer of hope. Like maybe I can work through this. I'm exhausted, but I also feel... I don't know, maybe a bit proud? That I faced this memory and didn't completely fall apart. It's weird, I feel both drained and somehow lighter at the same time. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Many people experience that. How would you like to care for yourself now?",
    "Client: I think I need some quiet time to process all of this. Maybe take a walk in the park near my house. Being in nature always helps ground me. And I might call my partner later. I've been pushing him away when these memories come up, but maybe... maybe I can try to let him in a little. It's scary, but I think it might help. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful plan. How are you feeling as we wrap up?",
    "Client: Still shaky, but... okay, I think. Like I've been through a storm, but I'm starting to see some clearing skies. Thank you for... for being here with me through this. It means more than I can say. I'm nervous about what comes next, but I also feel like I've taken a big step today. It's a lot to process, but I'm grateful for the chance to finally face this.",
    "Therapist: You've shown immense courage today. We'll continue next week?",
    "Client: Yes, I'll be here. It's tough, but I think it's helping. Thank you again. I'll see you next week."
