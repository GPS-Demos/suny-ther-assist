    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the car accident?",
    "Client: Okay... I was driving home from work. It was raining, and the roads were slick. I remember gripping the steering wheel tightly, feeling tense. Suddenly, I saw headlights coming towards me in my lane. My heart started racing, and I felt panic rising in my chest.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: The other car was swerving, and I tried to avoid it. I jerked the wheel to the right, but my car started to spin. Everything was a blur of lights and motion. I could hear the screeching of tires and the sound of metal crunching. I... I'm not sure I can keep going.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel uncomfortable. You're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... As the car spun, I felt completely helpless. I couldn't control anything. Then there was a sudden impact, and my body jerked violently. The airbag deployed, hitting me in the face. It felt like I couldn't breathe. The smell of burnt rubber and something metallic filled the air.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. What happened next?",
    "Client: Everything went quiet for a moment. I could hear my own ragged breathing and the rain pattering on the roof. My chest hurt, and I tasted blood in my mouth. I was disoriented, trying to make sense of what just happened. I remember thinking about my wife, wondering if I'd see her again.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're doing great.",
    "Client: It's hard to think about. I felt so alone and scared. I tried to move, but pain shot through my body. I could hear people shouting outside the car, but it sounded far away. I was trapped, and the fear of the car catching fire or exploding kept flashing through my mind.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I started to cry. I've never felt so vulnerable in my life. The physical pain was bad, but the emotional pain was worse. I kept thinking about all the things I might never do again, all the moments I might miss with my family. It was overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: Eventually, I heard sirens. Paramedics arrived and started working to get me out of the car. They were talking to me, trying to keep me calm, but I was in shock. The process of being extracted from the car was painful and frightening. I remember the sound of metal being cut and the jostling as they moved me onto a backboard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job describing this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling shaky and a bit nauseous. Talking about it brings back the fear and helplessness I felt that day. But... I also feel a strange sense of relief. Like I'm finally facing this memory instead of running from it.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're making progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard, but I want to keep going. In the ambulance, I remember the paramedic holding my hand. It was the first time since the accident that I felt a connection to another person. I was still scared, but that simple human touch helped ground me. I started to believe that maybe I would be okay.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful memory. You're doing great.",
    "Client: At the hospital, everything was a blur of tests and questions. I was in pain, but the fear had started to subside. When my wife arrived, I broke down crying again. Seeing her face, knowing I was alive to see her... it was overwhelming. I felt grateful but also guilty for putting her through this worry.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have mixed emotions. Keep going.",
    "Client: The recovery process was long and difficult. Physical therapy was painful, and there were days I wanted to give up. But I kept thinking about that moment in the car when I thought I might never see my family again. It pushed me to keep trying, to fight through the pain and frustration.",
    "Therapist: You showed remarkable strength. How do you feel now, reflecting on all of this?",
    "Client: It's still hard to think about, but I feel... stronger, I guess. Like I've survived something terrible and come out the other side. I still have moments of fear when I'm driving, especially in the rain, but I'm working on it. Talking about it like this, it feels like I'm taking back some control.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: Thank you. I am proud, in a way. It's not something I would ever want to go through again, but I've learned that I'm more resilient than I thought. I appreciate life more now, and I try not to take my time with my family for granted. It's changed me, but not all of those changes are bad.",
    "Therapist: That's a very insightful observation. How are you feeling about ending our session?",
    "Client: I feel drained, but also somewhat relieved. It's like I've been carrying this heavy weight, and now I've set it down for a moment. I know we'll have to pick it up again in future sessions, but for now, I feel a bit lighter. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. We'll end here."
