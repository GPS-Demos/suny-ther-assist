    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also frozen at the same time. I can still hear the sirens, you know? And see the flashing lights. It's bringing back so much.",
    "Therapist: What's most vivid for you right now?",
    "Client: The fear. It's... it's overwhelming. I keep seeing the officer's face, how angry he looked. I didn't do anything wrong, but he treated me like a criminal. My heart is pounding just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Where do you feel that fear in your body?",
    "Client: It's like a knot in my stomach. And my chest feels tight, like I can't breathe properly. My hands are shaking a little too. It's... it's hard to shake this feeling off.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"Why me?\" Why did this have to happen to me? I'm a good person, I follow the laws. But in that moment, none of that mattered. I felt so... so powerless. Like I was nothing. And now, I can't help but wonder if it'll happen again. Every time I see a police car, I freeze up.",
    "Therapist: How does that powerlessness feel now?",
    "Client: It's... it's suffocating. Like I'm trapped in my own skin. I want to run, to hide, but there's nowhere to go. It makes me angry too, you know? I didn't deserve this. No one does. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe ashamed? Like I should have done something differently.",
    "Therapist: Can you tell me more about that shame?",
    "Client: I guess... I feel like I should have stood up for myself more. But I was so scared. I kept thinking about all those stories on the news, about people who resisted and... and didn't make it home. So I just froze. And now, I feel weak. Like I let myself down, let my family down. My kids look at me differently now, like they're worried about me. I hate that.",
    "Therapist: How does sharing this now feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. Really hard. But also, I don't know, maybe a little relieving? Like I'm not carrying this alone anymore. But it also makes it more real, you know? Talking about it makes me confront the fact that this really happened to me. It wasn't just a bad dream.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you confront that reality?",
    "Client: A mix of things, I guess. Sadness, for sure. I feel like I lost something that day - my sense of safety, my trust in the system. But also... maybe a tiny bit of hope? Like, by talking about it, maybe I'm starting to process it. It still hurts, but it feels a little less overwhelming than before.",
    "Therapist: Can you describe that hope?",
    "Client: It's... it's small, but it's there. Like a tiny flame. I guess it's the idea that maybe I can work through this. That I don't have to let this define me forever. Don't get me wrong, it's still scary and painful. But talking about it, facing it head-on... it makes me feel like I'm doing something. Like I'm not just a victim anymore.",
    "Therapist: How does that shift feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's strange. Good, but also scary. Like I'm stepping into unknown territory. I've been so used to feeling helpless, you know? But now, it's like I'm taking back a little bit of control. It's empowering, but also terrifying. What if I can't do it? What if I'm not strong enough?",
    "Therapist: What would being \"strong enough\" look like to you?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. I guess it would mean being able to walk down the street without constantly looking over my shoulder. To see a police officer and not immediately panic. To be able to tell my story without breaking down. To feel like myself again, you know? The person I was before all this happened. But maybe... maybe it's not about going back. Maybe it's about moving forward, becoming someone new. Someone who's been through this but isn't defined by it.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... it's both exciting and intimidating. The idea of letting go of who I was before is scary. That person felt safe, secure. But at the same time, I can't go back to that. So moving forward, becoming someone new... it's challenging, but it also feels like the only way. I want to be someone who can talk about this experience and maybe even help others who've gone through similar things. Someone who's not just a survivor, but a... a thriver, I guess? Is that even a word?",
    "Therapist: What does being a \"thriver\" mean to you?",
    "Client: I think... I think it means not just getting by, but really living. Not letting this experience hold me back, but using it to grow stronger. To be more empathetic, more aware. To stand up for others who might be going through similar things. To be an example for my kids, showing them that bad things can happen, but we can overcome them. It's about turning this pain into something meaningful, you know?",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that possibility?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming, but in a different way than before. It's like... like I can see a light at the end of the tunnel. It's still far away, and the path to get there looks tough. But for the first time in a long time, I feel like I might be able to reach it. It's scary, and I know there will be setbacks. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little excited? Like I'm on the verge of something important.",
    "Therapist: What's the next step for you?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's about keeping this momentum. Continuing to face these memories, as hard as it is. Maybe... maybe even thinking about how I can use my experience to help others. I'm not ready for that yet, but I can see it as a possibility down the line. For now, I just want to focus on healing, on rebuilding my sense of safety and trust. And maybe... maybe start looking for work again. I've been avoiding it, but I think getting back out there might be good for me.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about our session today?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've done some hard work. It's been intense, reliving those moments. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've put down a bit of the burden I've been carrying. I know we have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I might be able to get through this. Thank you for... for creating a space where I can talk about this stuff.",
    "Therapist: You've shown a lot of courage today. How about we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think that's a good idea. It's been intense, but... good. Really good. I'm looking forward to our next session, even though I know it'll be challenging. But I feel like I'm making progress, you know? Like I'm finally moving forward instead of just being stuck in that moment. Thank you again, doc. This... this means a lot to me."
