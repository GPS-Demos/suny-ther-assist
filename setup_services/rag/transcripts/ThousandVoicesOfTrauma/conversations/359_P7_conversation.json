    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Can you describe the animal attack?",
    "Client: Okay... I was hiking in New Zealand, near a remote beach. It was supposed to be a relaxing day, but... (deep breath) I remember hearing a strange noise behind me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: I turned around and saw this massive sea lion. It was much bigger than I expected. At first, I was just surprised, but then... (voice trembles) it started charging at me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What happened next?",
    "Client: I... I froze. I couldn't move. My heart was pounding so hard I could hear it. The sea lion was getting closer, and I could see its teeth. I wanted to run, but my legs wouldn't work.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Keep going.",
    "Client: It knocked me down. The impact was so strong, I felt like all the air left my lungs. I could smell its fishy breath, feel its weight on me. I thought... (starts crying) I thought I was going to die.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel emotional. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (through tears) I managed to roll away, but it bit my leg. The pain was excruciating. I screamed, but there was no one around to help. I felt so alone and terrified.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (inhales deeply) I somehow found the strength to get up and run. My leg was bleeding, but adrenaline took over. I ran faster than I ever have in my life. I could hear the sea lion behind me, grunting and chasing.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Continue.",
    "Client: I spotted some large rocks and managed to climb up. The sea lion couldn't follow. I was safe, but... (voice shaking) I was trapped. I sat there for hours, in pain, scared it would find a way up.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. How did you feel?",
    "Client: Terrified. Helpless. My leg was throbbing, and I kept replaying the attack in my mind. I felt so stupid for hiking alone. What if no one found me? What if I bled out?",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those thoughts. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Eventually, some other hikers found me. They called for help, and I was airlifted to a hospital. But even after I was safe... (sighs) I couldn't shake the fear. I still have nightmares about it.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable resilience. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Drained. Talking about it... it brings back all those feelings. But also... maybe a little relieved? Like I'm not carrying it all alone anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. We'll end here for today.",
    "Client: Thank you. This was hard, but... I think it's helping. Can we continue this in our next session?",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've made excellent progress today."
