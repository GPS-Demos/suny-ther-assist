    "Therapist: Welcome, John. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: Yeah, I suppose so. I'm feeling a bit on edge about it, to be honest. It's not easy thinking about that time.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's start with a SUDS rating. How would you rate your distress from 0 to 100?",
    "Client: Uh... probably around a 60 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we're here together. Take a deep breath and begin when you're ready.",
    "Client: Alright... *deep breath* I'm back there, in the prison cell. It's dark, and the air feels heavy. I can hear the distant sound of metal doors clanging shut. The concrete walls are closing in on me, and I... I can feel my heart starting to race.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: The fluorescent lights are flickering, casting weird shadows. There's this... constant murmur of voices from other cells. I'm sitting on the hard bunk, and the scratchy blanket is irritating my skin. I keep thinking about the storm that hit just before I was arrested. It's like the chaos outside matched what was happening in my life.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My stomach's in knots. I feel nauseous, and my hands are clammy. I can't stop fidgeting.",
    "Therapist: Focus on those sensations. What happens next?",
    "Client: A guard walks by, his boots echoing in the hallway. I flinch at the sound, remembering how rough they were during processing. I... I can smell the musty odor of the cell, mixed with disinfectant. It's making me feel sick.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about my partner. How I've let them down. The storm destroyed our home, and now I'm here because I... I turned to drugs to cope. God, I'm such a failure.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe now. Keep going.",
    "Client: *voice trembling* I can hear someone crying in a nearby cell. It reminds me of the people I heard screaming during the storm. I... I start to panic, thinking I'll never get out of here. The walls feel like they're closing in even more.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 75, I think.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep breathing and continue.",
    "Client: I'm pacing in the cell now. My feet are cold on the concrete floor. I keep replaying the moment I was arrested in my head. The sound of the wind howling outside, the officers shouting... It's all mixed up with memories of the storm.",
    "Therapist: What do you do to cope with these feelings?",
    "Client: I... I try to distract myself. I start counting the cracks in the wall, but it's not helping. I can feel the panic rising in my chest. I'm sweating now, and my heart's pounding so hard I think it might burst.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: I curl up on the bunk, trying to make myself as small as possible. I can hear my own ragged breathing. The guilt is overwhelming. I think about how I turned to drugs after the storm, how I let everything spiral out of control. I feel so ashamed.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I start to cry. Quietly at first, but then I can't hold it back. I'm sobbing, and I don't care who hears me. I feel so alone, so trapped. The cell feels like it's swallowing me whole.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're doing well.",
    "Client: *voice shaky* I can taste the salt of my tears. My throat feels tight, like I can't breathe. I'm gasping for air, and for a moment, I think I might be dying. The fear is overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's 85 now. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I start to think about my future. Will I ever get out? Will my partner still be there? The storm took everything, and now this... I feel like my life is over. I can hear the rain starting outside, and it triggers memories of the disaster.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel?",
    "Client: My muscles are so tense they're aching. I feel lightheaded, and my stomach is churning. I think I might be sick.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I force myself to stand up. I go to the tiny window and press my face against the bars. The cool metal helps ground me a little. I can see the rain falling outside, and for a moment, it's almost peaceful.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: The rain reminds me of the storm, but it's gentler now. I start to focus on the sound of it hitting the roof. It's... it's almost soothing. I take a deep breath, and I can smell the fresh air coming through the window.",
    "Therapist: How does this change how you're feeling?",
    "Client: I... I feel a tiny bit calmer. The panic is still there, but it's not as overwhelming. I start to think about my partner again, but this time... I think about how they've always supported me. Maybe... maybe they'll understand.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 70, I think.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Continue.",
    "Client: I move away from the window and sit back on the bunk. I'm still shaking, but it's not as bad. I start to think about what I can do to make things right. Maybe... maybe this is rock bottom, and I can only go up from here.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive thought. How does it make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of emotions. I still feel scared and ashamed, but there's a tiny spark of hope too. I think about the resilience I showed after the storm. Maybe I can find that strength again.",
    "Therapist: Keep going with that thought.",
    "Client: I... I start to make a mental list of things I can do. I need to get help for my addiction. I need to make amends with my partner. I need to rebuild, just like we did after the storm. It feels overwhelming, but... but not impossible.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel now?",
    "Client: I'm still tense, but... but I can breathe a little easier. My heart isn't racing as much. I feel... I feel exhausted, but also like a weight has lifted a bit.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 60 now.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. Let's start to bring you back to the present.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... I'm... I'm back in the room with you. It feels... it feels different now. Like I've faced something I've been avoiding for a long time.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained, but there's also this sense of... I don't know, accomplishment maybe? Like I've taken a step forward.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Yeah, okay. I... I can feel the chair beneath me. I can see the sunlight coming through the window. I'm... I'm here, in the present.",
    "Therapist: Well done. What's your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 40 now. I feel... I feel okay.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today, John. How do you feel about the session?",
    "Client: It was tough, really tough. But... but I think it was important. I feel like I understand my experience better now. And maybe... maybe I can start to move forward.",
    "Therapist: That's a great insight. We'll end here for today. Remember to practice your coping strategies.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I will. This wasn't easy, but I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself. We'll continue this work in our next session."
