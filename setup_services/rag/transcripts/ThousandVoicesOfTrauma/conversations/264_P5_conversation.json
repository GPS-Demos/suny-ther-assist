    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm honestly quite nervous, Dr. Thompson. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of reliving that horrible day at the zoo... it makes my stomach churn. I've spent so long trying to forget it all.",
    "Therapist: Your anxiety is understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried that talking about the animal attack will bring back all those intense feelings of terror and helplessness. I can still hear the screams sometimes, you know? And what if I completely fall apart during the session? I'm not sure I can handle that.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How do you think revisiting the memory might help?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe it could help me process what happened? It's just that I've been avoiding thinking about it for so long. Every time I see anything related to that day, I immediately change the channel or leave the room. It's exhausting always being on guard like that. Maybe facing it head-on could help me regain some control?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. Avoidance often prolongs suffering. This exercise aims to reduce that.",
    "Client: That makes sense, but it's still scary. How exactly will this work? Will I need to close my eyes and describe everything in detail? The thought of that makes me feel panicky already.",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the event aloud. I'll guide you through it supportively.",
    "Client: Okay, I think I can manage that. But what if I start to panic or feel overwhelmed? I'm worried I might have a full-blown anxiety attack.",
    "Therapist: We'll use grounding techniques if needed. You're in control throughout.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I appreciate your support, Dr. Thompson. I guess I'm also wondering about the aftermath. Will I be okay to drive home after this? I'm concerned I might be too shaken up.",
    "Therapist: Good question. We'll end with a calming exercise. How's your support system?",
    "Client: My husband's been really supportive throughout this whole process. He's offered to pick me up after sessions if needed. I just hate feeling so vulnerable, you know? I used to be so independent and confident before all this happened.",
    "Therapist: It's great you have support. This process can help regain that confidence.",
    "Client: I hope so. I miss feeling like myself. Okay, I think I'm ready to give this a try. Can you walk me through what exactly I need to do?",
    "Therapist: Certainly. You'll describe the event in present tense, including thoughts and feelings.",
    "Client: Present tense? That sounds intense. But I understand it's to make the memory more immediate, right? I'll do my best. Is it okay if I need to take breaks?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll go at your pace. Your courage is commendable, Sarah.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Thompson. I appreciate your patience and guidance. I'm nervous, but I'm also feeling a glimmer of hope. Maybe this will finally help me move past that terrible day and start living my life fully again.",
    "Therapist: That's the goal. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I am. Let's do this."
