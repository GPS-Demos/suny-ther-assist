    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Can you describe the scene where you witnessed violence?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in my living room. It's late at night, and I can hear shouting from the kitchen. My parents are arguing again. I'm trying to focus on my homework, but their voices keep getting louder.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you see and hear.",
    "Client: I hear a loud crash, like something breaking. My heart starts racing. I want to go check, but I'm scared. Then I hear my mom cry out in pain. I can't just sit here anymore. I get up and slowly walk towards the kitchen.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you notice as you approach?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking as I reach for the doorknob. I can hear my dad yelling and my mom sobbing. I push the door open slightly, and I see... I see my dad grabbing my mom's arm really hard. There's a broken plate on the floor.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: My mom's face... she looks so scared and hurt. I've never seen her like that before. My dad's eyes are wild, and he's red in the face. He doesn't even notice me standing there. He raises his hand, and I know he's going to hit her. I want to scream, to do something, but I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I can't breathe. I feel so helpless. My dad slaps my mom across the face, and the sound... it's so loud. My mom stumbles back, holding her cheek. I can see tears streaming down her face. I want to run to her, to protect her, but I'm terrified of what my dad might do.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: I... I can't. It's too much. I feel like I'm right back there, watching it happen all over again. My chest feels tight, and I'm starting to feel dizzy.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Try to stay present.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm trying. I see my mom looking at me now. Her eyes are pleading, but I don't know what she wants me to do. My dad turns and sees me. His face changes from anger to shock. He lets go of my mom and takes a step back. I can see guilt in his eyes, but it doesn't make me feel any better.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel angry and scared. I hate that I couldn't do anything to help my mom. I hate that my dad could do something like that. And I'm terrified because I don't know if it will happen again.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to have those feelings. Can you continue?",
    "Client: My mom rushes over to me and hugs me tight. She's whispering that everything's okay, but I can feel her shaking. My dad is just standing there, looking lost. I want to scream at him, to ask him how he could do this, but the words won't come out. I just stand there, holding my mom, feeling like everything I thought I knew about my family has shattered.",

    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. You did well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was hard, but I think it helped to talk about it. I've never really described it in detail like that before.",
    "Therapist: You showed a lot of strength. Is there anything else you'd like to share?",
    "Client: No, I think that's enough for today. I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's end here and discuss how you're feeling."
