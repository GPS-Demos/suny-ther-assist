    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the refugee experience you mentioned?",
    "Client: Okay... It was about 40 years ago. We were fleeing our home country due to political unrest. I remember the chaos at the border crossing. There were so many people, all desperate to get through. The noise was overwhelming - children crying, officials shouting, engines roaring. I can still smell the exhaust fumes and sweat.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: We had been waiting for hours in the sweltering heat. My husband was holding our youngest child, and I was clutching our other two. I remember feeling so thirsty, but we had run out of water. The fear was palpable. Everyone around us looked terrified. I kept thinking, \"What if they don't let us through? What will happen to us?\"",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I see the face of a border guard. He looked so stern, almost cruel. As we approached, my heart was racing. I felt like I could hardly breathe. He was scrutinizing our papers, and I remember thinking that our whole future depended on this man's decision.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The wait felt like an eternity. I was trying to keep the children quiet, but they were tired and scared. I remember my legs shaking, feeling like they might give out at any moment. Then... then the guard stamped our papers. The relief was... overwhelming. But it was short-lived because we still had to get on a crowded bus to the refugee camp.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. How did you feel on the bus?",
    "Client: The bus was so packed. We could barely move. It was hot, stuffy, and the smell was awful. I was worried about my children - were they getting enough air? Would they be okay? I felt claustrophobic and panicked. Every bump in the road made me fear we might crash. The journey seemed endless.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I know, but it still feels so real. When we finally arrived at the camp, I was exhausted. The camp itself was a shock - rows and rows of tents, so many people, and the facilities were so basic. I remember feeling a mix of relief that we had made it, but also despair at our new reality. How would we live like this? How long would we be here?",
    "Therapist: You've come through so much. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard to talk about. My heart is racing, and I feel a bit shaky. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe proud? We survived that. We made it through and built a new life. It wasn't easy, but we did it.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. You showed incredible strength.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's strange, but talking about it makes me realize how far we've come. We arrived with nothing but the clothes on our backs, and now... now we have a home, our children are grown, and we're safe. But sometimes, especially when I see news about current refugees, it all comes flooding back.",
    "Therapist: It's natural for those memories to resurface. How do you cope when that happens?",
    "Client: I try to remind myself that we're safe now. Sometimes I call my children or spend time with my grandchildren. It helps to see how well they're doing, how different their lives are from what we went through. But sometimes the anxiety is overwhelming, and I feel like I'm right back there, in that moment of uncertainty and fear.",
    "Therapist: You've developed some good coping strategies. Let's explore more ways to manage those moments.",
    "Client: I'd like that. Sometimes I feel guilty for still struggling with this after so many years. Shouldn't I be over it by now?",
    "Therapist: There's no timeline for healing. Your feelings are valid.",
    "Client: Thank you for saying that. It helps to talk about it, even though it's difficult. I've kept these memories bottled up for so long, afraid to revisit them. But facing them like this... it's hard, but I think it might be helping.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel drained, but also... lighter somehow. Like I've set down a heavy burden I've been carrying for years. It's still there, but it feels more manageable now.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. We'll continue working through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm glad I finally decided to seek help. For years, I thought I could handle it on my own, but now I see the value in talking about it. It's like... like I'm finally allowing myself to fully process what happened.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. We'll end here for today. Well done."
