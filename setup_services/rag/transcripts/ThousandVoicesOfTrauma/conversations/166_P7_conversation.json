    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Can you describe the combat situation you experienced?",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. It was during my second tour in Afghanistan. We were on a routine patrol in a small village. The sun was setting, casting long shadows across the dusty streets. I remember feeling uneasy, like something wasn't right.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you saw and felt.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there was a loud explosion. I was thrown to the ground, my ears ringing. I could smell smoke and burning rubber. When I looked up, I saw... I saw my squad leader. He was... he was just lying there, not moving. There was so much blood...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) I... I can't. It's too much. I feel like I'm back there.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay... I remember crawling towards him, my heart pounding. I could hear screaming and gunfire in the background. When I reached him, I knew... I knew he was gone. I felt so helpless, so angry.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: But that's not even the worst part. As I was trying to drag his body to safety, I saw a young boy, couldn't have been more than 12, holding a detonator. He looked terrified, like he didn't want to be there. I raised my weapon, but I... I couldn't shoot. He was just a child.",
    "Therapist: That must have been an incredibly difficult moment. Keep going.",
    "Client: (voice breaking) I froze. I just stood there, staring at him. Then one of my teammates shot him. The boy fell, and I... I felt relieved and horrified at the same time. How could I feel relieved that a child was dead?",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to have conflicting emotions in such a situation.",
    "Client: After that, everything's a blur. We managed to get out, but I lost two more friends that day. And that boy... his face still haunts me. I keep thinking, what if I had acted differently? What if I had been able to save my squad leader?",
    "Therapist: You're showing tremendous courage sharing this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. Sad. Angry. But also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. Your feelings are valid.",
    "Client: It's just... I've never talked about this in so much detail before. I always tried to push it away, but now... it's like I'm seeing it all again, but from a distance. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. You're doing really well.",
    "Client: I guess... I guess I'm realizing that I've been carrying this weight for so long. It's exhausting. But talking about it... it's hard, but it's also like I'm finally acknowledging what happened. Not just the event, but how it affected me.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: I think... I think I can keep going. It's painful, but I want to work through this. I'm tired of letting these memories control me.",
    "Therapist: I'm here to support you. Whenever you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay. After the explosion, when we finally got back to base... that's when it really hit me. The adrenaline wore off, and I just... broke down. I couldn't stop shaking. I felt so ashamed, like I had failed my team.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to express those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I remember sitting in the barracks, just staring at my friend's empty bunk. It felt so wrong, so unfair. And then there was the guilt. Why did I survive when they didn't? I kept replaying every decision, every moment, wondering if I could have done something differently.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: The worst part was writing letters to their families. How do you tell someone that their loved one isn't coming home? I felt like a fraud, like I didn't deserve to be the one delivering that news.",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly difficult. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. I can feel my heart racing, and my hands are shaking a bit. But... I also feel like I'm finally facing it. For years, I've tried to push these memories away, but they always came back in nightmares or flashbacks. Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also like I'm taking back some control.",
    "Therapist: You're showing remarkable strength. Do you want to continue?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. It's painful, but it's also... I don't know, maybe healing in a way? I've carried this alone for so long. Sharing it, even though it's difficult, feels like I'm finally acknowledging what happened and how it affected me.",
    "Therapist: That's an important step. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I'm ready to talk about what happened after we returned home. That's when things really started to fall apart for me...",
    "Therapist: I'm here to listen. Take your time.",
    "Client: When we got back, everyone was calling us heroes. There were parades, ceremonies, all that stuff. But I felt like a fraud. How could they call me a hero when I couldn't even save my own friends? I started isolating myself, pushing away family and friends.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. Keep going.",
    "Client: I couldn't sleep without nightmares. I'd wake up in cold sweats, thinking I was back there. During the day, loud noises would send me into a panic. I started drinking just to numb myself. It was like... like I left a part of myself in Afghanistan.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave sharing this. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. But also, in a strange way, it's a relief to finally say these things out loud. I've kept it bottled up for so long, thinking I had to be strong, that talking about it would make me weak. But maybe... maybe talking about it is its own kind of strength?",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. You are showing great courage.",
    "Client: I think... I think I'm ready to stop for today. This has been intense, but... good, I think. Thank you for listening and guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. We'll end here and process this next time."
