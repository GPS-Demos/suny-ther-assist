    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Johnson. How are you feeling about our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: Oh, well... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I've been thinking about it all week, and part of me wants to just cancel and go home. But I know that won't help in the long run.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Your courage is admirable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Where do you want me to start?",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes and take us to the beginning of the hostage situation. Describe what you see and feel.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm at the bank. It's a Tuesday afternoon, and I'm just waiting in line to deposit a check. The air conditioning is humming, and there's soft music playing. I can smell coffee from the little caf\u00e9 area they have... Then suddenly, there's shouting. A man bursts through the door waving a gun. My heart starts racing, and I feel frozen in place. He's yelling at everyone to get down on the ground. I... I can't move. My legs feel like lead.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, about a 6, I'd say.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath and continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: The man with the gun, he's pacing back and forth. I can hear his heavy breathing. Someone starts to cry, and he screams at them to shut up. I'm on the ground now, my cheek pressed against the cold tile. I can taste something metallic in my mouth \u2013 I think I've bitten my lip. The gunman is talking to someone behind the counter, demanding money. His voice is shaking. I think... I think he's scared too.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm terrified. My whole body is trembling. I keep thinking about my daughter, wondering if I'll ever see her again. I want to run, but I'm paralyzed with fear. The air feels thick, like I can't get enough oxygen.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here. What's happening now?",
    "Client: There's a commotion near the entrance. I hear glass breaking. My heart is pounding so hard I think it might burst out of my chest. I risk a glance up and see police officers entering. The gunman is shouting, waving his weapon around wildly. I squeeze my eyes shut, praying it will all be over soon.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Feel your feet on the floor. Can you describe something you see in this room?",
    "Client: I... I see the plant in the corner. It has green leaves with white edges.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, when you're ready, let's continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: Okay... There's a loud bang. At first, I think it's a gunshot, but then I realize it's a flash-bang grenade. My ears are ringing, and there's chaos all around. People are screaming and running. I'm still on the floor, too scared to move. I can smell gunpowder and sweat. Someone grabs my arm \u2013 it's a police officer. He's yelling at me to get up and run, but my legs won't work. He practically drags me out of the building.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm shaking uncontrollably. My throat is so dry it hurts to swallow. I feel dizzy and nauseous. As we get outside, the bright sunlight hurts my eyes. I can hear sirens and people shouting. It's all a blur.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with those sensations. What happens after you're outside?",
    "Client: I'm sitting on the curb. Someone puts a blanket around my shoulders, but I can't stop shivering. A paramedic is talking to me, but I can't focus on what he's saying. I keep replaying the scene in my head \u2013 the gun, the shouting, the fear. I feel... I feel ashamed that I was so helpless.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel that way. Remember, you survived a terrifying situation. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's still pretty high... maybe a 7.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. Can you tell me about any positive thoughts or feelings you have looking back on this experience?",
    "Client: I... I guess I'm grateful that no one was seriously hurt. And I remember feeling a sense of connection with the other hostages. We went through something horrible together, and there was a kind of unspoken bond.",
    "Therapist: That's a good observation. Let's stay with that feeling for a moment. How does it change your perspective on the event?",
    "Client: It makes me feel less alone, I suppose. Like we were all in it together. But it's still hard to shake the fear and helplessness.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you describe what happened in the days following the incident?",
    "Client: The first few nights were awful. I couldn't sleep. Every little noise made me jump. I kept reliving it over and over. I was afraid to leave my house, especially to go to any banks or stores. I felt so vulnerable, like it could happen again at any moment.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now as you recall those days?",
    "Client: It's... it's bringing back a lot of those feelings. My hands are clammy, and my heart is racing again. But it's not as intense as before. I know I'm safe here.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 5 now.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. Let's focus on how you've coped since then. Can you tell me about any strategies or support that have helped you?",
    "Client: Well, these therapy sessions have been helpful. And I've been doing some meditation, which sometimes calms me down. My daughter has been incredibly supportive \u2013 she even went with me the first time I went back to a bank. It was terrifying, but I did it.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. How did you feel after that first trip back to the bank?",
    "Client: I was shaky and exhausted, but also... proud, I guess. Like I had faced my fears. It didn't fix everything, but it felt like a step forward.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant accomplishment. As we start to wrap up this session, can you tell me about any changes you've noticed in how you think about the incident now compared to right after it happened?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'm starting to see it as something that happened to me, not something that defines me. It's still scary to think about, but I don't feel as powerless. I know I can face difficult things and survive them.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm tired, but also a bit relieved. It's like I've let go of something I've been carrying around.",
    "Therapist: What's your final SUDS level?",
    "Client: I'd say it's down to a 3 now.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. You've done excellent work today. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you... this was hard, but I think it was good for me.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself. We'll continue to work through this in our future sessions. For now, remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
