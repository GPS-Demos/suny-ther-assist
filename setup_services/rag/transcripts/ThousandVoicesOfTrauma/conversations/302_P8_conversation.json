    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel a bit shaky. That memory of the medical procedure in the refugee camp... it's like I was right back there, you know? The smell of antiseptic, the sound of people crying in pain... it's all so vivid.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I think. No, not just fear... terror. I remember feeling so helpless, like I had no control over what was happening to me or my family. And now, even though I know I'm safe here, that feeling of helplessness is creeping back in. It's like... like I'm waiting for something bad to happen again.",
    "Therapist: I see. Can you tell me more about that feeling of helplessness?",
    "Client: It's... it's like being trapped in a tiny box, you know? I can't move, can't breathe properly. Back then, I couldn't protect my children or myself. We were at the mercy of others, and some of them... some of them didn't care if we lived or died. And now, even though I'm here in Australia, sometimes I still feel like that scared woman in the camp, waiting for the next disaster to strike.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you describe this?",
    "Client: My shoulders are so tense they're almost up to my ears. My stomach feels like it's in knots, and I've got this lump in my throat that won't go away. It's like my body's getting ready to run or fight, but there's nowhere to go and nothing to fight against. It's exhausting, really.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why us? Why did we have to go through all that?\" And then I feel guilty for even asking that because so many others had it worse. I wonder if I could have done more to protect my family. And then there's this voice in the back of my head saying, \"You're safe now, why can't you just get over it?\" But I can't seem to shake these feelings, no matter how hard I try.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts and feelings impact your daily life?",
    "Client: Oh, in so many ways. I have trouble sleeping because I'm afraid of the nightmares. I'm always on edge, especially in crowded places or when I hear loud noises. It's affected my relationship with my husband too. He doesn't understand why I can't just \"move on.\" And... well, I've been using alcohol more than I should to try and numb these feelings. I know it's not healthy, but sometimes it feels like the only way to get some peace.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. What do you think might help you feel safer?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe if I could find a way to remind myself that I'm not in that camp anymore. That I'm in Australia, and my family is safe. But it's hard when the memories feel so real. I suppose... maybe talking about it more might help? It's painful, but keeping it all bottled up inside isn't working either.",
    "Therapist: That's a great insight. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's scary, to be honest. Dredging up these memories is like reopening old wounds. But at the same time, I'm tired of living like this. I want to be able to enjoy my life here, to be present for my family without always looking over my shoulder. So yes, I think I want to continue. It's not easy, but if there's a chance it can help me move forward, I want to try.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your courage. What's one small step you can take this week?",
    "Client: Hmm... Maybe I could start writing down my thoughts when I feel overwhelmed by memories. Just to get them out of my head, you know? And perhaps I could try talking to my husband about how I'm feeling. He might not understand completely, but at least he'd know what I'm going through. It's a start, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How does it feel to have this plan?",
    "Client: It's... it's a bit of a relief, actually. Like I'm finally doing something, even if it's small. I'm still scared, and I know it won't be easy, but having a plan makes me feel less helpless. Like maybe, just maybe, I can start to take back some control over my life. It's a tiny spark of hope, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I feel drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've done something important, even though it was hard. Thank you for listening and for helping me through this. I know we have a long way to go, but I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this. Is it okay if I call you if things get too overwhelming between now and our next session?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
