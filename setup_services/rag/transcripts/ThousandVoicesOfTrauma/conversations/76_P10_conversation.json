    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is terrified. It's like my stomach is doing somersaults.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0-100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: Um... probably around a 60? My hands are a bit shaky.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we can pause anytime. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day of the car accident.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm in my car. It's a sunny afternoon, and I'm driving home from work. The radio is playing softly... some pop song I can't quite remember. I'm feeling... content, I guess. Just thinking about what to make for dinner.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm approaching an intersection. The light is green, so I'm not slowing down. But then... oh god... (voice trembles) I see this blur of motion from the right. It's... it's a truck, and it's not stopping.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Panic. Pure panic. My heart is racing, and I can't breathe. I'm trying to hit the brakes, but it's happening so fast. I... I can hear the screeching of tires. Mine? The truck's? I don't know.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Remember, you're safe here. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) It's... it's up to 80, I think.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (inhales deeply) The impact... it's deafening. Metal crunching, glass shattering. My body jerks violently to the side. The airbag explodes in my face, and there's this acrid smell... smoke, maybe? I'm disoriented, everything's spinning.",
    "Therapist: What are you aware of in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest... it feels tight. And my hands... they're clenched so hard they hurt.",
    "Therapist: Notice those sensations. They're memories. You're safe now. What happens after the impact?",
    "Client: I... I'm hanging there, held by my seatbelt. Everything's quiet for a moment, eerily quiet. Then I hear... voices? People shouting. Someone's asking if I'm okay, but I can't respond. I taste blood in my mouth.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. Am I going to die? What about the other driver? Oh god, what if I killed someone? (starts crying) I can't move. I'm trapped, and I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Sarah. Remember, you survived this. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: (through tears) It's... it's 90. This is so hard.",
    "Therapist: I know it is. You're very brave. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: (takes a few deep breaths) Okay... I'm hearing sirens now. They sound far away at first, but they're getting closer. Someone's telling me not to move, that help is coming. I'm still so scared, but there's... relief? Maybe?",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens when help arrives?",
    "Client: The firefighters... they're talking to me, trying to keep me calm. They're using some kind of tool to cut me out of the car. The sound is horrible, like screeching metal. It's making my teeth hurt.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling as they work to get you out?",
    "Client: Impatient. Scared. Every movement hurts. I keep thinking about my family... what if I never see them again? (voice breaks) I... I can't do this anymore.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Remember, you're here now, you're safe. This is just a memory. Can you continue?",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) I... I'll try. They finally get me out. The paramedics are all around me now. They're asking me questions, shining lights in my eyes. I'm on a stretcher, being lifted into the ambulance.",
    "Therapist: What are you aware of during this time?",
    "Client: Pain. So much pain. My head is throbbing, and my left arm feels wrong. The paramedic is telling me I'll be okay, but I don't believe him. The sirens are so loud... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still around 85. My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Remember to breathe. What happens in the ambulance?",
    "Client: They're putting an IV in my arm. I hate needles, but I barely feel it compared to everything else. The paramedic is asking me questions... my name, the date. I'm struggling to focus. Everything feels hazy.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The movement of the ambulance... it's making me nauseous. I close my eyes, but that makes it worse. I'm trying to stay still, but every bump in the road sends shockwaves of pain through my body.",
    "Therapist: How are you coping with these sensations?",
    "Client: I... I'm trying to distract myself. Counting the beeps of the machines. Focusing on the paramedic's voice. But the fear keeps creeping back in. What if I have brain damage? What if I can't work again?",
    "Therapist: Those are scary thoughts. Remember, you're here now, you recovered. What happens when you arrive at the hospital?",
    "Client: It's... chaotic. Bright lights, so many voices. They're wheeling me in quickly. I catch glimpses of other patients, hear snippets of conversations. Someone's calling out medical terms I don't understand.",
    "Therapist: How does this make you feel?",
    "Client: Overwhelmed. Scared. But also... relieved? Like, I've made it this far, maybe I'll be okay. The doctors and nurses seem so confident, so in control.",
    "Therapist: That's a good observation. What happens next?",
    "Client: Tests. So many tests. X-rays, CT scans. I'm poked and prodded. Every movement hurts. I keep asking about the other driver, but no one seems to know anything.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, Sarah?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Both in the memory and... and here, now. My SUDS is down to about 70, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. You're doing really well. Can you tell me about when you finally get some answers?",
    "Client: It's... it's hours later. A doctor comes in. He looks serious, and my heart starts racing again. But then he smiles, just a little. He tells me I'm incredibly lucky. Concussion, broken arm, lots of bruising, but nothing life-threatening.",
    "Therapist: How do you react to this news?",
    "Client: Relief... overwhelming relief. I start crying, but it's different now. It's like... release? The doctor's telling me about recovery time, but I'm barely listening. I'm just... I'm alive. I'm going to be okay.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful moment. How does it feel to revisit it?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. I can feel that relief again, but also... I don't know. Gratitude? Fear? It's all mixed up.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 55, I think. I feel drained, but... lighter? Like I've let something go.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress, Sarah. How about we start winding down? Can you bring yourself back to the present moment?",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Yeah... yeah, I can do that. I'm... I'm here, in your office. The couch feels solid beneath me. I can hear traffic outside.",
    "Therapist: Very good. Take a few more deep breaths. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired. Really tired. But also... I don't know. Proud, maybe? Like I faced something big.",
    "Therapist: You did face something big. You showed incredible courage today, Sarah.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I didn't think I could do it, but I did.",
    "Therapist: Yes, you did. And that's a significant step in your healing journey. Let's take a few more moments to ground ourselves, and then we can discuss how you're feeling.",
    "Client: Okay. I... I think I'm ready for that.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's start by focusing on five things you can see in this room..."
