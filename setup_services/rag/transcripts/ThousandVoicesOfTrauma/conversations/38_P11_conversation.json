    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. That memory... it's just so vivid, you know? Seeing my father hit my mother like that, I can still hear the sound of it echoing in my head.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The look in my mother's eyes. She seemed so... defeated. And I felt so helpless, like I should have done something, but I was just frozen there. I keep thinking, what if I had stepped in? Maybe I could have stopped it. But then again, maybe he would have turned on me instead. I don't know. It's all so confusing.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was hard. Really hard. At first, I felt like I couldn't breathe, like I was right back there in that moment. But as I kept going... I don't know, it's weird, but it got a little easier. Like, I could start to separate myself from it a bit? Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How does this connect to your symptoms?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... I've been having these nightmares, right? And they're always about that night. But going through it like this, it's like... maybe I can start to face it? I mean, I'm still scared, but it doesn't feel quite as overwhelming as it did before.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What else have you noticed?",
    "Client: I've been jumpy lately, especially around loud noises. I think it's because they remind me of the shouting that night. But talking about it like this, it's like... I can start to see it as just a memory, not something that's happening right now. It's still upsetting, but... maybe a little less scary?",
    "Therapist: How does this relate to your goals?",
    "Client: I want to feel normal again, you know? To not be constantly on edge or afraid. This is hard, but... I think it's helping? Like, maybe if I can face this memory, I can start to move past it. I want to be able to trust people again, especially in relationships. I don't want to always be waiting for something bad to happen.",
    "Therapist: What strategies have you found helpful?",
    "Client: The breathing exercises we've been practicing have been really good. When I start to feel overwhelmed, I can use them to calm down. And... I don't know if this counts as a strategy, but just talking about it like this... it helps make it feel less scary, less powerful. Like, it's just a thing that happened, not this huge, terrifying secret I have to keep inside.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: It's scary, and sometimes I want to just stop and never think about it again. But... I think I need to keep going. I want my life back, you know? I don't want to let this control me anymore. So yeah, it's hard, but I'm... I'm ready to keep working on it.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. What's your takeaway today?",
    "Client: I guess... that I can face this. That it's hard, but not impossible. And that maybe, just maybe, I'm stronger than I thought I was. It's like, every time we do this, it gets a tiny bit easier. Not easy, but... easier. And that gives me hope, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How will you care for yourself now?",
    "Client: I think I'll call my best friend. She's been really supportive through all of this. And maybe take a long bath, try to relax a bit. Oh, and I'll definitely use those breathing exercises before bed. They've been helping with the nightmares.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a good plan. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For helping me through this. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can actually get there. It's scary, but... I'm starting to feel a little hopeful, you know?",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. We'll continue next session. Take care.",
    "Client: Thanks. I will. See you next time."
