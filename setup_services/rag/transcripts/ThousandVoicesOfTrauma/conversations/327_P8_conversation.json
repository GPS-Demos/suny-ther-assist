    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is spinning. I can still see those faces, you know? The way they looked at me, like I didn't belong. It's bringing up a lot of old feelings.",
    "Therapist: What specific feelings are coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: Anger, definitely anger. But also... shame? Yeah, shame. It's like I'm right back there in that moment, feeling so small and out of place. My chest feels tight, and my hands are a bit shaky. It's hard to shake off that feeling of being 'other'.",
    "Therapist: Can you tell me more about that feeling of being 'other'?",
    "Client: It's... it's like I'm constantly aware of my skin color, you know? Every time I walk into a room, I feel eyes on me. I remember that day so vividly - the comments, the whispers. It's not just about that one incident, it's a lifetime of little moments adding up. I feel... exhausted. Tired of always having to prove myself, of being the 'token' in so many situations.",
    "Therapist: How does this memory connect to your broader experience?",
    "Client: God, it's like... it's the foundation of so much in my life. That constant awareness, the need to be twice as good just to be considered equal. It's affected my career choices, my relationships, even how I parent. I've always pushed myself so hard, you know? Because I felt like I had to, to overcome these... these invisible barriers.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind as you reflect on this?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... maybe I've been too hard on myself. Maybe it's not my fault that I've felt this way. But then there's this voice in my head saying I should be over this by now. I mean, I'm 65, for crying out loud! Shouldn't I have figured out how to deal with this stuff by now? And yet, here I am, still feeling that sting, still getting worked up over memories from decades ago.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts make you feel?",
    "Client: Frustrated, mostly. And a little sad. It's like... I've spent so much of my life trying to prove something, you know? To show that I belong, that I'm worthy. And now I'm wondering if I've missed out on just... living. Just being me, without all this baggage. But then I feel guilty for feeling that way, like I'm letting down all the people who came before me and fought so hard for equality.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you noticing as you share this?",
    "Client: My throat feels tight, like I'm holding back tears. And my shoulders are tense - I just realized I've been hunching them up towards my ears. There's this heaviness in my chest, too. It's like my body is carrying all this weight that I've been trying to ignore.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to be sharing these thoughts and feelings?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of things. Part of me feels relieved, like I'm finally letting out something I've been holding in for a long time. But there's also fear. What if talking about it makes it worse? What if I can't put this back in the box once it's out? And there's a little voice of hope too, wondering if maybe by facing this head-on, I might finally find some peace with it all.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to know that it's okay to feel this way. That I'm not weak for still struggling with these memories and feelings. And maybe... maybe I need to learn how to be kinder to myself. To acknowledge that what I've experienced is real and valid, and that it's okay to still be working through it, even at my age. I've spent so long being strong for everyone else, maybe it's time I learned how to be gentle with myself.",
    "Therapist: How can we work together to support that need?",
    "Client: I'm not entirely sure, to be honest. Maybe... maybe we could explore ways for me to recognize these feelings when they come up without getting overwhelmed by them? And perhaps look at how I can start to challenge some of these long-held beliefs about having to constantly prove myself? I think I need to learn how to give myself permission to just... be. Without all the pressure and expectations I've put on myself over the years.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good place to start. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense? Like I've let out some of the pressure that's been building up. There's still a lot to work through, but I feel like maybe I can see a path forward now. It's scary, but also a little exciting. I'm nervous about what might come up as we dig deeper, but I'm also hopeful that maybe I can finally start to heal some of these old wounds.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to start looking at some of those core beliefs we talked about. The ones about always having to prove myself and never feeling like I truly belong. Maybe we could explore where those came from and start to challenge them a bit? And... and maybe we could talk more about how I can be kinder to myself. I think that's something I really need to work on.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How do you want to close our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to take a moment to just breathe. To sit with these feelings and acknowledge them, but also to remind myself that I'm safe here and now. And maybe... maybe to thank myself for being brave enough to face these memories and emotions. It wasn't easy, but I did it. And that's something to be proud of, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's take that moment together."
