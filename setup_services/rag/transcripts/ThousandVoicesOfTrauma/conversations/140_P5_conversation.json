    "Therapist: Hello, John. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares lately about my time in combat, and I'm not sure I'm ready to face all of that again.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you familiar with it?",
    "Client: Not really. Is it... like reliving everything? Because I'm not sure I can handle that right now.",
    "Therapist: It's controlled recollection. We'll go slowly. How does that sound?",
    "Client: Controlled? That's a bit reassuring, I suppose. But I'm still scared. What if I completely lose it? I mean, I've been trying so hard to keep it together, especially living with my parents again. They're already worried about me.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll take it step by step. Ready to learn more?",
    "Client: I guess so. Can you tell me what exactly we'll be doing? And... how it's supposed to help? Because right now, it just sounds terrifying.",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit memories gradually. It helps reduce their power over you. Shall I explain further?",
    "Client: Yeah, please. I need to understand this better. Will it make the nightmares worse? Or the anxiety? Because I'm barely managing as it is.",
    "Therapist: Initially, symptoms might intensify. But over time, they usually decrease. How does that sit with you?",
    "Client: That's... a lot to take in. I'm scared of it getting worse before it gets better. But I'm also tired of feeling this way. Losing my best friend in that ambush... it's like it happened yesterday. I can't keep living like this.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. We'll go at your pace. Any questions before we start?",
    "Client: I have so many questions. Will you be with me the whole time? What if I panic? And how long will this process take? I'm not sure how much more I can take before I completely break down.",
    "Therapist: I'll be here throughout. We can pause anytime. Duration varies, but we'll assess regularly. Feeling overwhelmed?",
    "Client: Yeah, I am. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a tiny bit hopeful? If this can help me process what happened, maybe I can start moving forward. It's been so long since I've felt normal.",
    "Therapist: That hope is important. Shall we begin with a brief relaxation exercise?",
    "Client: Okay, yeah. That might help. I'm still nervous, but I trust you. And I want to get better. For myself, for my parents... for the memory of my friend. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. We'll start slowly..."
