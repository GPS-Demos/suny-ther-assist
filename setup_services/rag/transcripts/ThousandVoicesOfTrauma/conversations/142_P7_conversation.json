    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure exercise. Can you describe the airplane crash scene?",
    "Client: Okay... I was sitting in my seat, 14C, aisle seat. The plane had just taken off, and I remember feeling the usual anxiety I get during flights. Suddenly, there was a loud bang, and the plane started shaking violently. People were screaming, and I could see the fear in their eyes.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The oxygen masks dropped down, and I fumbled to put mine on. My hands were shaking so badly. I could hear the engines making this awful screeching noise, and the plane was tilting to one side. I thought, \"This is it. I'm going to die.\" I closed my eyes and gripped the armrests so hard my knuckles turned white.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you remember?",
    "Client: I remember the smell of something burning. It was acrid and made my eyes water. The flight attendants were trying to calm everyone down, but their voices were shaky. I could hear a child crying somewhere behind me. I felt so helpless, so out of control.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How were you feeling physically?",
    "Client: My heart was racing, and I felt like I couldn't breathe. My chest was so tight. I was sweating profusely, and my whole body was trembling. I remember thinking about my family, wondering if I'd ever see them again. The guilt of our last argument hit me hard.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The plane started to lose altitude rapidly. The descent was so fast, my ears were popping painfully. Objects were flying around the cabin. A laptop hit the seat in front of me. I was certain we were going to crash into the ocean. I kept thinking about how cold the water would be, wondering if I'd survive the impact.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: As we got closer to the water, I could see it through the window. The waves looked massive. I closed my eyes and braced for impact. The sound of the engines was deafening. Then, suddenly, we leveled out. The pilot's voice came over the intercom, shaky but controlled, saying we'd regained control and were diverting to the nearest airport.",
    "Therapist: How did you feel in that moment?",
    "Client: I felt... I don't know. Relief, but also disbelief. My body was still in panic mode. I couldn't stop shaking. People around me were crying, praying, hugging each other. I just sat there, frozen, unable to process what had just happened. The rest of the flight was a blur. I remember landing and the applause that erupted, but I couldn't join in. I was just... numb.",
    "Therapist: You've done an excellent job describing the experience.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's still so vivid in my mind. Even now, talking about it, I can feel my heart racing. I haven't been able to get on a plane since then. The thought of it makes me panic. I know it's irrational, but I can't shake the feeling that if I fly again, I won't be so lucky.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to feel that way. Let's take a deep breath together.",
    "Client: *Takes a deep breath* It helps a little, but I still feel so anxious. Every time I see a plane in the sky or hear one, I'm right back in that moment. I've been having nightmares about it too. Sometimes in the dreams, we actually crash. I wake up in a cold sweat, feeling like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for facing these memories.",
    "Client: It's hard. I feel like this experience has changed me. I used to love traveling, and now I can't even consider it. My job sometimes requires travel, and I've had to turn down opportunities because of this fear. I feel like I'm letting everyone down - my family, my coworkers. But the thought of getting on a plane... I just can't do it.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: I hope so. I want to be able to live normally again, to not have this fear controlling my life. Sometimes I feel so angry that this happened to me. Why did I have to be on that flight? Why couldn't it have been a smooth, uneventful trip like all the others? I know it's not logical, but I can't help feeling this way.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have those feelings. Let's focus on your breathing again.",
    "Client: *Takes another deep breath* It's frustrating because logically, I know flying is safe. I've looked up the statistics, I know how rare accidents are. But my body doesn't seem to care about logic. As soon as I think about flying, I'm right back in that moment of terror.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress by talking about this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: A bit drained, to be honest. Talking about it is exhausting. But also... maybe a little relieved? It's like carrying around this heavy secret, and sharing it lifts some of that weight. I still feel anxious, but maybe a bit less than when we started. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's a common response. You've done well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I know we have more work to do, but I'm glad I came today. It's hard facing this, but I want to get better. I want to be able to travel again, to not let this fear control my life. Do you think that's possible?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll continue working together towards that goal.",
    "Client: That gives me hope. I'm willing to keep trying, even though it's difficult. I want to be able to get on a plane without panicking, to enjoy traveling again. Maybe even to help others who've been through similar experiences. Is that something we can work towards in our sessions?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's a great goal. We'll take it step by step.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your guidance and support. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't judge me for these fears. I'm looking forward to our next session, even though I know it will be challenging. Is there anything I should do between now and then to help with my progress?",
    "Therapist: Practice the breathing exercises we've discussed. We'll build on this next time.",
    "Client: Okay, I can do that. I'll try to do the breathing exercises daily. It's amazing how something so simple can be so powerful. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Any potential setbacks or challenges I might face as we continue this process?",
    "Therapist: It's normal to have ups and downs. Be patient with yourself.",
    "Client: I'll try to remember that. It's easy to get frustrated when progress isn't immediate, but I understand this is a process. Thank you for your help today. I feel like I've taken a small but important step forward. Even though talking about the experience was difficult, I feel a bit lighter now. Is that a good sign?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's a positive indication. We'll end here for today.",
    "Client: Alright. Thank you again for your time and support. I'm nervous about our next session, but also somewhat looking forward to it. I hope that by continuing this work, I'll eventually be able to overcome this fear and regain control of my life. See you next week.",
    "Therapist: Take care. We'll continue our progress next session."
