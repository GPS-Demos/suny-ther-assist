    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not really sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. I can still see flashes of that night, you know? The way he looked at me, his fists clenched... God, my heart is pounding just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you noticing right now?",
    "Client: My hands are shaky, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's like I can't get a full breath. And my stomach feels like it's in knots. It's weird, but I also feel kind of cold, even though I know the room isn't.",
    "Therapist: And what thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... what if I had done something differently? Maybe if I hadn't said anything, he wouldn't have... (pauses, takes a deep breath) I know it's not logical, but I can't help wondering if it was my fault somehow. And then I get angry at myself for even thinking that. It's just... it's all so confusing.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like a heat in my chest, spreading out. My jaw is clenched, and I want to... I don't know, scream or hit something. But then I remember how scared I was that night, and the anger just... deflates. And I'm left feeling small and helpless all over again.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you describe these feelings?",
    "Client: I... (long pause) I'm realizing how much I've been holding onto. It's like I've been carrying this weight around, and I didn't even know how heavy it was until now. Part of me feels relieved to be talking about it, but another part is terrified. What if I can't handle remembering all of this?",
    "Therapist: How does that fear manifest for you?",
    "Client: It's like... a cold pit in my stomach. My thoughts start spiraling, thinking about all the ways this could go wrong. What if I have a breakdown? What if I can't function in my daily life? I've worked so hard to keep it together, to be a good student, to not let this... this trauma define me. But now, it feels like it's all unraveling.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about that fear of unraveling?",
    "Client: (sighs) It's... it's exhausting. I realize now how much energy I've been putting into keeping everything bottled up. But at the same time, there's this tiny part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe hopeful? Like maybe if I let it unravel, I can finally start to put the pieces back together in a healthier way. Does that make any sense?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it does. How does that hope feel?",
    "Client: It's faint, but... warm. Like a small candle in a dark room. I'm scared to trust it, honestly. After everything that happened, hope feels dangerous. But it's there, and I think... I think I want to hold onto it.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to you to nurture that hope?",
    "Client: (long pause) I think... it would mean accepting that what happened wasn't my fault. That I'm not broken beyond repair. It would mean believing that I deserve to heal and to have a life that isn't controlled by fear. But God, that's terrifying. What if I'm wrong? What if I let myself hope and then everything falls apart again?",
    "Therapist: How does your body respond to that uncertainty?",
    "Client: My shoulders are tense, and I feel this fluttery sensation in my stomach. It's like I'm standing on the edge of a cliff, and part of me wants to step back to safety, but another part wants to take the leap. I'm trembling a little, but... I also feel this surge of something. Maybe courage? I don't know if I'm ready to call it that yet.",
    "Therapist: What does that surge feel like?",
    "Client: It's... energizing. Like a tingling sensation running through my body. For the first time in a long time, I feel... alive. Not just going through the motions. It's scary, but also kind of exhilarating. I've been numb for so long, you know? Even feeling scared feels like progress in a weird way.",
    "Therapist: How does this compare to how you felt before the exercise?",
    "Client: Before, I felt... contained. Like I had everything neatly boxed up and under control. But now, it's like the boxes have been opened, and everything's spilling out. It's messy and overwhelming, but also... freeing? Like I can finally breathe, even if the air is still shaky. I didn't realize how much energy it took to keep everything locked away.",
    "Therapist: What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I... (pauses, takes a deep breath) I think I need to sit with this for a bit. To let myself feel without trying to push it away or analyze it. And maybe... maybe I need to remind myself that it's okay to not have all the answers right now. That healing isn't linear, and that's okay. Is that... is that alright?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How would you like to end our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to take a few deep breaths together. To ground myself before I leave. And maybe... could you remind me of those coping techniques we talked about? I have a feeling I might need them this week as I process all of this.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's do that now."
