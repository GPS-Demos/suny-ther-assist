    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. Going through that memory of the hurricane again, it's like I was right back there. The sound of the wind, the creaking of the building... it felt so real.",
    "Therapist: What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The fear. It was overwhelming. I remember huddling in the bathroom, hearing things crash outside. I kept thinking, \"This is it. I'm going to die.\" And then... then I remembered the assault. It all got mixed up in my head.",
    "Therapist: How did that feel?",
    "Client: Terrifying. It's like the two worst moments of my life collided. I felt so helpless, just like during the... the abuse. I couldn't escape either situation.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult.",
    "Client: Yeah, it was. But... I made it through. Both times. I'm still here.",
    "Therapist: What does that mean to you?",
    "Client: I guess... I'm stronger than I thought? It's hard to believe sometimes, with the depression and everything. But I survived. Maybe that counts for something.",
    "Therapist: It absolutely does. How does recognizing that strength feel?",
    "Client: It's... weird. Good, I think? But also scary. Like, what if I'm not actually strong and I just got lucky?",
    "Therapist: What makes you question your strength?",
    "Client: I don't know. I still have nightmares. I struggle to trust people. Sometimes I can barely get out of bed. Doesn't seem very strong to me.",
    "Therapist: How might those struggles relate to your experiences?",
    "Client: I... I guess they're normal reactions? To trauma, I mean. It's just... it's been years. Shouldn't I be over it by now?",
    "Therapist: There's no set timeline for healing. What matters is your progress.",
    "Client: Progress... Sometimes I feel like I'm going backwards. But then I think about how I couldn't even talk about the hurricane or the assault before. And now I'm here, facing it. That's something, right?",
    "Therapist: It's significant. How does that realization sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... encouraging, I suppose. Maybe I'm not as stuck as I thought. It's just... it's so hard sometimes.",
    "Therapist: What helps you keep going in those hard moments?",
    "Client: My friends, I guess. They don't know everything, but they're supportive. And... and this therapy. It's tough, but it feels like I'm actually doing something about it all.",
    "Therapist: That's great. What else have you noticed changing?",
    "Client: I... I've been sleeping a bit better. Not great, but better. And I went to a party last week. I was anxious, but I went. That's new.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about those changes?",
    "Client: Proud, I think. And hopeful. Like maybe things can actually get better.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful. What would you like to focus on next?",
    "Client: I... I think I want to work on trusting people again. It's so isolating, always being on guard.",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. Shall we discuss strategies next time?",
    "Client: Yeah, I'd like that. It's scary, but... I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. We'll continue this next session."
