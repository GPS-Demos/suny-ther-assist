    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Jake?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, Dr. Thompson. It's all a bit overwhelming. Reliving that moment when I found out about my brother's death... it's like I was right back there in my dorm room, you know? I could almost smell the leftover pizza from the night before, hear the muffled sounds of my roommate's TV next door. It's so vivid, yet it feels surreal at the same time.",
    "Therapist: What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The phone call. My mom's voice... I've never heard her sound like that before. It was like all the life had been drained out of her. I remember my hands shaking so much I could barely hold the phone. And then this wave of disbelief hit me. I kept thinking, \"This can't be real. It's just a nightmare.\" But it wasn't, was it?",
    "Therapist: How did your body react during the memory?",
    "Client: My heart was racing, and I felt this tightness in my chest. It's funny, I didn't notice it during the actual call, but reliving it now, I realized I was holding my breath a lot. And my palms were so sweaty... I remember wiping them on my jeans over and over.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts went through your mind?",
    "Client: I kept thinking, \"I should've been there. I should've protected him.\" It's irrational, I know. I was hundreds of miles away at university. But... he was my little brother, you know? I was supposed to look out for him. And then I felt guilty for being relieved it wasn't about my dad's drinking again. God, that makes me sound like a terrible person.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your current experiences?",
    "Client: I... I guess it explains why I've been so jumpy lately. Every time my phone rings, I feel that same panic. And the guilt... it's always there, gnawing at me. I've been drinking more to numb it, which I know isn't healthy, but... it's like I can't face the world sober anymore.",
    "Therapist: What have you learned from this experience?",
    "Client: I... I never realized how much that moment affected me. It's like it changed everything in an instant. But going through it again, I noticed I managed to stay relatively calm, at least outwardly. Maybe I'm stronger than I give myself credit for? And... maybe it's okay to feel all these emotions. They're intense, but they're real.",
    "Therapist: How might this insight help moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I need to stop running from these feelings. The drinking, the avoiding phone calls, isolating myself... it's not really helping, is it? It's just postponing the inevitable. Maybe if I face this head-on, it'll hurt like hell, but... it might be the only way through.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you could take?",
    "Client: I... I could try answering my phone more often. Maybe set up regular calls with my mom. We've both been avoiding each other, and that's not helping either of us. And... maybe cut back on the drinking. It's not bringing my brother back, it's just... making everything hazier.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about our session today?",
    "Client: It was tough, Dr. Thompson. Really tough. But... I feel like I understand myself a bit better now. There's still a long way to go, but... for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this. Thank you for guiding me through it.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great courage today, Jake.",
    "Client: Thanks, Doc. It doesn't feel like courage most of the time. It feels like I'm barely hanging on. But I guess showing up and facing this stuff... that counts for something, right? I'm just... I'm tired of feeling this way. I want to be able to remember my brother without falling apart. I want to be able to talk to my family without this cloud of guilt hanging over me. Do you think that's possible?",
    "Therapist: What do you think?",
    "Client: I... I hope so. I really do. It's hard to imagine right now, but... I guess that's why I'm here, right? To work towards that. It's just... some days it feels like I'm making progress, and other days it feels like I'm right back where I started. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: It's a common experience in recovery.",
    "Client: That's... oddly comforting, actually. Knowing I'm not the only one who feels this way. I've been so caught up in my own head, feeling like I'm the only person in the world who's ever felt this lost. But I'm not, am I? There are other people out there who've been through similar things and come out the other side. That gives me hope.",
    "Therapist: What else gives you hope?",
    "Client: I... I guess the fact that I'm here, doing this work. Six months ago, I couldn't even say my brother's name without having a panic attack. Now, I can talk about that day, relive it even. It's painful, but... I'm doing it. And my mom... she sent me a text last week saying she was proud of me for getting help. That meant a lot. Maybe... maybe we can heal together, you know?",
    "Therapist: How does that idea feel?",
    "Client: It feels... scary, but good. Like, really good. I've been so focused on my own pain, I forgot that my family is hurting too. Maybe by working on myself, I can be there for them in a way I haven't been able to before. It's not going to be easy, but... I think it might be worth it.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization, Jake.",
    "Client: Yeah, it is. It's like... for the first time since it happened, I can see a future where I'm not defined by this tragedy. Where I can remember my brother with love instead of just pain. Where I can be there for my family without drowning in guilt. It's still a long way off, but... it feels possible now. And that's... that's something to hold onto, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: Indeed. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. This was... intense. But good. Really good. Thank you, Dr. Thompson. Same time next week?",
    "Therapist: Yes, see you then. Take care, Jake."
