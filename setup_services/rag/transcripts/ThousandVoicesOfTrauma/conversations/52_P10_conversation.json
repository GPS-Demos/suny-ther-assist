    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Singh. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a part of me that wants to get this over with, but another part that's terrified of revisiting those memories. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 40. It's not overwhelming yet, but I can feel the anxiety building.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we're here to help you process these experiences. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. Yes, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see... I see the compound. It's early morning, and the sun is just starting to rise. The air is crisp, and I can smell the dew on the grass. I'm walking towards the main building, my heart racing with each step.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I hesitate at the door. I know what's waiting for me inside, but I can't turn back now. My hand trembles as I reach for the doorknob. I can hear muffled voices inside.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm terrified. My mouth is dry, and I can feel sweat trickling down my back. But there's also this... this sense of resignation. Like I know what's coming and I've accepted it.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens when you open the door?",
    "Client: The voices stop. Everyone turns to look at me. I see the leader, his eyes cold and calculating. He motions for me to come forward. My legs feel like lead, but I force myself to move.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 60. I can feel my heart pounding in my chest.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a deep breath. What happens next?",
    "Client: The leader starts speaking. He's talking about loyalty and sacrifice. I know what's coming. I... I can't breathe. My vision is starting to blur.",
    "Therapist: Stay with me. You're safe here. Can you describe the room?",
    "Client: It's... it's dimly lit. There are about a dozen people, all watching me. I can see the altar at the front of the room. There's a bowl on it, filled with something dark. My stomach churns.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: The leader approaches me. He's holding a knife. I want to run, but I can't move. He grabs my arm, and I feel the cold steel against my skin. I... I can't do this. It's too much.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here with me. You're safe now. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 80. I feel like I'm back there. My arm is burning where he cut me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's ground ourselves. Can you tell me five things you see in this room right now?",
    "Client: I... I see the clock on the wall. Your desk. The bookshelf. The window. And... and the plant in the corner.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, can you continue? What happened after he cut your arm?",
    "Client: He... he takes my blood in the bowl. Everyone is chanting now. The sound is deafening. I feel dizzy, like I might pass out. But I know I can't. If I show weakness, the punishment will be worse.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. What are you thinking in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... I'm thinking that I've made a terrible mistake. That I want to go home. But I know there's no going back now. I'm trapped.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: The leader starts speaking again. He's talking about my dedication, my willingness to sacrifice. But all I can focus on is the pain in my arm and the nausea in my stomach. I nod along, pretending to agree, but inside I'm screaming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still around 80. My heart is racing, and I feel like I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe with me. In... and out. In... and out. Are you ready to continue?",
    "Client: Yes... yes, I think so.",
    "Therapist: Okay. What happens after the ceremony?",
    "Client: They... they bandage my arm. Everyone is congratulating me, telling me how proud they are. But I feel hollow inside. Empty. I want to cry, but I know I can't show any emotion. I have to pretend this is what I wanted.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel in this moment?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel betrayed. Not just by them, but by myself. How could I have let this happen? I'm angry and scared and ashamed all at once.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm sent to my quarters. As soon as I'm alone, I break down. I sob into my pillow, trying to muffle the sound. My arm throbs, a constant reminder of what I've done. I want to leave, but I know they're watching. I've never felt so alone.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 70. Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also a relief.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Can you tell me more about the following days?",
    "Client: The next few days are a blur. I'm in a daze, going through the motions. They keep praising me, telling me how I've proven myself. But every time I look at the bandage on my arm, I feel sick. I start to withdraw, to speak less. I'm afraid if I open my mouth, I'll scream.",
    "Therapist: How do others react to your withdrawal?",
    "Client: They... they notice. The leader pulls me aside, tells me I need to be more engaged. He says my behavior is disappointing after such a show of dedication. I force myself to smile, to nod, to pretend everything is fine. But inside, I'm dying.",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly difficult. What are you feeling as you recall this?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel a deep sadness. And anger. Anger at them for what they did to me, but also anger at myself for letting it happen. I keep thinking about all the warning signs I ignored, all the chances I had to leave before it got to this point.",
    "Therapist: Those are very normal reactions. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 65. Talking about it is helping, even though it's painful.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Can you tell me about the moment you decided to leave?",
    "Client: It... it wasn't a single moment. It was a slow realization over weeks. Every day, the discomfort grew. The cognitive dissonance became unbearable. One night, I lay awake, staring at the ceiling, and I knew I couldn't do it anymore. I started planning my escape.",
    "Therapist: That took a lot of courage. How did you feel as you were planning?",
    "Client: Terrified. Absolutely terrified. But also... determined. For the first time in months, I felt like I was taking control of my life again. It was like waking up from a long, terrible dream.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What happened next?",
    "Client: I started small. Gathering supplies, a little at a time. Hiding them in my room. I memorized the guard schedules, the layout of the compound. Every day was a battle not to give myself away. My heart was constantly racing, my palms sweating. I was sure they would discover my plan at any moment.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, recalling this?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. My hands are shaking, and I can feel my heart pounding. But there's also a sense of... pride? I did it. I got out.",
    "Therapist: That's right, you did. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to about 55 now. Remembering that I escaped... it helps.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Can you tell me about the night you left?",
    "Client: It was... it was a new moon. Dark. I waited until the middle of the night, when most people were asleep. I gathered my hidden supplies and snuck out of my room. Every creak of the floorboards sounded like an explosion to me. I was sure someone would wake up, catch me.",
    "Therapist: But they didn't. What happened next?",
    "Client: I made it to the fence. My hands were shaking so badly I could barely cut through it. Every rustle in the bushes made me freeze. But finally, I was through. I ran. I ran until my lungs were burning and my legs were ready to give out. I didn't stop until I reached the highway.",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly intense. How do you feel, remembering it now?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel strong. Scared, still, but strong. I did what seemed impossible. I got out. I saved myself.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 45. Remembering the escape... it's empowering.",
    "Therapist: You've made incredible progress today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. But also... lighter? Like I've set down a heavy burden I've been carrying for years.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after these sessions. You've done excellent work today. Let's take a few deep breaths together to close out the session.",
    "Client: Okay. *deep breath* Thank you. This... this wasn't easy, but I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself. We'll continue to work through this in our future sessions. For now, remember to be kind to yourself and use the coping strategies we've discussed.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. I'll see you next week."
