    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart is still racing, and I feel this tightness in my chest. The memory of being in that small, dark cell... it's like I'm right back there again. I can almost smell the dampness and feel the cold concrete against my skin.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... anger? I'm angry that I had to go through that, that anyone would do that to a child. I was so helpless, so confused. I keep thinking about how unfair it all was.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to feel that way. How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like... a burning sensation in my stomach. My fists are clenched, and I want to scream or hit something. But at the same time, I feel this deep sadness, like a weight pressing down on me. It's strange to feel so many things at once.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, acknowledging these feelings. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why me? What did I do to deserve this?\" And then I feel guilty for even asking that because I know I didn't do anything wrong. It's just... it's hard to shake off that feeling of being somehow responsible, you know? And then I worry... will I ever be normal? Will these memories ever stop haunting me?",
    "Therapist: Those are common thoughts for survivors. How do you respond to them now?",
    "Client: I try to remind myself that it wasn't my fault. That I was just a child. But it's hard, especially when the memories feel so fresh. Sometimes I can challenge those thoughts, but other times they just... overwhelm me. Right now, I'm trying to ground myself, to remember that I'm here, that I'm safe. But part of me still feels trapped in that cell.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great strength. What helps you feel safe in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I focus on my breathing. And I try to look around the room, to remind myself where I am. The soft chair I'm sitting in, the sunlight coming through the window... it's so different from that dark place. And talking about it here, with you... it helps. It makes me feel less alone with these memories.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. How does sharing this experience make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... liberating, in a way. Scary, but also like I'm finally letting go of something I've held onto for so long. There's a part of me that feels lighter, even though another part is still shaking. It's like... I'm starting to see that maybe I can face this, that maybe it won't always have this power over me.",
    "Therapist: You're showing remarkable resilience. What do you notice about your body now?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm starting to relax a bit. My shoulders aren't as tense, and my breathing is slowing down. I still feel a bit shaky, but it's not as intense as before. It's like... the memory is still there, but it's not consuming me anymore. I feel... I don't know... maybe a little bit stronger?",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How does this compare to previous exposures?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a bit easier this time. Don't get me wrong, it's still incredibly difficult, but... I feel like I'm handling it better. The first few times we did this, I felt completely overwhelmed, like I was drowning in the memories. But now, even though it's painful, I feel like I can... I don't know, swim through it? Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What do you think has changed?",
    "Client: I think... I'm starting to believe that I can face these memories without being destroyed by them. And maybe... maybe I'm starting to see myself differently too. Not just as a victim, but as someone who survived, who's fighting back. It's still hard, and I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time, I feel like there might be light at the end of this very dark tunnel.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it feel to acknowledge that strength?",
    "Client: It's... it's both exciting and terrifying. Part of me wants to embrace this newfound strength, to run with it and see how far I can go. But another part is scared. What if I'm wrong? What if I can't handle it? And there's this weird guilt too, like... am I betraying my younger self by moving forward? It's all so confusing.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to have mixed feelings. What would you say to your younger self now?",
    "Client: I... (long pause, voice breaking) I'd tell her that it's not her fault. That she's so brave and strong, even if she doesn't feel like it. That... that she'll survive this, and that one day, she'll be okay. That she's not alone, even when she feels like the whole world has abandoned her. And that... that I'm proud of her. God, I've never said that before, but I am. I'm proud of her for surviving.",
    "Therapist: That's beautiful. How does it feel to express that?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. I'm crying, but it's not just sadness. It's like... relief? And maybe a little bit of hope? I've spent so long being angry at myself, at that little girl, for not being able to stop what happened. But now... now I just want to hold her and tell her it's going to be alright. It's like I'm finally starting to separate who I am now from what happened then.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant shift. What does this mean for your healing journey?",
    "Client: I think... I think it means I'm finally ready to start forgiving myself. Not for what happened - that wasn't my fault - but for how I've treated myself since then. For all the blame and the shame I've carried. It's like... I'm ready to put down this heavy burden I've been carrying for so long. I know it won't be easy, and I'm sure I'll have setbacks, but for the first time, I feel like healing is actually possible.",
    "Therapist: That's a profound insight. How do you want to carry this forward?",
    "Client: I want to... I want to be kinder to myself. To challenge those negative thoughts when they come up, to remind myself that I'm not defined by what happened to me. And I want to keep facing these memories, as hard as it is, because I can see now that it does get easier. It's like... I'm reclaiming my story, bit by bit. And maybe, just maybe, I can use this experience to help others someday. Not now, I'm not ready for that yet, but... someday.",
    "Therapist: That's a wonderful goal. How are you feeling as we wrap up today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, honestly. Emotionally drained. But there's also this sense of... I don't know, accomplishment? Like I've climbed a mountain or something. I'm a bit shaky, but I also feel stronger. And I'm grateful, really grateful, for this space to work through all of this. It's hard, but I think... I think I'm on the right path.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredible work today. How will you take care of yourself for the rest of the day?",
    "Client: I think I'll take a long, hot shower when I get home. Maybe put on some comfy clothes and watch a lighthearted movie. I might call my sister too - she's been really supportive throughout all of this. And I'll try to be gentle with myself, to remember that it's okay to rest after doing such intense emotional work. Yeah... I think that's what I need right now.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great plan. We'll continue next week. Take care.",
    "Client: Thank you. I will. See you next week."

      "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, honestly. Emotionally drained. But there's also this sense of... I don't know, accomplishment? Like I've climbed a mountain or something. I'm a bit shaky, but I also feel stronger. And I'm grateful, really grateful, for this space to work through all of this. It's hard, but I think... I think I'm on the right path.",
      "Therapist: You've done incredible work today. How will you take care of yourself for the rest of the day?"

      "Client: I think I'll take a long, hot shower when I get home. Maybe put on some comfy clothes and watch a lighthearted movie. I might call my sister too - she's been really supportive throughout all of this. And I'll try to be gentle with myself, to remember that it's okay to rest after doing such intense emotional work. Yeah... I think that's what I need right now."
