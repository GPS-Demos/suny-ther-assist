    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your current SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10. My stomach feels a little tight.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and describe the workplace incident.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) I was at my desk when the earthquake hit. The building started shaking violently. Papers flew everywhere, and I could hear screaming...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that memory. What do you see and feel?",
    "Client: I see my coworkers panicking. The lights are flickering, and there's dust in the air. My heart is racing, and I'm frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 7. My palms are sweaty, and I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: (voice shaking) The shaking gets worse. I hear a loud crash - part of the ceiling collapses near me. I'm terrified, thinking I might die. I can't move...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's happening in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, and I'm trembling. It's like I'm back there again.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's an 8 now. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Continue with the memory.",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) Someone grabs my arm - it's my coworker, Lisa. She's yelling at me to move, to get under the desk. I snap out of it and scramble under...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: A little better. Maybe a 6? Remembering Lisa helps somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's good. What happens next?",
    "Client: We're huddled under the desk. The shaking stops, but we're afraid to move. There's dust everywhere, and I can hear sirens outside...",
    "Therapist: Current SUDS?",
    "Client: Back to a 7. My throat feels tight, like I can't swallow.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: We finally crawl out. The office is destroyed. Glass everywhere, computers smashed. And then I see blood - Tom from accounting is hurt...",

    "Client: I feel helpless and scared. My legs are shaky, and I want to run away.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's an 8 again. This part is really tough to remember.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you survived this.",
    "Client: (nodding) Right. We help Tom, and slowly make our way out of the building. It feels like forever. When we get outside, it's chaos...",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you describe this?",
    "Client: Tense. My shoulders are tight, and I have a knot in my stomach.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's come down a bit, maybe a 6. Remembering getting out helps.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Can you describe what you see outside?",
    "Client: People everywhere, some injured. Sirens, dust in the air. I remember feeling relieved but also shocked...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, remembering that relief?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. Relief, but also guilt for feeling relieved when others were hurt.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: About a 5 now. I feel drained, but less panicky.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. Let's start to wrap up the exercise.",
    "Client: (sighs) Okay. That was intense, but... I got through it.",
