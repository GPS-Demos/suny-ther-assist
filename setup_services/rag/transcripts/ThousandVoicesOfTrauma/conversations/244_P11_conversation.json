    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Ahmed?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is still processing everything. The memory of that dog attack felt so vivid, you know? I could almost feel its teeth on my leg again. It's strange because I know I'm safe here, but my body was reacting as if I was right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sound. The growling. It was so... primal. I remember freezing up completely when I heard it. And then the pain... it was overwhelming. But what really got to me was feeling so helpless. I couldn't move, couldn't think. It's embarrassing to admit, but I felt like a child again, powerless and scared.",
    "Therapist: How does sharing that make you feel now?",
    "Client: Uncomfortable, honestly. Part of me wants to brush it off, say it's no big deal. But... I know it affected me more than I've been willing to admit. It's not just about the physical pain anymore. It's like... it changed how I see the world, you know?",
    "Therapist: Can you elaborate on that?",
    "Client: Well, I used to love going for walks in the park. Now, I'm always on edge when I'm outside. Every dog I see feels like a potential threat. It's exhausting, always being on guard like that. And it makes me feel weak, like I can't handle simple things anymore.",
    "Therapist: How does this relate to your broader experiences?",
    "Client: I guess... it's not just about dogs or being outside. It's affected my whole life. I've become more isolated, more dependent on my parents. I feel like I've lost a lot of my independence and confidence. It's frustrating because I want to move forward, but I feel stuck.",
    "Therapist: What insights have you gained from this process?",
    "Client: I'm realizing that avoiding my fears isn't helping. It's actually making things worse. And maybe... maybe it's okay to feel vulnerable sometimes. It doesn't make me weak. I think I need to be more patient with myself, but also push myself a bit more to face these fears.",
    "Therapist: That's a valuable realization. How might you apply this?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I could start with small steps. Like, sitting in the backyard for a few minutes each day. Or walking to the corner store instead of asking my mom to go. It's not much, but it's a start, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's tough, not gonna lie. But... I think it's necessary. I want my life back, you know? I want to feel like myself again. So yeah, I'm scared, but I'm also... kind of hopeful? Like maybe there's a way through this after all.",
    "Therapist: That's great, Ahmed. What's your takeaway from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. Reliving that memory was intense, but I got through it. And talking about it afterwards, it's like... I can see it more clearly now. It's still scary, but it feels a bit more manageable. I'm not saying it's easy, but maybe with time and practice, I can learn to cope better.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How would you like to proceed?",
    "Client: I want to keep going with these sessions. They're tough, but I feel like I'm making progress. And maybe... maybe we could work on some strategies for those small steps we talked about? I want to start reclaiming my life, bit by bit.",
