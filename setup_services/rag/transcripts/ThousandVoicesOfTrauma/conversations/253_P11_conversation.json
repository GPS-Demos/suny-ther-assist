    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like I'm still there, you know? The hospital smells, the beeping machines, the feeling of helplessness... It's all so vivid. I keep thinking about how close I came to losing everything.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The fear. God, the fear was overwhelming. I remember lying there, thinking about my kids, my husband... wondering if I'd ever see them again. And the pain, it was excruciating. But what really got to me was the uncertainty. Not knowing if I'd make it through the night, or if I'd ever be the same again.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... difficult. Really difficult. But also... different? I mean, I'm here now, safe in your office, and I can separate myself from that moment a bit more. It's still scary, but I'm not completely lost in it like I used to be.",
    "Therapist: That's an important observation. How does this relate to your day-to-day experiences?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... I've been so afraid of anything reminding me of that time. I've avoided hospitals, medical shows on TV, even conversations about health. But going through it here, it's like... maybe I can face those things bit by bit?",
    "Therapist: That's a great insight. How might this impact your goals?",
    "Client: I... I think it gives me hope. Maybe I can start doing more things I've been avoiding. Like, I've been putting off my regular check-ups because of the anxiety, but perhaps I can work towards that now.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive step. What else?",
    "Client: Um, well... I've been having nightmares about being back in that hospital bed. But talking through it like this, it's like... I'm starting to see it as a memory, not a current threat. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How does that shift feel?",
    "Client: It feels... liberating, I guess? Like a weight's been lifted a bit. Don't get me wrong, it's still scary, but it's like I have a bit more control now. I'm not just a victim of my memories anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I think... I want to keep pushing forward with this. It's hard, and sometimes I feel like I can't do it, but then I remember how far I've come. I want to be able to talk about my experience without feeling like I'm right back in it, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. How can we support that?",
    "Client: Maybe... could we practice some coping strategies for when the memories feel overwhelming? And perhaps work on how I can talk about it with my family? They've been so supportive, but I've kept a lot from them because I didn't want to burden them.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent ideas. Anything else?",
    "Client: I... I think I'd like to start volunteering at a support group for people who've gone through similar experiences. I'm not ready yet, but maybe that could be a long-term goal? To use my experience to help others?",

    "Therapist: You should be. What's your takeaway?",
    "Client: That I'm stronger than I thought. And that facing these memories, as hard as it is, is helping me reclaim my life. I'm not there yet, but I can see a path forward now.",
    "Therapist: That's fantastic, Sarah. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. Thank you... for guiding me through this. It means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and we'll continue next week."
