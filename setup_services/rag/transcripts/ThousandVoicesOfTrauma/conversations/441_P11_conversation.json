    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Chen?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. The memory of losing my sister to human trafficking... it's still so vivid. I can feel my heart racing, and my hands are a bit shaky.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you about revisiting that experience?",
    "Client: The helplessness. I keep thinking about how I couldn't protect her. I was supposed to be the older brother, you know? But I failed her. And now, every time I see news about trafficking, it's like I'm right back there, powerless and scared.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. I could smell the musty air of that rundown building where we last saw her. I heard her voice, pleading for help. My chest tightens just thinking about it. But... there's something different this time.",
    "Therapist: Different how?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Maybe it's because we've been working on this for a while now, but I felt a tiny bit more... detached? Like I could observe the memory without being completely overwhelmed by it. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. How do you think this relates to your PTSD symptoms?",
    "Client: Well, I've noticed that my nightmares aren't as frequent lately. And when I do have them, I can sometimes recognize them as just memories, not current threats. It's... it's a small change, but it feels significant.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. What else have you noticed?",
    "Client: I... I've been able to talk about my sister more with my wife. Before, I'd shut down completely. Now, we can share memories of her without me spiraling into panic. It's... it's bittersweet, but it feels like I'm honoring her memory instead of just reliving the trauma.",
    "Therapist: How does this progress make you feel about continuing therapy?",
    "Client: It's... encouraging. I mean, don't get me wrong, it's still incredibly hard. Sometimes I wonder if I can keep doing this. But then I remember how I couldn't even say her name a few months ago, and now... now I can talk about her. It gives me hope, you know?",
    "Therapist: What strategies have you found most helpful so far?",
    "Client: The breathing exercises have been a lifesaver. When I feel myself starting to panic, I can sometimes catch it early and use those techniques to calm down. And... and writing in that journal you suggested. It helps me process things when I'm alone.",
    "Therapist: That's great. How else has this impacted your daily life?",
    "Client: I... I've been able to focus more at work. The chronic pain is still there, but it's not consuming all my thoughts anymore. I even went to a community event last week - something I haven't done in years. It was hard, but... I did it.",
    "Therapist: You've made remarkable progress. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I... I think I want to try volunteering at a support group for families of trafficking victims. It terrifies me, but... maybe I can help someone else not feel so alone. Is that... is that too ambitious?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. How do you feel about that goal?",
    "Client: Scared. Excited. Nervous. But also... determined? It's like... like I'm reclaiming a part of myself that was lost with my sister. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How can we work towards that in our sessions?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe we could practice what I might say? Or work on coping strategies for when it gets overwhelming? I... I want to do this, but I know it won't be easy.",
    "Therapist: That's a great idea. Shall we start next session?",
    "Client: Yes, I... I think I'd like that. Thank you, doctor. For everything. I know I have a long way to go, but... for the first time in years, I feel like there's a light at the end of the tunnel.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work. I'm just here to guide you.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's... it's been a tough journey, but I'm starting to believe that maybe, just maybe, I can get through this. That's... that's something I never thought I'd say."
