    "Therapist: Welcome back, Ahmed. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not great, to be honest. Work's been stressful, and I can't stop thinking about my ex. It's been months since the divorce, but it still hurts. I'm not sure I'm ready for whatever we're doing today.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. It's a key part of your treatment.",
    "Client: Imaginal exposure? That sounds... intense. What exactly does that involve?",
    "Therapist: It's revisiting your trauma memory in a safe environment. We'll go through it step-by-step.",
    "Client: I'm not sure I want to relive that. The breakup was painful enough the first time. Why do we need to do this?",
    "Therapist: It helps process the memory and reduce its emotional impact over time.",
    "Client: But what if it makes things worse? I've been having trouble sleeping as it is, and my anxiety's through the roof.",
    "Therapist: That's a valid concern. We'll go at your pace and I'll support you throughout.",
    "Client: Okay... I guess I can try. But what should I expect? Will it be like reliving the whole thing again?",
    "Therapist: You'll describe the memory in detail, in the present tense. It may feel intense, but you're safe here.",
    "Client: That sounds scary. I'm already feeling anxious just thinking about it. How long will this take?",
    "Therapist: We'll start with about 30 minutes today. We can pause if it gets overwhelming.",
    "Client: Alright. I'll give it a shot. But what if I can't handle it? Can we stop if it's too much?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're in control. We can stop anytime you need to.",
    "Client: Okay, that makes me feel a bit better. I appreciate your patience with me. I know I'm not the easiest client to work with.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage, Ahmed. This is an important step in your healing journey.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm still nervous, but I trust you. Can you walk me through exactly what I need to do?",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes, breathe deeply, and describe the memory as if it's happening now. I'll guide you.",
    "Client: Alright. I'm ready. Or as ready as I'll ever be, I suppose. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Remember, you're safe here. Let's begin when you're comfortable."
