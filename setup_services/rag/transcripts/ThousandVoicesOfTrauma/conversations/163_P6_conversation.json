    "Therapist: Alright, Sam. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm a bit nervous, but I'm ready to give it a try.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that moment of cyber bullying. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm sitting at my desk, staring at my computer screen. There's a flood of notifications coming in. My heart is starting to race as I see message after message pop up on my social media accounts.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The messages are all from anonymous accounts. They're calling me names, saying I'm worthless, that I should... that I should kill myself. My palms are getting sweaty, and I feel this tightness in my chest.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What else?",
    "Client: I'm scrolling through the comments, and they're getting worse. There are memes of me, manipulated photos making me look ridiculous. I feel so exposed, so violated. My breathing is getting faster.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to a 7.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I want to look away, but I can't stop reading. They're threatening to share personal information about me. I'm terrified they might know where I live. My hands are shaking now, and I feel nauseous.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sam. Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I try to block the accounts, but new ones keep popping up. It feels like I'm drowning in this sea of hate. I can't breathe properly. I'm starting to cry, and I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's a 9 now. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: I know it's difficult, but you're doing incredibly well. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: I shut down my computer, but I can still hear the notification sounds in my head. I curl up in my chair, feeling so small and vulnerable. I'm sobbing now, and I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My whole body feels tense. My stomach is in knots, and I have this crushing weight on my chest. I feel dizzy and lightheaded.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: Still at a 9. It's not getting any better.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing great by staying with it. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why me? What did I do to deserve this?\" I feel so alone, like no one can help me. I'm scared this will never end.",
    "Therapist: Those are common thoughts in this situation. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm starting to feel a little calmer. My breathing is slowing down a bit. The room is coming back into focus.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 6 now.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Sam. You've done really well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was tough, but I feel... I don't know, maybe a little stronger for having gone through it again.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. How do you feel about ending the exercise here?",
    "Client: I think that would be good. I'm feeling pretty drained.",
    "Therapist: Understandable. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we wrap up."
