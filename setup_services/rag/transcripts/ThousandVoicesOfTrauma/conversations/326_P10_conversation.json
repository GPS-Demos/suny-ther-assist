    "Therapist: Welcome, Fatima. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to dive into the hostage situation again, and just thinking about it makes my heart race a little.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I'm at the bank. It's a busy afternoon, and I'm in line waiting to deposit a check. The air conditioning is on full blast, and I remember wishing I'd brought a sweater. There's a faint smell of coffee from the little cafe in the corner of the bank.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud crash. I turn around and see three men in masks bursting through the doors. One of them fires a shot into the ceiling, and everyone starts screaming. My heart... it feels like it's going to explode out of my chest.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 70.",
    "Therapist: Okay, take a deep breath. You're doing well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The man with the gun is shouting at everyone to get down on the floor. I can't move. My legs feel like they're made of lead. Someone bumps into me as they're dropping to the ground, and I stumble. That's when one of the men grabs me by the arm.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in that moment?",
    "Client: Terrified. Absolutely terrified. His grip is so tight, I can feel his fingers digging into my skin. He's dragging me towards the teller counter, and I can hear myself whimpering. I... I wet myself. The shame... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: It's okay, Fatima. That's a normal reaction to extreme fear. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 85.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. Remember, you're here with me, in a safe place.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. The man pushes me against the counter and tells the teller to fill a bag with money. His breath smells like cigarettes, and I can see sweat beading on his forehead through the holes in his mask. The teller is fumbling with the cash drawer, her hands shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I hear sirens in the distance. The robbers start arguing among themselves. The one holding me tightens his grip, and I can feel the cold metal of his gun pressed against my temple. I'm... I'm certain I'm going to die.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I think about my husband, my children. Will I ever see them again? I start praying silently, begging Allah to protect me, to let me live. The sirens are getting louder, and the man holding me is getting more agitated. He's shouting at his partners, telling them to hurry up.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's at 90. My hands are shaking just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Remember to breathe. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The police are outside now. I can hear them on megaphones, telling the robbers to surrender. The man holding me starts using me as a shield, backing towards the rear of the bank. I can smell his sweat, hear his ragged breathing. My legs are so weak, I'm barely standing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Fatima. Keep going.",
    "Client: We're in a back office now. The other robbers are there too, arguing about what to do. One of them wants to give up, but the one holding me is adamant about finding a way out. I'm... I'm trying to make myself as small as possible, praying they'll forget about me.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling physically at this point?",
    "Client: My whole body is trembling. My mouth is so dry, and I feel lightheaded. I think I might faint. The gun is still pressed against my head, and every time the man shifts, I flinch, thinking this might be the moment he pulls the trigger.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Hours seem to pass, but I know it's probably only been minutes. The police keep trying to negotiate, but the men aren't budging. Suddenly, there's a loud bang from outside. The man holding me jerks, and for a split second, I think I've been shot. But then I realize it was just a distraction.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: Everything happens so fast. There's smoke, shouting, more bangs. I feel myself being thrown to the ground. Someone's on top of me, and I can't breathe. I'm screaming, but I can barely hear myself over the chaos. Then... then it's over.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I'm shaking. My heart is pounding. But... I also feel a sense of relief. Like I've survived it all over again.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 65 now.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You did really well, Fatima. Let's take a few deep breaths together.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Thank you. I... I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart.",
    "Therapist: You're making great progress. How do you feel about what we did today?",
    "Client: It was hard, really hard. But... I feel like I faced something I've been running from for a long time. It's... it's empowering, in a way.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. You should be proud of yourself. We'll end here for today. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you... this means more to me than you know.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Fatima. I'll see you next week."
