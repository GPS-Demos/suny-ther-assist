    "Therapist: Okay, Alex. Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and describe the memory.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm walking home from class. It's late afternoon, and I see a group of protesters gathering near the campus. They're chanting about police brutality. I feel my heart rate pick up a bit, remembering all the times I was bullied in high school. I... I see a line of police officers approaching the crowd. Their faces are stern, and they're carrying riot gear. It reminds me of how powerless I felt when I was younger.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Um, probably a 4 out of 10. I'm tense, but okay.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue.",
    "Client: The protesters are getting louder. I hear shouting, and suddenly there's a scuffle. A young guy, maybe my age, is being roughly handled by two officers. I... I freeze. My palms are sweaty, and I can feel my heart pounding in my chest. It's like I'm back in high school, watching the bullies pick on someone, and I can't do anything about it.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Maybe a 6? I feel really anxious.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The guy is yelling, \"I didn't do anything!\" and it echoes in my head. I remember saying those exact words when I was being bullied. I... I want to help him, but I'm paralyzed with fear. My breathing is shallow, and I feel like I might throw up. The police are so intimidating, just like those bullies were. I... I hate feeling this helpless.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it.",
    "Client: I... I see more officers arriving. The crowd is getting agitated. Someone throws a water bottle, and suddenly it's chaos. People are running, screaming. I'm rooted to the spot, unable to move. My chest feels tight, and I'm shaking. I... I see an officer raise his baton, and I flinch, expecting to be hit, just like when the bullies cornered me in the locker room. I... I can't breathe...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: I... I finally manage to move. I'm running, but it feels like I'm in slow motion. My legs are heavy, and I'm dizzy. I hear sirens, shouting, the thud of batons. It's all mixing with memories of laughter, taunts, and the sound of fists hitting lockers. I... I feel so small, so powerless. I make it to my apartment and slam the door shut. I slide down to the floor, gasping for air, tears streaming down my face. I... I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still a 9. My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Stay present.",
    "Client: I... I curl up on the floor, hugging my knees. I can still hear the commotion outside, but it's muffled. I'm safe in my apartment, but I don't feel safe. I feel like that scared kid again, hiding from the bullies. I... I'm angry at myself for not helping, for being so weak. But I'm also terrified of what could have happened if I had tried to intervene. I... I just feel so helpless and alone.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down. Maybe a 7?",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this well.",
    "Client: I... I eventually manage to stand up. My legs are shaky, and I feel exhausted. I go to the window and peek out. The street is mostly empty now, just a few police cars with flashing lights. I... I feel a mix of relief and guilt. Relief that it's over, but guilt that I couldn't do anything to help. I... I crawl into bed, still fully clothed, and pull the covers over my head. I just want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5 now. I feel drained.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. But also kind of relieved? It's like... I've been carrying this weight, and now it's a little lighter. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You've shown great courage.",
    "Client: Thanks. It was tough, but... I think it helped. Can we... can we talk about it more next time?",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll process this further. Well done today."
