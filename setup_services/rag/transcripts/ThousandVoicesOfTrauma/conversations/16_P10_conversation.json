    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. How are you feeling about revisiting your experience today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit apprehensive, to be honest. My heart's already racing a bit. But I know this is important, so I'm trying to stay focused.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath and begin when you're ready.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm at the protest. It's a warm day, and there are so many people around me. The energy is... it's electric, you know? We're all chanting, holding up signs. I can smell a mix of sweat and sunscreen. I remember feeling proud, like we were really making a difference.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a shift in the crowd. People start pushing, and I hear shouting. My heart starts pounding. I see police officers in riot gear advancing towards us. They look... intimidating. I'm trying to stay calm, but I can feel panic rising in my chest.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's going up. Maybe a 6?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going, and remember to breathe.",
    "Client: I... I see an officer raise his baton. Everything seems to slow down. I'm frozen, I can't move. Oh God, I can hear screams now. People are running, pushing past me. I... I trip and fall. The ground is hard, and I can taste dirt in my mouth.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I'm on the ground, and I can't... I can't breathe. There's chaos all around me. Someone's foot steps on my hand, and I cry out in pain. I'm terrified. I... I see the officer approaching me. His face is hidden behind the shield, but his body language is... it's aggressive. I'm trying to get up, but I can't. My chest feels so tight.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe higher. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here in the office with me. Keep going.",
    "Client: The officer, he... he grabs my arm roughly. I'm pleading, trying to explain that I'm not resisting, that I just fell. But he's not listening. He's twisting my arm behind my back. The pain is... it's intense. I can hear myself sobbing, begging him to stop.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I... I can smell the officer's sweat, mixed with something metallic. Maybe it's blood? I don't know. My face is pressed against the pavement. It's hot, burning my skin. I hear more shouting, sirens in the distance. I'm... I'm so scared. I keep thinking, \"This can't be happening. This can't be real.\"",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: They're... they're pulling me up now. My arm is throbbing. I see other protesters being arrested, some are injured. There's a woman nearby, blood streaming down her face. I feel... I feel so helpless. So angry. But mostly, I'm just terrified. They're pushing me towards a police van. I can barely walk. My legs feel like jelly.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Focus on your breathing. In and out.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm in the van now. It's dark, and I'm surrounded by other protesters. We're all shell-shocked. Someone's crying softly. My arm is killing me, and I think... I think it might be broken. I'm shaking uncontrollably. I keep replaying what happened in my mind, wondering how a peaceful protest turned into this nightmare.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Continue.",
    "Client: We arrive at the police station. The processing is a blur. I'm fingerprinted, photographed. I feel... dehumanized. Like I'm just a number to them. My arm is swelling, and I keep asking for medical attention, but they're ignoring me. The pain is... it's unbearable. I'm still in shock, I think. I can't believe this is happening to me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8.5? I feel so overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: They finally take me to the hospital. The doctor confirms my arm is broken. I'm... I'm angry, but also relieved to finally get help. The nurse is kind, which makes me break down. I start sobbing uncontrollably. All the fear, the pain, the humiliation... it all comes pouring out. I feel... I feel violated. Like my rights, my dignity, were stripped away.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaky. My heart's still racing. But... I also feel a strange sense of... I don't know, maybe relief? Like I'm finally confronting this.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7 now?",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's continue.",
    "Client: The next few days are a blur of pain meds, police interviews, and lawyer consultations. I have nightmares every night. I keep seeing that officer's face, feeling the pavement against my cheek. I'm... I'm afraid to leave my house. Every time I see a police car, my heart starts racing. I feel... I feel broken. Like something fundamental has changed in me.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here now, safe in my office.",
    "Client: (Inhales deeply) Right... I'm here. It's just... it's still so vivid, you know? I can still feel the fear, the helplessness. I keep wondering what I could have done differently. Should I have run? Should I have stayed home? I... I feel guilty for putting myself in that situation, but also angry that I even have to think that way.",
    "Therapist: Those are normal thoughts. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 6, I think. It's coming down.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The physical healing was... it was easier than the emotional healing. My arm healed, but the fear... it lingered. I started having panic attacks. Crowds became unbearable. I... I lost my job because I couldn't bring myself to leave the house some days. My husband, he tried to understand, but... I could see the frustration in his eyes. I felt so alone, so... damaged.",
    "Therapist: You're not alone. You're here, working through this.",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, you're right. It's just... it's hard, you know? I keep thinking about who I was before this happened. I was confident, outgoing. Now, I... I second-guess everything. I'm always looking over my shoulder. But being here, talking about it... it helps. It's like... like I'm reclaiming my story, bit by bit.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. Emotionally drained. But there's also this... this tiny spark of hope? Like maybe I can get through this, come out the other side.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. What's your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: I'd say... maybe a 4? It's definitely lower than when we started.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: Okay... (takes a deep breath) I can feel the chair beneath me. I can see the paintings on your wall. I'm... I'm here, in the present. It's over. I survived.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. You survived, and you're working through it. How do you feel about today's session?",
    "Client: It was... intense. Draining. But also... I don't know, maybe cathartic? Like I'm finally facing this head-on instead of trying to push it away. It's hard, but... I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: That's great to hear. Remember, healing takes time. We'll continue to work through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I appreciate your support. It means a lot to have someone listen, to really hear me.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Let's end here for today. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
