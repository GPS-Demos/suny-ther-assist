    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Kazemi?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit. That memory of the ambush in Fallujah... it felt so real again. I could smell the dust, hear the gunfire. It's like I was right back there.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The fear. The absolute terror of not knowing if I'd make it out alive. And the guilt... God, the guilt of seeing my fellow soldiers fall. I keep thinking, \"Why them and not me?\" It's been haunting me for years.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... difficult. Really difficult. But also... I don't know, maybe a little different this time? I mean, it was still awful, but I felt like I could breathe through it a bit better. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What do you think contributed to that?",
    "Client: Well, I've been practicing those grounding techniques you taught me. Focusing on my breath, reminding myself that I'm here, safe, in the present. It helped me stay... somewhat anchored, I guess.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How does this connect to your everyday experiences?",
    "Client: I... hmm. You know, I've noticed that when I have flashbacks at home, I've started using those same techniques. It doesn't make the memories go away, but it helps me manage them better. My wife says I seem less... on edge lately.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant change. How does it feel to recognize that progress?",
    "Client: It's... encouraging, I suppose. Sometimes I feel like I'm not moving forward at all, but hearing you say that... it helps me see that maybe I am making some headway. It's just so slow, you know?",
    "Therapist: Change often is. What else have you noticed?",
    "Client: Well, I've been able to talk about my experiences a bit more with my wife. Not in detail, but... just acknowledging when I'm having a hard day. It feels... I don't know, like I'm not carrying this burden alone anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful shift. How has that impacted your relationship?",
    "Client: It's... it's been good, actually. She seems relieved that I'm opening up more. I think she's felt pretty helpless all these years. And me... I feel less isolated. It's like a wall is slowly coming down between us.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful. What's your takeaway from today's session?",
    "Client: I guess... that facing these memories is incredibly hard, but it's not impossible. And maybe, just maybe, it's helping me reclaim parts of my life that I thought were lost forever. It's a glimmer of hope, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How will you carry this forward?",
    "Client: I think... I'll keep practicing those grounding techniques. And maybe... maybe I'll try to open up a bit more to my wife about my therapy progress. It's scary, but I think it might be worth it.",
    "Therapist: Excellent plan. How are you feeling now?",

    "Therapist: You're doing great work, Mr. Kazemi. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, I'll be here. Thank you again."
