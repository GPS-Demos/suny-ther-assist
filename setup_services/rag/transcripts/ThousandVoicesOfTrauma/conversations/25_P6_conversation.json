    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's begin. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that moment.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm there. It's the day of the earthquake. I'm in my apartment, and suddenly everything starts shaking. The walls are creaking, and I can hear things falling off shelves. My heart is racing, and I'm frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 6. I can feel my palms getting sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: The shaking is getting worse. I'm trying to move, but I can't. I'm thinking about my girlfriend - ex-girlfriend now - and wondering if she's okay. We had a fight that morning, and I... I feel guilty for not checking on her sooner.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's happening next?",
    "Client: I finally manage to get under the doorframe. I can hear car alarms going off outside, and people screaming. It feels like it's never going to end. I'm... I'm terrified.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to an 8. My chest feels tight, and I'm having trouble breathing steadily.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: The shaking stops, but I'm too scared to move. I can hear sirens in the distance. I'm trying to call my girlfriend, but the lines are down. I feel so helpless and alone.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking a bit. It feels so real, like I'm back there again. My SUDS is still at an 8, maybe even a 9 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're here with me, and you're safe.",
    "Client: Thanks. I... I eventually leave the apartment. The streets are chaos. Buildings are damaged, and there's debris everywhere. I keep trying to call her, but nothing's working. I feel like I've failed her, like I should have been there.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7 now. I'm feeling more sad than scared at this point.",
    "Therapist: That's natural. Continue with what happens next.",
    "Client: I spend hours searching for her. When I finally find her, she's okay, but... she's with someone else. They were together when the quake hit. That's... that's when I knew it was over between us.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",

    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Let's stay with these feelings for a moment.",
    "Client: It's hard. I keep replaying that moment in my head. The fear from the earthquake mixed with the shock of seeing her with someone else. I feel... I feel abandoned, I guess.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's hovering around a 5. I'm feeling drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter?",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing these emotions. How about we start wrapping up?",
    "Client: Okay. Yeah, I think I'm ready. It's... it's still painful, but talking about it like this, it feels different somehow.",
    "Therapist: Different how?",
    "Client: Like... like I'm looking at it from the outside. It still hurts, but I feel like I have a bit more control over the memory now.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 now. I'm tired, but I feel... I feel okay.",
    "Therapist: Well done. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end."
