    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of drained. Going through that memory of being ignored and belittled because of my race... it brought up a lot of emotions I've been trying to avoid.",
    "Therapist: Understandable. What stood out most?",
    "Client: The feeling of invisibility, I guess. Like, no matter how hard I tried to speak up or assert myself, it was like I didn't even exist to them. It's a feeling I've carried with me for so long, you know? And reliving it now, it's just... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: How does that relate to your daily life?",
    "Client: It's everywhere. In class, at parties, even just walking down the street. There's always this underlying fear that I'll be dismissed or treated differently because of my race. It's exhausting, always being on guard, always wondering if someone's reaction to me is because of who I am or... because of what I look like.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to confront that memory today?",
    "Client: Terrifying, honestly. But also... I don't know, maybe a little empowering? Like, I'm finally facing this thing that's had such a grip on me for so long. It hurts, yeah, but there's also this tiny spark of... hope? Like maybe by facing it, I can start to move past it.",
    "Therapist: That's significant. What do you think sparked that hope?",
    "Client: I think... it's the realization that I'm not that helpless kid anymore. I have a voice now, and I'm learning to use it. Even just being here, talking about this... it's a step I couldn't have taken before. It's like I'm reclaiming some of the power I felt I'd lost.",
    "Therapist: How might this impact your PTSD symptoms?",
    "Client: I hadn't really thought about that. I guess... maybe it could help with the flashbacks? Like, if I can face the memory head-on and process it, maybe it won't have such a strong hold on me when it pops up unexpectedly. And the constant anxiety... maybe that could lessen if I feel more in control?",
    "Therapist: That's insightful. Any strategies you want to try?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I could try to remind myself of my worth when I start feeling invisible or dismissed. Like, actively challenge those negative thoughts. And maybe... I don't know, seek out spaces where I feel truly seen and valued? It's hard with the depression sometimes, but I think it could help.",
    "Therapist: Good ideas. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's scary, but... I think I'm ready. For the first time in a long time, I feel like there might be a way forward. It's not going to be easy, and I know there will be setbacks, but... I want to keep going. I want to reclaim my life from this trauma.",
    "Therapist: That's courageous. What's your next step?",
    "Client: I think... I want to try journaling about these experiences. Get them out of my head and onto paper. And maybe... maybe I could look into joining a support group for people who've experienced racial trauma? I've always been hesitant about that, but hearing myself talk about it today... I think it could be helpful to connect with others who understand.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a solid plan. Anything else?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I guess. For listening, for guiding me through this. It means more than I can express to have someone really hear me and validate my experiences. It's... it's helping me feel less alone in all of this."
