    "Therapist: Welcome, James. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling a bit jittery, to be honest. But I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. How would you rate your distress from 0 to 100?",
    "Client: Uh, probably around a 60 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, you're safe here. Close your eyes and take us back to that day at work.",
    "Client: *Deep breath* Alright... I'm at my desk, it's just another Tuesday morning. The office is quiet, everyone's focused on their screens. I'm reviewing some reports when suddenly, the building starts to shake. At first, it's subtle, and I think maybe it's just a truck passing by or something. But then it gets stronger, and stronger...",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: My heart's racing. I... I can hear things starting to rattle on my desk. The shaking's getting more intense. People are starting to look up, confused. Someone shouts, \"Earthquake!\" and that's when the panic hits me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's happening in your body?",
    "Client: My palms are sweating. I can feel my legs trembling, almost like they're matching the building's vibrations. I'm frozen in my chair, I can't move. The noise is getting louder - there's creaking, things falling off shelves. I hear screaming from somewhere in the office.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I finally snap out of it and stand up. But the floor's moving so much, I can barely keep my balance. I grab onto my desk, knocking over my coffee. It spills everywhere, but I don't care. I'm just trying to stay upright.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's pretty high. Maybe 80?",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, James. Take a deep breath. What's happening around you?",
    "Client: People are rushing past me, heading for the exits. There's so much chaos. I see my coworker, Sarah, she's crying and trying to get under her desk. The lights are flickering, and I can hear what sounds like glass breaking somewhere.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I'm thinking this is it. This is how I die. I'm going to be crushed under this building. My family, my friends... I'll never see them again. I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What do you do?",
    "Client: I finally force myself to move. I'm stumbling towards the emergency exit, but it feels like I'm moving in slow motion. The hallway seems so long. Pictures are falling off the walls. I can smell dust and... is that gas? Oh god, what if there's a fire?",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, James. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: I make it to the stairwell. It's packed with people, everyone's pushing and shoving. I can hear sobbing, shouting. Someone falls in front of me, and I help them up. We're all clinging to the railings as we make our way down. The stairs are swaying beneath our feet.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Terrified. Absolutely terrified. But also... there's this weird sense of connection with everyone around me. We're all in this together, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's still high... maybe 85?",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue with what happens next.",
    "Client: We finally make it outside. The street is... it's chaos. Car alarms are blaring, there's debris everywhere. I can see cracks in the pavement. People are streaming out of buildings, some are injured. I hear sirens in the distance.",
    "Therapist: What do you do once you're outside?",
    "Client: I... I just stand there for a moment, trying to catch my breath. My legs feel like jelly. I'm looking up at our building, expecting to see it collapse any second. But it's still standing. I feel a mix of relief and... and disbelief. Like, did that really just happen?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: Someone's shouting for everyone to move away from the buildings. I start walking... stumbling really, towards the park across the street. My phone's in my hand, but the network's jammed. I can't call anyone, can't check on my family. That helpless feeling comes rushing back.",
    "Therapist: How are you coping with those feelings?",
    "Client: I... I'm trying to focus on my breathing. Trying to stay calm. But it's hard. I keep expecting aftershocks. Every little vibration, every loud noise makes me jump. I find myself standing with a group of my coworkers. We're all just... shell-shocked.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, James. How would you rate your distress now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe 70?",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going. What happens as time passes?",
    "Client: We're in the park for what feels like hours. Emergency services are everywhere. There are people being treated for injuries. I see my boss organizing people, trying to account for everyone from our office. I help out, anything to keep my mind occupied.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling physically at this point?",
    "Client: Exhausted. My whole body's aching from the tension. I've got a pounding headache. But the adrenaline's still there, keeping me on edge. I keep scanning the area, looking for... I don't know what. More danger, I guess.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. What happens next?",
    "Client: Eventually, we get word that it's safe to leave the area. Some people are heading to emergency shelters. Others are trying to find ways home. The city's a mess - traffic lights are out, some roads are blocked. I decide to walk home. It's a long way, but I need to move, to do something.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that decision?",
    "Client: Part of me is scared to be alone, but another part needs the space to process. As I'm walking, I'm seeing all this damage. Broken windows, toppled trees, cracks in buildings. It's like being in a movie, you know? It doesn't feel real.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What are you thinking as you walk?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about how fragile everything is. How in just a few minutes, our whole world can be turned upside down. I'm worried about aftershocks, about my family and friends. But I'm also feeling... I don't know, grateful? Like, I survived this. I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: That's a common mix of emotions. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's lower. Maybe around 50? I'm still shaken, but the immediate panic is fading.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens when you get home?",
    "Client: My apartment's a mess. Things knocked over, some broken dishes. But the building seems okay. I finally get through to my family on the phone. Hearing their voices... that's when I break down. All the emotions I've been holding back just come pouring out.",
    "Therapist: Allow yourself to feel those emotions. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I clean up a bit. Try to restore some normalcy. But I can't relax. I keep checking the news, looking for updates. I don't want to sleep, afraid I'll miss something important. Every little creak or sound makes me tense up.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with that anxiety?",
    "Client: I try some deep breathing exercises. I text with friends, check on coworkers. Somehow, connecting with others helps. But I still feel... on edge. Like the world isn't safe anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction to trauma. How would you rate your distress now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 40, I think.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well, James. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Take a deep breath and slowly open your eyes when you're ready.",
    "Client: *Opens eyes, takes a deep breath* Wow... that was intense. But... I got through it.",
    "Therapist: Yes, you did. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, but... okay. It's still hard to talk about, but it feels a bit less overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Remember, you're safe now. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves before we end the session."
