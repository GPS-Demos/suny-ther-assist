    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a part of me that wants to dive in, but another part that's terrified. It's like I'm standing on the edge of a cliff, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start slowly. Can you describe where you are in your memory?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in my childhood home. It's dark, and I'm alone in my room. I can hear my parents arguing downstairs.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably about a 4 or 5.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: The walls feel like they're closing in. I'm curled up on my bed, trying to block out the sounds. My heart is racing, and I feel so small and helpless.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: The shouting gets louder. I hear something crash downstairs, and I flinch. God, I'm shaking just thinking about it. I... I want to go check on my little sister, but I'm too scared to leave my room.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to a 7, I think.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... I hear footsteps coming up the stairs. Heavy, angry footsteps. I'm holding my breath, praying they'll pass by my door.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest is tight, and my stomach is in knots. I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Keep going. You're doing great.",
    "Client: The footsteps stop outside my door. I can hear my father's ragged breathing. He's drunk again, I can tell. The doorknob turns, and I... I want to disappear. I'm frozen in place as he stumbles in.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: He's... he's yelling at me. Saying it's all my fault, that I'm the reason for their fights. I can smell the alcohol on his breath. I'm pressing myself against the wall, trying to become invisible.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Sarah. Take another deep breath.",
    "Client: *shaky breath* He's... he's grabbing my arm, pulling me out of bed. I'm begging him to stop, but it's like he can't even hear me. He's dragging me down the hallway, and I can hear my mom crying downstairs.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: We're at the top of the stairs now. I'm terrified he's going to push me. My legs are shaking so badly. He's screaming in my face, telling me I'm worthless, that I should just leave and never come back.",
    "Therapist: What do you want to do in this moment?",
    "Client: I want to run, to hide, to fight back... but I can't. I'm just a kid. I feel so powerless.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he shoves me. Not down the stairs, thank god, but against the wall. My head hits hard, and I see stars. I slide down to the floor, and he just... leaves. Goes back downstairs like nothing happened.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's still at a 9. My head is pounding just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Remember, you survived this.",
    "Client: I... I know. But it feels so real right now. I can still feel the wall against my back, hear the creaking of the stairs as he walks away.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I sit there for what feels like hours. I'm too scared to move. Eventually, I hear my mom coming up the stairs. She's crying softly.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel seeing your mom?",
    "Client: I feel... angry. And sad. She comes over to me, tries to hug me, but I push her away. Why didn't she protect me? Why did she let this happen?",
    "Therapist: That's a valid feeling. What does your mom do?",
    "Client: She just... sits next to me. We don't speak. I can hear her sniffling, and a part of me wants to comfort her, but I'm too hurt, too angry.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about a 7. I'm starting to feel more numb than scared.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Continue with what happens next.",
    "Client: Eventually, I get up. My legs are shaky, and my head still hurts. I go back to my room and lock the door. I can hear my mom still crying in the hallway.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking at this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking that I need to get out of here. That I can't live like this anymore. I start planning in my head, thinking about where I could go, how I could escape.",
    "Therapist: How old are you in this memory?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm 14. Old enough to know this isn't normal, but too young to really do anything about it.",
    "Therapist: That's a difficult position to be in. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I start packing a bag. Just essentials - some clothes, a toothbrush, the little money I've saved. I'm not really thinking clearly, just acting on instinct.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 6 now. The fear is turning into determination.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going with what happens.",
    "Client: I wait until it's late, until I'm sure everyone's asleep. Then I open my window. It's a two-story drop, but there's a tree nearby. I've climbed it before, playing as a kid.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling as you prepare to leave?",
    "Client: Terrified, but also... relieved? Like I'm finally taking control. My hands are shaking as I throw my bag out the window.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: I climb out onto the branch. It's colder than I expected, and the bark is rough against my hands. I nearly slip at one point, and my heart feels like it's going to burst out of my chest.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. Then what?",
    "Client: I make it down the tree. My feet touch the ground, and for a moment, I just stand there, looking back at the house. It looks so normal from the outside. No one would ever guess what goes on inside.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm wondering if I should go back. If maybe things will be better in the morning. But then I remember the look in my father's eyes, the sound of my mother's sobs, and I know I can't stay.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's at a 5. I'm scared, but I also feel a strange sense of freedom.",
    "Therapist: Where do you go from here?",
    "Client: I start walking. I don't really have a plan, just a vague idea of heading towards the bus station. It's so quiet out here, just the sound of crickets and my own footsteps.",
    "Therapist: How long do you walk?",
    "Client: It feels like hours. My feet are aching, and I keep looking over my shoulder, afraid someone will see me and call the police. Or worse, that my father will come after me.",
    "Therapist: What happens when you reach the bus station?",
    "Client: It's... it's closed. Of course it is, it's the middle of the night. I sit on a bench, suddenly feeling very alone and very stupid. What was I thinking?",
    "Therapist: That must have been a difficult moment. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I start crying. Quietly at first, then these big, heaving sobs. I'm scared and cold and I have no idea what to do next.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's back up to a 7. I feel so lost and helpless.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe now.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... As I'm sitting there, a police car drives by. The officer sees me and stops.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel when you see the police?",
    "Client: Terrified at first. I think about running, but I'm too exhausted. Part of me is relieved, though. Maybe they can help.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: The officer approaches me. He's kind, asks me what I'm doing out so late. I... I break down and tell him everything. About my dad, the fights, the neglect.",
    "Therapist: How does the officer respond?",
    "Client: He listens, really listens. Then he tells me he's going to take me somewhere safe. I'm scared, but I trust him. It feels like the first time an adult has really seen me in years.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 4. I feel drained, but also a little hopeful.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Let's start wrapping up. How does this memory end?",
    "Client: The officer takes me to a youth shelter. It's not perfect, but it's safe. As I lay down on the bed there, I feel... I don't know, a mix of sadness and relief. Like I've lost something, but maybe gained a chance at something better.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful ending. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. But I also feel lighter somehow, like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's normal after an intense session like this. Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to a 3 now. I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: You did incredibly well today, Sarah. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves before we end.",
    "Client: Okay... thank you. I didn't think I could get through that, but... I did.",
    "Therapist: You did, and you should be proud. Let's focus on some deep breathing now."
