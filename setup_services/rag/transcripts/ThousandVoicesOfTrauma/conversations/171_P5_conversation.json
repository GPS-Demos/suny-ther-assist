    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do. I've been having more nightmares lately about that day at the bank.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you familiar with this?",
    "Client: Not really. Is it like... reliving the hostage situation? Because I'm not sure I can handle that.",
    "Therapist: It's controlled recounting. We'll go slowly. How does that sound?",
    "Client: I'm still scared, but I trust you. Can you explain more about what we'll be doing exactly? And why we need to do this?",
    "Therapist: Certainly. We'll revisit the memory safely. It helps reduce PTSD symptoms over time. Any questions?",
    "Client: Yeah, um... What if I panic? Or what if I can't stop crying? I'm worried I'll fall apart completely.",
    "Therapist: I'll be here throughout. We can pause anytime. Your safety is paramount.",
    "Client: Okay, that's reassuring. I guess I'm also worried about how I'll feel afterward. Will this make my nightmares worse?",
    "Therapist: It may be challenging initially, but often improves sleep long-term. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Alright, I'll try. But can we start with just a small part of what happened? Maybe just the beginning when we first realized something was wrong?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll start there. Your courage is commendable, Maria.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm trying to be brave, but it's hard. Sometimes I feel like I'll never get past this, you know? But I want to get better. I want to be able to go into banks again without panicking.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is admirable. Ready to start?",
    "Client: I think so. Can you remind me what I should do if it gets too overwhelming?",
    "Therapist: Just say \"stop.\" We'll pause immediately. How's your breathing now?",
    "Client: It's a little fast, but I'm trying to keep it steady. Okay, I think I'm ready. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Good. Close your eyes. Describe the bank that day.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay... I remember walking in. It was busy, lots of people. The air conditioning was on high, and I remember feeling cold..."
