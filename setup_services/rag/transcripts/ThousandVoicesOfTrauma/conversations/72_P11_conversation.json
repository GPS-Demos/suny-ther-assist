    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Jake?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of... drained, I guess? But also, weirdly alert at the same time. It's like my body doesn't know whether to shut down or stay on high alert.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sounds. God, the sounds were so vivid. The explosions, the shouting, the... the screams. I could hear them so clearly, it was like I was right back there in the middle of it all. And the smell of smoke and gunpowder... it's like it was filling my nostrils again.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit those sensations?",
    "Client: Terrifying, honestly. For a moment, I forgot I was here in your office. I was back there, in that hellish place, feeling completely overwhelmed and helpless. But... but then I remembered your voice, reminding me that I'm safe now. That helped ground me a bit.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad that helped. What else did you notice?",
    "Client: I realized how tense my body gets. My muscles were so tight, especially in my shoulders and jaw. I think I've been carrying that tension with me for years without even realizing it. And my breathing... it was so shallow and quick. No wonder I feel exhausted all the time.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your day-to-day experiences?",
    "Client: Well, I've been jumpy and on edge for so long, I thought it was just... normal, you know? But now I can see how it's tied to those memories. The constant vigilance, the trouble sleeping, the irritability... it all stems from those experiences.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. How do you feel about that realization?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a relief, in a way. Like, there's a reason for all this, you know? I'm not just broken or weak. I've been through something real, something traumatic, and my mind and body are still trying to protect me from it. It doesn't make it easier, exactly, but it makes more sense now.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful perspective. What's next for you in this process?",
    "Client: I want to keep going. It's hard, really hard, but I feel like I'm finally starting to understand myself better. And maybe... maybe if I can face these memories head-on, they'll start to lose some of their power over me. I want to learn how to relax again, how to feel safe in my own skin.",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. How can we support that in our next session?",
    "Client: Could we... could we maybe work on some of those breathing techniques you mentioned? I think if I could get a better handle on my physical reactions, it might help me stay more grounded during these exposures. And maybe we could dig a little deeper into that specific memory? There's more there that I think I need to process.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll focus on that next time. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... okay. Better than I expected, actually. It's like... like I've taken a step towards something important. It's scary, but I also feel a little bit stronger. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. You've shown great courage today, Jake.",
    "Client: Thanks. I... I appreciate that. And thank you for guiding me through this. I know I've got a long way to go, but for the first time in years, I feel like there might actually be a light at the end of this tunnel.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful progress. We'll build on this next week.",
    "Client: Yeah, okay. I'm... I'm actually looking forward to it. Well, maybe \"looking forward\" isn't the right phrase, but you know what I mean. I'm ready to keep working on this. It feels important.",
    "Therapist: It is. Take care of yourself this week, Jake.",
    "Client: I will. Thanks again, doc. See you next time."
