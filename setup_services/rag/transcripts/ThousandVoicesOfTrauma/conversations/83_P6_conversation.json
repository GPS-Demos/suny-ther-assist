    "Therapist: Alright, Karim, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's begin. Close your eyes and recall the memory of your imprisonment.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in the cell. It's dark and cold. The walls are closing in on me. I can hear the guards shouting outside.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 6 out of 10. My heart is starting to race a bit.",
    "Therapist: Thanks. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The cell smells musty, like mold and sweat. I'm sitting on the hard concrete floor, my back against the wall. I can feel the rough texture through my thin shirt. My stomach is in knots, and I'm terrified of what might happen next.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's getting more intense. Maybe a 7 or 8 now. My palms are sweaty, and I'm starting to feel a bit dizzy.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I hear footsteps approaching. My whole body tenses up. I'm trying to make myself as small as possible in the corner. The door creaks open, and I see the silhouette of a guard. He's saying something, but I can't understand him. My ears are ringing.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating at this moment?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. I feel like I can't breathe. My chest is so tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I'm trying, but it's hard. The guard is coming closer. He's shouting at me, telling me to stand up. I can't move. I'm frozen. He grabs my arm roughly, and I flinch. I can feel his fingers digging into my skin.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's still a 9. Maybe even a 10. I feel like I'm right back there. My whole body is shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here with me.",
    "Client: The guard is dragging me out of the cell. The hallway is so bright it hurts my eyes. Other prisoners are watching as I'm pulled along. I feel so humiliated and scared. I don't know where they're taking me or what they're going to do.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe an 8. I'm still shaking, but I can breathe a little easier.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: They're taking me to an interrogation room. The fluorescent lights are harsh. There's a metal table and two chairs. They push me into one of the chairs. I can hear my heart pounding in my ears. My mouth is dry, and I feel nauseous.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling at this point?",
    "Client: It's about a 7 now. I'm still anxious, but I'm starting to remember that it's just a memory.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: An officer enters the room. He's holding a file. He sits across from me and starts asking questions. I can barely focus on what he's saying. My mind is racing, trying to figure out what they want from me, what I should say.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6. I'm still tense, but I'm feeling more in control.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. You're making progress. Keep going.",
    "Client: The interrogation seems to go on forever. They keep asking the same questions over and over. I'm exhausted and confused. My head is pounding. I just want it to be over.",
    "Therapist: And how are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'd say it's a 5 now. I'm tired, but the intense fear is fading.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. We're almost done.",
    "Client: Finally, they take me back to my cell. I collapse on the floor, feeling drained and hopeless. But there's also a tiny sense of relief that the interrogation is over, at least for now.",
    "Therapist: What's your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to a 4 now. I'm feeling calmer, but still a bit shaky.",
    "Therapist: Well done, Karim. You've made it through the exercise. Let's take a moment to breathe deeply together."
