    "Therapist: Welcome, Alex. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Oh, you know... I'm a bit on edge. This whole thing still feels strange to me. I mean, talking about the accident... it's not easy. But I suppose that's why I'm here, right?",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start slowly. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. Yes, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes if you're comfortable. Take us back to that day.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm... I'm in my car. It's a crisp autumn morning. The leaves are just starting to turn. I'm driving to my weekly bridge game at the community center. I always looked forward to those... (pause) The radio's on, playing some oldies station. I remember humming along...",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: I see... the road stretching out ahead. It's winding through the hills. There are trees on both sides, their leaves a mix of green and gold. It's beautiful, really. I remember thinking how lucky I was to live in such a pretty place...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, on a scale of 0 to 100?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 30? I'm okay for now.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: Well, I'm approaching a curve in the road. I've driven this route hundreds of times, so I'm not really thinking about it. I'm more focused on what snacks I'll grab at the center before the game starts. And then... (voice trembles) I see something out of the corner of my eye.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: It's... it's a deer. A young one, I think. It darts out onto the road, right in front of me. I... I panic. My heart's racing now, just like it did then. I jerk the wheel hard to avoid hitting it.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: Everything's spinning. The car's out of control. I'm trying to steer, but it's no use. I'm going too fast, and the road's too curvy. I feel the tires leave the pavement, and suddenly I'm airborne. It's... it's terrifying. I can't breathe. I can't think. I'm just... falling.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) It's... it's up there. Maybe 70?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Remember, you're here in the room with me. You're safe.",
    "Client: Right... safe. Okay. (takes a deep breath) The car hits the ground with a sickening crunch. I'm jolted forward, but the seatbelt catches me. There's a moment of silence, and then... pain. So much pain. My chest hurts, my head is throbbing. I taste blood in my mouth.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I smell gasoline. And something burning. The airbag's deployed, and there's this powdery stuff in the air. I'm coughing, trying to catch my breath. I'm scared... so scared. I don't know if the car's going to explode, or if I'm badly hurt, or if anyone will find me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I try to move, but everything hurts. I'm pinned in place by the crumpled dashboard. I can hear... distant sounds. Cars on the road above, maybe? But no one's stopping. No one knows I'm here. I start to panic. What if no one finds me? What if I die here, alone?",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. Remember, you survived this.",
    "Client: (inhales shakily) Right... I did. I'm here. Okay... I remember trying to reach for my phone, but it's not in its usual spot. Must have fallen during the crash. I'm getting lightheaded. The pain is... it's overwhelming. I start to feel sleepy, which scares me even more. I don't want to close my eyes. I'm afraid I won't wake up.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's pretty high. Maybe 85?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: (takes several deep breaths) Okay... I'm... I'm still here. In your office. I can feel the chair beneath me.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: Alright... I don't know how long I was there. It felt like hours, but it might have been minutes. Suddenly, I hear a voice. Someone's calling out. I try to answer, but my voice is weak. I manage a small cry for help. There's movement outside the car, and then a face appears at the window. It's a young man, maybe in his twenties. He looks terrified, but he's talking to me, telling me help is on the way.",
    "Therapist: How does seeing this person make you feel?",
    "Client: Relieved... so relieved. But also scared. His expression... it makes me realize how bad things must look. I can hear sirens in the distance now. The young man is still talking to me, telling me to stay awake, that I'll be okay. I want to believe him, but I'm slipping in and out of consciousness.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The next part is... fuzzy. I remember flashing lights, voices shouting. Someone's asking me questions, but I can't seem to form words. There's a flurry of activity around me. I feel them cutting away my clothes, putting a brace around my neck. The pain intensifies as they move me, and I think I cry out.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I smell antiseptic. Hear the crackle of a radio. Feel the cold air as they lift me out of the car. Everything hurts, but I'm starting to feel... detached. Like I'm floating above it all. I catch glimpses of the scene - my car, crumpled like a tin can at the bottom of a small ravine. There are so many people around now. Firefighters, paramedics, police...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... intense. But I'm okay. Maybe a 60 on the distress scale?",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're handling this well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: They load me into the ambulance. The lights are so bright, and there's a constant beeping sound. Someone's holding my hand, telling me I'm going to be alright. I want to ask about my family, about what happened, but I can't speak. There's an oxygen mask on my face, and I'm drifting again. The last thing I remember before everything goes dark is the feeling of movement, the ambulance racing towards the hospital.",
    "Therapist: You've done an excellent job describing the accident. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. But also... relieved? Like a weight's been lifted, somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's common after an exposure exercise. Let's take some time to process this.",
    "Client: Okay... you know, I've never really talked about it in this much detail before. It's always been too painful. But now... it feels different. Like I'm looking at it from the outside, almost.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive sign. How has this affected your view of the accident?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'm starting to see it as something that happened to me, not something that defines me. For so long, I've been the person who survived that terrible crash. But now... I'm just me again. Someone who went through something scary, but came out the other side.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it make you feel?",
    "Client: Stronger, I suppose. Like maybe I can face other things that scare me. It's still hard, don't get me wrong. But it doesn't feel impossible anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's work on grounding techniques now.",
    "Client: Yes, please. I feel a bit shaky after all that.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's start with some deep breathing...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Much better. Calmer. I feel... present again.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's one thing you've learned from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I've learned that I'm stronger than I thought. That I can face these memories without being overwhelmed by them. It's not easy, but it's possible.",
    "Therapist: That's a valuable insight. We'll build on this in our next session.",
    "Client: Thank you. This wasn't easy, but I'm glad we did it. I feel... different. Like maybe I can start moving forward now.",
    "Therapist: That's the goal. You've done excellent work today, Alex. We'll end here."
