    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is buzzing, but also heavy at the same time. My heart's still racing a bit. I can feel this tightness in my chest, and my hands are clammy. It's weird because I'm here in this room, but part of me still feels like I'm back in that hospital bed.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. Like, I was supposed to be this strong, independent student, you know? But suddenly, I'm just... lying there, unable to even go to the bathroom by myself. It's embarrassing to talk about, but it's true. I felt so vulnerable and exposed. And there's this voice in my head saying, \"What if it happens again? What if I'm never truly healthy?\"",
    "Therapist: I see. How does it feel to share those thoughts?",
    "Client: It's... uncomfortable. But also, kind of relieving? I've never really put it into words before. It's like, by saying it out loud, I'm acknowledging how scared I actually was. And still am, I guess. It's not just about the physical pain anymore, it's about feeling like my body betrayed me, you know?",
    "Therapist: Betrayed. That's a powerful word. Can you tell me more about that?",
    "Client: Yeah, it's like... I always took my health for granted. I was young, active, doing well in my studies. And then suddenly, my body just... gave up on me. I couldn't trust it anymore. Even now, every little ache or pain makes me panic. What if it's happening again? What if I end up back in that hospital bed, surrounded by beeping machines and the smell of disinfectant?",
    "Therapist: And when those thoughts come up, what do you feel?",
    "Client: Terrified. Absolutely terrified. My heart starts racing, I get sweaty, and sometimes I feel like I can't breathe. It's like I'm right back there in that moment when the doctor told me how serious my condition was. I remember the look on his face, the fluorescent lights overhead, the cold metal of the bed rail I was gripping. It's so vivid, even now.",
    "Therapist: How do these memories impact your daily life?",
    "Client: They... they're always there, lurking in the background. I've become hyper-vigilant about my health. I'm constantly checking my body for any signs of illness. I've missed classes because I convinced myself I was getting sick again. My roommates probably think I'm a hypochondriac. And dating? Forget about it. How do I explain to someone that I'm terrified of my own body?",
    "Therapist: That sounds really challenging. What do you think you need to feel safe again?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Part of me wants to wrap myself in bubble wrap and never leave my room. But I know that's not living. I guess... I need to feel like I have some control over my health. Like, even if I get sick again, it won't be the end of the world. I need to trust my body again, to believe that it's strong and resilient. But how do I do that when I'm so scared?",
    "Therapist: That's a great insight. How might you start building that trust?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I could start small? Like, setting little health goals for myself. Eating better, exercising more, getting regular check-ups. And perhaps... talking more about my experience? It's scary, but it also feels good to get it out. To know that someone understands. I've been carrying this alone for so long, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive step. How does it feel to consider these changes?",
    "Client: It's... a mix of emotions, honestly. There's a part of me that feels hopeful, like maybe I can actually move past this. But there's also this fear, this voice saying, \"What if it's not enough? What if you do all this and still get sick again?\" It's hard to shut that voice up. But... I want to try. I'm tired of living in fear all the time.",
    "Therapist: Your resilience is remarkable. What else comes to mind as we discuss this?",
    "Client: I'm thinking about my family, actually. They were so supportive during my illness, but I've kind of pushed them away since then. I didn't want them to see how scared I still am. But maybe... maybe I need to let them in more? It's just, I'm supposed to be the strong one, you know? The one who moved away for university, who's making something of herself. It feels like admitting weakness to tell them I'm still struggling.",
    "Therapist: How might opening up to them change things for you?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me is scared they'll be disappointed or worried. But another part... another part of me really wants that support. To not feel so alone in this. Maybe they could help me feel more secure, remind me of the times I've been strong before. And maybe... maybe talking about it with them could help me process it better? I don't know. It's scary to think about, but also kind of... liberating?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you feel now, compared to when we started?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, honestly. But also lighter, somehow? Like I've been carrying this heavy backpack and I've finally put it down for a moment. My heart isn't racing as much anymore, and that tightness in my chest has eased a bit. I'm still scared, don't get me wrong. But it feels like... like maybe I can face this fear now. Like I'm not alone in it anymore. Is that... is that normal?",
    "Therapist: There's no \"normal\" in healing. What matters is how you feel. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. This was... intense. But good, I think. Thank you for listening, for helping me make sense of all this. I feel like I have a lot to think about, but in a good way. Like maybe there's a path forward that I couldn't see before. Is it okay if we pick this up next time? I think I need some time to process everything we've talked about today.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
