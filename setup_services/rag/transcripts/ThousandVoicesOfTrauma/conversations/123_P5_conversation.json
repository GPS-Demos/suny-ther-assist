    "Therapist: Good morning, Mr. Thompson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Morning, Dr. Evans. I'm... alright, I suppose. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been thinking about it all week.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's talk through it. What are your thoughts?",
    "Client: Well, to be honest, I'm not sure I want to revisit those memories from work. It was a long time ago, and I've tried so hard to forget it all. The bullying, the constant fear... it's not easy to think about, you know?",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your honesty. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: It's just... I've spent years trying to push those memories away. The idea of deliberately bringing them back feels... wrong, somehow. Like I'm inviting trouble. And at my age, haven't I been through enough already?",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. How do you think revisiting might help?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe it could help me process things better? But I'm worried it might make everything worse. What if I can't handle it?",
    "Therapist: That's a common concern. How can I support you through this?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe if you could explain more about what we're going to do? And maybe... could you stay close by? I know it sounds silly at my age, but I don't want to feel alone with those memories.",
    "Therapist: Of course. I'll be right here. Shall I explain the process?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think that would help me feel a bit more prepared.",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit the memory gradually. You're in control. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. It's strange, feeling both scared and hopeful at the same time. But I trust you, Dr. Evans. And if this can help me finally move past what happened... well, I suppose it's worth trying, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Let's start slowly. Close your eyes when ready.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm closing my eyes now. My heart's racing a bit, but I'm trying to stay calm. What should I do next?",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Imagine you're back at your workplace.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Alright... I can see the office. The fluorescent lights, the smell of coffee... It's all coming back now. I can feel my stomach tightening...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're safe here. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see... I see my desk. And... oh god, there's Tom coming towards me. He's got that look on his face... I know what's coming...",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. What's happening?",
    "Client: He's... he's starting to mock me. Calling me names, telling me I'm too old for this job. I can feel everyone's eyes on me, but no one's saying anything. I feel so small, so helpless...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here now, safe.",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) It's hard... I can feel that same fear, that same shame. But... but I'm also angry. Why did I let him treat me like that? Why didn't anyone help?",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are normal. How are you coping right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. But I'm surprised. I thought I'd fall apart, but I'm still here. I'm... I'm stronger than I thought.",
    "Therapist: You are indeed. Would you like to pause or continue?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to continue for a bit longer. It's difficult, but I feel like I'm finally facing this. Maybe... maybe this can help me after all.",
    "Therapist: Your resilience is impressive. Let's proceed at your pace."
