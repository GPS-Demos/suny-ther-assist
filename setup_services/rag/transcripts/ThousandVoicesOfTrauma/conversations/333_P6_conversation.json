    "Therapist: Welcome back, John. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest.",
    "Therapist: That's completely normal. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Can you give me your current SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 4 out of 10. My stomach feels a bit tight.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Let's start. Close your eyes and describe the memory.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) I'm... I'm back in that dark room. The air is thick and musty. I can hear muffled voices outside. My heart is racing, and I feel so small, so helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe a 6? My palms are getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Keep going.",
    "Client: There's a creaking sound. The door is opening, and I see a silhouette. It's him. I want to disappear, to melt into the walls. My whole body is trembling.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. SUDS?",
    "Client: (Voice shaking) It's... it's an 8 now. I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Remember your coping strategies. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Takes several deep breaths) He's... he's approaching me. I can smell alcohol on his breath. I'm frozen, can't move. My mind is screaming, but no sound comes out.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Current SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's still an 8. My chest feels so tight.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Keep breathing. You're safe now.",
    "Client: He's... he's touching me. I feel so dirty, so ashamed. I want to fight, but I'm paralyzed with fear. The room is spinning.",
    "Therapist: You're very courageous. SUDS now?",
    "Client: (Choking back tears) It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're here with me. You're safe. Take a moment if you need.",
    "Client: (Breathing heavily) I... I see myself curled up in the corner after he leaves. I feel so broken, so alone. The silence is deafening.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down. Maybe a 7? I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger?",
    "Therapist: That's common. You're processing the memory. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I see myself slowly uncurling. My body aches, but I'm alive. I notice a small crack of light under the door. It's... it's hope.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Current SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5 now. I feel... I feel sad, but also a bit relieved.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. But I also feel like I've faced something I've been running from for so long. It's... it's intense, but also kind of freeing?",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. You've shown great courage today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I never thought I could talk about this. It's still hard, but... but I feel like I'm starting to take my power back, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful. Let's end here. Final SUDS?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 3 now. I feel drained, but... but okay.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today, John. How about we..."
