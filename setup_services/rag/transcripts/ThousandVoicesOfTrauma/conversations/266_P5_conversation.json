    "Therapist: Hello, John. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi, Dr. Thompson. I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been thinking about it a lot since our last session.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... the idea of reliving that earthquake. It was such a terrifying experience. I've spent years trying to forget it, and now you want me to remember it in detail? I'm worried it might be too much for me to handle.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your honesty. Imaginal exposure can feel daunting. How about we discuss its purpose?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I mean, I trust you, but I need to understand why this is necessary. It feels counterintuitive to deliberately revisit something so traumatic.",
    "Therapist: It helps process the memory and reduce its power over you. What are your thoughts on that?",
    "Client: I suppose that makes sense. But won't it just make everything worse? I've been having nightmares about it lately, especially with all the stress at work. I'm worried this might intensify those nightmares or trigger more anxiety.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace and provide support throughout. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's somewhat reassuring. But what exactly will happen during this exercise? Will I have to close my eyes and describe everything in detail? I'm not sure I can do that without having a panic attack.",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the memory while I guide you. We can pause anytime. What do you think?",
    "Client: Okay, that doesn't sound as bad as I imagined. But what if I get overwhelmed? Or what if I can't remember all the details? Sometimes it's all a blur, and other times it's so vivid it feels like it's happening all over again.",
    "Therapist: We'll handle overwhelm together. Incomplete memories are normal. Your safety is our priority.",
    "Client: Alright, I appreciate that. I guess I'm just scared of losing control. This earthquake, it... it took away my sense of safety, you know? And now, with all the pressure at work, I feel like I'm constantly on edge. I don't want to fall apart.",
    "Therapist: Your resilience is evident. This exercise aims to help regain control. Shall we proceed?",
    "Client: Okay, I think I'm ready to try. But can we start slowly? Maybe just talk about the lead-up to the earthquake first? I'm not sure I can jump right into the worst parts.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll start where you're comfortable. Your courage is commendable, John.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Thompson. I appreciate your patience and understanding. I know this isn't easy, but I want to get better. For myself, for my wife, for my colleagues. I can't keep living in fear of the ground suddenly shifting beneath my feet, both literally and metaphorically.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is inspiring. Shall we begin with some relaxation exercises?",
    "Client: Yes, that would be helpful. I can feel my heart racing already. It's amazing how just talking about it can bring back those feelings of panic. But I'm here, I'm safe, and I'm ready to face this. Let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Take a deep breath. We'll start when you're ready."
