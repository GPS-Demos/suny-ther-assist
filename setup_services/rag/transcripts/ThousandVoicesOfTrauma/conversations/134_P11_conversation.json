    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, John?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. The memory of that car accident feels so vivid now. I can still hear the screeching tires and smell the burnt rubber. It's like I was right back there on that highway.",
    "Therapist: What stood out most?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. In that moment, I realized I had no control over what was happening. The car was spinning, and I couldn't do anything to stop it. It's... it's terrifying to feel that powerless.",
    "Therapist: Mm. How's your body feeling now?",
    "Client: Tense. My shoulders are tight, and my heart's still racing a bit. It's like my body doesn't know the danger has passed.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Deep breath?",
    "Client: *takes a deep breath* Yeah, that helps a little. It's just... I've been avoiding thinking about this for so long. Reliving it is hard. I keep thinking about how things could have been different if I'd reacted faster or if I'd taken a different route that day. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your daily life?",
    "Client: I guess... I'm always on edge now. Especially when driving. I'm constantly scanning for potential dangers, and I get really anxious when other cars come too close. It's exhausting, always being in this state of high alert. And it's affecting my relationship too. My partner wants to go on a road trip, but the thought of being on the highway for hours... it terrifies me.",
    "Therapist: What did you learn today?",
    "Client: I realized that even though reliving the memory is painful, I can get through it. The anxiety peaks, but it also subsides. And... I think I understand now why I've been so irritable lately. This constant state of tension I'm in, it's not just about driving. It's affecting everything.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight.",
    "Client: Yeah, it is. I've been pushing people away, snapping at my partner over little things. I think it's because I'm always bracing for something bad to happen. It's like... the accident made me feel like danger is always just around the corner.",
    "Therapist: How might you use this awareness?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to talk to my partner about this. Explain why I've been so on edge. And maybe... maybe I can start practicing some relaxation techniques when I'm not driving. Try to lower my baseline anxiety level. It's just hard to let my guard down.",
    "Therapist: That's a great start. Next steps?",
    "Client: I want to keep working on this. Maybe... maybe we could do another imaginal exposure, but focus on the moments right after the accident? I think I need to process that part too. And I'd like to learn more coping strategies for when I start feeling overwhelmed in daily life.",
    "Therapist: Sounds good. Proud of your progress today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's tough, but... I think I'm starting to see a way forward. I just hope I can keep this momentum going. There are days when it all feels like too much, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's normal. We'll take it step by step.",
    "Client: Yeah, you're right. I appreciate your guidance through this. It's... it's not easy to face these memories, but I know it's necessary. I just want to get to a place where I can drive without panic and enjoy life again without constantly waiting for something terrible to happen.",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: A bit drained, honestly. But also... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful? Like I've taken a small step forward. It's exhausting, but I think it's worth it. I just need to remember that when things get tough.",
    "Therapist: Excellent insight. Anything else before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I don't think so. Just... thank you. For listening and for guiding me through this. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I might actually be able to get there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work, John. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, I'll be here. Thanks again, Doc."
