    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's like I was right back there in the car, you know? My heart's still racing a bit, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's strange how vivid it all becomes when I close my eyes and really focus on the memory.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: Well, I keep thinking about how helpless I felt in that moment. The screeching of the tires, the crunch of metal... it's all so loud in my head. And then there's this voice, my own voice, saying \"This is it. This is how it ends.\" It's... it's overwhelming. I'm also feeling guilty, you know? Like maybe if I had been more alert, I could have avoided the accident altogether.",
    "Therapist: I see. How do these thoughts and feelings compare to when the accident first happened?",
    "Client: Hmm... I'd say they're not as intense as they were right after the accident, but they're still pretty strong. Back then, I was in shock, I think. Now, it's like I can process it more, but that almost makes it scarier in a way. I'm more aware of how close I came to... well, to not being here anymore. And that awareness brings up a lot of anxiety.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice in your body as you talk about this?",
    "Client: My hands are a bit shaky, and I've got this knot in my stomach. It's like my body is preparing for danger, even though I know I'm safe here. I can feel my jaw clenching too. It's funny, I didn't even realize I was doing that until you asked.",
    "Therapist: How do you make sense of these physical reactions?",
    "Client: I suppose... I suppose it's my body remembering the trauma. Like it's trying to protect me from something that's already happened. It's frustrating, really. I want to move past this, but my body seems stuck in that moment. And then there's this voice in my head telling me I should be over this by now, which just makes me feel worse.",
    "Therapist: Mm. What would it mean to you to \"be over this\"?",
    "Client: I guess... to not have these intense reactions anymore. To be able to drive without constantly scanning for danger. To sleep through the night without nightmares. To feel... normal again. But then I wonder, is there even such a thing as normal after something like this? Maybe I'm chasing something that doesn't exist.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... unsettling. Part of me wants to reject it outright. But there's another part that finds it oddly comforting. Like, maybe it's okay that I'm struggling with this. Maybe I don't have to beat myself up for not being \"over it\" yet. I don't know... it's all so confusing.",
    "Therapist: What else comes up for you as you reflect on this?",
    "Client: I'm thinking about how this has affected my relationships. My wife, she's been so patient, but I can see the worry in her eyes. And my kids... I don't want them to see me as fragile or broken. There's this pressure I put on myself to be strong for them, you know? But then I wonder if that's just making things worse, not letting them see how much I'm struggling.",
    "Therapist: How do you think showing vulnerability might impact your relationships?",
    "Client: That's... that's a tough one. Part of me fears it would burden them, or maybe even push them away. But then again, maybe it would bring us closer? Allow them to understand what I'm going through? I've always been the one they relied on, the strong one. It's hard to imagine shifting that dynamic.",
    "Therapist: What might be a small step towards openness?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe I could start by telling my wife more about these therapy sessions. Not everything, but... enough to give her an idea of what I'm working through. And with the kids, maybe I could be more honest when I'm having a tough day, instead of always putting on a brave face. It's scary to think about, but... maybe it could help.",
    "Therapist: How does considering that step make you feel?",
    "Client: It's a mix of emotions, really. There's fear, definitely. Fear of being vulnerable, of being seen as weak. But there's also a glimmer of hope. Like maybe, just maybe, this could be a path towards healing not just for me, but for our family as a whole. And underneath it all, there's this tiredness. I'm so tired of carrying this all on my own, you know?",
    "Therapist: What do you need right now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I think... I think I just need to breathe for a minute. This session has brought up a lot, and I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed. But also... grateful, I suppose. Grateful that I have this space to work through all of this. It's hard, but I think it's important. I just need to remind myself that it's okay to take it one step at a time.",
    "Therapist: That's a great awareness. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: Okay... yeah, that sounds good. *takes a deep breath* You know, as difficult as these sessions are, I always leave feeling a bit lighter. Like I've offloaded some of the weight I've been carrying. It's not gone, but... it's more manageable somehow.",
    "Therapist: How would you like to close our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to set a small goal for myself. Maybe to have that conversation with my wife about therapy. Not everything, but... a start. And to remind myself that it's okay to take things slow. That healing isn't linear, and that's alright. Is that... is that a good way to end?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful plan. We'll pick up here next time.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your guidance and patience. It means a lot to have someone to navigate this with. I'll see you next week.",
    "Therapist: Take care, and remember to be kind to yourself."
