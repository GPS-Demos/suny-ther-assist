    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mr. Lee?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I'm back there, you know? The sounds of the gunshots, the screams... they're so vivid in my mind. I can almost smell the smoke and the fear.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I think. No, not just fear... terror. It's like a cold hand gripping my insides. I keep thinking about how helpless I felt, watching those people being hurt and not being able to do anything. And there's this... guilt, I suppose. Why did I survive when others didn't?",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt manifest for you?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a weight on my chest. Sometimes I find it hard to breathe when I think about it. I see the faces of those who didn't make it, especially the children. I wonder what their lives could have been like if... if things had been different. If I had done something, anything.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind about that?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"I should have done more.\" But then another part of me says, \"What could you have done? You were just one person.\" It's this constant battle in my head. And then I feel angry - at the soldiers, at the government, at the whole situation. But mostly, I feel angry at myself for being so... so powerless.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you're talking about this?",
    "Client: My muscles are tense, especially in my shoulders and jaw. I notice I'm clenching my fists. There's this knot in my stomach that won't go away. And I feel... cold. Even though it's warm in here, I feel chilled, like I did that night when we were hiding.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to curl up and hide, to forget everything. But another part knows that's not the answer. I think... I think I need to feel safe. To know that it's over, that I'm here now, not back there. And maybe... to feel that it's okay to have survived.",
    "Therapist: How can we work towards that feeling of safety?",
    "Client: I'm not entirely sure. Perhaps... perhaps by reminding myself where I am now? Looking around this room, focusing on the present. And maybe... talking about it, like we're doing now. It helps to say these things out loud, to know that someone else knows. It makes it feel more... real, but also more manageable somehow.",
    "Therapist: What's one thing you can do to ground yourself right now?",
    "Client: I can... I can focus on my breathing. In and out. Slow and steady. And maybe... maybe I can think about my grandchildren. They always bring me joy. They represent hope, you know? A future that's different from the past I've experienced.",
    "Therapist: How does thinking about your grandchildren make you feel?",
    "Client: It... it brings a warmth to my chest. A lightness. When I think of their smiles, their laughter... it's like a ray of sunshine breaking through dark clouds. It reminds me that there's still good in the world, that life goes on. And it makes me want to be better, to heal, so I can be there for them.",
    "Therapist: What does healing mean to you in this context?",
    "Client: Healing... I suppose it means finding a way to live with what happened without letting it control me. To be able to remember without feeling overwhelmed by fear or guilt. To find peace, maybe. And to use my experiences to help others, perhaps. To make something good come out of something so terrible.",
    "Therapist: How do you see yourself progressing towards that goal?",
    "Client: It's a journey, isn't it? Some days are harder than others. But I think... I think talking about it helps. Facing these memories, as difficult as it is, seems to make them less powerful over time. And learning to be kind to myself, to understand that I did what I could in an impossible situation. It's not easy, but I'm trying.",
    "Therapist: What strengths have you discovered in yourself through this process?",
    "Client: I've found that I'm more resilient than I thought. Every time I face these memories and come out the other side, I feel a little stronger. I've also discovered a deep well of empathy for others who've been through trauma. And patience - with myself and the healing process. It's slow, but I'm learning to appreciate small victories.",
    "Therapist: How can you nurture these strengths moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I think by continuing to face my fears, bit by bit. By sharing my story, not just here, but maybe with others who've had similar experiences. And by focusing on the present - my family, my community here. Maybe I could volunteer, use my experiences to help other refugees. It's about creating a new narrative, isn't it? One where I'm not just a victim, but a survivor who can make a difference.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful perspective. How do you feel now compared to when we started?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, somehow. Still shaky, but more grounded. Like I've taken another step forward. It's exhausting, facing these memories, but there's also a sense of... I don't know, accomplishment? Like I'm slowly reclaiming parts of myself that I thought were lost. It's not easy, but I think it's worth it.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to explore more about how I can use my experiences to help others. And maybe we could work on some more grounding techniques for when the memories become overwhelming. Is that... is that something we could do?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll work on that next time. How are you feeling about ending our session today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling okay. A bit drained, but also... hopeful, I suppose. Thank you for listening, for helping me navigate through this. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't judge. I'm looking forward to our next session, even though I know it won't be easy.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Take care, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'll try to practice some of the techniques we've discussed. Have a good week."
