    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important. Okay, I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that moment. Describe what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: I'm... I'm back in the convoy. The hot desert air is stifling, even inside the vehicle. The smell of diesel fuel is overwhelming. I can hear the low rumble of the engines and the crackle of radio chatter. My hands are sweating on my weapon. I'm scanning the roadside, looking for any signs of danger.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4. I'm tense, but still okay.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a deafening explosion. The vehicle in front of us erupts in flames. I'm frozen for a second, my ears ringing. Then instinct kicks in. I'm shouting orders, trying to coordinate our response. But it's chaos. I can hear screaming... oh god, the screaming...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to a 7. My heart is racing. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) Okay. I... I see Johnson. He's badly hurt. There's so much blood. I'm trying to drag him to safety, but the gunfire is intensifying. I can feel the heat from the burning vehicle. The smell of burning flesh... it's making me nauseous.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's a 9. I feel like I'm right back there. My hands are shaking. I can't... I can't save him.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with the memory. What happens next?",
    "Client: (voice trembling) I... I have to leave Johnson. I can hear the medic yelling that he's gone. I'm returning fire, but it feels futile. There's dust and smoke everywhere. I can taste it. I'm terrified, but I have to keep fighting. I have to protect the others.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: Still at a 9. My chest feels so tight. I'm sweating... I feel trapped.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Keep breathing. What else do you recall?",
    "Client: The firefight seems to last forever. Finally, backup arrives. As things calm down, the reality hits me. We lost three men. I couldn't save them. I feel... I feel so guilty. So angry. Why them? Why not me?",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7? I still feel shaky, but not as overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. Sad. But... also a little relieved? Like I've let something out that I've been holding in for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You did very well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was hard, but... I think it helped.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad. We'll end here for today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Tired, but okay. My SUDS is down to about a 3 now.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we wrap up."
