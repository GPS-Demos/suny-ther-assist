    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Patel?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Revisiting that memory of my wife leaving... it's brought up so many emotions I thought I'd buried.",
    "Therapist: What stood out to you about the experience?",
    "Client: The intensity of the pain. It felt so raw, like it was happening all over again. I could see her face, hear her voice... It's been years, but in that moment, it was like no time had passed at all.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... difficult. I felt this crushing sense of loneliness, you know? Like I was that scared little boy again, abandoned and unloved. But... there was something else too. A kind of... I don't know, strength maybe?",
    "Therapist: Can you tell me more about that strength?",
    "Client: Well, I realized that I survived it. Both times - as a child and when my wife left. It hurt like hell, but I made it through. I'm still here. That's... that's something, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How does this realization connect to your recovery goals?",
    "Client: I suppose it shows me that I'm more resilient than I give myself credit for. Maybe I don't need to be so afraid of getting close to people. If I could survive those losses, I can handle whatever comes my way.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How might this affect your daily life?",
    "Client: I... I think I might be ready to start putting myself out there more. Maybe join that community group my neighbor keeps inviting me to. It's scary, but... I'm tired of being alone all the time.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive step. What challenges do you anticipate?",
    "Client: The fear of rejection is still there. What if they don't like me? What if I make a fool of myself? But... I guess that's part of life, isn't it? You can't avoid all risks.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about facing those challenges?",
    "Client: Nervous, definitely. But also... kind of excited? It's been so long since I've allowed myself to hope for connections. It's like... like I'm waking up after a long sleep.",
    "Therapist: That's a beautiful analogy. What else has changed for you?",
    "Client: I've noticed I'm less jumpy lately. The nightmares aren't as frequent. And today, during the exposure... I felt more in control. Like I was observing the memory rather than reliving it. Is that progress?",
    "Therapist: It certainly can be. How do you feel about your progress?",
    "Client: Proud, I think. And grateful. There were times I didn't think I'd ever feel better. But here I am, talking about joining groups and making friends. It's... it's pretty amazing, actually.",
    "Therapist: Indeed. What would you like to focus on next?",
    "Client: I'd like to work on my self-esteem more. I still struggle with feeling worthy of love and friendship. And maybe... maybe we could talk about dating again? Not now, but... someday.",
    "Therapist: Those are great goals. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: I'm committed to it. It's hard, but it's worth it. I want to live, not just survive. And for the first time in a long time, I believe that's possible.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful. Is there anything else you'd like to share?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For helping me see that there's still hope. That I'm not defined by what happened to me. It means more than I can say.",
    "Therapist: You're very welcome. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I feel... lighter. Like I've set down a heavy burden. It's a good feeling to end on.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad. Take care, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. See you then."
