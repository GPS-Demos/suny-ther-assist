    "Therapist: Alright, Carlos. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the cyber bullying incident.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm scrolling through my social media feed, and suddenly I see these horrible comments about me. They're calling me names, saying I'm worthless because I still live with my parents. My heart starts racing, and I feel this tightness in my chest.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: Um, probably a 6 out of 10. It's uncomfortable, but manageable.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going.",
    "Client: As I read more comments, I start feeling sick to my stomach. They're bringing up my time in the military, saying I'm a coward for coming back home. My hands are shaking, and I'm struggling to breathe normally. I want to defend myself, but I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to an 8 now. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with it.",
    "Client: I... I see a comment from someone I thought was my friend. They're laughing at me, agreeing with the others. I feel so betrayed, so alone. My vision's getting blurry with tears. I'm remembering being in combat, feeling isolated and scared, but this feels worse somehow.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's a 9. I feel like I'm right back there, reading those comments for the first time.",
    "Therapist: That's intense. You're very brave for facing this.",
    "Client: Thanks... I'm trying. I remember closing the app, but the comments keep replaying in my head. I can't sleep that night, and I'm too ashamed to talk to anyone about it. I feel like a failure, like maybe they're right about me.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: Still a 9. My heart's pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I'm trying... The next day, I can barely get out of bed. I'm terrified to look at my phone. I feel so vulnerable, like everyone's judging me. It reminds me of being on high alert during patrols, but now the enemy is everywhere online.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 7, I think. Talking about it is helping a little.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Keep going.",
    "Client: I finally work up the courage to tell my parents. They're supportive, but I can see the worry in their eyes. It makes me feel guilty for burdening them. I spend the next few days barely eating, jumping at every notification on my phone.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's a 6 now. I'm starting to feel a bit more distant from the memory.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How does your body feel?",
    "Client: My shoulders are really tense, and I've got a knot in my stomach. But my breathing is a bit easier now.",
    "Therapist: Noted. Continue.",
    "Client: Over the next few weeks, I start to feel a little better. I block the bullies and set my accounts to private. But I still feel on edge, like I can't trust anyone online. It's affecting my job performance, and I'm withdrawing from my friends.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5. Remembering how I started to cope helps.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're making progress.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess I am. Looking back, I can see that those comments don't define me. My experiences in the military made me strong, not weak. And living with my parents while I get on my feet is nothing to be ashamed of.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My SUDS is down to a 3. I feel... lighter somehow. Like I'm starting to take back control.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's wrap up the exercise. Open your eyes when you're ready.",
    "Client: *opens eyes* Wow, that was intense. But I feel like I understand the experience better now.",
    "Therapist: You did very well. How do you feel?",
    "Client: Tired, but... kind of proud? I didn't think I could face that memory head-on like that.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. We'll end here for today."
