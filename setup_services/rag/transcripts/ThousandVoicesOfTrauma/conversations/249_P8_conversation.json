    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mr. Abadi?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Revisiting those memories of my time in the cult, it's like I'm right back there, you know? I can feel the weight of it all pressing down on me.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: It's a mix of emotions. There's this deep sadness, almost like a physical ache in my chest. I keep thinking about my late wife, how she would have been so disappointed to see me fall for their lies. But there's also this... this anger bubbling up. I'm angry at myself for being so naive, for letting them manipulate me like that.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a heat in my stomach, spreading up to my chest. My fists are clenched, and I notice my jaw is tight. I just want to... I don't know, punch something? But then I remember I'm 79, and that's not really an option anymore. [chuckles weakly]",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are accompanying these feelings?",
    "Client: I keep hearing their voices in my head, you know? The cult leaders. They'd say things like, \"Your family doesn't understand you, but we do. We're your real family now.\" And part of me still wants to believe it, even though I know it's all lies. It's... it's confusing. I feel so stupid for falling for it, especially at my age.",
    "Therapist: How does that confusion manifest for you?",
    "Client: It's like... like my mind is a tangled ball of yarn. I'm trying to unravel it, to make sense of everything, but the more I pull, the tighter it gets. I find myself questioning everything - my memories, my judgement, even my own identity. Who am I without the cult? I've spent so long defining myself by their rules and beliefs.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I... I feel this overwhelming sense of loss. Not just for my wife, but for the years I spent in the cult. I missed out on so much - my grandchildren growing up, my daughter's wedding. And now, living in this shared accommodation, it's like I'm starting from scratch at 79. It's terrifying, really.",
    "Therapist: How does that fear feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's like standing on the edge of a cliff. My heart is racing, and there's this tightness in my chest. I'm afraid of falling, of failing. But at the same time, there's a tiny part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe excited? Like maybe there's still a chance to rebuild, to reconnect with my family. Is that crazy?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. What does that excitement feel like?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a small warmth in my chest. A flicker of hope, I suppose. When I think about the possibility of seeing my grandchildren again, of hugging my daughter... it's like a ray of sunlight breaking through storm clouds. But then I remember all the hurt I've caused, and the warmth fades.",
    "Therapist: How do these conflicting emotions interact?",
    "Client: It's exhausting, really. One moment I'm hopeful, the next I'm drowning in guilt and shame. It's like being on an emotional rollercoaster. And physically, I feel drained. My shoulders are tense, my head aches. I just want to crawl into bed and sleep for days.",
    "Therapist: What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants reassurance, to be told that it's not too late to fix things. But another part feels like I don't deserve that comfort. I guess... I guess I need to know that it's okay to feel all these conflicting emotions. That I'm not going crazy.",
    "Therapist: It's absolutely okay. How does hearing that affect you?",
    "Client: It's... it's a relief, actually. Like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I've been holding onto this idea that I should have everything figured out by now, that at my age I shouldn't be struggling like this. But hearing you say it's okay... it makes me feel less alone. Less... broken, I suppose.",
    "Therapist: What else are you aware of now?",
    "Client: I'm noticing that my breathing has slowed down a bit. The tightness in my chest isn't as intense. And I'm... I'm realizing that maybe I've been too hard on myself. Yes, I made mistakes, big ones. But I'm here now, trying to make sense of it all, trying to heal. That has to count for something, right?",
    "Therapist: How does that realization sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... it's bittersweet. There's a sadness for all the time lost, but also a glimmer of hope. Maybe it's not too late to rebuild some of what I've lost. I'm thinking about my daughter now, wondering if she'd be open to talking. It's scary to think about reaching out, but... but maybe it's worth the risk.",
    "Therapist: What would taking that risk mean to you?",
    "Client: It would mean... it would mean facing my fears head-on. Admitting my mistakes, asking for forgiveness. It's terrifying, but also... liberating? Like maybe by confronting this, I can start to let go of some of the guilt I've been carrying. And maybe, just maybe, I can start to rebuild those connections I've lost.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, to be honest. Emotionally drained. But there's also this sense of... I don't know, clarity? Like the fog has lifted a bit. I still have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe there's a path forward. It's not going to be easy, but... but I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to work on strategies for reaching out to my family. Maybe... maybe we could role-play some conversations? I'm nervous about saying the wrong thing, but I know I need to take that first step. And... and I'd like to continue exploring these memories. It's painful, but I think it's helping me understand myself better.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling about ending our session today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I think. A bit raw, emotionally, but also... hopeful? Is that the right word? It's like I've opened a door I've been afraid to look behind for a long time. It's scary, but also... necessary. Thank you for guiding me through this. I... I appreciate your patience and understanding.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Mr. Abadi. Take care, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you, Doctor. I'll see you then."
