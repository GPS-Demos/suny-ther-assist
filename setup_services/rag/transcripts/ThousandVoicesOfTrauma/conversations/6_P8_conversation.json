    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's all a bit jumbled up in my head. The memories of the refugee camp, they're so vivid now. I can almost smell the dampness in the air, you know? It's like I'm right back there, huddled in that makeshift tent with my family. My heart's still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I think. No, not just fear... terror. I remember feeling so exposed, so vulnerable. Every noise made me jump. And there was this constant knot in my stomach, like something terrible was about to happen at any moment. Even now, I can feel that tightness creeping back.",
    "Therapist: Hmm. How does that fear manifest in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a heaviness in my chest. My shoulders are tense, and I notice I'm clenching my jaw. I keep wanting to look over my shoulder, you know? Like I need to be on guard. It's exhausting, really. And there's this... this deep sadness too. For everything we lost, everything we left behind.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts are accompanying these feelings?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"Why us? Why did this have to happen to my family?\" And then I feel guilty for even asking that because so many others suffered too. But then I remember the bullying afterwards, when we finally settled here, and I just... I feel so angry. Like we went through all of that only to face more cruelty. It's not fair.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to process. How are you coping with these emotions now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. Part of me wants to push it all away, to forget. But I know that's not healthy. I'm trying to breathe through it, like we've practiced. And reminding myself that I'm safe now, that those experiences are in the past. But sometimes, especially at night, it all feels so immediate, you know?",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What do you do when it feels immediate?",
    "Client: I... I try to ground myself. I look around my room, touch something familiar. Sometimes I call my daughter, just to hear her voice. It helps remind me that I'm here, now, not back there. But it's a struggle. There are days when the depression feels so heavy, and I wonder if I'll ever truly feel at peace.",
    "Therapist: How does revisiting these memories impact your day-to-day life?",
    "Client: It's... it's complicated. Some days, I feel stronger for having survived it all. I look at my life now, my job, my home, and I feel proud of how far I've come. But other days, it's like a dark cloud hanging over everything. I find myself snapping at coworkers over little things, or canceling plans because I just don't have the energy to face the world.",
    "Therapist: I see. What helps you on those difficult days?",
    "Client: Hmm... Sometimes, I go for a walk by the ocean. The vastness of it, the sound of the waves, it helps put things in perspective. And I've been trying to write more, just for myself. Getting the memories and feelings out on paper somehow makes them feel less overwhelming. Oh, and talking to other refugees. There's a support group I've been attending. It helps to know I'm not alone in this.",
    "Therapist: That's great. How do these coping strategies make you feel?",
    "Client: More... more in control, I suppose. Like I'm not just a victim of my past anymore. Don't get me wrong, there are still bad days. But overall, I feel like I'm slowly reclaiming my life. It's like... like I'm weaving all these difficult experiences into the fabric of who I am, rather than letting them define me entirely. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What's your biggest hope moving forward?",
    "Client: I... I want to feel at peace. To be able to remember without being overwhelmed. And I want to use my experiences to help others, especially young refugees who are struggling with bullying like I did. I think... I think that would give all this pain some meaning, you know? To turn it into something positive.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful goal. How do you feel about your progress so far?",
    "Client: It's... it's a journey, isn't it? Some days I feel like I've come so far, and other days it's like I'm right back at the beginning. But overall, I think I'm moving in the right direction. These sessions, they're hard, but they're helping me face things I've been avoiding for years. And that feels... it feels important. Necessary, even if it's painful.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad you feel that way. What's one thing you're proud of from today's session?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm proud that I didn't try to run away from the memories this time. In the past, I would have shut down, changed the subject. But today, I really tried to stay with the feelings, to examine them. It was scary, but... but I did it. And I'm still here, still breathing. That feels like progress, doesn't it?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How would you like to care for yourself for the rest of the day?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'll call my daughter when I get home. Her voice always grounds me. And maybe I'll write a bit, get some of these thoughts out on paper. Oh, and I promised myself I'd try that new recipe for fish curry. Cooking always helps me feel more... more present, I suppose. Connected to my culture in a positive way.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like wonderful self-care plans. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I... I don't think so. Just... thank you, I suppose. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel. And that... that means more than I can express.",
    "Therapist: You're very welcome. I'll see you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, I'll be here. Thank you again."
