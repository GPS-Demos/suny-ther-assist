    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the memory of police brutality you witnessed.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm at the park. It's a sunny day, but something feels off. I see a group of officers approaching a young man. He looks scared...",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what you see.",
    "Client: The officers are surrounding him now. One of them is yelling, but I can't make out the words. The young man is putting his hands up, trembling. I feel my heart racing...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: Suddenly, one officer tackles him to the ground. It's so violent... I hear the man cry out in pain. My stomach is churning now.",

    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Helpless. Angry. Scared. I should've done something, but I just stood there frozen.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's an 8. I can barely breathe...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I'm trying... The young man is crying out for help. Blood is trickling down his face. I feel like I'm going to throw up...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: People around me are shouting, some are filming. The officers look... almost gleeful. It's horrifying. My legs feel weak...",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. I can't... I can't do this...",
    "Therapist: You can. You're doing great. Keep breathing.",

    "Therapist: Good. You're doing well. Keep describing what you're experiencing.",
