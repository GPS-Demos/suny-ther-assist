    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like my whole body is buzzing. That memory of being in the field hospital, it's so vivid. I can still smell the antiseptic and hear the constant beeping of monitors. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's like I'm right back there, waiting to hear if I'll make it or not. My heart is racing, and I feel this tightness in my chest. It's hard to breathe normally.",
    "Therapist: And what thoughts are accompanying that fear?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"This isn't fair. I shouldn't be here.\" I was supposed to be helping others, not lying in a hospital bed myself. And then there's this voice in my head saying, \"You're going to die here, far from home.\" It's... it's terrifying.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you recall these thoughts?",
    "Client: My palms are sweaty, and I feel cold all over. There's this knot in my stomach that won't go away. It's like my body is preparing for the worst all over again. I can feel my shoulders tensing up, too.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I... I'm realizing how angry I am. Not just scared, but furious. Why did this happen to me? I volunteered to help, and instead, I ended up fighting for my own life. It feels so unjust, you know? And then I feel guilty for being angry when so many others had it worse.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt manifest for you?",
    "Client: It's like a heavy weight on my chest. I start second-guessing everything I did. Should I have been more careful? Did I let my team down? And then I think about the people I couldn't help because I was the one who needed help. It's a vicious cycle of guilt and self-doubt.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to remind myself that I survived. That I'm here now, safe. It's hard, but... maybe I need to give myself permission to feel all of this without judgment. To acknowledge that it was a traumatic experience and it's okay that it affected me so deeply.",
    "Therapist: How does giving yourself that permission feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a relief, actually. Like I can breathe a little easier. I've been holding onto this idea that I should be \"over it\" by now, you know? But allowing myself to really feel it, to admit how scared and angry and guilty I've been... it's like releasing a valve on all this pent-up pressure.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing as you allow yourself to feel?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much this experience has shaped me. Not just the fear and trauma, but the strength I found to keep going. There's a part of me that's proud I made it through, even though it was horrific. And I'm noticing a sense of connection to others who've been through similar experiences. It's like... I'm not alone in this.",
    "Therapist: How does that connection impact you?",
    "Client: It's... comforting, in a way. Knowing that others have walked this path and come out the other side. It makes me feel less isolated, less like there's something wrong with me for still struggling with this. And it gives me hope that I can continue to heal and grow from this experience.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a mix of emotions. There's still fear and sadness, but also a glimmer of hope. It's like I can see a path forward, even if it's not always clear. I'm remembering the resilience I found during that time, and I'm wondering if I can tap into that strength now, in my everyday life.",
    "Therapist: How might you do that?",
    "Client: I think... maybe by acknowledging my experiences more openly. Not hiding from them or trying to push them away. And perhaps by using what I've learned to help others, in whatever way I can. It's scary to think about, but also empowering in a way.",
    "Therapist: What does that empowerment feel like?",
    "Client: It feels... warm. Like a small flame in my chest. It's not erasing the fear or the pain, but it's giving me something to hold onto. A sense that I'm not just a victim of my circumstances, but someone who can use my experiences to grow and maybe even make a difference.",
    "Therapist: How does this relate to your broader recovery journey?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's showing me that recovery isn't about forgetting or \"getting over\" what happened. It's about integrating it into who I am now. Finding meaning in the pain, as difficult as that is. And recognizing that healing isn't linear - there will be good days and bad days, but I'm moving forward.",
    "Therapist: What's one thing you want to remember from this session?",
    "Client: I want to remember that it's okay to feel all of these emotions. That they're a natural response to what I've been through. And that by facing them, by really allowing myself to process this experience, I'm taking steps towards healing. It's not easy, but I'm doing it.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but in a good way. Like I've released something that's been bottled up for a long time. There's a calmness that wasn't there before. I'm still shaky, and I know these feelings will come and go, but right now, I feel... I feel like I can handle it. Like I'm not alone in this journey.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing so openly. Is there anything else you'd like to add?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For creating a space where I can explore all of this. It's not easy to revisit these memories, but I'm starting to see how important it is. I'm grateful for the opportunity to work through this, even when it's challenging. I feel like I'm slowly reclaiming parts of myself that I thought were lost.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible courage today. How would you like to close our session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to take a few deep breaths. To ground myself in the present and remind myself that I'm safe now. And maybe to set an intention for the week ahead - to be gentle with myself as I continue to process everything we've talked about today.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a wonderful way to end. Shall we do that together?",
    "Client: Yes, I'd like that. It feels good to not be alone in this moment. To know that someone else is witnessing this journey with me. Thank you.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Let's take those breaths together now."
