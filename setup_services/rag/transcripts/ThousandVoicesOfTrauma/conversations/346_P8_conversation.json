    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, John?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also kind of numb at the same time. You know? Like, I can still see the images so clearly, but it's like I'm watching them from far away. My heart's still pounding a bit.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What's most prominent for you right now?",
    "Client: The guilt, I think. It's always the guilt. Remembering how I left things with Sarah before deploying... God, I was such an idiot. I thought I was being strong, you know? Pushing her away to protect her. But now, after everything that happened over there, I realize I was just scared. And now she's gone, and I can't... I can't fix it.",
    "Therapist: You're noticing a lot of regret.",
    "Client: Yeah, regret. That's a good word for it. It's like this heavy weight in my chest. I keep thinking about all the things I should have said, should have done differently. And then my mind jumps to the guys I lost over there, and it's like... it's all mixed up together. The guilt about Sarah, the guilt about them. I feel like I failed everyone.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you're talking about this?",
    "Client: Tense. Really tense. My shoulders are up around my ears, and my jaw feels like it's locked. And there's this... this knot in my stomach. It's like I'm back there, you know? Back in that moment when I got the news about the ambush, and I knew... I just knew some of my guys didn't make it. And at the same time, I'm remembering the look on Sarah's face when I told her not to wait for me. It's all happening at once.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What do you notice now?",
    "Client: (Deep breath) I... I feel a little calmer. The knot in my stomach is still there, but it's not as tight. I'm starting to feel the chair under me again, you know? Like I'm coming back to the present. But there's still this... sadness. This deep, aching sadness.",
    "Therapist: You're reconnecting with the present. Good.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess so. It's just... it's hard, you know? Remembering all of that. I've spent so long trying not to think about it, trying to push it all down. But now that I'm facing it, it's like... it's like I'm grieving all over again. For my guys, for Sarah, for the person I used to be before all of this.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are coming up as you grieve?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"What if?\" What if I had told Sarah how I really felt? What if I had made different decisions that day of the ambush? What if I had been a better leader, a better partner? And then I catch myself, and I think, \"This is useless. You can't change the past.\" But I can't seem to stop the thoughts from coming.",
    "Therapist: How do those thoughts make you feel?",
    "Client: Frustrated. Angry at myself. But also... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful? Like, maybe if I can understand all of this, really process it, I can start to move forward. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. You're recognizing a potential for growth.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess I am. It's just... it's scary, you know? Facing all of this. Sometimes I wonder if it would be easier to just go back to numbing it all out. But then I remember how that was destroying me, destroying my relationships. I don't want to live like that anymore.",
    "Therapist: What do you want instead?",
    "Client: I want... I want peace, I guess. I want to be able to think about Sarah, about my guys, without feeling like I'm being torn apart inside. I want to be able to connect with people again without being terrified that I'm going to lose them. I want to feel like I deserve good things in my life.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful goal. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, honestly. But also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've put down a heavy backpack I've been carrying for years. It's still there, I can still see it, but I'm not actively carrying it right now. And that feels... it feels good. Scary, but good.",
    "Therapist: You've done some hard work today, John.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess I have. It's weird, you know? I never thought talking about this stuff could make a difference. I always figured I just had to tough it out, push through. But this... it's different. It's like I'm finally giving myself permission to feel all of this, to really look at it.",
    "Therapist: What's that permission like for you?",
    "Client: It's... liberating, I think. But also terrifying. It's like I've opened a door that I've kept locked for so long, and now I'm not sure what's going to come through it. But at the same time, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can handle whatever does come. Is that crazy?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It sounds like growth.",
    "Client: Growth. Yeah, I like that. It's painful, but... maybe it's necessary. Like, maybe this is how I start to rebuild myself, you know? Not ignoring the past, but learning how to carry it differently. Learning how to honor my guys, and the love I had with Sarah, without letting it destroy me.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight, John.",
    "Client: Thanks. I... I think I'm starting to see a way forward. It's not clear yet, and I know it's going to be hard work, but... for the first time in a long time, I feel like maybe there's hope. Like maybe I can find a way to live with all of this, instead of just surviving it.",
    "Therapist: That's a great place to end for today. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. Really, thank you. I know I've got a long way to go, but... I think I'm ready to keep working on this. To keep facing it. It's not easy, but... I think it's worth it."
