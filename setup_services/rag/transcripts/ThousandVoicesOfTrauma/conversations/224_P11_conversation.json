    "Therapist: How are you feeling after today's imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling a bit shaken up, to be honest. Reliving that workplace trauma, it brought back a lot of intense emotions. The fear, the helplessness... it all felt so real again. I could almost smell the smoke from the fire, hear the alarms blaring. It's like I was right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The overwhelming sense of panic. I remember feeling frozen, unable to move or think clearly. It's frustrating because I'm usually so composed at work, you know? But in that moment, all my training just... vanished. I felt like a complete failure.",
    "Therapist: How does that connect to your current experiences?",
    "Client: Well, I've noticed I'm still really jumpy at work. Any loud noise or sudden movement sets me off. I'm constantly on edge, waiting for something bad to happen. It's exhausting, and I feel like I can't perform my job as well as I used to.",
    "Therapist: What insights did you gain from this exercise?",
    "Client: I... I think I realized that I've been avoiding thinking about the incident entirely. But going through it again, I can see that maybe... maybe it wasn't entirely my fault? I mean, nobody could have predicted that situation. I'm starting to wonder if I've been too hard on myself.",
    "Therapist: That's a valuable observation. How does it feel to consider that perspective?",
    "Client: It's... relieving, actually. Like a weight lifting off my shoulders. But also a bit scary? I've been holding onto this guilt for so long, it almost feels wrong to let it go. But I can see how it might be healthier in the long run.",
    "Therapist: What strategies might help you moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I need to work on self-compassion? And perhaps some relaxation techniques for when I'm at work? Oh, and I've been thinking about talking to HR about implementing better emergency training. That could help me feel more in control, and maybe help others too.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like positive steps. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: I'm... cautiously optimistic? It's tough, reliving these memories. But I can see how it's helping me process things. I feel like I'm starting to understand my reactions better, and that gives me hope. It's hard work, but... I think I'm ready to keep going.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is commendable. What else is on your mind?",
    "Client: I've been thinking about how this trauma has affected my personal life too. I've been isolating myself, avoiding social situations. It's like I'm afraid something bad will happen if I let my guard down. But going through this process, I'm starting to see how that's not really living, you know? I want to start reconnecting with friends, maybe even consider dating again. It's scary, but I think it's important for my recovery.",
    "Therapist: How might you approach that?",
    "Client: Um, maybe I could start small? Like, invite a friend over for coffee instead of going out. Or join an online support group for trauma survivors. Baby steps, I guess. And I could use some of the coping strategies we've discussed to manage my anxiety in social situations.",
    "Therapist: That sounds thoughtful. Any other reflections?",
    "Client: Yeah, I... I've been having this recurring nightmare about the incident. But today, during the imaginal exposure, I noticed some details that weren't actually part of the real event. It's like my mind has been exaggerating certain aspects. Realizing that... it makes the memory seem less overwhelming somehow. Like, maybe I can start to separate what really happened from what my fears have added to it.",
    "Therapist: How might that realization help you?",
    "Client: I think... it gives me some power back? If I can recognize what's real and what's not, maybe I can start challenging some of these intrusive thoughts and memories. It's not going to be easy, but it feels like a step in the right direction. And it makes me curious about what other distortions I might uncover as we continue this process.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful perspective. Anything else you'd like to share?",
    "Client: I... I just want to say thank you. This process is tough, and there are times when I've wanted to give up. But I feel like I'm making progress, even if it's slow. And having someone to guide me through this, someone who understands... it means a lot. I know we have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel hopeful about the future.",
    "Therapist: Your resilience is admirable. How would you like to proceed?",
    "Client: I think I want to keep going with the imaginal exposures. They're difficult, but I can see how they're helping. And maybe we could spend some time discussing strategies for managing my anxiety at work? I'd like to feel more confident in my ability to handle stressful situations. Oh, and if you have any resources on self-compassion, I'd be really interested in those. I'm starting to see how important that is in this whole process."
