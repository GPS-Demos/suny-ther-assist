    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. The memories of that earthquake, they just came flooding back. I could almost feel the ground shaking beneath me again. It's like I was right back there in that moment, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The noise. God, the noise. It was deafening. I remember thinking the whole world was coming apart. And then there was this eerie silence right after, before people started screaming. I... I can still hear those screams sometimes.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... hard. Really hard. My heart was racing, and I felt that same panic rising in my chest. But... I don't know, maybe it wasn't quite as bad as I thought it would be? I mean, I got through it, right?",
    "Therapist: You did. How do you think this relates to your day-to-day experiences?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... I've been avoiding anything that reminds me of earthquakes. Even small vibrations, like a truck passing by, can set me off. But going through this memory, as awful as it was, maybe shows me that I can face these fears? I'm not sure.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. What else?",
    "Client: I realized how much this fear has been controlling my life. I've been using alcohol to numb myself, to avoid dealing with these memories. But facing it head-on like this... it's terrifying, but also kind of... empowering? Is that weird to say?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. Can you elaborate on that feeling?",
    "Client: It's like... for the first time in years, I feel like I have some control. The memory doesn't have to be this big, scary monster lurking in the shadows. It's just a memory. A terrible one, sure, but just a memory. And I survived it once, I can survive remembering it too.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How might this impact your recovery?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I don't need to rely on alcohol so much? If I can face this memory sober, maybe I can face other things too. And maybe, just maybe, I can start to rebuild my life. Go back to school, make some friends... live again, you know?",
    "Therapist: Those sound like meaningful goals. What's one small step you could take?",
    "Client: Hmm... Maybe I could try to reduce my drinking, just a little. And... maybe I could look into some support groups? For both the trauma and the alcohol. I've always been scared to do that before, but now... I don't know, it doesn't seem quite so impossible.",
    "Therapist: That's great. How are you feeling about continuing with these exposures?",
    "Client: Honestly? Terrified. But also... hopeful? I never thought I'd say that. It's going to be hard, I know that. But for the first time in a long time, I feel like maybe, just maybe, there's a light at the end of this very long, very dark tunnel.",
    "Therapist: That's a beautiful way to put it. What else?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm starting to understand why we're doing this. It's not just about reliving the trauma, it's about... processing it? Learning that I can face it and come out the other side. And each time we do this, it gets a tiny bit easier. Not easy, but... easier.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. How does that make you feel about your progress?",
    "Client: Proud, I guess? And surprised. I didn't think I had it in me to face this. But I did. I am. And yeah, I'm scared about doing it again, but I'm also... kind of looking forward to it? Is that crazy?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It shows growth. Anything else you'd like to share?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For guiding me through this. For believing I could do it when I didn't believe in myself. I know we have a long way to go, but... I think I'm ready to keep going. To see where this path leads.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. You've done great work today."
