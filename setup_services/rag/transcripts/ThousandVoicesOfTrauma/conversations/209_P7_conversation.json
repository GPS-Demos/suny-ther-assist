    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the scene?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in my old neighborhood. It's a warm evening, and I'm walking home from work. The streets are mostly empty, but I can hear distant traffic. I'm feeling uneasy because it's getting dark.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: As I turn the corner onto my street, I see two men arguing loudly in front of a house. One of them is holding something... I think it's a bottle. My heart starts racing, and I slow down, not sure if I should keep going.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: The argument gets more heated. Suddenly, one man swings the bottle at the other. There's a sickening crack as it connects with his head. I freeze, unable to move or look away. The victim stumbles and falls to the ground.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I want to help, but I'm terrified. The attacker looks around, and for a moment, our eyes meet. I feel like I can't breathe. He starts walking towards me, and I... I just run. I run as fast as I can, not looking back.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel scared. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I make it to my apartment and lock the door. My hands are shaking so badly I can barely turn the key. I slide down against the door, gasping for air. I feel so ashamed for not helping, for running away. But I was so scared...",
    "Therapist: You handled a terrifying situation. What are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... guilty. And angry. Why did I have to see that? Why couldn't I do something? I keep replaying it in my mind, wondering if the man who was hit is okay. I feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to have those feelings. Continue.",
    "Client: For weeks after, I couldn't sleep well. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that man's face, the bottle swinging. I started drinking more to numb myself. I was jumpy all the time, always looking over my shoulder. I felt like I couldn't trust anyone anymore.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How did this affect your daily life?",
    "Client: It changed everything. I couldn't focus at work. I started taking different routes home, even if it meant a longer walk. I stopped going out in the evenings altogether. The guilt... it ate at me. I felt like a coward, like I failed some kind of test of character.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're not there now. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I know, but sometimes it feels so real... Like it's happening all over again. I can still hear the sound of that bottle hitting his head. It haunts me. I wonder if I'll ever feel normal again, you know? Like I can walk down the street without constantly being on edge.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Keep going.",
    "Client: The worst part is, I never found out what happened to that man. Did he survive? Was he okay? Not knowing... it's like this constant weight on my conscience. I've thought about trying to find out, but I'm scared of what I might learn. And I'm ashamed to admit it, but part of me hopes I never do find out. Is that terrible of me?",
    "Therapist: There's no right or wrong way to feel. What else comes to mind?",
    "Client: I think about how it's affected my relationships. I push people away because I don't want them to see how messed up I am inside. I feel like I'm carrying this secret, this burden. And the drinking... it's become a crutch. I know it's not healthy, but sometimes it feels like the only way to quiet the memories.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Talking about it... it's hard, but there's a small part of me that feels relieved. Like maybe I'm not crazy for still being affected by this after all this time. But I'm also exhausted. Reliving it, even just in my mind, it takes so much out of me. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a tiny bit lighter? Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: It's a common response. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I need a moment. This is intense. Can we take a short break?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's pause here."
