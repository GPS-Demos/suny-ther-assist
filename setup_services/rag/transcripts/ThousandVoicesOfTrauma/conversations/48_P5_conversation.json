    "Therapist: Hello, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Thompson. I'm... I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. I know we've been working towards this, but now that we're here, I'm not sure I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... I've spent so long trying not to think about my time in the military. The idea of purposely bringing those memories back feels terrifying. What if I can't handle it? What if it makes everything worse?",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. How about we discuss the process?",
    "Client: Okay, I guess that might help. It's just... I've worked so hard to build a life after my service. I finally have a good job, I'm reconnecting with my parents. I'm worried this will undo all of that progress.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your openness. Shall we explore how this exercise can actually help maintain that progress?",
    "Client: Alright, I'm listening. But I have to admit, I'm still skeptical. How can reliving those traumatic experiences possibly be good for me?",
    "Therapist: The exposure helps process memories, reducing their power over you. What are your thoughts on that?",
    "Client: I understand the concept, but it's hard to believe. These memories have controlled my life for so long. The nightmares, the flashbacks, the constant anxiety... it's exhausting. If this could really help, I'd do anything. But I'm scared, Dr. Thompson. What if I fall apart during the session?",
    "Therapist: Your strength has brought you this far. How can I support you during this process?",
    "Client: I appreciate that, Doctor. I guess... maybe if we could have a signal or something? If it gets too intense and I need a break? And... could you remind me where I am if I start to get too lost in the memory? I'm worried about completely losing touch with reality.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll use a hand signal and grounding techniques. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That sounds good. It makes me feel a bit safer knowing we have a plan. I'm still nervous, but I trust you, Dr. Thompson. You've helped me come so far already. I just hope this works. I'm so tired of living in fear, of letting my past control my present.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable, Sarah. Shall we begin with a breathing exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, please. That would be helpful. I can feel my heart racing already. It's amazing how just talking about this brings up so many emotions. I'm realizing now how much I've been avoiding even thinking about my experiences. Maybe this exposure therapy is more necessary than I thought.",
    "Therapist: That's insightful, Sarah. Let's start with slow, deep breaths. Ready?",
    "Client: Okay, I'm ready. [Takes a deep breath] You know, as scared as I am, there's a part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe hopeful? Like maybe after this, I'll finally be able to talk to my parents about what I went through. They've been so patient with me, but I know they don't really understand. Maybe this will help me find the words.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive outlook. How about we focus on your breath now?",
    "Client: You're right, I'm getting ahead of myself. Okay, focusing on my breath. In... and out. In... and out. I can do this. We can do this. Thank you for being here with me, Dr. Thompson. I don't think I could face this alone.",
    "Therapist: You're not alone, Sarah. Let's continue breathing, then we'll start slowly."
