    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving that hostage situation in the hospital... it's bringing back so many emotions I've tried to bury for years.",
    "Therapist: What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The fear. The absolute terror of not knowing if I'd make it out alive. I remember the cold metal of the scalpel against my neck, and the smell of antiseptic mixed with sweat. It's like... like I was there again, you know?",
    "Therapist: How did your body react during the memory?",
    "Client: My heart was racing, and I felt this tightness in my chest. My hands were shaking, and I started to sweat. It's funny, I didn't even realize I was holding my breath until you asked me to breathe deeply.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts went through your mind?",
    "Client: I kept thinking, \"This can't be happening. Not here, not in a hospital.\" I've always seen hospitals as safe places, you know? But ever since that day... it's like nowhere feels safe anymore. I was also angry at myself for not being able to do anything, for being so helpless.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your daily life now?",
    "Client: I... I guess it explains why I've been avoiding medical check-ups. Even the thought of stepping into a clinic makes me anxious. And that feeling of helplessness? It's followed me everywhere. I find myself constantly on edge, always looking for potential threats.",
    "Therapist: What did you learn about yourself today?",
    "Client: (long pause) I realized I'm stronger than I thought. Reliving that memory was terrifying, but I did it. And... and maybe, just maybe, I can start to face these fears head-on instead of running from them.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about continuing this process?",
    "Client: It's scary, no doubt about that. But there's also a glimmer of hope? Like, maybe if I keep doing this, I can reclaim the parts of my life that I've lost to this fear. I want to be able to go to the doctor without having a panic attack. I want to feel safe again.",
    "Therapist: What strategies might help you moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe practicing those breathing exercises you taught me? They seemed to help a bit during the exposure. And perhaps... perhaps talking to my family about this? I've kept it bottled up for so long, but maybe sharing might help?",
    "Therapist: How can we build on today's progress?",
    "Client: Well, um, maybe we could work on gradually exposing me to hospital-related things? Like, starting with pictures, then maybe driving by a hospital? And... and I think I need to keep reminding myself that I survived. That I'm here, I'm safe, and I'm working on getting better.",
    "Therapist: What's one thing you're proud of from today's session?",
    "Client: (voice breaking slightly) I'm proud that I didn't run away. In the past, I've always tried to avoid anything that reminded me of that day. But today, I faced it. It wasn't easy, but I did it. And that... that feels like a small victory."
