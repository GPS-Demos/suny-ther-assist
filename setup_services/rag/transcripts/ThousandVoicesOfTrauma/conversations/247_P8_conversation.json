    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. It's like I'm back there, you know? My heart's still racing a bit, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's strange how vivid it all becomes when I close my eyes and really let myself remember.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What's the most prominent emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I think. No, not just fear... it's more like terror. When I think about that moment in the hospital, when the doctor told me about the complication during my surgery, it's like the world just... stops. I can still hear the beeping of the machines, smell that antiseptic hospital smell. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: And physically, where do you feel that terror in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's in my chest, definitely. Like a heavy weight pressing down. And my hands are trembling a bit. I notice I'm clenching my jaw too. It's like my body is preparing for something terrible to happen, even though I'm safe here.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"What if it happens again?\" I know it's not rational, but I can't shake this feeling that I'm not safe, that my body might betray me at any moment. And then... then I think about how this fear has changed me. I used to be so active, you know? Now I'm afraid to even go for a walk sometimes.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization make you feel?",
    "Client: Angry. Frustrated. I... I feel like I've lost a part of myself. And then I feel guilty for feeling angry because I know I should be grateful I survived. It's this constant internal battle.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have mixed feelings. Can you tell me more about that internal battle?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... on one hand, I'm so thankful to be alive. I have my family, my grandchildren. But on the other hand, I'm angry that this happened to me. I'm angry that I can't just move on and enjoy my retirement like I planned. And then I feel ashamed for being angry, because I know others have it worse. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings relate to your experiences with cyberbullying?",
    "Client: Oh, that's... that's another layer of fear and frustration. After my surgery, I joined an online support group. I thought it would help, you know? But then there was this person who kept posting horrible things, saying people like me were a drain on the healthcare system. It brought back all those feelings of vulnerability from the hospital. I felt attacked, exposed... like I couldn't even find safety in my own home.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. How did you cope with that?",
    "Client: At first, I didn't. I withdrew completely. Stopped going online, stopped talking to friends. It was like the trauma from the hospital all over again. But then... then I remembered what we've been working on here. I tried to face it, bit by bit. I told my daughter what was happening, and she helped me report the bully. It was hard, but I felt a little stronger after that.",
    "Therapist: What does that strength feel like?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a tiny spark. Not a roaring fire, mind you, but a small, persistent light. When I focus on it, I feel a bit of warmth in my chest, replacing some of that heaviness. It reminds me that I'm not just a victim, that I can take steps to protect myself.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful image. How can we nurture that spark?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe by continuing to face these memories, as hard as it is? And perhaps by reconnecting with some of the positive aspects of my life that I've been avoiding. My granddaughter's been asking me to teach her how to knit. Maybe I could start there.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a wonderful idea. How do you feel about that possibility?",
    "Client: It makes me feel... hopeful, I suppose. A bit nervous too. But mostly, I feel a sense of... I don't know, maybe determination? Like I'm ready to try reclaiming some parts of my life. It won't be easy, I know that. But sitting here, talking about it... I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can do this.",
    "Therapist: That's great. What's your biggest takeaway from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's that I'm stronger than I realized. Yes, the memories are still terrifying. The cyberbullying still hurts. But I'm here, I'm talking about it, and I'm even making plans for the future. That's... that's something, isn't it? It feels like a small step, but an important one.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How would you like to end our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to sit quietly for a moment, if that's okay. Just to let everything settle. And maybe... maybe to focus on that little spark of strength for a bit. Is that alright?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take all the time you need."
