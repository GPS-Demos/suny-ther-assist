    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit anxious, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about the home invasion again, and it's making me nervous.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'll try to keep that in mind. Where should I start?",
    "Therapist: Begin with the moment you first realized something was wrong.",
    "Client: Okay... It was late at night, around 11 PM. I was in bed, reading a book. Suddenly, I heard a loud crash downstairs. At first, I thought maybe I'd left a window open and something had fallen, but then I heard footsteps. My heart started racing immediately.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: I froze for a moment, unsure of what to do. Then I heard another noise, like someone bumping into furniture. I realized it wasn't just my imagination - someone was actually in the house. I felt panic rising in my chest, and my hands started shaking.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe now.",
    "Client: It's hard to go back there... I remember feeling so helpless. I reached for my phone, but my hands were shaking so much I could barely dial 911. I was trying to be quiet, but I was breathing so heavily I was sure they could hear me.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Keep going.",
    "Client: As I was on the phone with the dispatcher, I heard footsteps coming up the stairs. My whole body went cold. I wanted to run, but I was paralyzed with fear. The dispatcher was telling me to stay on the line, but all I could think was that I was going to die.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The footsteps were getting closer, and I could hear them trying doorknobs along the hallway. I was silently praying they wouldn't come into my room. I felt so vulnerable, like a child hiding under the covers. When they tried my doorknob, I thought my heart would stop.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: The door opened, and I saw a figure in the doorway. It was dark, but I could make out that it was a man. He had a mask on, and... and... I'm sorry, I can't... This is too much.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (Taking a deep breath) Okay... The man saw me and rushed towards the bed. I screamed, louder than I've ever screamed in my life. He grabbed me, and I fought back, kicking and hitting as hard as I could. I could smell alcohol on his breath, and it made me feel sick.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Thank you... As we struggled, I heard sirens in the distance. The man must have heard them too because he suddenly let go of me and ran out of the room. I was sobbing uncontrollably, my whole body shaking. I couldn't move, even though I knew I should try to lock the door or hide.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. You're doing well.",
    "Client: The next few minutes felt like hours. I could hear the man ransacking other rooms, and I was terrified he'd come back. When I finally heard the police enter the house, I felt a wave of relief so strong it was almost painful. But even after they caught him, I couldn't stop shaking. I felt so violated, so vulnerable in my own home.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible resilience. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, mostly. And a bit shaky. But also... I don't know, maybe a little proud? I've never been able to talk about it in this much detail before.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant achievement. Well done, Sarah.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard, but I think it's getting a little easier each time we do this.",
    "Therapist: That's often the case. Shall we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. Thank you for your support.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care of yourself this week."
