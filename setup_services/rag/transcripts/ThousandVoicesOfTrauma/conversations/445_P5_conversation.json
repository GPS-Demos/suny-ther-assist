    "Therapist: Welcome back. Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: I'm... not sure. To be honest, I'm a bit nervous. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of reliving those workplace experiences makes me feel uneasy. Can you tell me more about what to expect?",
    "Therapist: Of course. It's normal to feel nervous. What concerns you most?",
    "Client: I guess I'm worried about losing control of my emotions. At work, I always have to maintain this professional facade, you know? The thought of breaking down here... it's scary. Plus, I'm not sure how revisiting these memories will help. Won't it just make things worse?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How do you typically handle difficult emotions?",
    "Client: I try to push them down, keep busy. But lately, that hasn't been working so well. The depression's been getting worse, and I find myself snapping at my family more often. It's like I'm always on edge, waiting for the next bad thing to happen at work. I don't want to bring that tension home, but it's hard not to.",
    "Therapist: I understand. This exercise aims to help process those emotions. Ready to learn more?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I mean, I trust you, and I know I need to do something different. My spouse has been really supportive, but I can tell they're worried about me too. So, what exactly will we be doing?",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit the workplace trauma memory. You'll describe it in detail, present tense. I'll guide you through.",
    "Client: Okay... that sounds intense. Will you stop me if it gets too much? And what if I can't remember everything clearly? Some parts of those days are a bit fuzzy.",
    "Therapist: Yes, we can pause anytime. It's okay if details are unclear. Just share what you remember.",
    "Client: Alright. I appreciate that. I'm still nervous, but I'm trying to remind myself that this is a safe space. It's just... at work, as a Black professional, I always feel like I have to be twice as good, you know? Showing vulnerability feels risky.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. This space is for you to process safely. How can I support you best?",
    "Client: Maybe... could you remind me that I'm here in the present if I start to get too caught up in the memory? And perhaps we could have a code word if I need a break? Would that be okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What word would you like to use?",
    "Client: How about \"pause\"? Simple, but not something I'd say in describing the memory.",
    "Therapist: \"Pause\" it is. Anything else you'd like to know before we begin?",
    "Client: I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Just... thank you for being patient with me. This isn't easy, but I'm trying to remember that it's part of getting better. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage. Shall we start?",
    "Client: Yes, let's start. I'm taking a deep breath... okay, I'm ready."
