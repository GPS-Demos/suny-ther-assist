    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Johnson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Oh, hello Dr. Evans. I'm... well, I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been thinking about this session all week. You mentioned last time we'd be doing something called imaginal exposure? It sounds a bit daunting.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... I've spent so long trying not to think about what happened. The idea of purposely bringing it all up again... it's frightening. I'm worried I might fall apart or have one of those awful panic attacks. And at my age, I'm not sure how much more stress I can handle. My husband's been so worried about me lately.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How do you feel about trying it?",
    "Client: I suppose I'm willing to give it a try. I trust you, Dr. Evans, and I know you wouldn't suggest something if you didn't think it would help. But could you explain a bit more about what we'll be doing? I'm afraid my imagination is running wild with possibilities.",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll revisit the traumatic memory in a safe environment.",
    "Client: Revisit the memory? You mean... you want me to actually talk about what happened that day? With the police and everything? I... I'm not sure I can do that. Just thinking about it makes my heart race.",
    "Therapist: Yes, but at your own pace. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: I appreciate that, Dr. Evans. It's just... it's been so long since I've allowed myself to really think about it. That day changed everything for me. I went from being an active, independent woman to... well, to someone who's afraid of her own shadow. It's embarrassing, really.",
    "Therapist: There's no shame in your reactions. This process helps heal.",
    "Client: I hope you're right. I'm tired of feeling this way. My grandchildren keep asking why I won't go to the park with them anymore. I hate disappointing them, but ever since that day... well, you know. So, what exactly will we be doing in this imaginal exposure?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the event in detail. I'll guide you through it.",
    "Client: In detail? Oh my... that sounds intense. Will it be like reliving it all over again? I'm not sure I can handle that. What if I get too upset?",
    "Therapist: It may be intense, but I'll be here to support you throughout.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I do trust you, Dr. Evans. You've been so patient with me these past months. I just... I want to get better, to feel like myself again. If this will help, then I suppose I need to try. But... what if I can't remember everything clearly?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. We'll work with what you remember. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. Yes, I'm ready. Just promise me you won't let me get too overwhelmed, okay? And if I need to stop, we can stop, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're in control. Shall we start?",
    "Client: Alright, Dr. Evans. I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Let's do this. For my grandchildren, if nothing else. They deserve to have their grandmother back."
