    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is still racing, you know? That memory of the animal attack during my deployment... it just feels so vivid right now. My heart's still pounding a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sounds, definitely. The growling, the screams of my fellow soldiers... it's like I was right back there in that moment. I could almost smell the dust and feel the heat. It's weird how your mind can take you back like that, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: Indeed. How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. Scary, but also... I don't know, maybe a little empowering? Like, I survived that, you know? But mostly, I felt helpless again. Like I couldn't do anything to stop it from happening.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does that connect to your everyday experiences?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... I often feel that way in my daily life too. Like I'm not in control. Especially when I'm having a bad day with my depression. It's like I'm frozen, waiting for the next \"attack,\" even though I know logically that I'm safe now.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful connection. What else?",
    "Client: Um, I noticed that during the memory, I kept thinking about how I should have done things differently. Like, maybe if I had been more alert, or if I had reacted faster... But then I remember you saying that hindsight is 20/20, and I'm trying not to beat myself up over it.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How might this insight help you moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I can try to be a little kinder to myself? Like, when I start having those thoughts of what I should have done, I can remind myself that I did the best I could in that situation. And maybe that applies to other areas of my life too, you know?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What else did you learn from today's session?",
    "Client: I realized that even though it's painful to revisit these memories, it's also... I don't know, kind of freeing? Like, each time we do this, it gets a tiny bit easier to talk about. It's still hard, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming as it did in the beginning.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: I'm... nervous, but I think I want to keep going. It's tough, but I can see how it might help in the long run. Plus, I feel like I can trust you, which makes it a bit easier. Is that normal? To feel like you're making progress but still be scared?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. It's a common experience. What else?",
    "Client: I guess I'm also realizing how much this has affected my relationships. Like, I've been pushing people away because I'm afraid of feeling vulnerable. But maybe... maybe I need to let people in a little more. It's just hard, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a valuable insight. How might you act on that?",
    "Client: Maybe I could... I don't know, reach out to an old friend? Just for coffee or something. Baby steps, right? And maybe try to open up a little bit about what I'm going through. Not everything, but... something.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great idea. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... tired, but also kind of relieved? Like I've put down a heavy backpack I've been carrying for a while. It's nice to talk about this stuff and not feel judged. And even though it's hard, I feel like I'm making progress. Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a positive sign. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I guess. For listening and for pushing me to face this stuff. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe there's hope, you know? Like maybe I can get through this and have a normal life again. It's scary, but also kind of exciting.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm pretty drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Same time next week?",
    "Therapist: Sounds good. Take care, and remember to use your coping strategies.",
    "Client: Will do. Thanks again, doc. See you next week."
