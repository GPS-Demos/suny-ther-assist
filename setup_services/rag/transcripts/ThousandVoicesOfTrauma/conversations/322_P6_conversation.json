    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Take a deep breath and start when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in Afghanistan. It's a hot day, and I'm on patrol with my unit. The sun is beating down, and I can feel sweat trickling down my back. We're walking through a small village, and everything seems quiet... too quiet. Suddenly, I hear a growl from an alleyway. Before I can react, a huge dog lunges at me. Its teeth are bared, and its eyes are wild...",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Um, about a 6 right now. My heart is starting to race just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Keep going. You're doing well.",
    "Client: The dog's jaws clamp onto my arm, and I can feel its teeth tearing through my uniform. I'm screaming, trying to shake it off, but it won't let go. My squadmates are yelling, but their voices sound distant. All I can focus on is the searing pain and the dog's growls. I'm terrified it's going to go for my throat next...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to an 8. My palms are sweating, and I feel like I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: I manage to pull out my knife with my free hand. I don't want to hurt the dog, but I'm panicking. I stab at it, and it finally releases my arm. There's blood everywhere - mine and the dog's. I fall to the ground, clutching my arm. The dog runs off, whimpering. My squadmates rush to me, but I can barely hear them over the ringing in my ears. I feel dizzy, and the world starts to spin...",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. My chest feels tight, and I'm shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here with me, safe in my office.",
    "Client: Right... I'm trying to focus on that. In the memory, they're calling for a medic. I'm going into shock, I think. The pain is intense, but it's starting to feel distant. I'm scared I might lose my arm, or that the dog might come back. Everything feels hazy and surreal...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's still at a 9. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're processing the memory. Keep going.",
    "Client: The medic arrives and starts working on my arm. I can hear him saying something about major blood loss. They're preparing to evacuate me. I'm fading in and out of consciousness. The last thing I remember is being lifted onto a stretcher, the hot sun on my face, and the distant sound of helicopters...",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down a bit. Maybe an 8 now. I feel drained.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Exhausted. My heart is still racing, but I feel... I don't know, maybe a little relieved? Like I've let something out that I've been holding onto for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. You've shown great courage today.",
    "Client: Thanks. It was tough, but I'm glad I did it. I didn't think I could face that memory head-on like that.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end.",
    "Client: Okay. *deep breath* I think I'm starting to feel a bit calmer now.",
    "Therapist: Good. We'll process this more next session. How are you feeling about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's scary, but... I think it's helping. I want to keep going.",
    "Therapist: That's great. We'll take it one step at a time."
