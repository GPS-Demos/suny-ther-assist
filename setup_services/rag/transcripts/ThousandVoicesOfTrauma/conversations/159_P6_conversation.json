    "Therapist: Alright, Carlos, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's begin. Close your eyes and describe the car accident.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm driving home from work. It's late, around 9 PM. The road is dark, and I'm tired. I see headlights in my rearview mirror, coming up fast. My heart starts racing. The car behind me is swerving... it's getting closer... I grip the steering wheel tighter...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, about a 5... The memory is clear, but I'm not too distressed yet.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue.",
    "Client: The car behind me suddenly veers into my lane. I try to swerve, but it's too late. There's a loud crash, and I feel my car spinning. Glass is shattering... I can smell burning rubber... My body is being thrown around... I can't control anything...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to a 7. My palms are sweating, and my heart is pounding.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The car finally stops spinning. Everything is quiet for a moment. Then I hear people shouting. I'm disoriented... there's a sharp pain in my chest. I try to move, but I'm stuck. I smell gasoline... I'm terrified the car might explode. I start panicking, trying to get out, but my seatbelt is jammed...",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. I feel like I can't breathe... just like I did then...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Carlos. You're safe here. Keep describing what happened.",
    "Client: I... I hear sirens in the distance. Someone is at my window, telling me help is coming. But I can't focus on their words. The pain is getting worse. I'm going in and out of consciousness. I keep thinking about my wife, my kids... will I see them again? Then everything goes black...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's still at a 9. My chest feels tight, and I'm shaking.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You're doing great. Let's continue.",
    "Client: I wake up in the hospital. The lights are too bright. There are tubes and wires everywhere. I try to speak, but there's something in my throat. I can't move. I'm in so much pain... I feel helpless, trapped... just like in the car...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",

    "Client: Okay... yeah, I think I'm ready to stop. Thank you... this was hard, but I feel... I don't know, maybe a little lighter?",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted, but... okay. My heart rate is slowing down. I feel more in control.",
