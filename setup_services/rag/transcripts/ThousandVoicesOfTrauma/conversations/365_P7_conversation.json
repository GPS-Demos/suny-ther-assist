    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Can you describe the natural disaster experience you mentioned?",
    "Client: Okay... It was about three years ago when a severe earthquake hit our city. I was at work in my office on the 15th floor of a high-rise building. At first, I felt a slight tremor, but within seconds, it intensified. The whole building started swaying, and I could hear the creaking of steel and concrete. Papers were flying off desks, and people around me started screaming. I froze in my chair, unable to move.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The shaking seemed to last forever. I could see cracks forming on the walls, and chunks of ceiling were falling down. I finally managed to get under my desk, but I was terrified that the entire building would collapse. The power went out, and we were in darkness. I could hear glass shattering and people crying out for help. I... I thought I was going to die right there.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Continue.",
    "Client: After what felt like an eternity, the shaking stopped. But I was too scared to move. I could hear sirens outside and people shouting. Someone from our floor's emergency team came around with a flashlight, telling us to evacuate. My legs were shaking so badly, I could barely stand. As we made our way down the emergency stairwell, I kept thinking aftershocks could hit at any moment. The stairwell was dark, and I could smell dust and smoke. I was sweating profusely and my heart was racing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: When we finally got outside, it was chaos. There were injured people everywhere, buildings with shattered windows, and debris all over the streets. I couldn't get in touch with my family because cell networks were down. I spent hours wandering the streets, trying to find a way home, all the while fearing another quake could hit. When I finally reached home and found my family safe, I broke down completely. For weeks after, I couldn't sleep properly. Every little sound or vibration would send me into a panic. I... I still have nightmares about being trapped in that building.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The worst part is the lingering fear. I can't go into tall buildings anymore without feeling anxious. I've had to change jobs because I can't work in high-rise offices. Every time there's a small tremor or even a truck passing by that shakes the ground a little, I feel that same terror all over again. It's like I'm constantly on edge, waiting for the next big earthquake to hit. I feel so helpless and out of control.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I feel guilty too. So many people lost their lives or loved ones in that earthquake, and here I am, physically unharmed but still struggling. Sometimes I wonder if I'm overreacting or if I should just \"get over it.\" But I can't seem to shake off this fear. It's affecting my relationships too. My ex-wife couldn't understand why I was so paranoid all the time. It played a part in our divorce. I feel like that earthquake not only shook the ground but my entire life.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Continue.",
    "Client: I've tried to cope in different ways. I've become obsessed with emergency preparedness, always having a \"go-bag\" ready. I constantly check weather and geological reports. It's exhausting living like this, always on high alert. I miss the person I used to be before the earthquake - carefree, ambitious, not afraid of the world around me. Now, I feel like I'm just... surviving, not really living. I want to move past this, but I don't know how. Every time I think I'm making progress, something triggers the memories, and I'm right back in that terrifying moment.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage. Let's continue.",
    "Client: The thing is, I know rationally that earthquakes are rare and that buildings are designed to withstand them. But emotionally, I can't seem to convince myself of that. It's like my body and mind are stuck in that moment of terror. I've tried meditation, yoga, even medication, but nothing seems to fully alleviate this constant state of anxiety. I worry about how this is affecting my children too. I don't want to pass on my fears to them, but I can't help being overprotective now. It's a constant battle between wanting to keep them safe and not wanting to limit their experiences because of my trauma.",
    "Therapist: You're doing excellent work. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but also somewhat relieved. Talking about it in such detail is exhausting, but it also feels like I'm releasing some of the pent-up emotions I've been carrying. My heart is racing a bit, and I feel a little shaky, but not as overwhelmed as I thought I'd be. It's strange, but describing it out loud makes it feel both more real and less threatening at the same time. I'm surprised I was able to go through the whole experience without breaking down. Maybe... maybe I'm stronger than I thought?",
    "Therapist: You absolutely are. Well done today."
