    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Alex?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of drained. Going through that memory of the domestic violence I witnessed... it brought back so many emotions I've tried to bury.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sounds, I think. The shouting, the crashes... I could hear my mom crying. It's like I was right back there, hiding in my room, feeling so helpless and scared. I remember wanting to do something, anything to make it stop, but I was frozen.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. I felt that same fear and helplessness all over again. But there was also this anger that I don't think I let myself feel back then. Anger at my dad for his actions, but also at myself for not doing more to help my mom.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to carry. How does this connect to your current experiences?",
    "Client: I guess... I still struggle with feeling helpless sometimes. Like when my chronic pain flares up, or when I face conflicts in my relationships. I tend to freeze up or avoid confrontation altogether. And the guilt... it's always there, lurking.",
    "Therapist: I see. What insights are you gaining from this process?",
    "Client: I'm starting to realize that maybe I'm not as powerless now as I felt back then. I'm an adult now, I have more options. But it's like part of me is still stuck in that moment, you know? And maybe that's why I've been having such a hard time standing up for myself or setting boundaries.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How might this affect your recovery goals?",
    "Client: I think... I need to work on separating my past experiences from my present. To remind myself that I'm not that helpless child anymore. Maybe if I can do that, I'll be able to manage my anxiety better and be more assertive in my relationships.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a valuable direction. What's been helpful in this process so far?",
    "Client: Um, I think talking through it like this helps. It's painful, but it's also... clarifying, I guess? And the breathing exercises we've practiced have been really helpful when the memories feel overwhelming. I've been using them outside of our sessions too, when my pain flares up or when I'm feeling stressed.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad those strategies are helping. How are you feeling about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's tough, not gonna lie. There are times when I want to just give up and go back to avoiding everything. But... I can see that it's making a difference. I feel like I'm starting to understand myself better, and that's giving me hope. So yeah, I want to keep going.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is commendable. What support do you need moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe some more tools for grounding myself when the memories get intense? And... I don't know, maybe some guidance on how to start setting boundaries in my current relationships? I'm realizing that's something I really struggle with.",
    "Therapist: Those are great areas to focus on. We'll work on that together.",
    "Client: Thanks. I appreciate your support through all this. It's not easy, but I'm starting to believe that maybe I can actually get through this and come out stronger on the other side.",
