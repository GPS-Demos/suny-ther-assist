    "Therapist: Today, we'll be doing imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: I'm not really sure what that means. Can you explain it to me? I'm feeling a bit nervous about trying something new.",
    "Therapist: Of course. It's a technique where you'll revisit your bullying experiences in your mind. It helps process trauma.",
    "Client: Oh, I see. That sounds pretty intense. Will it be difficult? I'm worried about reliving those painful memories.",
    "Therapist: It can be challenging, but I'll be here to support you. What concerns you most?",
    "Client: I guess I'm afraid of getting overwhelmed by the emotions. What if I can't handle it? And how will this actually help me?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace. This helps reduce the power those memories hold over you.",
    "Client: That makes sense, I suppose. It's just... those experiences were so humiliating. The racial slurs, the isolation... it's hard to think about.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Your bravery in facing this is commendable. Shall we discuss what to expect during the session?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I'd like to know what I'm getting into. Will I need to close my eyes? How long will it last?",
    "Therapist: You can close your eyes if comfortable. We'll start with 15-20 minutes. You'll describe the memory aloud.",
    "Client: Alright. And what if I start to panic or feel too upset? Can we stop if it gets too much?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We can pause anytime. I'll guide you through grounding techniques if needed.",
    "Client: Okay, that's reassuring. I'm still nervous, but I think I'm ready to give it a try. Will this really help with my PTSD symptoms?",
    "Therapist: Many find it effective for reducing symptoms. Your willingness to engage is a big step towards healing.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's been affecting my studies and social life so much. I really want to move past this. How should I prepare myself mentally?",
    "Therapist: Focus on being present. Remember, you're safe here. Any other questions before we begin?",
    "Client: I think I'm okay for now. Thank you for explaining everything. I'm as ready as I'll ever be, I suppose.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your courage is admirable. Shall we start with a relaxation exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, that sounds good. I could use some relaxation to calm my nerves. How does it work?",
    "Therapist: We'll focus on your breathing and body awareness. It'll help center you before we begin.",
    "Client: Okay, I'm willing to try that. I just hope this whole process will help me finally move forward from what happened.",
    "Therapist: Your hope is a powerful tool. Let's begin with a deep breath..."
