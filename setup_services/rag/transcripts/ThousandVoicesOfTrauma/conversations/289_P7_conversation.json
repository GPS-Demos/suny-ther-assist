    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Can you describe the memory of your imprisonment?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard to talk about. I remember the cold, damp cell. The guards were always yelling, their voices echoing off the concrete walls. I felt so alone, so scared.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take your time.",
    "Client: The worst part was the emotional torture. They'd tell me my family had abandoned me, that no one cared. I tried to stay strong, but sometimes I'd break down crying in the corner of my cell. The guards would laugh...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) I can still hear their laughter. It was so cruel. I felt so worthless, like maybe they were right. Maybe no one did care about me anymore.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. Keep going.",
    "Client: Days blurred together. I lost track of time. Sometimes, I'd imagine my life before, my job, my family. But it felt so distant, like a dream. The reality was just... emptiness. Hopelessness.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: (taking a deep breath) There was this one guard who seemed to take pleasure in tormenting me. He'd whisper terrible things through the cell door, threaten my family. I never knew if he was lying or telling the truth. It was psychological warfare.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. You're very brave for sharing this.",
    "Client: I started to doubt everything about myself. My values, my beliefs, even my memories. It felt like they were stripping away my identity, piece by piece. I was afraid I'd lose myself completely.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The worst moments were at night. The silence was deafening. I'd lie awake, replaying every mistake I'd ever made, wondering if this was my punishment. The guilt and shame were overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those feelings. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (voice breaking) Sometimes, I... I thought about ending it all. The pain was too much. But then I'd think of my children, and I'd find a tiny spark of hope to keep going.",
    "Therapist: You're incredibly strong. Let's stay with that memory.",
    "Client: It's hard to describe the relief when I was finally released. But even then, I felt... broken. Like I'd left a part of myself behind in that cell. The world seemed so bright and loud, almost painful. I didn't know how to fit back into my life.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable resilience. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. Talking about it brings back so many emotions. But... also a little lighter, I think. Like I'm not carrying it all alone anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. You've done well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to believe I survived all that. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever truly feel 'normal' again.",
    "Therapist: Recovery is a process. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It helps to know I have support now. I just hope I can learn to trust again, to feel safe in the world.",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. We'll end here for today."
