    "Therapist: Welcome, Rahul. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I think so... I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with your SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10 right now. Just thinking about revisiting those memories makes me tense up a bit.",
    "Therapist: Noted. Let's begin. Close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back at the refugee camp. It's crowded, noisy. I can smell sweat and dust in the air. My family and I are huddled together in a small tent. It's so hot, and I'm scared...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that memory. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I'm worried about my parents. They look so tired and stressed. I feel... helpless.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. My palms are sweating, and I feel a knot in my stomach.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear shouting outside. There's some kind of commotion. My father peeks out of the tent, and I can see the fear in his eyes. He quickly zips it back up and tells us to be quiet. I'm... I'm terrified.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. My chest feels tight, and I'm having trouble breathing steadily.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Okay... The shouting gets louder. I can hear people running. My mother pulls me close, and I can feel her trembling. I want to cry, but I know I have to be quiet. The uncertainty is overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in that moment?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... will we ever be safe? Will we ever have a normal life again? I feel so angry at the world, but also so powerless.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's still an 8. My hands are shaking now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The commotion outside seems to die down, but the tension in the tent is palpable. My father whispers that we might have to move soon. I feel a mix of relief that the immediate danger has passed, but dread at the thought of having to leave again. We have nowhere to go.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: The intensity has dropped a bit. Maybe a 6? I feel drained, but the memory is still vivid.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. What happens next?",
    "Client: We spend the night in uneasy silence. I can't sleep. Every sound makes me jump. By morning, I'm exhausted, but we have to pack up and move. The uncertainty of our future weighs heavily on me.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5 now. I feel... sad. Deeply sad.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. How does your body feel?",
    "Client: My muscles are tense, especially in my shoulders. I have a dull headache. But the intense anxiety from earlier has subsided.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. Let's start wrapping up.",
    "Client: Okay... As we leave the camp, I remember feeling a mix of fear and hope. Fear of what's to come, but hope that maybe, just maybe, we'll find somewhere safe.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful memory. Final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: I'd say it's back to a 4. I feel... drained, but also a bit relieved to have shared this.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Tired, but... I don't know. Maybe a little lighter? It's hard to explain.",
    "Therapist: That's common. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: *takes a deep breath* Thank you. This wasn't easy, but I think it was important.",
    "Therapist: You did exceptionally well. We'll end here for today."
