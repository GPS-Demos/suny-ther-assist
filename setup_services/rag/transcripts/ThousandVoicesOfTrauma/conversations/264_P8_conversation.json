    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit. That memory of the animal attack... it's so vivid. I can still hear the growling, you know? It's like I'm right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. I was just frozen, watching it happen. Part of me feels guilty for not doing more, even though logically I know there wasn't much I could've done. It's just... seeing that level of violence, even if it wasn't directed at me, it's really shaken my sense of safety in the world.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What physical sensations are you noticing?",
    "Client: My hands are clammy, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's like I can't take a full breath. And my stomach feels kind of queasy. It's weird, but I can almost smell the fear from that day. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Everyone's experience is unique. What emotions are coming up for you?",
    "Client: It's a mix. There's fear, obviously. But also this deep sadness. And... anger? I think I'm angry that something so brutal could happen, that the world can be so unpredictable and dangerous. It makes me want to control everything, to make sure nothing like that ever happens again. But I know I can't, and that frustrates me even more.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when you first experienced the trauma?",
    "Client: They're... less intense, I suppose. When it first happened, I felt completely overwhelmed. I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat. Every little noise made me jump. Now, it's more... manageable? But it still affects me. Like, I avoid nature documentaries now, which I used to love. And I'm hyper-vigilant when I'm outside, always scanning for potential threats.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about how you're coping now?",
    "Client: Well, I'm here, talking about it. That's something I couldn't have done before. I'm able to sit with the discomfort more, even though it's still really hard. I've been using those breathing exercises we practiced, and they help a bit. But sometimes I still feel like I'm that same scared person who witnessed the attack, you know?",
    "Therapist: How does that impact your daily life?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. On one hand, I feel like I've become more cautious, which isn't necessarily bad. But on the other, I feel like I'm missing out on things. I used to love hiking, but now the idea of being in a remote area terrifies me. And sometimes, I catch myself being overprotective of my loved ones, always warning them about potential dangers. I know it annoys them sometimes, but I can't help it.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to be different?",
    "Client: I... I want to feel safe again. To be able to enjoy nature without constantly being on edge. To not have this memory pop up at random times and derail my day. I want to be able to watch animal documentaries with my nieces and nephews without feeling panicky. Most of all, I want to feel like I'm living my life, not just surviving it.",
    "Therapist: How do you think today's session has contributed to that goal?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard, but I think it's helping. Talking about it, really diving into the memory instead of avoiding it, it's like... it's losing some of its power over me? Don't get me wrong, it's still incredibly difficult and uncomfortable. But each time we do this, I feel like I'm reclaiming a little bit of control. It's exhausting, but also... empowering, in a way?",
    "Therapist: What's one thing you've learned about yourself through this process?",
    "Client: I've realized I'm stronger than I thought. To be able to face this memory, to talk about it openly... that takes courage, right? And resilience. I'm starting to see that while I can't control what happened, I can control how I respond to it now. It's a slow process, but I'm gradually learning to trust the world, and myself, again.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How are you feeling now compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: I'm... calmer, I think. Still a bit shaky, but the tightness in my chest has eased up. I feel drained, but also... lighter? Like I've put down a heavy burden, even if just for a moment. It's a strange mix of exhaustion and relief.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on for self-care after today's session?",
    "Client: I think I need some quiet time to process everything. Maybe I'll try that mindfulness exercise we talked about last time. And I promised myself I'd call a friend after today's session, just to chat about normal things. I think that human connection will help ground me. Oh, and definitely a hot shower. That always helps me feel more... present, I guess?",
    "Therapist: Those sound like excellent strategies. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I... I just want to say thank you. I know I've said it before, but these sessions, they're really helping. Even though it's painful to go through this process, I feel like I'm making progress. It's slow, and sometimes I feel like I'm taking two steps forward and one step back, but... I'm moving forward. And that means a lot to me.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your hard work is paying off. How would you like to close our session today?",
    "Client: Could we do that grounding exercise we've done before? The one where we focus on things we can see, hear, and feel in the room? I think that would help me transition back to the present moment.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's begin..."
