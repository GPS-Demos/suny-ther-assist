    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I'm back there, you know? Watching that video of police brutality, it just... it brought back all those feelings of helplessness from when I was bullied.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What physical sensations are you noticing right now?",
    "Client: My palms are sweaty, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's hard to take a deep breath. I keep seeing flashes of that video, but then it morphs into memories of being shoved against lockers in high school. It's all mixed up in my head.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking, \"Why does this keep happening?\" Not just to me, but to others too. It's like there's no escape from cruelty, you know? Whether it's kids in school or people who are supposed to protect us. I feel so angry, but also... scared. Like, what if I'm next? What if no one believes me or helps me?",
    "Therapist: That sounds really overwhelming. How do these thoughts affect you?",
    "Client: They make me want to hide away. I've been avoiding the news, social media, even hanging out with friends. It's exhausting, always being on edge, waiting for the next bad thing to happen. But then I feel guilty for not doing more, for not speaking up or protesting. It's like I'm letting everyone down.",
    "Therapist: I hear your struggle. How does this connect to your past experiences?",
    "Client: I guess... it's that same feeling of powerlessness. Back then, I couldn't stop the bullies. Now, I can't stop what's happening in the world. It's like... no matter how much I grow or change, I'm still that scared kid who can't defend himself or others.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What else comes up for you?",
    "Client: I... I'm realizing how much anger I've been holding onto. Not just at the bullies or the police, but at myself too. For not being stronger, for not fighting back. And then I feel ashamed for being angry because I know others have it worse. It's this cycle I can't seem to break out of.",
    "Therapist: How does recognizing these feelings impact you now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a bit of a relief. Like, I'm not crazy for feeling this way. But it's also scary. I don't know what to do with all these emotions. They feel too big, too overwhelming. I want to make a difference, but I don't know how. And part of me is still that scared kid who just wants to hide.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to process. What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to breathe. Just... sit with these feelings for a bit without trying to fix them or push them away. Maybe... maybe it's okay to not have all the answers right now. I don't know. It's just... a lot.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a wise approach. How can we support that process?",
    "Client: Could we... could we just sit here for a minute? In silence? I just need to feel... safe, I guess. To know that even with all these big feelings and memories, I'm still here, still okay. Is that alright?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take that moment together.",
    "Client: Thank you. That... that helped. I feel a bit more grounded now. It's like... the memories and feelings are still there, but they're not consuming me as much. I can see them more clearly, if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad that helped. What are you noticing now?",
    "Client: I'm noticing that... even though these memories and current events are painful, I'm stronger than I used to be. I'm here, talking about it, facing it. That's something I couldn't do before. Maybe... maybe that's a start in breaking that cycle of helplessness.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it feel to acknowledge that strength?",
    "Client: It's... it's both scary and empowering. Like, I'm proud of myself for facing this, but I'm also terrified of what comes next. What if I can't maintain this strength? What if I let myself or others down? But then I think... maybe it's okay to not be strong all the time. Maybe it's about getting back up when I fall, not about never falling.",
    "Therapist: That's a profound insight. Where do you want to go from here?",
    "Client: I think... I want to explore this more. To understand how I can use this strength, not just for myself but to help others too. Maybe... maybe there's a way to turn all this pain and anger into something positive. I don't know what that looks like yet, but I want to find out.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a meaningful goal. How do you feel about ending our session here?",
    "Client: I feel... okay, actually. Better than I expected. There's still a lot to process, but I feel like I have a direction now. Thank you for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone listen and understand.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. I'm proud of the work you did today. We'll continue next session."
