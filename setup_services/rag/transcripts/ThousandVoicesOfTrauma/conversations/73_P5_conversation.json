    "Therapist: Welcome back. Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm honestly quite nervous. I've been dreading this all week. The idea of revisiting those workplace experiences... it's overwhelming. I'm not sure I can handle it.",
    "Therapist: Your apprehension is understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I've spent years trying to forget what happened. The neglect, the constant undermining... it's like a dark cloud that follows me. I'm afraid that if I start talking about it, I won't be able to stop the flood of emotions. What if I completely fall apart?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How do you think revisiting might help?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe it could help me process what happened? But I'm scared it'll make things worse. I've worked so hard to build a life outside of that trauma. What if this undoes all of that progress?",
    "Therapist: Understandable fear. Let's discuss how this exercise can actually reinforce your progress.",
    "Client: Okay, I'm listening. But I'm still skeptical. How can reliving something so painful be beneficial? It seems counterintuitive.",
    "Therapist: By facing it, we can reduce its power over you. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Well, what exactly will happen during this exposure? Will I have to describe everything in detail? And what if I start panicking? I'm worried I might have a breakdown right here in your office.",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. I'll guide you and provide support throughout. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's somewhat reassuring. But I'm still anxious about the whole process. Can you tell me more about what to expect? Will it be like reliving the entire experience all over again?",
    "Therapist: It may feel intense, but you're safe here. We can pause anytime. What else worries you?",
    "Client: I guess I'm worried about how I'll feel afterwards. Will I be able to function normally? I have responsibilities at home and work. I can't afford to fall apart.",
    "Therapist: We'll debrief and ensure you're grounded before leaving. Your courage is admirable. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I appreciate your support, but I'm still hesitant. This feels like such a big step. I've spent so long trying to keep these memories at bay. The idea of voluntarily bringing them to the surface is terrifying. But I also know that what I've been doing hasn't really been working. My anxiety is still there, affecting my daily life. So, I suppose... yes, I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Your bravery is commendable. Remember, you're in control. Shall we start?"
