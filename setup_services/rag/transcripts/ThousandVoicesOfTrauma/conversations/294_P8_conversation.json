    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling pretty shaky, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit. That memory... it's like I was right back there, you know? I can still hear the sirens, smell the tear gas. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: (inhales deeply) It's... it's a mix of things. I'm angry, scared, and... I don't know, maybe ashamed? I keep replaying the moment when the officer grabbed me. I felt so powerless, like I was nothing. And then the pain... (voice trembles) I can almost feel it again.",
    "Therapist: It sounds like a really intense experience. Can you tell me more about those feelings?",
    "Client: Yeah, um... The anger is like this burning in my chest. I'm furious that they could just... do that, you know? Treat people like that. But then the fear... it's like ice in my veins. I'm terrified it could happen again, that I'm never really safe. And the shame... (pauses) I guess I feel like I should have done something different, fought back or... I don't know.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How do these emotions connect to your everyday life now?",
    "Client: God, they're always there, lurking. I'm constantly on edge, especially around authority figures. I avoid crowds, protests... anything that reminds me of that day. It's like I'm not living, just... existing. And I hate that they've taken that from me, you know? My sense of safety, my ability to stand up for what I believe in.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to carry. What thoughts come up when you reflect on this?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"Why me?\" Like, what did I do to deserve this? And then I feel guilty for even thinking that because so many others have it worse. But mostly, I just... I don't understand how people can be so cruel. How can someone sworn to protect just... hurt people like that? It makes me question everything.",
    "Therapist: Those are heavy thoughts. How do you cope with them?",
    "Client: (sighs) Not well, honestly. I try to distract myself, throw myself into my studies. But sometimes... sometimes I have these moments where I just break down. I'll be in the shower or lying in bed, and suddenly I'm sobbing uncontrollably. It's like all the emotions I've been holding back just... explode.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in those moments?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Part of me wants someone to hold me, to tell me it's going to be okay. But another part of me wants to be alone, to not let anyone see me like that. I feel so vulnerable, so raw. It's like I'm that scared, helpless person all over again.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel vulnerable. How does sharing this now feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. Really hard. But also... I don't know, maybe a little relieving? Like, I've been carrying this alone for so long, and now... now someone else knows. Someone understands. It doesn't fix anything, but... maybe it makes it a little less lonely?",
    "Therapist: That's a big step. What do you think this means for your healing journey?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me is scared to hope, you know? Like, what if I can never move past this? But another part... maybe there's a tiny glimmer of hope. That by facing this, by talking about it... maybe I can start to reclaim some of what I've lost. My sense of safety, my ability to trust... It's terrifying, but also... maybe a little exciting?",
    "Therapist: That hope is important. How can we nurture it?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to keep talking about it. Keep facing it, even when it's hard. Maybe... maybe find ways to feel empowered again? I don't know what that looks like yet, but... I want to feel strong again. Not just physically, but... emotionally. Like I can handle whatever comes my way.",
    "Therapist: That's a great insight. What's one small step you could take this week?",
    "Client: Hmm... Maybe... maybe I could try going to a small gathering? Nothing big, just... maybe a study group or something. Just to be around people without feeling overwhelmed. It's scary, but... I think I need to start somewhere, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a brave first step. How do you feel about that idea?",
    "Client: I'm nervous, definitely. But also... maybe a little excited? It's been so long since I've done anything like that. I'm scared I might panic, but... I also know I can't keep hiding forever. And maybe... maybe it'll be okay. Maybe I'm stronger than I think I am.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What else are you noticing about yourself right now?",
    "Client: I... I feel a bit lighter, actually. Like, talking about all this... it's hard, but it's also like I'm setting down some of the weight I've been carrying. And I'm realizing that... maybe I'm not alone in this. That there are people who want to help, who believe in me. It's... it's a nice feeling.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful. How would you like to close our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to sit with this feeling for a moment. This... lightness. It feels fragile, like it might disappear any second, but... it's also precious. And maybe... maybe it's a sign that things can get better. That I can get better.",
    "Therapist: That's a beautiful thought to end on. Thank you for sharing so openly today."
