    "Therapist: Welcome, Arjun. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's this knot in my stomach. I know we've been working towards this, but now that we're here, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm at the airport. It's bustling with people. The air feels thick with tension and excitement. I can smell coffee from a nearby cafe mixing with the scent of cleaning products.",
    "Therapist: Good. What are you doing?",
    "Client: I'm standing in line at the check-in counter. My hands are sweaty, and I keep checking my pocket for my passport. God, I hate flying, but I have to get to this conference.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 40? It's uncomfortable, but manageable.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: I make it through security. Everything feels like it's moving too fast. I find my gate and sit down. My heart's racing a bit. I keep thinking about all the things that could go wrong.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I can't help but think about all the plane crashes I've seen on the news. What if something goes wrong? What if we lose an engine? What if... (voice trembles) What if I never see my family again?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember to breathe. Where are you now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm boarding the plane. My palms are so sweaty. I can barely hold onto my ticket. The flight attendant smiles at me, but it doesn't help. I feel like I'm walking to my doom.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's higher. Maybe 65? My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in my seat now. Window seat. I can see the runway. My heart is pounding so hard I swear the guy next to me can hear it. The plane starts to move, and I grip the armrests. Oh god, this is it.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What do you hear? What do you feel?",
    "Client: The engines are getting louder. I can feel the vibrations through my whole body. We're speeding up, and suddenly we're lifting off. My stomach drops. I close my eyes tight. I can't look.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: We're climbing higher and higher. There's turbulence. Every bump makes me flinch. I... I start to feel dizzy. My breathing is so fast. I can't... I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: Focus on your breathing. Slow, deep breaths. You're safe.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) It's hard. I feel like I'm suffocating. The plane keeps shaking. I hear a weird noise from the engine. Oh god, what if something's wrong?",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: The... the shaking gets worse. People are starting to look worried. The captain comes on the intercom, but I can barely hear him over the sound of my own heartbeat. He says... he says we're having some technical difficulties.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's really high. Maybe 85? I feel like I'm going to pass out.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here with me. You're safe. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: The plane suddenly drops. People are screaming. Oxygen masks fall from the ceiling. I'm fumbling with mine, hands shaking so bad I can barely get it on. We're falling, falling so fast.",
    "Therapist: Stay with me. What do you see? What do you feel?",
    "Client: Everything's a blur. The world outside the window is spinning. I can see the ground getting closer. People are crying, praying. I... I think about my family. About how I never told them I loved them enough. The guilt... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: We're getting closer to the ground. I can see trees, buildings. They're getting bigger so fast. I close my eyes. I can't watch. I'm gripping the seat so hard my knuckles are white. I'm... I'm saying goodbye in my head to everyone I love.",
    "Therapist: What's happening in your body right now?",
    "Client: My whole body is tense. I feel like I can't move. My heart is racing so fast it hurts. I can't breathe. I... I think I'm going to be sick.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (takes a few deep breaths) It's... it's hard to stay present. The memory feels so real.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What happens next?",
    "Client: There's a massive jolt. The plane hits the ground. The impact is... it's indescribable. I'm thrown forward, my seatbelt cutting into me. There's a deafening noise of metal tearing. Smoke fills the cabin. I can't see anything.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What do you hear? What do you smell?",
    "Client: I hear screaming. So much screaming. And this awful creaking sound, like the plane is being torn apart. The smell... it's awful. Smoke, fuel, something burning. I'm coughing, choking on it.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's maxed out. 100. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. This is just a memory. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: I... I unbuckle my seatbelt. My hands are shaking so badly. I can barely stand. People are pushing, shoving to get out. I see flames at the back of the plane. Oh god, we're going to burn alive.",
    "Therapist: Stay with me. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I stumble towards the emergency exit. Someone's trying to open it but they can't. I help them push. The door flies open and cold air rushes in. We're sliding down the inflatable ramp. I hit the ground hard.",
    "Therapist: What do you feel as you hit the ground?",
    "Client: Pain. So much pain. But also... relief? I'm alive. I made it out. I'm crawling away from the plane. The grass is wet. I can feel it on my hands.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. What's happening around you?",
    "Client: There's chaos everywhere. People running, crying. I hear sirens in the distance. The heat from the plane is intense. I keep crawling until I can't anymore. I collapse on the grass, gasping for air.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I... I'm shaking. My heart is still racing. But... I'm here. I survived. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You did survive. You're safe now. Let's take a few deep breaths together.",
    "Client: (takes several deep breaths) It's... it's hard to believe it's over.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down. Maybe 70? I still feel shaky, but not as intense.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You've done incredibly well. How are you feeling about the experience we just went through?",
    "Client: It was... intense. Terrifying. But also... I feel like I faced it. Like I didn't run away this time.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You faced it head-on. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: I... I am. It's strange. I feel exhausted, but also... lighter? Like I've let go of something.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after exposure therapy. You've confronted a deeply frightening memory and made it through.",
    "Client: Yeah... I have, haven't I? It's still scary, but... maybe a little less so now.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. Each time we do this, it may become a bit easier. How are you feeling physically now?",
    "Client: My heart rate is slowing down. I'm still a bit shaky, but I feel more... grounded? Is that the right word?",
    "Therapist: That's a great word for it. Let's take a few more deep breaths together.",
    "Client: (takes several deep breaths) That helps. I feel more present now.",
    "Therapist: Good. You've done excellent work today, Arjun. How do you feel about what we've accomplished?",
    "Client: I feel... proud, I guess? And tired. But also like I've taken a step forward. It was hard, but... I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: That's great to hear. Remember, this is a process. We'll continue to work on this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I appreciate your support through this. It means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. You've shown incredible strength today. Let's end our session here and discuss how you can take care of yourself for the rest of the day."
