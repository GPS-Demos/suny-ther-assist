    "Therapist: Welcome, Priya. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. My stomach's been in knots all morning. I know we've talked about this, but actually doing it feels different.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in our living room. It's evening, maybe around 8 PM. The lights are dim, and I can hear the TV in the background. My sister Amira is sitting next to me on the couch. We're both tense, waiting...",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: The front door slams open. It's my father. He... he stumbles in, reeking of alcohol. His eyes are bloodshot, and he's muttering under his breath. My heart starts racing...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 60? My palms are getting sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Okay... My mom comes out of the kitchen. She looks tired, defeated. She says, \"Dinner's ready.\" But my father... he just glares at her. He slurs, \"Where were you this afternoon?\" My mom looks confused. She starts to explain she was at work, but he cuts her off...",
    "Therapist: What do you see and hear?",
    "Client: He... he starts yelling. Accusing her of cheating. His face is red, veins bulging in his neck. My mom tries to calm him down, but it only makes him angrier. He grabs a vase from the side table and throws it. It shatters against the wall, inches from my mom's head. I can still hear the sound of it breaking...",
    "Therapist: Stay present. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My heart is pounding. I feel so helpless, just like I did then.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're safe here. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 75, I think.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take another deep breath. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: *exhales slowly* Amira grabs my hand. We're both frozen on the couch. My dad... he advances towards my mom. She backs away, pleading with him to calm down. But he... he slaps her across the face. The sound echoes through the room. I want to scream, to do something, but I'm paralyzed with fear...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Priya. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: My mom stumbles back, holding her cheek. There are tears in her eyes. My dad grabs her arm, shaking her violently. He's shouting in her face, calling her horrible names. I can smell the alcohol on his breath from across the room. Amira is sobbing quietly next to me...",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My... my chest feels tight. I'm having trouble breathing. It's like I'm back there, and I can't do anything to help.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Focus on your breath. In and out.",
    "Client: *breathes deeply* Okay... I'm... I'm still there. My dad is still gripping my mom's arm. She's begging him to let go, saying he's hurting her. But he doesn't listen. He... he pushes her, hard. She falls back, hitting her head on the corner of the coffee table. There's a sickening thud...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: Blood. There's blood trickling down my mom's forehead. She looks dazed. I... I finally find my voice. I scream, \"Stop! You're killing her!\" My dad turns to look at me, his eyes wild with rage. For a moment, I think he's going to come after me...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 90. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Priya. Take a moment. Feel your feet on the ground.",
    "Client: *takes several deep breaths* Okay... I'm... I'm still in the memory. My dad... he seems to snap out of his rage for a moment. He looks at my mom on the floor, then at us. There's a flicker of... something in his eyes. Regret? Fear? He stumbles back, muttering, \"I... I didn't mean to...\" Then he grabs his keys and rushes out the door.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I rush to my mom. Amira is right behind me. Mom's trying to sit up, but she's disoriented. The cut on her head isn't too deep, but there's a lot of blood. I grab a towel from the kitchen and press it to her wound. Amira is on the phone, calling for an ambulance. I'm trying to be strong, but I'm shaking so hard...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel angry. And scared. And so, so guilty. Why didn't I do something sooner?",
    "Therapist: Remember, it wasn't your fault. What happens after the ambulance arrives?",
    "Client: The paramedics come in. They're asking questions, checking my mom's vitals. I'm trying to explain what happened, but my voice keeps cracking. They put my mom on a stretcher. As they're wheeling her out, she reaches for my hand. She whispers, \"It's not your fault, beta. Don't worry about me.\" But how can I not worry? How can I ever feel safe again?",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly difficult. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. Sad. Angry. It's like all these emotions are swirling inside me.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 70. Still high, but not as intense as before.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well, Priya. Let's start to bring you back to the present.",
    "Client: Okay... *takes a deep breath* I'm... I'm here. In your office. It's... it's over.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You're safe here. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... exhausted. But also... I don't know. Maybe a little lighter? Like I've let out something I've been holding in for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after these sessions. You've shown great courage today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was hard, but... I think it helped. Can we... can we talk about what happened?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's process this experience together."
