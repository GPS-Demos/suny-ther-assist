    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Well, to be honest, I'm feeling a bit uneasy. It's not easy coming here and talking about... well, you know. But I suppose that's why I'm here, right?",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to help you process these experiences. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. Yes, let's get started.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) I'm... I'm in my daughter's house. It's a Sunday afternoon, and I've come over for dinner. The house smells like roast beef, and I can hear the grandkids playing in the backyard. Everything seems normal at first, but then...",
    "Therapist: Go on. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear raised voices coming from the kitchen. It's my daughter and her husband. They're arguing about something... I can't quite make out what. The tone is getting angrier, more intense.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling anxious. My heart's starting to race. I want to do something, but I'm not sure what.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 40... maybe 45.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath and continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: The argument is getting louder. I can hear my son-in-law shouting now. There's a crash \u2013 it sounds like something's been thrown. I... I get up from my chair. My legs feel shaky.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I walk towards the kitchen. My heart's pounding in my ears. I push open the door and... (voice breaks) I see my daughter cowering in the corner. Her husband is looming over her, his fist raised.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (breathing deeply) It's... it's hard to see this again.",
    "Therapist: I know it's difficult. You're doing well. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 70.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, you're here now, safe in my office. Can you describe what you're seeing and feeling?",
    "Client: I see the fear in my daughter's eyes. She looks so small, so vulnerable. I feel... I feel angry. Furious. But also... helpless. I'm frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: My son-in-law turns to me. His face is red with anger. He shouts at me to mind my own business. I... I can smell alcohol on his breath.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: Tense. My fists are clenched. I'm shaking, but I'm not sure if it's from fear or anger.",
    "Therapist: Continue. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I find my voice. I tell him to step away from her. My voice sounds strange to me, like it's coming from someone else. He laughs, a cruel sound.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Humiliated. Angry. I... I step forward. I'm not thinking clearly. I just want to protect my daughter.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 85.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here in my office. You're safe.",
    "Client: (breathing deeply) Okay... okay.",
    "Therapist: Can you continue?",
    "Client: Yes... As I step forward, he turns his attention fully to me. He's shouting, but I can't make out the words. Everything seems to slow down. I see his fist coming towards me...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you feel?",
    "Client: I feel... afraid. But also determined. I raise my arms to protect myself, but I'm too slow. His fist connects with my jaw. There's a burst of pain, and I stumble backwards.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I fall to the ground. My vision is blurry. I can hear my daughter screaming, the grandkids crying from the other room. I feel... I feel so ashamed. I couldn't protect her.",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. You did what you could in a difficult situation.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) I know that now, but in that moment... I felt like I'd failed her.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: Everything's a blur after that. I remember sirens, police lights. My daughter helping me up. The kids huddled together, looking scared and confused.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel now, recalling all of this?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. Sad. But also... I don't know. Maybe a little relieved to have talked about it?",
    "Therapist: That's normal. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's come down a bit. Maybe around 60?",
    "Therapist: That's good. You've done really well today, John. How about we take a few moments to ground ourselves?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Let's focus on our breathing. In through the nose, out through the mouth.",
    "Client: (breathing deeply) Okay... that helps.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, can you name five things you can see in this room?",
    "Client: Um... your desk, the bookshelf, the painting on the wall, the plant in the corner, and the clock.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How about four things you can touch?",
    "Client: The armrest of the chair, my pants, my watch, and... the texture of my shirt.",
    "Therapist: Great. Three things you can hear?",
    "Client: The ticking of the clock, the hum of the air conditioner, and... faint traffic noise outside.",
    "Therapist: Very good. Two things you can smell?",
    "Client: The leather of the chair and... is that coffee?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it is. Last one - one thing you can taste?",
    "Client: Just... the lingering taste of the mint I had earlier.",
    "Therapist: Excellent job, John. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Better. More... present, I guess. Less caught up in the memory.",
    "Therapist: That's great. Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's down to about 30 now.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant improvement. You've made great progress today, John. How do you feel about the session?",
    "Client: It was tough, reliving that moment. But... I think it helped. It doesn't feel as overwhelming now.",
    "Therapist: That's often the case. By facing these memories, we can start to process them. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm good for now. It's a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Remember, it's normal to feel drained after a session like this. Be kind to yourself for the rest of the day. We'll continue working through this in our next session.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I appreciate your help.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, John. You've shown great courage today. I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: See you then. Thank you again."
