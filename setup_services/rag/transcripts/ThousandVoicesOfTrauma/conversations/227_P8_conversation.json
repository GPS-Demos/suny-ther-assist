    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is buzzing, you know? My hands are shaking a bit, and my heart's still racing. That memory... it felt so real, like I was right back there in that moment. I could smell the alcohol on my father's breath, hear the crash of bottles breaking. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. I was just a kid, you know? I couldn't do anything to stop it. I remember wanting to jump in, to protect my mom, but I was frozen. I... I feel ashamed. Like I should've done something, anything. But then I also feel angry. So angry at my father for putting us through that. It's a mess of emotions, really.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to process. How are you coping with these feelings in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm trying to remind myself that I'm safe now. That it's in the past. But it's hard, you know? My instinct is to push it all down, to numb it somehow. That's... that's probably why I turned to drugs for so long. It was easier than feeling all of this. But I'm trying to sit with it now, even though it's uncomfortable. I'm trying to breathe through it.",
    "Therapist: You're showing a lot of strength. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I... I feel a tightness in my chest. Like there's a weight pressing down on me. And my throat feels constricted, like I want to cry but can't. It's strange, but I also feel a sense of relief. Like, finally talking about this, really facing it... it's terrifying, but also liberating in a way. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Can you tell me more about that sense of relief?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... for so long, I've been carrying this secret, this burden. Always trying to present a strong front, you know? But now, talking about it, really diving into those memories... it's like I'm finally acknowledging that little boy who was so scared and confused. I'm giving him a voice. And yeah, it hurts like hell, but it also feels like... like I'm finally dealing with it, you know? Like maybe I can start to heal.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does this connect to your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's all connected, you know? My substance use, my struggles with relationships, my anger issues... it all stems from this. From these memories I've been trying to bury. And facing it now, it's hard, but I can see how it's necessary. If I want to stay clean, if I want to be a better husband, a better father... I need to deal with this. I can't keep running from it.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you make that connection?",
    "Client: It's... it's scary, to be honest. Because it means I have to keep doing this hard work. But it's also... hopeful? Like, maybe there's a reason for all the pain I've been through. Maybe by working through this, I can break the cycle. I don't want my kids to ever feel the way I did. And... and maybe I can finally forgive myself. For not being able to stop it, for turning to drugs... for all of it.",
    "Therapist: That's a profound insight. How are you feeling physically now?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm starting to calm down a bit. My heart's not racing as much. I feel... drained, but also lighter somehow. Like I've set down a heavy load I've been carrying for years. My hands have stopped shaking, but I feel exhausted. It's like I've run a marathon or something.",
    "Therapist: What do you need right now to take care of yourself?",
    "Client: I think... I think I just need a moment. To breathe, to let all of this settle. Maybe some water? And... and I think I want to call my wife later. I've never really told her about all of this, but I think I'm ready to start opening up. She's always been so supportive of my recovery, and I think... I think sharing this with her might bring us closer.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling about our session today?",
    "Client: It was tough, really tough. But... I'm glad we did it. I feel like I've taken a big step forward, you know? Like I'm finally facing the root of my problems instead of just treating the symptoms. It's scary, but it also feels right. Like this is what I need to do to truly heal.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible courage today. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I just... I want to say thank you. For creating a safe space for me to confront these memories. For guiding me through this. I know we have a long way to go, but for the first time in a long time, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this. And that... that means everything.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue this work next session. Take care."
