    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. I can still see the dimly lit room, smell the incense... It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I think. No, not just fear. It's... terror. Like I'm back there, and I can't escape. My heart's pounding, and I feel so small, so helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Can you tell me more about that feeling of helplessness?",
    "Client: It's... it's like being trapped in quicksand. The more I struggled, the deeper I sank. I wanted to scream, to run away, but I couldn't. They had this... this power over me. I believed everything they said, even when it didn't make sense. God, I was so stupid.",
    "Therapist: You weren't stupid. You were manipulated. What thoughts are going through your mind now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... what if I had been stronger? What if I had seen through their lies? Maybe I could have saved myself, saved others. But I was weak. I let them control me, let them... use me.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you're sharing this?",
    "Client: Tense. Really tense. My shoulders are so tight it hurts. And there's this knot in my stomach, like I'm going to be sick. I can feel my hands shaking... I hate this feeling.",
    "Therapist: That's your body remembering. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Part of me wants to curl up and hide. But another part... I'm angry. So angry. At them, at myself. I want to scream, to break something. Is that... is that normal?",
    "Therapist: It's a common response. How does expressing that anger feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a relief. Like letting out a breath I've been holding for years. But it's scary too. I'm not used to feeling this... intensely. What if I can't control it?",
    "Therapist: You're in control now. How does that knowledge sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... strange. Good, but strange. For so long, I didn't have any control. They made all the decisions, told me what to think, what to feel. Now... now I'm free, but sometimes that freedom feels overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Can you expand on that feeling of being overwhelmed by freedom?",
    "Client: It's like... imagine being in a dark room for years, and then suddenly you're thrust into bright sunlight. It's what you wanted, but it's also painful and disorienting. I have to make my own choices now, and that's terrifying. What if I make the wrong ones?",
    "Therapist: That's a common fear. How do you cope with it?",
    "Client: I... I try to remind myself that I'm not alone anymore. I have support, people who care about me. And I'm learning to trust my own judgment again. It's hard, but... I'm getting there. Slowly.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What else are you noticing about your thoughts or feelings?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm starting to feel a bit calmer now. The memory is still there, but it's not as overwhelming. It's like... it's like I'm looking at it from a distance. I can see how messed up it all was, how they manipulated me. But I can also see how far I've come.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. How does it make you feel?",
    "Client: Proud, I guess. And... hopeful? Yeah, hopeful. For the first time in a long time, I feel like maybe I can get through this. Like maybe I'm stronger than I thought.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful shift. What do you think contributed to it?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's because I'm finally facing it. For so long, I tried to push it all away, pretend it never happened. But now, talking about it, reliving it... it's painful, but it's also freeing. It's like... like lancing a wound. It hurts, but it's the only way to heal.",
    "Therapist: That's a vivid analogy. How does this new perspective affect your view of the future?",
    "Client: It makes me feel... cautiously optimistic? I know I still have a long way to go, but for the first time, I can actually imagine a future where I'm not defined by what happened to me. Where I can be... just me. Whoever that is.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. What's one thing you can do to nurture that feeling?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to start trusting myself more. Making small decisions, taking risks. Maybe... maybe I'll join that study group I've been avoiding. Start reconnecting with people outside of therapy.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive step. How do you feel about our session today?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... good. Like I've run a marathon or something. My mind feels clearer, even if my emotions are all over the place. Thank you for... for helping me through this.",
    "Therapist: You did the hard work. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up?",
    "Client: No, I think... I think I need some time to process all of this. It's a lot to take in. But I'm glad we did it. It feels like... like I've taken a step forward, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a great note to end on. We'll pick up here next time. Take care of yourself this week.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again. See you next week."
