    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you start by describing the scene?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in my childhood home. It's late at night, and I can hear shouting from downstairs. I'm in my bed, trying to cover my ears, but the voices are getting louder.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: I'm scared. My heart is racing, and I can feel my hands shaking. The shouting is getting closer, and I can hear heavy footsteps coming up the stairs. I want to hide, but I'm frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I can see the door handle turning. My dad bursts in, his face red with anger. He's yelling at my mom, who's right behind him. They don't even notice me at first. I'm trying to make myself as small as possible, hoping they won't see me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: My mom sees me and tries to calm my dad down, but he pushes her. She falls against my dresser, knocking things over. The crash is so loud, and I can't help but let out a whimper. That's when my dad turns to me...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. You're safe now.",
    "Client: His eyes... they're so full of rage. He starts yelling at me, asking why I'm not asleep. I'm crying now, trying to apologize, but I can barely speak. My mom is pleading with him to leave me alone, but he's not listening.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Remember, you're here in the present.",
    "Client: I can smell the alcohol on his breath as he leans in close. He grabs my arm, pulling me out of bed. It hurts so much, and I'm terrified he's going to hit me. My mom is screaming now, trying to pull him away from me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're doing incredibly well.",
    "Client: Everything is happening so fast. There's a struggle, and suddenly my dad loses his balance. He falls, dragging me with him. We hit the floor hard, and I can hear my mom crying. I'm in pain, but I'm more scared than anything else.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I... I feel shaky. My heart is pounding, and I can feel tears on my cheeks. It's like I'm right back there, feeling so small and helpless.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe here with me.",
    "Client: I remember lying there on the floor, too afraid to move. My dad is groaning, and my mom is helping him up. They're both ignoring me now, like I'm not even there. I just want it all to stop, for everyone to go away and leave me alone.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job describing this. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I slowly crawl back into bed, pulling the covers over my head. I can still hear them arguing, but it's muffled now. I'm trying to focus on my breathing, trying to pretend I'm somewhere else, anywhere else. But I can't stop shaking, and I'm so afraid they'll come back.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory very well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. And sad. It's like all the energy has been sucked out of me. But there's also this weird sense of relief, like I've finally let something out that I've been holding onto for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. You've shown great strength today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to talk about this, but I think it's helping. I've never really told anyone about that night before. It's like I've been carrying this secret weight for years.",
    "Therapist: You've taken a big step. How do you feel about sharing this memory?",
    "Client: It's scary, but also... freeing? I've always felt so alone with these memories, like no one would understand. But talking about it, even though it's painful, makes me feel less isolated. I just hope it gets easier with time.",
    "Therapist: It often does. You've shown remarkable courage today.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I'm exhausted, but I also feel a little lighter. Is it normal to feel this mix of emotions?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it's very normal. Your reactions are valid.",
    "Client: Okay, that's good to know. I'm still processing everything, but I think I'm ready to end the session for today. It's a lot to take in, but I'm glad I was able to share this with you.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves before we end."
