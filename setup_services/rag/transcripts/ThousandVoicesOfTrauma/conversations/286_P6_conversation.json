    "Therapist: Welcome back, John. Are you ready to continue our imaginal exposure exercise today?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with your SUDS rating. Where are you at right now?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10. My stomach feels a bit tight, but I'm mostly okay.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Let's begin. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that moment.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm there. I can see the walls of the room closing in on me. The air feels thick and heavy. My heart is starting to race a bit.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The silence is deafening. I can hear my own breathing echoing off the walls. My palms are getting sweaty, and I'm starting to feel trapped.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's climbing... probably a 6 now. I can feel my chest tightening.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Keep going.",
    "Client: (Voice shaking slightly) I'm pacing back and forth now. The room feels smaller with each step. I keep thinking, \"I can't do this. I need to get out.\" But there's no way out. I'm trapped here, and no one's coming to help me.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: My mouth is dry. I'm trying to swallow, but it's difficult. The walls seem to be closing in even more. I'm starting to panic. I can feel my heart pounding in my ears.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe even a 9. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a slow, deep breath. You're doing great.",
    "Client: (Inhales shakily) I'm trying, but it's so hard. I feel like I'm going to pass out. The room is spinning, and I can't focus on anything. I'm sliding down the wall, hugging my knees to my chest. I feel so small, so helpless.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm crying now. Sobbing, actually. I can taste the salt from my tears. My whole body is shaking. I keep thinking, \"This is it. This is how I'll spend the rest of my life.\" The hopelessness is overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Still a 9. Maybe it's gone down to an 8.5, but barely. I feel exhausted, drained.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Keep going.",
    "Client: Time seems to stand still. I don't know how long I've been here. Minutes? Hours? Days? It all blurs together. My legs are cramping from sitting in this position, but I can't bring myself to move. I feel paralyzed by fear.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm starting to feel a bit calmer. Maybe a 7 now. The panic is subsiding, but there's this deep sadness settling in. I feel so alone, so abandoned.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. Keep describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: I'm uncurling myself slowly. My muscles ache. I stand up, legs shaky. I walk to the small window and look out. The world seems so far away, so unreachable. I place my hand on the cool glass, and it grounds me a little.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6. I'm still anxious, but I can breathe easier now. The room doesn't feel as suffocating.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's start wrapping up. Take a few deep breaths.",
    "Client: (Breathes deeply) Okay. I'm... I'm back in the room with you. My heart rate is slowing down. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little proud that I got through it?",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm at about a 4 again. Tired, but okay. That was intense, but... manageable.",
    "Therapist: Well done, John. We'll process this more next time."
