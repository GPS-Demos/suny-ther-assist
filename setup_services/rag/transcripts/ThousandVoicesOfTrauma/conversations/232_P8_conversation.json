    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. The memories of being imprisoned during the war... they're so vivid now. I can almost feel the cold concrete walls closing in on me again. My heart's racing, and I'm feeling a bit shaky.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's like I'm right back there, you know? I can hear the guards' footsteps echoing down the hallway, and I'm terrified they're coming for me. But there's also this... this intense anger bubbling up. I'm angry at the situation, at the people who put me there, and even at myself for not being able to escape.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's hot. Like a fire in my chest. My fists are clenched, and I notice I'm gritting my teeth. It's almost like my body wants to fight, but there's nowhere for that energy to go. And then there's this wave of helplessness that washes over me, and I feel so small and powerless again.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are accompanying these feelings?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why me? Why did I have to go through this?\" And then I feel guilty for even asking that because I know others had it worse. There's this voice in my head saying I should be over this by now, that I'm weak for still being affected. But another part of me is screaming that what happened was wrong, that no one should have to endure that kind of treatment.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts impact you now?",
    "Client: They... they make me feel conflicted. On one hand, I want to move on and not let this experience define me. But on the other, I feel like ignoring it would be a betrayal to myself and others who suffered. It's exhausting, constantly battling these thoughts. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever truly feel at peace.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I think I need reassurance. That it's okay to still be processing this, that healing isn't linear. And maybe... maybe I need permission to be angry, to grieve for what I lost during that time. It's hard to allow myself to feel these things without judgment.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. How can we support that process?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe by acknowledging that this is part of my story, but it doesn't have to be all of it? I want to find a way to honor my experience without letting it consume me. And I think I need help in learning how to sit with these difficult emotions without trying to push them away or let them overwhelm me.",
    "Therapist: That's insightful. What strengths have you drawn on to cope so far?",
    "Client: I suppose... my resilience. The fact that I'm here, talking about this, is a testament to that. And my adaptability \u2013 I've had to learn new ways of navigating the world after my experiences. There's also a part of me that's deeply compassionate, especially towards others who've experienced trauma. It's like... through my own pain, I've developed a greater capacity for empathy.",
    "Therapist: How might you apply those strengths moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I can use my resilience to keep facing these memories, even when it's tough. My adaptability could help me find new coping strategies when old ones aren't working. And maybe my compassion... maybe I can start directing some of that towards myself. Be a little gentler with my own struggles, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What's one small step you could take this week?",
    "Client: Hmm... Maybe I could start a journal? Write down my thoughts and feelings after these sessions, or when the memories come up. It might help me process things better, and maybe I'll start to see patterns or progress over time. And it could be a way to practice that self-compassion we talked about \u2013 giving myself a safe space to express everything without judgment.",
    "Therapist: Excellent idea. How are you feeling now compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, I think. Still a bit shaky, but not as overwhelmed. It's like... by talking about it, I've released some of the pressure that was building up inside. I'm tired, but it's a good kind of tired, if that makes sense? Like I've done some important work today.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Any final thoughts before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I think it's necessary. And I'm starting to believe that maybe, just maybe, I can get through this and come out stronger on the other side. It's a small hope, but it's there.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue this journey together. Take care until next time."
