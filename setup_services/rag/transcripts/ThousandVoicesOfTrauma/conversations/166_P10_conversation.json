    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Let's... let's just get it over with.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm at the base. It's early morning, the sun's barely up. The air smells like dust and diesel. I can hear the distant rumble of vehicles.",
    "Therapist: Good. What are you doing?",
    "Client: I'm suiting up. My hands are shaking as I fasten my vest. God, I'm so nervous. I've only been here a month, and already...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you?",
    "Client: About... about 60.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: We're loading into the trucks. Everyone's quiet. Too quiet. I catch a few stares. I know what they're thinking - the Asian girl doesn't belong here. I... I want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember to breathe. What do you hear?",
    "Client: The engines roaring to life. Someone's muttering a prayer. I grip my rifle tighter, my palms are sweaty.",
    "Therapist: And now?",
    "Client: We're moving. The road's bumpy, I'm jostling against the others. My heart's pounding so hard I think it might burst out of my chest.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that sensation. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe 75?",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a deafening explosion. The truck swerves. People are yelling. I... I can't breathe. Oh god, I can't...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Ms. Chen. You're here, in my office. You're safe.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... okay. I'm... I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: We're under attack. I stumble out of the truck, my ears ringing. There's dust everywhere. I can taste it, choking on it. Gunfire erupts around us.",
    "Therapist: What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I freeze. My training vanishes. I can't move. Someone shoves me, yelling at me to take cover. I fall, scraping my hands on the rough ground.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel in this moment?",
    "Client: Terrified. Useless. I... I'm letting everyone down. They were right, I don't belong here.",
    "Therapist: Remember, these are just memories. You're safe now. How's your distress?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. 90, maybe?",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... I manage to crawl behind a low wall. My hands are shaking so badly I can barely hold my rifle. I peer over the wall and...",
    "Therapist: What do you see?",
    "Client: Chaos. Smoke, flashes of gunfire. I see one of our guys go down. There's blood... so much blood.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I force myself to aim. To shoot. But I can't tell if I'm hitting anything. My vision's blurry with tears and sweat.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Angry. At myself. At this whole situation. Why am I here? Why did I think I could do this?",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are valid. Keep going.",
    "Client: The firefight feels like it lasts forever. At some point, I realize I'm screaming. My throat hurts. I can smell gunpowder and... and something worse.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's maxed out. 100. I can't... *sobs*",
    "Therapist: You're safe, Ms. Chen. Take a moment. Breathe with me.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* I... I'm okay. I can continue.",
    "Therapist: When you're ready.",
    "Client: Finally, it starts to quiet down. The gunfire becomes sporadic, then stops. I'm shaking all over. Someone calls out that it's clear.",
    "Therapist: What do you do then?",
    "Client: I... I stand up slowly. My legs feel like jelly. I look around and... oh god. There are bodies. Ours and theirs. The smell... *gags*",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. You're here, in my office.",

    "Client: It's... it's still high. 85, maybe?",

    "Therapist: What are you thinking?",
    "Client: That I'm a fraud. That I'll never fit in. Not here, not back home. I'm... I'm nobody.",
    "Therapist: Those are difficult thoughts. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Drained. Empty. Like... like I left a part of myself there in the dust.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down. Maybe 70?",
    "Therapist: That's good. You've done excellent work today, Ms. Chen. Let's start to bring you back to the present.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay. I... I can feel the chair beneath me. Hear the clock ticking.",
    "Therapist: Good. Open your eyes when you're ready.",
    "Client: *opens eyes* I... I made it through.",
    "Therapist: Yes, you did. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted. But... but also a little lighter? Like I've set down a heavy backpack.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after these sessions. You've shown incredible strength today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I never thought I could talk about this.",
    "Therapist: You've made significant progress. We'll work on processing these memories and emotions in our upcoming sessions.",
    "Client: I think... I think I'm ready for that now.",
    "Therapist: That's great to hear. Let's end here for today. Remember to use the coping strategies we've discussed if you feel overwhelmed later.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you, doctor.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Ms. Chen. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
