    "Therapist: Welcome, Amira. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to do this, but another part is scared. It's like my heart is racing already just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 5 or 6 out of 10. My palms are a bit sweaty.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. When you're ready, describe the scene.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm walking down the street near campus. It's evening, and the streetlights are just coming on. I can hear distant traffic and... and some shouting. My heart starts beating faster.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see... I see a group of men, maybe five or six of them. They're surrounding someone... oh god, it's a woman wearing a hijab. She looks terrified.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's happening now?",
    "Client: They're... they're yelling at her. Calling her names, telling her to \"go back where she came from.\" I feel frozen. I want to help, but I'm scared.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My throat is tight. My hands are shaking. I... I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Take a slow, deep breath. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: One of the men grabs her hijab. He's trying to pull it off. She's crying, pleading with them to stop. I... I can't just stand here!",
    "Therapist: What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I start walking towards them. My legs feel like lead. I'm terrified, but I can't let this happen. I shout, \"Hey! Leave her alone!\"",
    "Therapist: How do they react?",
    "Client: They turn towards me. Their faces... they look so angry. One of them starts walking towards me. He's saying something about me being a \"sympathizer.\" I feel like I'm going to throw up.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe even a 9. I'm shaking all over.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Amira. Take another deep breath. What happens next?",
    "Client: The man gets in my face. He's screaming at me, telling me I don't belong here either. I can smell alcohol on his breath. I'm trying to stand my ground, but I'm terrified.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: My heart is pounding so hard I think it might burst. My mouth is dry. I feel like I might pass out.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep breathing. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I try to push past him to get to the woman. But he grabs my arm. His grip is so tight, it hurts. I'm yelling for help, but no one's coming.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... I'm thinking this is it. They're going to hurt us both. I feel so helpless, so angry. Why is this happening? Why does no one care?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: Suddenly, I hear sirens. The men start to panic. They're looking around, trying to decide what to do. The one holding my arm lets go and shoves me hard. I stumble and fall.",
    "Therapist: How does that feel?",
    "Client: It hurts. My palms are scraped from the fall. But mostly, I feel... I feel relieved. And guilty for feeling relieved.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. What's happening now?",
    "Client: The men are running away. The woman is still there, crying. I get up and go to her. She's shaking so badly. I ask if she's okay, but she can't speak. We just... we just stand there, holding each other until the police arrive.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Amira. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down. Maybe a 7? I still feel shaky, but not as intense.",
    "Therapist: Good. Take a moment. What are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel angry. And sad. And scared. But also... also kind of proud that I tried to help. But mostly, I just feel exhausted.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. Let's stay with this scene. What happens when the police arrive?",
    "Client: They start asking questions. I try to explain what happened, but my voice is shaking. The woman is still too scared to speak. One of the officers is kind, but the other... he seems skeptical. He asks if we're sure we didn't provoke them somehow.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Furious. And helpless all over again. I want to scream at him, but I'm afraid that will just make things worse.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. What do you do?",
    "Client: I take a deep breath and try to stay calm. I tell him exactly what happened, that we were just walking and those men attacked us for no reason. I can hear the anger in my voice, but I try to keep it under control.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. What happens next?",
    "Client: They take our statements. The kind officer gives us information about victim support services. But as they're leaving, I hear the skeptical one mutter something about \"these people always causing trouble.\" I feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: That must be incredibly frustrating. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. And angry. And scared. I keep thinking about how easily it could happen again. To me, to her, to anyone who looks like us.",
    "Therapist: Those are understandable feelings. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's about a 6 now. The intensity has faded, but the emotions are still there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Let's continue. What happens after the police leave?",
    "Client: I stay with the woman for a while. Her name is Fatima. We sit on a nearby bench, both of us still shaking a little. We don't talk much, but there's a sense of... of shared understanding.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful connection. How does it feel?",
    "Client: It's... comforting, in a way. But also sad. I hate that we have this in common. I hate that this is something we have to fear.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: I offer to walk Fatima home. She lives in the same direction as me. As we walk, we start talking more. She tells me about her family, her studies. It feels... normal. Like we're just two students walking home.",
    "Therapist: How does that normalcy feel after what you've been through?",
    "Client: It's... it's strange. Almost surreal. But also... healing, I guess? Like a reminder that life goes on, even after something terrible happens.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 4. I still feel shaken, but there's a sense of... I don't know, resilience maybe?",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's stay with the scene. What happens when you reach Fatima's home?",
    "Client: We stop outside her building. For a moment, we just stand there. Then she hugs me, tightly. She thanks me for helping her, for walking her home. I feel... I feel overwhelmed with emotion.",
    "Therapist: What kind of emotions?",
    "Client: Sadness, relief, a sense of connection. And... and a kind of determination. Like, this shouldn't have happened, but we got through it together.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful mix of emotions. What happens next?",
    "Client: We exchange phone numbers. Fatima says she'd like to meet for coffee sometime, to talk more. I agree. As I watch her go into her building, I feel... I feel less alone.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant moment. How does it affect you?",
    "Client: It's like... like a small light in all this darkness. It doesn't erase what happened, but it helps. It makes me feel like maybe we can make things better, even if it's just in small ways.",
    "Therapist: That's a hopeful perspective. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 3. I still feel the weight of what happened, but it's not as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well, Amira. How do you feel about ending the exposure here?",
    "Client: I think... I think that's okay. It feels like a good place to stop.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Let's take a few deep breaths together. You've shown incredible strength today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was hard, but... but I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we end?",
    "Client: I just... I hope talking about this helps. I want to feel stronger, less afraid.",
    "Therapist: This is a process, and you're making great progress. We'll continue working together. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... okay. Better than I expected, actually.",
    "Therapist: That's great to hear. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later. We'll discuss this more next time.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you... for everything.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Amira. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
