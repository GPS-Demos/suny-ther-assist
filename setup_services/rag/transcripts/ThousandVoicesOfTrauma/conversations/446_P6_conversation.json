    "Therapist: Alright, Sarah. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, you can stop at any time. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll give it my best shot.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your SUDS rating. From 0 to 100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 40. My stomach feels a bit tight, but I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day of the earthquake. Describe what you see and feel.",
    "Client: I'm in my office... It's just a normal day. Suddenly, everything starts shaking. The bookshelves are rattling, and I can hear things falling off my desk. My heart is racing, and I'm frozen in place. I... I don't know what to do.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The shaking is getting stronger. I can hear people screaming in the hallway. I'm trying to get under my desk, but my legs feel weak. I'm... I'm so scared. I think I might die here.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 70. My hands are sweating, and my chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: The lights go out, and I can hear glass breaking. I'm under my desk now, but I feel so helpless. I'm thinking about my family, wondering if they're safe. The shaking seems to go on forever. I'm crying, praying for it to stop.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I feel... vulnerable. My heart is pounding, and I'm starting to feel dizzy. It's like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... 85. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Can you continue?",
    "Client: Yeah... The shaking finally stops, but I'm too scared to move. I can hear sirens outside and people crying. I'm trying to call my family, but the lines are down. I feel so alone and terrified.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What do you notice in your body?",
    "Client: My whole body is tense. I'm shaking, and I feel nauseous. It's like I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How would you rate your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's still at 85. I feel overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Remember, you're safe here. What happens as you leave your office?",
    "Client: I... I stumble out into the hallway. There's debris everywhere. I see a colleague with a head injury, and I try to help her. We make our way down the stairs, and it's chaos outside. Buildings are damaged, car alarms are blaring. I feel so small and powerless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm starting to feel a bit calmer. My SUDS is maybe 75 now. It's still intense, but I can handle it.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's stay with the memory a bit longer. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I join a group of people in a nearby park. We're all in shock, sharing what little information we have. I finally get through to my sister on the phone. Hearing her voice... I break down crying. I'm so relieved she's okay, but I'm still shaken to my core.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling as we near the end of this exercise?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. My SUDS is down to about 60. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I survived telling the story, just like I survived the actual earthquake.",
    "Therapist: That's a great observation. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end."
