    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm okay, I guess. A bit nervous about diving into this again.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We'll take it slow.",
    "Client: Thanks. I've been thinking about that day a lot since our last session. It's hard not to replay it in my mind.",
    "Therapist: You're showing courage. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Where should I start?",
    "Therapist: Start from the beginning of the memory.",
    "Client: Okay. So, I was sitting in my bunk at the base, scrolling through my phone. It was supposed to be downtime, you know? A chance to relax. But then I saw this notification. Someone had tagged me in a post. I clicked on it, and... God, it was awful. There was this photo of me from basic training, but they'd edited it. Made me look weak, pathetic. The comments were worse. People I thought were my friends, saying I didn't belong in the military, that I was a disgrace to my uniform.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I felt my stomach drop. My hands started shaking. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. All these people, some I didn't even know, piling on. Calling me names, saying I should quit, that I was a liability to my unit. I wanted to throw up. I kept scrolling, hoping to see someone defend me, but it just got worse and worse.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: It's hard. I feel so angry and humiliated all over again. I remember looking around the barracks, wondering if anyone else had seen it. I felt so alone, so exposed. Like everyone was laughing at me behind my back. I started to sweat, my heart was racing. I wanted to disappear.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: I... I closed the app, but I couldn't stop thinking about it. Those words, those edited images, they were burned into my brain. I couldn't focus on anything else. I skipped dinner that night, couldn't face anyone. I was afraid they'd seen it too, that they'd start mocking me to my face. I felt like such a coward, hiding in my bunk. But I didn't know what else to do.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's still so vivid, you know? I remember lying there, staring at the ceiling, feeling like my whole world was crumbling. Everything I'd worked for, all my training, it felt meaningless. Like one stupid post could undo it all. I kept thinking about my family back home, how disappointed they'd be if I quit. But in that moment, I seriously considered it. I felt so... worthless.",
    "Therapist: You're showing real strength. Keep going.",
    "Client: I barely slept that night. The next morning, I had to force myself to get up, to face everyone. I was sure they all knew, that they were all judging me. Every glance, every whisper felt like it was about me. I couldn't concentrate during drills. My performance suffered. I was making stupid mistakes, which only made me feel worse. It was like a vicious cycle I couldn't break out of.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... intense. My heart's racing just talking about it. I can feel that same panic, that same shame. But... I don't know, maybe it's a little less overwhelming than before? Talking about it... it helps, I think. Makes it feel less like this huge, dark secret I'm carrying around.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. You should be proud.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's still hard, though. I mean, I know rationally that it was just some jerks online, that it doesn't define me. But emotionally? It still hurts. I still sometimes catch myself wondering if they were right, if I really don't belong. It's like that post planted a seed of doubt that I can't fully shake.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are valid. You're processing well.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's just... frustrating, you know? I joined the military to serve, to make a difference. I never expected to be dealing with this kind of thing. It feels so... trivial compared to actual combat, but it affected me so deeply. I feel guilty for letting it get to me so much.",
    "Therapist: There's no need for guilt. Your reactions are normal.",
    "Client: I guess. It's just hard to reconcile. I mean, I've faced actual dangerous situations in training, but this? This is what broke me down. It makes me feel weak, like maybe I'm not cut out for this after all. And that thought terrifies me, because being in the military, it's not just a job for me. It's who I am, or at least, who I want to be.",
    "Therapist: You're not weak. You're confronting this bravely.",
    "Client: Thanks. I'm trying. It's just... it's changed how I interact with people. I'm more guarded now, always wondering if someone's going to use something against me. I don't post anything online anymore, I'm paranoid about what people might say or do. It's like I can't fully trust anyone, and that's not who I want to be.",
    "Therapist: Trust takes time. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I hope so. I want to get past this, to not let it define me. But it's hard. Every time I start to feel better, I remember those comments, those edited photos, and it all comes flooding back. I want to be stronger than this, but some days it feels impossible.",
    "Therapist: You are strong. This process proves that.",
    "Client: I guess you're right. I mean, I'm here, talking about it. That's something, right? A few months ago, I couldn't even think about it without having a panic attack. So maybe I am making progress. It's just... it's slow. And some days, it feels like I'm right back where I started.",
    "Therapist: Progress isn't always linear. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Yeah, I'm starting to see that. It's just... it's a journey, I guess. Some days are better than others. But being here, talking about it... it helps. Makes me feel less alone, less... broken. Like maybe I can get through this after all.",
    "Therapist: You absolutely can. Let's wrap up for today.",
    "Client: Okay. Thanks for listening. It means a lot to have someone who understands.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Same time next week?",
