    "Therapist: Welcome, Priya. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm feeling a bit jittery, to be honest. But I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. How would you rate your distress from 0 to 100?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 60? My stomach feels like it's in knots.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, you're safe here. Let's begin. Close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm... I'm standing outside the community center. It's where the group meets. The building is old, kind of rundown. There's peeling paint on the walls and... and I can smell incense drifting out from inside. My heart is starting to race a little.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I push open the heavy wooden door. The incense smell is stronger now, mixed with body odor and something else... maybe candle wax? I see people sitting in a circle on the floor. They all turn to look at me as I enter. Their eyes... they're so intense. I feel like they can see right through me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Maybe 75? My palms are sweating.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue.",
    "Client: The leader, Amar, he stands up and walks towards me. He's smiling, but it doesn't reach his eyes. They're cold. He says, \"Welcome, sister. We've been waiting for you.\" His voice is soft, almost hypnotic. I feel myself nodding, even though everything in me wants to run.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. But also... drawn in? It's like I can't look away from him. He takes my hand and leads me to the circle. His touch makes my skin crawl, but I don't pull away. I don't know why I don't pull away...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Priya. Remember, you're here now, safe in my office.",
    "Client: Right, right... okay. So, I sit down in the circle. Everyone's still staring at me. Amar starts talking about how we're all chosen, how we're going to change the world. His words... they're like honey, sweet and sticky. I can feel them seeping into my brain.",
    "Therapist: What's happening in your body as you remember this?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. It's hard to breathe. And I feel... small. Like I'm shrinking into myself.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... So, Amar's talking, and everyone's nodding along. Then he... he singles me out. Says I have a special purpose. That I need to prove my dedication. He tells me to stand up in front of everyone.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you experiencing?",
    "Client: I'm shaking. I don't want to stand up, but I do it anyway. My legs feel like jelly. Amar's looking at me with this... this hunger in his eyes. He says, \"Tell us your deepest shame, sister. Purge yourself of your past life.\"",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, Priya?",
    "Client: I... I feel sick. My stomach's churning. I want to run, but I can't move. It's like I'm frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're here now, not there. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. Maybe 85? I feel like I might throw up.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Ground yourself in the present.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... So, I'm standing there, and everyone's waiting. I can feel their eyes on me. I start talking, telling them about... about how I disappointed my parents, how I feel like a failure. The words just pour out of me. I can't stop them.",
    "Therapist: What's happening as you share this?",
    "Client: I... I feel exposed. Raw. Like they're all seeing the worst parts of me. But Amar... he's nodding, looking pleased. He says, \"Good, sister. Let it all out. We accept you. We are your family now.\"",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... confusing. Part of me feels relieved, accepted. But another part feels... violated? Like I've given away something precious.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: Amar comes over to me. He puts his hands on my shoulders. His touch... it's both comforting and terrifying. He says, \"You're one of us now. There's no turning back.\" And I... I believe him. I nod, even though inside I'm screaming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Priya. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My heart's pounding. It feels so real, like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Take a moment to ground yourself.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... So, after that, we all join hands. Amar starts chanting something. I don't understand the words, but they seem to vibrate through me. Everyone's swaying, eyes closed. I... I feel dizzy. Like the room is spinning.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 80? I feel lightheaded.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with the memory, but remember you're here now.",
    "Client: Right... So, the chanting gets louder. Faster. People start... start speaking in tongues? At least, that's what Amar calls it. It's chaos, but... controlled? Like Amar's orchestrating everything. And then... then he comes to me.",
    "Therapist: What happens when he approaches you?",
    "Client: He... he puts his hand on my forehead. Says he's going to \"open my third eye.\" His touch... it burns. Not physically, but... inside. I feel like he's reaching into my brain, scrambling everything. I... I start shaking uncontrollably.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm trembling. My hands are clammy. It's like I can still feel his touch.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... So, I'm shaking, and Amar's telling me to let go, to surrender. And I... I do. It's like something snaps inside me. I start babbling nonsense, my body jerking around. Part of me is horrified, but another part feels... free? Like I'm floating above myself.",
    "Therapist: What's happening around you as this occurs?",
    "Client: Everyone's... cheering? Clapping? They're saying I've been \"touched by the divine.\" Amar looks... triumphant. Like he's won something. And I... I feel drained. Empty. But also... special? Like I belong.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel now, looking back?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. I feel angry. Violated. But also... ashamed? Like I should have been stronger, should have resisted more.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: The... the session winds down. People start leaving, but they all come to hug me first. Telling me how blessed I am, how lucky. Amar... he hangs back. Waits until we're alone.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What occurs?",
    "Client: He... he comes close. Too close. Says I have great potential, that he has big plans for me. His breath smells like mint and something... sour. He touches my face, and I... I freeze. Can't move, can't speak.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, Priya?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm nauseous. My skin's crawling. I can almost smell his breath again.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. Remember where you are now.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... So, Amar's there, touching my face. He says... he says I need to cut ties with my family, my friends. That they'll hold me back from my true potential. And I... I nod. I agree. Even though inside, I'm screaming.",
    "Therapist: That sounds very difficult. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 75? I feel... dirty. Like I need to scrub my skin.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Priya. We're almost done. Can you describe how the memory ends?",
    "Client: I... I leave the community center. It's dark outside now. The street feels... different. Like I'm seeing it through new eyes. But I also feel... hollow? Like I've left a part of myself behind. I walk home in a daze, already planning how I'll lie to my parents about where I've been.",
    "Therapist: And how do you feel now, as the memory concludes?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. But also... angry? At Amar, at myself. And scared... scared of how easily I got pulled in.",
    "Therapist: Those are all normal reactions. Let's take a deep breath together.",
    "Client: *deep breath*",
    "Therapist: Well done, Priya. How would you rate your distress now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down some. Maybe a 60? I feel... shaky, but also... lighter? Like I've let something out.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You did excellent work today. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves before we end the session."
