    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that night of the home invasion. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I'm in my living room. It's late, maybe around 11 PM. I'm reading a book, and my husband is upstairs sleeping. The house is quiet, except for the ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear a noise outside. At first, I think it's just the wind, but then I hear it again. It sounds like someone's trying to force the back door open. My heart starts racing, and I feel frozen in my chair.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The noise gets louder, and suddenly I hear a crash. They've broken through the door. I can hear heavy footsteps and voices - at least two men. I'm terrified, but I can't move. I'm just sitting there, clutching my book, hoping they won't come into the living room.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel scared. You're safe here.",
    "Client: But they do come in. Two men in dark clothes, wearing masks. One of them sees me and yells, \"Don't move!\" I'm shaking uncontrollably. I want to scream for my husband, but no sound comes out. The other man starts ransacking the room, throwing things around, looking for valuables.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: The man watching me keeps telling me to shut up, even though I'm not making any noise. I'm so scared he's going to hurt me. I can hear my husband stirring upstairs, and I'm terrified they'll go up there and hurt him too.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel afraid. Keep going.",
    "Client: My husband calls out, asking if everything's okay. The men freeze for a second, then the one guarding me pushes me to the floor. I hit my head on the coffee table. Everything's spinning, and I can taste blood in my mouth.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: I hear my husband coming down the stairs. The men are shouting at each other, panicking. One of them runs towards the stairs. There's a scuffle, and I hear my husband cry out in pain. I'm on the floor, my vision blurry, feeling helpless and terrified.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: It all happens so fast after that. There's more shouting, things breaking, and then they're gone. Just like that. The house is quiet again, but it feels so wrong. I manage to get up, stumbling to the stairs. My husband is there, holding his arm. We're both in shock, just staring at each other, unable to believe what just happened.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. My heart is still racing, and I can feel that fear lingering. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I survived reliving it.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. You've shown great courage.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to talk about, but it does feel a little easier each time. I just wish I could shake this feeling of vulnerability, you know? Like our home isn't safe anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We'll work on that feeling.",
    "Client: I hope so. Sometimes I still wake up in the middle of the night, thinking I hear noises. My husband installed a security system, but I still don't feel completely at ease. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. It takes time to feel safe again.",
    "Client: I guess you're right. It's just... it changed everything, you know? I used to love quiet evenings at home, but now they make me anxious. I keep thinking about what I could have done differently that night.",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. You did the best you could.",
    "Client: I know that logically, but emotionally... it's harder to accept. I keep thinking if I had screamed earlier or if we had better locks... maybe it wouldn't have happened.",
    "Therapist: Those thoughts are common, but not helpful.",
    "Client: You're right. I'm trying to focus on the present, on feeling safe now. But it's a struggle. Some days are better than others. Today, talking about it... it was hard, but I feel like I'm making progress. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're showing real strength and progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your guidance through this. It's not easy, but I'm determined to work through it. I want to feel safe in my home again, to enjoy those quiet evenings without fear. I know it'll take time, but I'm willing to put in the effort.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. We'll continue working together.",
    "Client: I'm grateful for that. It helps to know I'm not alone in this journey. Sometimes, I feel silly for still being so affected by it, especially at my age. But then I remind myself that trauma doesn't have an age limit, right?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. Trauma can affect anyone, at any age.",
    "Client: That's comforting to hear. I'm learning to be kinder to myself through this process. It's not always easy, but sessions like this help me see my progress. Even though reliving it is difficult, I feel a bit lighter afterward, like I'm slowly reclaiming my sense of security.",
    "Therapist: You're making excellent progress. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... tired, but in a good way. Like I've done something important. There's still a lingering anxiety, but it's not as overwhelming as it was when we started. I think I'm ready to end for today, if that's okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've done very well today. Take care."
