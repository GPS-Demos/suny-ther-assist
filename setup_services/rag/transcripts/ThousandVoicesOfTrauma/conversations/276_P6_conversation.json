    "Therapist: Welcome back, Maria. Are you ready to continue our imaginal exposure work today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's begin. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm at the bank... It's a normal day, and I'm waiting in line to deposit a check. Suddenly, there's shouting, and I see a man with a gun. My heart starts racing, and I can't believe this is happening.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, about a 6... I can feel my palms getting sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Keep going.",
    "Client: The man is yelling at everyone to get down on the floor. I'm frozen for a moment, but then I slowly lower myself. I can hear a child crying nearby, and it's making me even more anxious. I'm trying to stay calm, but my mind is racing with worst-case scenarios.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to an 8. I can feel my chest tightening as I remember the fear.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: The robber is demanding money from the tellers. His voice is so angry, and I'm terrified he might hurt someone. I keep thinking about my family, wondering if I'll see them again. The floor is cold and hard beneath me, and I can smell the cleaning products they used earlier.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I hear sirens in the distance, and the robber starts to panic. He's shouting even louder now, and I'm worried he might start shooting. My whole body is shaking, and I'm trying not to make any noise. The waiting feels endless, and I'm struggling to keep my breathing under control.",
    "Therapist: How about now?",
    "Client: Still a 9... maybe even a 9.5. I feel so helpless and scared.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud crash as the police break in. Everything happens so fast - there's yelling, movement, and then it's over. The robber is on the ground, and officers are helping us up. I'm trembling all over, and I can barely stand. The relief is overwhelming, but I still feel so shaken.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down. Maybe a 7 now. I'm feeling drained, but also relieved that it's over.",
    "Therapist: That's good. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... okay. It's getting easier to talk about, even though it's still hard.",
    "Therapist: You did very well today, Maria. We'll continue working through this."
