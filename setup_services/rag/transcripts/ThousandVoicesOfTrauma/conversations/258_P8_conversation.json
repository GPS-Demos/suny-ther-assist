    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. My heart is still pounding. I can feel this tightness in my chest, like I can't get enough air. The memory feels so vivid, like I'm right back there in that room.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: I keep seeing his face. The man who... who took us hostage. His eyes were so cold, so empty. I remember feeling so helpless, like my whole world was crumbling around me. I couldn't move, couldn't think. It's like my body was there, but my mind was somewhere else entirely.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What emotions are you experiencing?",
    "Client: Fear. Overwhelming fear. But also... anger? I'm angry that I froze, that I couldn't do anything to help myself or the others. And there's this deep sadness, like a pit in my stomach. I feel... I feel ashamed. Like somehow, it was my fault.",
    "Therapist: It's important to remember that your reactions were normal.",
    "Client: Were they? I mean, I just sat there. I didn't try to escape or fight back. I keep thinking about what I should have done differently. Maybe if I had been braver or smarter, things would have turned out differently. It's just... it's hard not to blame myself.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts affect you now?",
    "Client: They... they make me feel weak. Vulnerable. Like I can't trust myself to handle difficult situations. I find myself constantly on edge, always looking over my shoulder. It's exhausting. And it's affecting my relationships too. I push people away because I'm afraid of being hurt again.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice in your body as you share this?",
    "Client: My shoulders are so tense. I can feel this knot in my stomach, and my hands are shaking a little. It's like my body is preparing for something bad to happen, even though I know I'm safe here. I just want to curl up and disappear sometimes.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really challenging. What helps you feel grounded?",
    "Client: I... I try to focus on my breathing. Sometimes I count things around me, like you taught me. It helps a little. And talking about it, as hard as it is, it does make me feel less alone. Like maybe I'm not crazy for feeling this way.",
    "Therapist: You're definitely not crazy. These are normal responses to trauma.",
    "Client: I keep telling myself that, but it's hard to believe sometimes. There are moments when I feel like I'm making progress, like I'm starting to heal. But then something will trigger a memory, and I'm right back there. It's like... like I'm on a rollercoaster I can't get off.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with those moments?",
    "Client: I try to use the techniques we've practiced. Deep breathing, grounding exercises. Sometimes I call a friend or family member, just to hear a friendly voice. But other times... I'll be honest, sometimes I just want to numb everything out. I know it's not healthy, but the pain feels so overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: It's good that you're aware of that impulse. What else?",
    "Client: I've been trying to write more, like you suggested. It helps sometimes, getting the thoughts out of my head and onto paper. And I've been going on walks, trying to connect with nature. It doesn't always work, but when it does, I feel a little more... I don't know, connected to the world?",
    "Therapist: That's a great observation. How does that connection feel?",
    "Client: It feels... calming. Like maybe the world isn't as scary as my mind makes it out to be. For a moment, I can forget about what happened and just exist. But then the guilt creeps in, like I shouldn't be allowed to feel peace or happiness after what happened.",
    "Therapist: Why do you think you feel that guilt?",
    "Client: I... I guess part of me feels like I don't deserve to move on. Like if I start to feel better, I'm somehow betraying the memory of what happened. And there's this fear that if I let my guard down, something bad will happen again. It's like I'm stuck between wanting to heal and being afraid to.",
    "Therapist: That's a common struggle. How do you navigate that?",
    "Client: It's hard. Some days are better than others. I try to remind myself that healing doesn't mean forgetting. That I can honor what happened while still trying to move forward. But it's a constant battle with myself. I want to feel normal again, but I'm not even sure what normal is anymore.",
    "Therapist: What does \"normal\" mean to you now?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. I guess normal would be feeling safe again. Being able to trust people, to form connections without this constant fear. To be able to go about my day without feeling like I'm constantly looking over my shoulder. To sleep through the night without nightmares. Just... to feel like myself again, whoever that is now.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful reflection. How does it feel to articulate that?",
    "Client: It's... it's both scary and liberating. Scary because it makes me realize how much the trauma has changed me. But liberating because... well, maybe it gives me something to work towards? Like, now that I can put it into words, maybe I can start to figure out how to get there. It's overwhelming, but also... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful?",
    "Therapist: That hope is important. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm noticing that as we talk, my body feels a little less tense. The knot in my stomach is still there, but it's not as tight. And I feel... I feel seen, I guess? Like maybe I'm not alone in this journey. It's still hard, and I know there's a long way to go, but maybe... maybe I can do this. Maybe I am stronger than I thought.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How can you carry this forward?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to be kinder to myself. To recognize that healing isn't linear, and that's okay. Maybe I can try to focus more on those moments of peace, even if they're brief. And to keep talking about it, even when it's hard. Because this, right here? It feels like a step forward, even if it's a small one.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent insight. We're out of time, but let's continue next session.",
    "Client: Thank you. This was hard, but... I think it was good. I feel drained, but also a little lighter. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's very common. Take care of yourself this week.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you for listening and for helping me make sense of all this. I'll see you next week."
