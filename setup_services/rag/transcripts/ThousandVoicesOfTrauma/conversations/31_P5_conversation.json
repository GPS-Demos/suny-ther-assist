    "Therapist: Let's discuss the imaginal exposure we'll be doing today. How are you feeling about it?",
    "Client: I'm... nervous, to be honest. The idea of reliving that airplane crash... it's overwhelming. I've spent so much time trying to forget it, you know? And now you're asking me to purposely remember it? It's scary.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Many feel this way initially. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about losing control. What if I panic? Or what if it brings back all those terrible feelings and I can't handle it? I've been using substances to cope, and I'm afraid this might trigger a relapse.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How do you think we could address them?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. Maybe... could we have a safe word if it gets too intense? And I'd like to know exactly what to expect. Will you be guiding me through it? How long will it last?",
    "Therapist: Excellent suggestions. Let's establish a safe word and go over the process. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. But can you explain why this is necessary? How is reliving trauma supposed to help me?",
    "Therapist: It helps by processing the memory in a safe environment. What questions do you have about that?",
    "Client: I guess I'm wondering how it's different from just remembering it on my own. And how will I know if it's working? Will I feel better right away, or is it a gradual process?",
    "Therapist: It's more structured than casual remembering. Results vary, but often it's gradual. How does that sound to you?",
    "Client: That makes sense. I appreciate your patience with all my questions. I'm still nervous, but I think I'm ready to give it a try. Can we start slowly?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll go at your pace. Your courage is commendable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Okay, let's do it. I'm taking a deep breath... alright, I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Thank you for being here with me through this."
