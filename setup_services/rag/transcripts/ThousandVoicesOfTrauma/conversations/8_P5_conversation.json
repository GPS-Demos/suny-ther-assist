    "Therapist: Mrs. Rodriguez, today we'll begin imaginal exposure. Are you ready to discuss this?",
    "Client: I think so, Dr. Thompson. But I'm feeling a bit nervous. What exactly does imaginal exposure involve?",
    "Therapist: It's a technique where you'll revisit your trauma memory in a safe environment. How does that sound?",
    "Client: Oh, I see. To be honest, it sounds a bit scary. I've tried so hard to avoid thinking about the hurricane and its aftermath. The idea of purposely remembering it makes me anxious. Will it be too overwhelming?",
    "Therapist: Your concern is valid. We'll go at your pace. How do you feel about trying?",
    "Client: Well, I trust you, Dr. Thompson. If you think it will help, I'm willing to give it a try. But can you tell me more about what to expect? Will I have to relive everything in detail?",
    "Therapist: You'll describe the event as if it's happening now. We'll start slowly. How does that approach sound?",
    "Client: That makes sense, I suppose. It's just... I've spent so long trying to forget. The thought of bringing it all back up is daunting. Will this really help with my nightmares and flashbacks?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it can reduce those symptoms. Your bravery is commendable. Any other concerns?",
    "Client: Thank you for saying that. I do have one more question. What if I get too upset or can't continue? I'm worried I might lose control or have a panic attack like I sometimes do when I think about the disaster.",
    "Therapist: We can pause anytime. You're in control here. How does that reassurance feel?",
    "Client: That's a relief to hear. Knowing I can stop if it becomes too much helps me feel more comfortable with the idea. I appreciate your patience with all my questions, Dr. Thompson. I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be to face this.",
    "Therapist: Your readiness is a big step. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do it. I'm still nervous, but I understand the importance of this process. I want to get better, to stop letting this trauma control my life. It's affected my relationship with my husband and my work. If this can help me move forward, then I'm willing to face these difficult memories.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is admirable. Let's start gently. Close your eyes when ready.",
    "Client: Okay, I'm closing my eyes now. My heart is racing a bit, but I'm trying to stay calm. I can do this, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're safe here. Take a deep breath. When you're ready, begin."
