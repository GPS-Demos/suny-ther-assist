    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Honestly, doc, I'm feeling a bit on edge. I know we're going to dive into some heavy stuff, and part of me wants to just bolt out of here. But I'm trying to remind myself why I'm doing this.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your honesty. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Uh, I'd say about a 6 right now. My hands are a little shaky.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, let's do this. I'm as ready as I'll ever be.",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes and take us to the moment of the animal attack.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in Afghanistan. It's late, maybe around 2 AM. I'm on patrol with my unit near this small village. The air is dry, and there's this eerie silence. We're moving slowly, carefully... Oh god, I can feel my heart racing already.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with it. What do you see?",
    "Client: We're approaching this abandoned building. It's dark, but I can make out the crumbling walls. Suddenly, I hear this low growl. Before I can react, this massive dog - no, more like a wolf - lunges out of the shadows. Its eyes... they're glowing in the moonlight. I freeze. I can't move. It's coming straight for me.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The dog's teeth... they're bared. I can see the saliva dripping. It's all happening so fast. I try to raise my weapon, but my arms feel like lead. The dog leaps, and I feel this searing pain in my leg as its jaws clamp down. I'm screaming, but it sounds distant, like it's not even me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Terror. Pure terror. And shame. Why can't I fight back? I'm a soldier, for crying out loud! But I'm just... frozen. The pain is intense, burning. I can feel the dog shaking its head, tearing into my flesh. My buddies are yelling, but it all sounds muffled.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Carlos. What happens next?",
    "Client: One of my teammates - I think it's Rodriguez - he's firing his weapon. The sound is deafening. The dog yelps and releases my leg. There's blood everywhere. My blood. I'm on the ground, panting, trying to crawl away. The adrenaline is pumping so hard I can barely think straight.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. My hands are shaking so bad.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here in my office. You're safe. Take a moment to ground yourself.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm here. I'm safe. But man, it feels so real.",
    "Therapist: When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: Right... So, I'm on the ground. The pain is excruciating. My leg feels like it's on fire. Rodriguez is kneeling beside me, applying pressure to the wound. I can hear him calling for a medic. The dog is lying motionless a few feet away. I keep staring at it, afraid it'll get up again.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I feel so weak. Useless. I should've been faster, should've reacted better. What kind of soldier gets taken down by a dog? And now I'm a liability to my team. They have to stop the mission because of me. I'm letting everyone down.",
    "Therapist: Those are tough emotions. How does your body feel?",
    "Client: My whole body's tense. My jaw is clenched so tight it hurts. And I feel... I feel cold. Like I'm going into shock or something. The medic arrives, and he's cutting away my pants leg. When I see the wound, I nearly throw up. It's bad, really bad.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you see, hear, smell?",
    "Client: I see... torn flesh. Blood everywhere. I can smell the coppery scent of blood mixed with dirt and gunpowder. I hear the medic talking, but it's like I'm underwater. Everything's muffled. My teammates are securing the area, their voices tense and urgent.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's still at a 9. My heart's pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Carlos. Keep going.",
    "Client: They're... they're loading me onto a stretcher. Every movement sends waves of pain through my body. I'm being carried to the extraction point. The sky... I remember looking up at the sky. It's so clear, so full of stars. It seems wrong, you know? Like how can the sky be so beautiful when I'm in so much pain?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful observation. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I notice... I notice how young everyone looks. We're all just kids, really. Playing at being soldiers until something like this happens. And now, lying here, I feel so... vulnerable. So mortal. I keep thinking, \"What if it had been my throat instead of my leg?\"",
    "Therapist: Those are heavy thoughts. How does it feel to express them?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a bit of a relief. I've never said that out loud before. But it's also scary, you know? Admitting how close I came to... to dying.",
    "Therapist: That's very brave of you to share. What happens next?",
    "Client: We reach the helicopter. The noise is deafening, the rotors kicking up dust everywhere. They load me in, and as we take off, I get one last look at the village. It looks so small from up here. I remember thinking how bizarre it was that my life changed so dramatically in such a tiny, unremarkable place.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Both in the memory and here, now. My SUDS is down to about a 7. I feel drained.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've done excellent work today. Let's start winding down.",
    "Client: Okay... yeah. In the helicopter, I'm starting to feel the effects of the painkillers. Everything's getting hazy. I keep replaying the attack in my mind, wondering what I could've done differently. But mostly, I'm just grateful to be alive.",
    "Therapist: That's a good place to end. Let's bring you back to the present.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm opening my eyes now. Wow, that was... intense.",
    "Therapist: You did very well, Carlos. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... wrung out. But also, kind of relieved? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 4, I think. I'm still a bit shaky, but I feel more... I don't know, grounded?",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's take a few minutes to debrief and discuss coping strategies for the rest of your day.",
    "Client: Yeah, that sounds good. I could use some tips on how to handle these memories when they come up outside of here.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's start with some grounding techniques..."
