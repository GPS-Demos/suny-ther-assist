    "Therapist: Good morning, John. How are you feeling about our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: Morning, Doc. To be honest, I'm a bit on edge. This whole process... it's not easy to face these memories head-on.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: I'd say... maybe a 40? My stomach's a bit knotted up.",
    "Therapist: Okay, thank you. Remember, we'll go at your pace. When you're ready, close your eyes and describe the memory we've been working on.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Alright... I'm closing my eyes. I'm... I'm back in my old apartment. It's about 25 years ago. The divorce papers just came through, and I'm sitting on the edge of my bed. The room feels so empty now that half of our things are gone. I can smell the cardboard from the moving boxes...",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... hollow. Like someone's scooped out my insides. My hands are shaking a little as I hold the papers. I keep reading the words over and over, but they're not sinking in.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep describing what's happening.",
    "Client: I stand up and walk to the window. It's raining outside, typical Seattle weather. The drops on the glass make everything look blurry, distorted. It matches how I feel inside. I'm thinking about how I got here, about the affair, about... about what happened when I was younger.",
    "Therapist: Stay present in that moment. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: (Voice wavering) I'm... I'm angry. At her for cheating, at myself for not being enough. But mostly, I'm furious at... at him. The man who... who abused me as a kid. I'm wondering if that's why I couldn't make my marriage work. If I'm just... broken goods.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe, John. You're safe here. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 65. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing great. Keep going when you're ready.",
    "Client: I turn away from the window and catch my reflection in the mirror. I look older, tired. I can see that scared little boy in my eyes, the one who never told anyone what happened. I want to reach out to him, to tell him it wasn't his fault. But instead, I just... I just start crying.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: I sink down onto the floor, my back against the bed. The divorce papers are scattered around me. I'm sobbing now, really letting it out for the first time since she left. It feels like everything is crumbling \u2013 my marriage, my sense of self, the walls I've built up for decades.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, John. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's... intense. My SUDS is probably around 80 now. I can feel my heart racing.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here in the present, and you're safe.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) Okay... okay. In the memory, I'm starting to calm down a bit. My sobs are turning into these quiet, hiccuping breaths. I look at the papers again, and suddenly I'm hit with this overwhelming sense of shame. I feel like I've failed at everything \u2013 being a husband, being a man. I can hear his voice in my head, the abuser, telling me I'm worthless.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it, John. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I... I start to get angry again. I crumple up one of the papers and throw it across the room. It doesn't help. I want to scream, to break something, but I don't. Instead, I just sit there, feeling lost and alone. The rain is getting heavier outside, and I can hear it pounding on the roof.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in that moment?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... I'm thinking that maybe this is all I deserve. That I'll always be alone, that I'll never be able to have a real relationship. I'm wondering if I should just give up, stop trying. The weight of it all feels crushing.",
    "Therapist: Remember, these are just thoughts. They're not facts. How's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still pretty high. Maybe 85? I feel like I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: Let's take a moment. Breathe in for four counts, hold for four, then out for four.",
    "Client: (Follows the breathing exercise) Okay... that helps a little.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue with the memory.",
    "Client: I... I eventually pull myself up off the floor. My legs feel shaky, like I've run a marathon. I walk to the kitchen, my feet dragging. The apartment feels so big and empty now. I pour myself a glass of water, but my hand is trembling so much I spill some on the counter.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My whole body feels heavy, like I'm moving through molasses. My eyes are burning from crying, and my throat feels raw. I lean against the kitchen counter, trying to steady myself.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I look at the clock on the microwave. It's late afternoon, but it feels like time has stopped. I realize I haven't eaten all day, but the thought of food makes me nauseous. I catch a glimpse of our... of my calendar on the fridge. There are all these crossed-out plans \u2013 dinners, weekend trips, things we were supposed to do together.",
    "Therapist: How does seeing that make you feel?",
    "Client: It's like a punch to the gut. All these little reminders of what I've lost. I feel this wave of loneliness wash over me. I've never felt so isolated, so... untethered. I start thinking about my childhood again, about how I've always felt like an outsider, even in my own marriage.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings, John. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I... I slide down to sit on the kitchen floor. The tile is cold against my skin. I'm hit with this overwhelming urge to call someone, anyone. But who? My wife is gone. I never told my friends or family about the abuse. I feel like I'm drowning in secrets and shame.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 90. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Remember, you're here in the present. You're safe.",
    "Client: (Takes several deep breaths) Okay... okay. In the memory, I'm still on the kitchen floor. I'm... I'm starting to feel angry again. Not just at my wife or the abuser, but at myself. For keeping quiet all these years, for letting it affect my life so much. I slam my fist against the cabinet, and the pain... it feels good. It feels real.",
    "Therapist: Remember, John, you're not there now. You're here, and you're safe.",
    "Client: Right... right. I know. In the memory, I... I finally pull myself up. I feel drained, exhausted. I stumble back to the bedroom and collapse on the bed. The divorce papers are still scattered on the floor. I stare at the ceiling, feeling numb.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking at this point?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking that I need help. That I can't keep living like this, carrying all this pain and shame. For the first time, I'm considering telling someone about the abuse. It's terrifying, but... but also a little bit freeing.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: My SUDS is coming down a bit. Maybe to 75? I feel... drained, but also like something's shifted.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well, John. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Take a few deep breaths.",
    "Client: (Breathes deeply) Okay... I'm here. That was... that was intense.",
    "Therapist: It was. You showed a lot of courage. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. But also... I don't know. Maybe a little lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's often how it feels after these sessions. You've done great work today, John.",
    "Client: Thank you, Doc. It's... it's not easy, but I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves before we end the session."
