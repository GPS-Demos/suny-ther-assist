    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we've been working up to this, but talking about the incident with the police still makes my stomach churn.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm standing on the sidewalk outside my office building. It's a warm afternoon, and I can hear traffic noise all around me. I'm waiting for my husband to pick me up after work.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I notice a commotion down the street. There's shouting, and I see a man running. He looks terrified. Behind him, there are two police officers chasing him. They're yelling at him to stop, but he keeps running.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now? Give me a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, about a 4 or 5. I'm starting to feel tense, remembering it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The man is getting closer to where I'm standing. He's... he's looking around frantically, like he's trying to find somewhere to hide. The police are gaining on him. I can see their faces now - they look angry, determined.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you notice about your body?",
    "Client: My heart is starting to race. I can feel my palms getting sweaty. I... I want to move, to get out of the way, but I feel frozen.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember, you're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: The man reaches me. He's gasping for breath, and there's fear in his eyes. He grabs my arm, using me as a shield. I can feel his grip, tight and desperate. The police are just a few meters away now.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to a 7. This is when it all goes wrong.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Stay with it. What do you see and hear?",
    "Client: The police are shouting, telling the man to let me go. One of them has his hand on his gun. I can smell the man's sweat, hear his ragged breathing next to my ear. I'm trying to stay calm, but inside I'm screaming.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm shaking. My legs feel weak, and there's this cold feeling in my stomach. I... I think I might throw up.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Remember, you're here in the room with me. You're safe. Keep going.",
    "Client: Suddenly, everything happens so fast. The man pushes me towards the police and tries to run. One of the officers grabs me to stop me from falling, but the other one... he... he tackles the man. They both hit the ground hard.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that scene. What do you notice?",
    "Client: There's so much noise. The man is yelling, the police are shouting. I can hear people around us gasping, some are screaming. The officer who tackled the man is on top of him now, trying to handcuff him.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe even a 9. I can't... I can't watch this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Sarah. Remember, you're here with me. Take a deep breath. Can you tell me what you see next?",
    "Client: The man is struggling, trying to get away. The officer... he's getting more aggressive. He's yelling at the man to stop resisting, but... but the man looks terrified. He's not trying to fight, he's just panicking.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel watching this?",
    "Client: I feel helpless. Scared. I want to do something, say something, but I'm paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: The officer... he... he pulls out his baton. He starts hitting the man. I can hear the impact, see the man flinching with each blow. It's... it's too much. I can't... I can't watch this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Remember, you're here in the room. Can you feel the chair beneath you?",
    "Client: Yes... yes, I can. It's... it's grounding me a bit.",
    "Therapist: Good. Take a deep breath. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: I... I find my voice. I start yelling at the officer to stop. Other people around us are doing the same. The man on the ground is crying out in pain. The other officer, the one who caught me, he's just standing there, watching.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a solid 9. I feel sick.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Remember, you're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: More police cars arrive. The sirens are so loud, piercing. Everything's chaos. Someone pulls me away from the scene. I can't see what's happening anymore, but I can still hear the man's cries.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel right now?",
    "Client: I'm shaking all over. My throat feels tight, like I can't breathe properly. I... I think I'm going to be sick.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Sarah. Feel the air filling your lungs. You're here, in this room, and you're safe.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm trying to breathe.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, tell me what happens next.",
    "Client: I... I'm sitting on the curb now. Someone's put a blanket around my shoulders. I can see paramedics arriving, rushing towards where the man is. The police are trying to keep people back, but everyone's shouting, angry.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: I feel... numb. Shocked. Like this can't be real. But at the same time, everything's so vivid. The sounds, the smells... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction to trauma. You're doing really well. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8 now. I feel drained.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. We're almost done. Can you tell me how the scene ends?",
    "Client: My husband arrives. He's frantic, pushing through the crowd to get to me. When he reaches me, he wraps his arms around me, and I just... I just break down. I'm sobbing into his chest, and he's holding me tight, telling me it's going to be okay.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel now, as your husband holds you?",
    "Client: I feel... safer. But also guilty. Guilty that I couldn't do more to help the man. Angry at the police. And... and scared. So scared about what I just witnessed.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings, Sarah. You've done incredibly well today. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Can you open your eyes and look around the room?",
    "Client: (opens eyes) Yes... yes, I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. Take a few deep breaths. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down. Maybe a 6 now.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You've made excellent progress today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted. Drained. But... but also a little relieved. Like I've let something out that I've been holding in for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after an exposure session. You've done very well, Sarah. We'll spend the rest of our time debriefing and ensuring you feel grounded before you leave. Is there anything you'd like to share or ask right now?",
    "Client: I... I think I just need a moment to collect myself. This was intense, but... but I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: Take all the time you need. I'm here to support you. We'll process this experience together and continue to work on your healing journey."
