    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mr. Khalil?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. It's like I was right back there in that moment, you know? My heart is still racing a bit, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's strange how vivid it all becomes when I close my eyes and really focus on the memory.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: Well, I keep seeing flashes of that night. The sound of glass shattering, my wife's frightened face, the feeling of helplessness... It's all mixed up with this overwhelming sense of guilt. I should have done more to protect her, you know? I'm supposed to be the man of the house, but in that moment, I froze. I just... I just stood there.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What emotions are you experiencing as you recall this?",
    "Client: Shame, definitely. A lot of shame. And anger, both at myself and at the intruder. There's fear too, a kind of residual fear that lingers even now, years later. It's like... like I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop, you know? Always on edge, expecting something bad to happen.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel right now?",
    "Client: Tense. Very tense. My shoulders are all bunched up, and I notice I'm clenching my jaw. There's this knot in my stomach too, like I'm about to be sick. It's funny, isn't it? How our bodies hold onto these memories, even when we try to forget.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how different things could have been if I had reacted differently. If I had been braver, stronger. Maybe we wouldn't have lost so much that night. Not just our belongings, but our sense of safety, you know? And then I think about how this has affected my relationship with my wife. She says she doesn't blame me, but sometimes I catch her looking at me, and I wonder... I wonder if she sees me differently now. Less of a protector, more of a... I don't know, a liability?",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts make you feel?",
    "Client: Sad. Incredibly sad. And... and a bit lost, I suppose. It's like this incident has redefined who I am, both to myself and to my family. I used to be confident, sure of my place in the world. Now, I second-guess everything. Every creak in the house at night, every stranger on the street... it all feels like a potential threat. And I hate that. I hate that I've become this person who's always afraid.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about how you're coping with these feelings?",
    "Client: I... I guess I've been trying to push them down, to ignore them. But they always seem to bubble up, especially at night when I'm trying to sleep. I've been drinking more than I should, I know that. It helps numb things for a while, but it's not really solving anything. And I've been withdrawing from my friends and family. It's just... it's easier sometimes to be alone than to pretend everything's okay.",
    "Therapist: How does sharing this now feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. Really hard. But there's also a sense of relief, I think. Like I'm finally letting out this breath I've been holding for years. I didn't realize how much I needed to talk about this, to really examine these feelings. It's painful, but it's also... I don't know, maybe necessary? Like lancing a wound to let it heal properly.",
    "Therapist: What's your biggest fear in confronting these memories?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm afraid of falling apart completely. Of not being able to put myself back together once I really start digging into all of this. And I'm afraid of how my family might see me if they knew how deeply this has affected me. I've tried so hard to be strong for them, to pretend that I'm okay. What if they can't handle seeing me vulnerable like this?",
    "Therapist: How might facing these fears change things for you?",
    "Client: That's... that's a tough question. I suppose it could go either way, couldn't it? On one hand, maybe facing these fears head-on could help me process everything and move forward. Maybe I could finally start to feel like myself again, to regain some of that confidence I've lost. But on the other hand, what if it just makes everything worse? What if I open this Pandora's box and can't close it again?",
    "Therapist: What gives you hope in this process?",
    "Client: Hope... Well, I guess the fact that I'm here, talking about it. That's something, right? And my wife... she's been so patient, so supportive. Even when I push her away, she's still there. Maybe... maybe facing this could bring us closer together. And I think about my kids too. I want to be the father they deserve, not this shell of a person I've become. So yeah, there's hope in that. In the possibility of reclaiming my life, my relationships.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's scary, I won't lie. But I think... I think it's necessary. I can't keep living like this, always on edge, always afraid. And talking about it today, as hard as it was, it felt like... like taking a step in the right direction. So yes, I want to continue. It won't be easy, but nothing worth doing ever is, right?",
    "Therapist: What support do you need moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to be more open with my family about what I'm going through. Maybe involve them in this process somehow. And I probably need to cut back on the drinking, find healthier ways to cope. Maybe some kind of physical activity to help with the stress? I'm not sure. I guess I'm hoping you can guide me on that, help me figure out the best way forward.",
    "Therapist: How would you like to end our session today?",
    "Client: I... I think I'd like to take a moment to just breathe. To acknowledge how far I've come today, even if it doesn't feel like much. And maybe... maybe set an intention for the week ahead. To be a little kinder to myself, to try and face one small fear each day. Does that sound okay?",
    "Therapist: That sounds perfect. Let's do that."
