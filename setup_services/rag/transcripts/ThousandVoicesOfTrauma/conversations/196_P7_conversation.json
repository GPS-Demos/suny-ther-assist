    "Therapist: Welcome, David. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm okay, I guess. A bit nervous about this session, to be honest.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We're here to support you.",
    "Client: Thanks. I've been thinking a lot about what happened with Sarah. It's been hard to focus on anything else lately.",
    "Therapist: I see. Can you tell me more about that?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... the breakup was so sudden. We were together for two years, and then one day she just said it was over. I keep replaying that moment in my head.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Can you describe that moment?",
    "Client: I... I remember I was sitting on my couch, studying for an exam. Sarah came over, and she looked... different. Serious. She sat down next to me and said, \"David, we need to talk.\" My stomach immediately dropped.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I felt like I couldn't breathe. She started talking about how we'd grown apart, how she didn't feel the same anymore. But all I could think was, \"This can't be happening.\" I wanted to argue, to fight for us, but I just sat there, frozen.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I remember her voice breaking as she said, \"I'm sorry, but I think we should break up.\" And suddenly, all those times I was bullied in school came flooding back. That same feeling of helplessness, of not being good enough.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: I... I started crying. I couldn't help it. I felt so small, so insignificant. Sarah tried to comfort me, but I pulled away. I didn't want her pity. I just wanted her to take it all back, to say it was a mistake.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, and my hands are shaking a bit. It's like I'm right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I keep thinking about what I could have done differently. Maybe if I had been more attentive, or if I had noticed she was unhappy... I feel like such a failure.",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. You're doing well facing these memories.",
    "Client: But it's hard not to blame myself. I've always struggled with self-doubt, especially after all the bullying I went through. This breakup just confirms all those negative thoughts I have about myself.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great strength. Keep going.",
    "Client: After Sarah left that day, I just sat on the couch for hours. I couldn't move. I kept hoping she'd come back, tell me it was all a mistake. But she didn't. And I felt so alone, so worthless. It was like all the progress I'd made in building my self-esteem just crumbled away.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this difficult memory well. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. Sad. But also, maybe a little relieved to have talked about it.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. You've done excellent work today.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's still hard, but I guess talking about it helps a little. I just wish I could stop feeling this way.",
    "Therapist: It's a process. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I hope so. Sometimes it feels like I'll never get over this. Like I'll always be that scared, insecure kid who got bullied and then dumped.",
    "Therapist: You're more than your past experiences. You're growing.",
    "Client: I want to believe that. It's just... hard. Especially when I'm alone in my apartment, and all these thoughts start swirling around in my head.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We'll work on coping strategies.",
    "Client: I'd appreciate that. I'm tired of feeling this way, of doubting myself all the time. I want to move forward, but it's like I'm stuck in this moment.",
    "Therapist: You're not stuck. You're here, working through it.",
    "Client: I guess you're right. It's just hard to see progress sometimes. But talking about it today... it wasn't easy, but maybe it's a step forward?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You've shown great courage today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I needed to hear that. It's been a while since I've felt proud of myself for anything.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. We'll continue this work next session.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm nervous about digging deeper, but I think I'm ready to try. Thank you for listening and for your support.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, David. Take care until next time."
