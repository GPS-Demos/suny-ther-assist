    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the scene.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back there, in the parking lot. It's dark, and I can hear muffled shouting.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: Um, about a 4 right now.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue.",
    "Client: I see two men arguing. Their voices are getting louder. I'm frozen, watching from my car. Oh god, one of them just pushed the other... My heart's racing.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: The bigger man is punching the other one now. I can hear the thud of his fists. The smaller man falls to the ground. I... I want to help, but I'm terrified.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. I'm shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The man on the ground isn't moving. There's blood... so much blood. I can smell it from here. My hands are clammy on the steering wheel. I feel sick.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I should call for help, but I'm paralyzed. What if the attacker sees me? I feel so guilty, so useless.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's a 9. I can barely breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *inhales shakily* The attacker is looking around now. I duck down in my seat. My whole body is trembling. I hear sirens in the distance.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens as the sirens get closer?",
    "Client: The man runs away. I'm still hiding, but I can see the victim through my windshield. He's not moving at all. I feel like I'm going to throw up.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: Still a 9. I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: The police arrive. They're checking on the victim. I should go talk to them, tell them what I saw, but I'm so scared. I start my car and drive away. I feel like such a coward.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Ashamed. Guilty. I can't stop thinking about that poor man.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 7 now. I'm still shaken, but the immediate panic is fading.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. Let's wrap up. Open your eyes when ready.",
    "Client: *opens eyes, takes a deep breath* That was intense.",
    "Therapist: You did well. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Drained, but... okay. It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.",
    "Therapist: That's common. Your SUDS dropped. What helped?",
    "Client: Focusing on my breathing, I think. And knowing you were here.",
    "Therapist: Good insight. We'll build on this next time.",
    "Client: Thank you. I feel... lighter, somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's great. Let's end here. Take care of yourself today."
