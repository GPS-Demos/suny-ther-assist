    "Therapist: Welcome, Amira. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Oh, you know... I'm feeling a bit uneasy. It's always difficult to revisit these memories, especially at my age. But I suppose it's necessary, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. Yes, let's proceed.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in our old house in Tehran. It's a warm summer day, and I can hear the bustling street outside. I'm 12 years old, sitting in the kitchen. The smell of saffron and cardamom fills the air. My mother is cooking...",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: My father storms in. He's angry, shouting about something. I can't quite make out the words, but his face is red, and... and I'm scared. My mother turns, her eyes wide with fear.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, Amira?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. My heart is racing, and I want to run, but I'm frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 7.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... My father grabs my mother's arm. She winces in pain. I want to scream, to tell him to stop, but no words come out. He's yelling about her family, about how they've ruined everything. I don't understand...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you see, hear, feel?",
    "Client: I see tears in my mother's eyes. I hear the clatter of pots as she stumbles backward. I feel... I feel so helpless, so small. The air is thick with tension, and I can barely breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Amira. Keep going.",
    "Client: My father raises his hand... Oh God, I can't... I can't watch this again...",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. This is just a memory.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... He... he strikes her. The sound echoes through the kitchen. My mother falls to the floor, and I finally find my voice. I scream, \"Baba, stop!\" He turns to me, his eyes wild with anger...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm shaking. My hands are clammy, and I feel sick to my stomach. It's like I'm right there again...",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Focus on your breath. In and out.",
    "Client: *breathing slowly* Okay... I'm... I'm a little calmer now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: My father looks at me, and for a moment, I see shock in his eyes. He looks down at my mother, then back at me. Without a word, he turns and leaves the kitchen. I rush to my mother, helping her up. She's crying silently, and I... I don't know what to do.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in that moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm wondering why this is happening. Why can't we be like other families? I feel so angry, so confused. And guilty... why didn't I do something sooner?",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault, Amira. You were a child.",
    "Client: I know that now, but then... I felt responsible somehow. Like if I had been a better daughter, this wouldn't have happened.",
    "Therapist: How does that belief impact you?",
    "Client: It's... it's followed me my whole life. In my marriage, in my relationships with my own children. I've always tried to be perfect, to keep everyone happy, because I thought... I thought that would prevent conflict.",
    "Therapist: I see. What happens next in the memory?",
    "Client: My mother stands up, wiping her tears. She looks at me and says, \"It's okay, azizam. Everything will be alright.\" But I know it's not true. Nothing feels alright. She starts cleaning up the kitchen, acting like nothing happened. I want to scream, to break something, but instead, I just stand there, frozen.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm angry. So angry at my father, at the situation, at the whole world. But also... also deeply sad. For my mother, for myself.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's about an 8 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Amira. Keep going.",
    "Client: The rest of the day passes in a blur. My father doesn't come home that night. My mother and I eat dinner in silence. I want to talk about what happened, but I don't know how. The words stick in my throat. That night, I lie awake in bed, listening for any sound of my father returning. I'm scared, but also... also hoping he'll come back and apologize, make everything okay again.",
    "Therapist: What do you wish you could have done?",
    "Client: I... I wish I could have been braver. Stood up to my father, protected my mother somehow. Or at least... at least comforted her more. But I was just a child, paralyzed by fear and confusion.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. Remember, you weren't responsible.",
    "Client: I know, I know. But it's hard to shake that feeling. The next morning, life goes on as if nothing happened. My mother has a bruise on her cheek that she covers with makeup. My father comes home, acting normal. And I... I feel like I'm going crazy. Did it really happen? Why isn't anyone talking about it?",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Frustrated. Angry. Like I'm living in a world of lies. I want to scream the truth, but I don't. I stay quiet, and I hate myself for it.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 7.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* This memory... it's like a turning point. After that day, I started to see the world differently. I became more guarded, more watchful. I started to notice things I hadn't before - the tension in my parents' voices, the way my mother flinched sometimes when my father moved too quickly. It was like a veil had been lifted, and I couldn't unsee it.",
    "Therapist: How did that change you?",
    "Client: I... I grew up faster than I should have. I became the peacekeeper, always trying to smooth things over, to prevent arguments. I lost some of my childhood innocence that day. And in my relationships later in life... I always found myself walking on eggshells, afraid of conflict, afraid of saying the wrong thing.",
    "Therapist: That must have been a heavy burden.",
    "Client: It was. It is. Even now, at my age, I find myself falling into those old patterns sometimes. With my husband, with my children. Always trying to keep the peace, even at the cost of my own feelings.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, Amira?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. Emotionally drained. But also... also a little lighter, somehow. Like talking about it is helping to lift some of that old weight.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 5 now.",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: Okay... *takes a deep breath* I can feel the chair beneath me, the coolness of the air conditioning. I'm here, in the present. That memory... it's just a memory now.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. You've done very well today, Amira.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's... it's never easy, but I think it's important. To face these memories, to understand how they've shaped me.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How do you feel about what we've discussed today?",
    "Client: I feel... raw, exposed. But also... also a bit empowered. Like by talking about it, I'm taking some of its power away. It doesn't control me as much as it used to.",
    "Therapist: That's a very insightful observation.",
    "Client: I just... I wonder sometimes, you know? How different my life might have been if that day hadn't happened. If I hadn't carried that fear, that need to keep the peace, with me all these years.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to wonder, but remember, you've shown incredible strength.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I'm starting to see that now. It's a long journey, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: It is, but you're making progress. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... tired, but calm. Like after a storm, when everything is quiet and still.",
    "Therapist: Your final SUDS level?",
    "Client: I'd say it's about a 3 now.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress, Amira. You've done very well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's... it's never easy, but I think it's helping. Slowly, but surely.",
    "Therapist: That's the goal. Shall we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Amira. Take care of yourself this week.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again."
