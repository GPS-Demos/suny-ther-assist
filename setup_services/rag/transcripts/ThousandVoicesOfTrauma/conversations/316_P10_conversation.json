    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Thompson. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. Knowing we're going to dive into this memory... it's making my stomach churn a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. As ready as I'll ever be, I guess.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I'm at the beach. It's a sunny day, warm... I can feel the sand between my toes. I'm walking along the shoreline, enjoying the breeze. It's... it's peaceful.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I hear barking. There's a dog running towards me. It's big, really big. I freeze... I can't move. My heart's racing.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 6? It's... it's getting higher as I think about it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The dog's getting closer. It's... it's growling now. I try to back away, but I stumble. I fall onto the sand. I can hear people shouting in the distance, but they sound so far away...",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My... my hands are shaking. I can feel my heart pounding in my chest. It's... it's hard to breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... The dog's right in front of me now. Its teeth... they're bared. I can smell its breath. It's... it's lunging at me. I throw my arm up to protect myself and... and... oh god, the pain! It's biting my arm!",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe higher. I can... I can feel the teeth tearing into my skin. I'm screaming, but it feels like no sound is coming out. I'm trying to push it away with my other hand, but it's so strong...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you survived this. You're here now, safe.",
    "Client: I... I know. It's just... it feels so real. I can hear people running towards us now. Someone's yelling at the dog. It finally lets go of my arm, but I'm... I'm bleeding. There's so much blood...",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Shaken. My arm... my real arm is aching, like it remembers the pain. But... but I'm okay. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You're safe. Can you continue?",
    "Client: Yes... I think so. People are crowding around me now. Someone's calling an ambulance. I'm... I'm in shock, I think. Everything feels distant, like I'm watching it happen to someone else. But the pain... the pain is so real.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind at this moment?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking, \"Why me?\" I was just walking on the beach. I didn't do anything wrong. And now... now I'm hurt, and I'm scared, and I don't know if I'll ever feel safe again.",
    "Therapist: Those are very normal thoughts. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe a 7? My heart's still racing, but I can breathe a little easier.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: The ambulance arrives. They're helping me onto a stretcher. I can see the owner of the dog... he looks horrified. Part of me wants to scream at him, but I'm too exhausted. Too scared. They're loading me into the ambulance now.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to be in the ambulance?",
    "Client: It's... it's a relief, in a way. I know I'm going to get help. But I'm still shaking. My arm... it hurts so much. The paramedic is talking to me, trying to keep me calm, but I can barely focus on what he's saying.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. Take a moment to breathe. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. It's strange, but talking about it... it's helping. My SUDS is probably down to a 6 now.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Can you tell me about arriving at the hospital?",
    "Client: We pull up to the emergency entrance. Everything's moving so fast. They wheel me in, and there's a flurry of activity. Doctors, nurses... everyone's asking questions. I'm trying to answer, but I feel so overwhelmed. They're examining my arm, cleaning the wound. It stings, but it's nothing compared to the initial pain.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: I... I start to cry. It's like all the fear and shock finally catch up with me. A nurse holds my hand, tells me it's okay to let it out. I'm sobbing now, can't seem to stop. But it feels... it feels like a release.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. How does your body feel as you cry?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a weight is lifting. My shoulders feel less tense. I'm still shaking a bit, but it's not as bad. My arm hurts, but the doctor says I'll need stitches. They're preparing for that now.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level at this point?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 5, I think. I'm calmer now, but still anxious about the stitches.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's continue with the stitches.",
    "Client: Okay... They're numbing my arm now. It's a strange sensation. I can feel pressure, but no pain. The doctor is explaining what he's doing, step by step. It's... it's helping me stay focused, stay present. I'm watching him work, and it's... it's not as bad as I feared.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling as you watch?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm surprisingly calm. It's like I've moved past the panic and now I'm just... observing. My SUDS is probably down to a 4 now. I'm still anxious, but it's manageable.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. What happens after the stitches?",
    "Client: They're bandaging my arm now. The doctor's talking to me about aftercare, about watching for signs of infection. He mentions that I might want to talk to someone... a therapist. I remember nodding, but feeling... feeling ashamed. Like I shouldn't need help to get over this.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are common, but remember, seeking help is a sign of strength.",
    "Client: I know that now, but then... I felt so vulnerable. They're discharging me, and my husband arrives to take me home. He looks so worried, and I just... I break down again. He holds me, and for the first time since it happened, I feel... I feel safe.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful moment. How does it feel to remember that?",
    "Client: It's... it's comforting. My SUDS is down to a 3 now. Remembering how my husband supported me... it helps. But I also remember the fear of leaving the hospital, of facing the world again.",
    "Therapist: Can you elaborate on that fear?",
    "Client: It was... it was like the world had suddenly become dangerous. Every dog I saw made me flinch. I couldn't go near the beach. I had nightmares... vivid ones. I'd wake up sweating, feeling the phantom pain in my arm.",
    "Therapist: How did you cope with those feelings?",
    "Client: At first, I didn't. I tried to ignore them, push them down. But they kept bubbling up. It affected my work, my relationships. That's when I finally decided to seek help. It was... it was hard to admit I needed it, but I'm glad I did.",
    "Therapist: That took courage. How do you feel now, looking back on all of this?",
    "Client: It's... it's still difficult. But I feel stronger. I can talk about it without feeling overwhelmed. My SUDS is down to a 2 now. I know I've made progress, even if I still have work to do.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired, but in a good way. Like I've accomplished something. It's still hard to revisit that day, but it doesn't have the same power over me that it used to. I feel... I feel like I'm reclaiming my life.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful progress. Let's take a few deep breaths together to close out the session.",
    "Client: (Takes deep breaths) Thank you. This... this really helps. I know it's a process, but I feel like I'm moving forward.",
    "Therapist: You absolutely are. We'll continue to work on this in our next session. For now, remember to be kind to yourself and use the coping strategies we've discussed.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again. I... I actually feel hopeful. It's been a while since I've felt that way about this.",
    "Therapist: That's great to hear. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
