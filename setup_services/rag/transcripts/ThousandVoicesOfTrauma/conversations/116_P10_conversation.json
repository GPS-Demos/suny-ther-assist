    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Lim. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, doctor. My hands are a bit shaky. It's been so long since I've talked about this.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I suppose we should. Where do I start?",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see... I see the market. It's bustling, like always. The smell of durian and spices is in the air. I'm at my usual stall, arranging mangoes when suddenly... (voice trembles) there's shouting. Loud, angry shouting.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: People start running. I'm confused. Then I see them - men with guns. They're yelling in a language I don't understand. I freeze. I can't move. Oh god, I can't breathe...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Mrs. Lim. You're doing well. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 70. My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: Focus on your breathing. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay. One of the men grabs me. His grip is so tight, it hurts. He's dragging me and others to the center of the market. We're huddled together like animals. I can smell his sweat, the gun oil. It makes me sick.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What are you feeling in that moment?",
    "Client: Terror. Pure terror. I think I'm going to die. I keep thinking about my husband, my children. Will I ever see them again?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: Hours pass. It's so hot. People are crying, praying. I'm so thirsty. Then there's more shouting, gunfire. I think, \"This is it. We're all going to die.\" But it's the police. They've come to rescue us. I feel relief, but I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, Mrs. Lim?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. My palms are sweaty. But I'm okay. Maybe... 60?",
    "Therapist: You're doing very well. Let's continue. What happened after the police arrived?",
    "Client: It's chaos. People are running, screaming. I can't move. A young officer helps me up, leads me away. I'm in shock. I can't stop staring at the market, at the bodies... (starts crying)",
    "Therapist: It's okay to cry. You're safe now. Take your time.",
    "Client: (after a moment) I'm taken to a makeshift medical area. They give me water, check me for injuries. But all I can think about is my family. I need to call them, but my hands won't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: How vivid is this memory right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's like I'm there again. I can smell the gunpowder, feel the heat.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Mrs. Lim. Keep going.",
    "Client: I finally get to call my husband. When I hear his voice, I break down. I can't speak. He's frantic, asking if I'm okay. All I can do is cry. The officer takes the phone, explains what happened. It feels surreal, like a nightmare I can't wake up from.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: About 55. It's... it's getting a bit easier to talk about.",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: My husband comes to get me. When I see him, I just collapse into his arms. I feel safe for the first time in hours. But I can't stop shaking. We go home, and for days, I can't leave the house. Every loud noise makes me jump. I have nightmares every night.",
    "Therapist: How did this experience change you?",
    "Client: I... I became afraid of everything. Crowds, loud noises, strangers. I stopped going to the market. I couldn't work. I felt... broken.",
    "Therapist: You've been through a lot. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's strange. Talking about it is hard, but I feel... lighter? Like I'm not carrying it all alone anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. Let's pause here. You've done excellent work today.",
    "Client: Thank you, doctor. I never thought I could talk about this without falling apart.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great strength. How would you rate your distress now?",
    "Client: Maybe... 40? It's better than when we started.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. Well done, Mrs. Lim. We'll continue next session."
