    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your current SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10. My hands are a little clammy.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and describe the accident scene.",
    "Client: I'm driving home from the grocery store. It's a sunny afternoon, and I'm thinking about what to make for dinner. Suddenly, I hear sirens. A police car is speeding through the intersection, and... oh god, it's happening so fast. The police car slams into the side of my vehicle. The impact is deafening, and I feel my body jerk violently.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. My heart is racing, and I can't breathe. The airbag has deployed, and there's this acrid smell. I can taste blood in my mouth.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's probably a 7. My palms are sweating, and my chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm trying to move, but I'm trapped. I hear shouting outside. Someone's yelling about calling an ambulance. I'm so confused and scared. Why was the police car going so fast? Did they not see me?",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"This can't be happening. I could die here.\" I'm angry too. The police are supposed to protect us, not endanger us like this.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's an 8 now. My heart is pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Continue.",
    "Client: I see the officer stumbling out of his car. He looks dazed. People are gathering around, and someone's trying to open my door. I'm in so much pain, and I'm worried about permanent injuries. What if I can't work or take care of myself?",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling physically right now?",
    "Client: My muscles are tense, especially in my neck and shoulders. I feel a bit lightheaded.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's still an 8. I can almost smell the gasoline and burnt rubber.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The paramedics arrive. They're asking me questions, but I'm having trouble focusing. I keep replaying the moment of impact in my mind. I'm angry at the officer, but also scared about my injuries. As they're pulling me out of the car, I see my groceries scattered all over the road.

    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: A bit overwhelmed. My SUDS is probably a 9. I'm shaking a little.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You're safe here. Take another deep breath.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in the ambulance now. The paramedic is telling me I'll be okay, but I don't believe him. I keep thinking about my husband at home, not knowing what's happened. I'm worried sick about him panicking when I don't come home.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7 now.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're processing this well. Continue.",
    "Client: At the hospital, everything's a blur of tests and questions. I overhear someone say the officer was responding to a call about domestic violence. I feel conflicted - I understand the urgency, but I'm still angry about what happened to me. The doctor tells me I have a concussion and some broken ribs. I'm relieved it's not worse, but I'm dreading the recovery process.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My SUDS is around a 6. I feel drained, but also a bit proud that I got through retelling it.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. Let's start winding down. What final thoughts do you have?",
