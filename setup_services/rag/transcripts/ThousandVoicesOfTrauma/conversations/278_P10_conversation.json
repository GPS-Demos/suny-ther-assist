    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Patel. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, doctor. My heart feels a bit fluttery. It's strange to be talking about these old memories.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I suppose we should. (deep breath) Where do I start?",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes and take us back to that day at the refugee camp. What do you see?",
    "Client: (pause) It's... crowded. So many people. The air is thick with dust and... and the smell of too many bodies. I'm sitting on a cot in a large tent. It's hot, so hot.",
    "Therapist: Good. What time of day is it?",
    "Client: Mid-afternoon, I think. The sun is beating down on the tent. I can hear children crying nearby.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Overwhelmed. Scared. I... I don't know where my husband is. He went to get water hours ago.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's happening around you?",
    "Client: There's a commotion outside. People are shouting. I... I want to go see, but I'm afraid to leave our few belongings.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling?",
    "Client: Um... maybe 70? My hands are shaking a bit.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: A woman bursts into the tent. She's speaking rapidly, but I can't understand her language. She looks panicked. I... I think she's trying to warn us about something.",
    "Therapist: What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I grab our small bag of possessions. My heart is pounding. I follow her outside, and... oh god, there's chaos everywhere.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What do you see?",
    "Client: People are running. There's dust everywhere. I hear... I hear gunshots in the distance. (voice trembling) I'm so scared.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. This is just a memory. Take another deep breath.",
    "Client: (inhales shakily) Okay... okay. I'm looking around frantically for my husband. I can't see him anywhere. People are pushing past me.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. I can barely breathe. My legs feel weak, like they might give out.",
    "Therapist: Focus on those sensations. What happens next?",
    "Client: Someone grabs my arm. I turn, hoping it's my husband, but it's a stranger. He's yelling something about trucks... evacuation. I don't want to go without my husband!",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 85. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you survived this. Keep going.",
    "Client: (voice shaky) I'm being pulled along with the crowd. There are military trucks. People are climbing in, children are crying. I... I see a woman fall. No one stops to help her.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I can't leave! What if my husband comes back and I'm gone? But... but I'm scared of what will happen if I stay.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that conflict. What do you decide?",
    "Client: I... I climb into the truck. (starts crying) I feel like such a coward. I'm abandoning him!",
    "Therapist: It's okay to cry. You made a difficult choice in a dangerous situation.",
    "Client: (through tears) The truck is so crowded. People are pressed against me. A child is wailing nearby. I can't stop looking back, hoping to see my husband.",
    "Therapist: What do you see as you look back?",
    "Client: Smoke. There's smoke rising from part of the camp. The gunshots are louder now. I... I think I see flames.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Guilty. Terrified. I... I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Feel your feet on the floor. You're here, you're safe.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) Okay... okay. The truck is moving now. It's bumpy. People are jostled against each other.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking about?",
    "Client: I... I'm worried about my husband. But I'm also... relieved to be leaving. Is that terrible of me?",
    "Therapist: It's a normal reaction. What happens as you drive away?",
    "Client: We're on a dirt road. It's so dusty. I can barely see the other trucks ahead of us. Someone starts singing... a prayer, I think. Others join in.",
    "Therapist: Do you join the singing?",
    "Client: No... no, I can't. My throat feels too tight. But... but the singing is comforting, somehow.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 60. The further we get, the more I can breathe.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: We drive for hours. The sun starts to set. People around me are quiet now, exhausted. I... I keep thinking I should have waited for my husband.",
    "Therapist: What do you do with those thoughts?",
    "Client: I... I try to push them away. I tell myself he'll find me. He has to.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel now?",
    "Client: Sore. Cramped. I'm so thirsty, but I gave my last water to a mother with a baby.",
    "Therapist: That was very kind. What happens as night falls?",
    "Client: It gets cold. People huddle together for warmth. I... I feel so alone. A young girl next to me falls asleep on my shoulder. I... I let her stay there.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Sad... but also, a little less alone. I wonder about her story, if she's lost someone too.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking about as you drive through the night?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm trying to plan. Where will we go? What will I do if... if I can't find my husband? I've never been on my own before.",
    "Therapist: That must be scary. How are you coping with those thoughts?",
    "Client: I... I start to pray. Silently. It's all I can think to do.",
    "Therapist: Take us to when the truck finally stops.",
    "Client: It's dawn. We've reached another camp. It's smaller, looks more organized. There are aid workers with clipboards.",
    "Therapist: What happens as you get off the truck?",
    "Client: My legs are so stiff. I nearly fall. Someone helps me down. We're... we're told to form lines. They're taking names, trying to reunite families.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel in this moment?",
    "Client: Hopeful... and terrified. What if he's not here? What if...",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What do you do?",
    "Client: I join a line. My hands are shaking as I give them my name, my husband's name. The wait feels endless.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind as you wait?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm trying to remember his face. What if I forget what he looks like? What if he doesn't recognize me?",
    "Therapist: How long do you wait?",
    "Client: Hours. The sun is high in the sky now. People around me are crying - some with joy, others... others with despair.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: A woman approaches me. She has a list. My heart is pounding so hard I can barely hear her. She asks me to follow her.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's back up to 80. I feel like I might faint.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here telling this story.",
    "Client: (breathes deeply) Okay... okay. She leads me to a tent. And there... (starts crying) there he is. My husband.",
    "Therapist: Allow yourself to feel that moment.",
    "Client: (through tears) I... I can't believe it. He looks exhausted, dirty. But he's alive. We... we just hold each other. I can't stop crying.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful moment. How does it feel to remember it?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. I feel relief, joy, but also... I realize how close I came to losing him.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to process. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. But... but also lighter, somehow. Like I've set down a heavy load.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today. How would you rate your distress now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 40. I'm tired, but... but I feel okay.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay... thank you, doctor. This was hard, but... but I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: You showed great courage today. We'll continue working through this in our next session."
