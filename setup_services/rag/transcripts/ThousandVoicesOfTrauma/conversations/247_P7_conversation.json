    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the cyber bullying incident?",
    "Client: Okay... It started when I joined a social media group for retired professionals. I thought it would be a nice way to connect with others. But then, one day, I saw these awful comments about me. They were making fun of my age, saying I was too old to be online. Someone even photoshopped my profile picture to make me look ridiculous. I felt so humiliated and exposed.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: I tried to defend myself, but it only made things worse. They started sending me private messages, calling me names and telling me to leave the group. I couldn't understand why they were being so cruel. I've never experienced anything like this before. It reminded me of when I was in the hospital last year, feeling so vulnerable and powerless.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: It's hard to talk about. I feel my heart racing just thinking about it. I kept checking my phone, dreading what I might see next. Every notification made me jump. I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat. My husband noticed something was wrong, but I was too embarrassed to tell him. I felt so alone and scared.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I started having nightmares about people pointing and laughing at me. In my dreams, I was always alone in a crowded room, with everyone staring at their phones and snickering. I'd wake up in a cold sweat, feeling like I couldn't breathe. It was like being back in the hospital, but this time the pain was emotional, not physical.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to talk about. I eventually told my daughter what was happening. She was furious and wanted to confront the bullies, but I was too scared. I felt like such a coward. I've lived through so much in my life, but this... this broke me in a way I never expected. I ended up deleting all my social media accounts and isolating myself even more.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength by sharing this. Continue.",
    "Client: The worst part was feeling like I didn't belong in the modern world anymore. Like I was too old, too out of touch. I started questioning everything about myself. Was I really as kind as I thought? As smart? As worthy of respect? It was like these strangers on the internet had more power over my self-worth than a lifetime of experiences.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling shaky, but also a bit relieved to be talking about it. It's like a weight I've been carrying around. I still feel ashamed sometimes, like maybe I did something to deserve it. But another part of me is angry. Angry that I let them affect me so much, angry that people can be so cruel to someone they don't even know.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have these feelings. You're processing this well.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think what scares me the most is how quickly it all happened. One day I was happily connecting with people online, and the next, I was a target. It makes me wary of trying to connect with people now, even in person. I worry about what they might be thinking or saying behind my back. It's exhausting to feel this way all the time.",
    "Therapist: You're showing remarkable resilience. Keep going.",
    "Client: I've been trying to rebuild my confidence, but it's not easy. My depression has gotten worse since this happened. Some days, I don't want to leave the house at all. I keep thinking about all the hurtful things they said, wondering if there's any truth to them. It's hard to shake off those doubts once they're planted in your mind.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Talking about it like this, it helps me see how far I've come. I'm still here, still fighting. I guess that counts for something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You've shown great courage today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think I need a moment to catch my breath. This has been more intense than I expected. But I'm glad we're doing this. It feels like the first step towards taking back control of my life, my emotions. I don't want to let those bullies have power over me anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. We'll end here for today."
