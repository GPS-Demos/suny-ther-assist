    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my heart is racing, but I also feel numb. The memory of that night, the home invasion... it's so vivid now. I can still hear the sound of glass breaking, and my pulse quickens just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's like I'm right back there, hiding in the closet, praying they won't find me. I can feel my hands shaking, just like they did that night. And there's this tightness in my chest, like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are accompanying that fear?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"What if they come back?\" Even though it's been years, I still worry. And then I feel... I feel ashamed. Like, I'm a grown man, I should be able to protect myself, my home. But that night, I was so helpless. I couldn't do anything but hide.",
    "Therapist: How does that shame feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's heavy. Like a weight on my shoulders. And my stomach feels twisted. I guess I've been carrying this for a long time, haven't I? It's exhausting, always being on guard, always feeling like I need to prove my strength.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much this has affected my life. I've avoided relationships, living alone... I thought it was just my preference, but now I see it's fear. Fear of being vulnerable, of not being able to protect someone else if something like this happened again.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... it's uncomfortable. But also, maybe a bit relieving? Like, now that I can see it, maybe I can start to change it. I don't want to let this fear control me anymore. But I'm not sure how to let go of it either.",
    "Therapist: What would letting go look like to you?",
    "Client: I guess... being able to relax in my own home. Not jumping at every little noise. Maybe even feeling comfortable enough to live alone again, or to invite someone into my life. It sounds nice, but also terrifying. What if I let my guard down and something happens?",
    "Therapist: How does that fear of vulnerability feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a battle inside me. Part of me wants to open up, to trust again. But another part is screaming to stay safe, to keep the walls up. I can feel the tension in my jaw, in my shoulders. It's exhausting, always being on high alert.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to breathe. Just... just sit with these feelings for a bit. It's overwhelming, but also... I don't know, maybe hopeful? Like I'm finally facing this head-on instead of running from it. Can we... can we just sit quietly for a moment?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take all the time you need.",
    "Client: Thank you. I feel a bit calmer now. It's strange, but talking about it... it's like the memory loses some of its power. Don't get me wrong, it's still scary, but it feels less... consuming, I guess.",
    "Therapist: What's different about the memory now?",
    "Client: It's... it's like I can see it from a distance now. Before, it was like I was reliving it every time. Now, I can acknowledge it happened, but also see that I survived. I'm here, I'm safe. That's... that's pretty powerful, actually.",
    "Therapist: How does that shift feel in your body?",
    "Client: My breathing is easier. The tightness in my chest is loosening a bit. I still feel shaky, but it's not as intense. It's like... like I'm starting to reclaim some control. Not over what happened, but over how I respond to it now.",
    "Therapist: What does that control mean to you?",
    "Client: It means... it means I'm not just a victim anymore. I'm a survivor. I've been carrying this for so long, letting it dictate my choices. But maybe... maybe I can start making different choices now. It's scary, but also exciting.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you could take?",
    "Client: I... I think I'd like to try sleeping with my bedroom door open tonight. It's always been locked since that night. Just the thought makes me nervous, but... but I want to try. It's my home, and I want to feel safe in it again.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that decision?",
    "Client: Nervous, definitely. But also... proud? Like I'm taking back a piece of myself. It's a small step, but it feels significant. And knowing I can talk about it here, that helps. Makes me feel less alone in this.",
    "Therapist: That's a big step. How would you like to end our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to take a few deep breaths. Ground myself in the present. Remind myself that I'm safe now, and that I'm working towards healing. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's do that together.",
    "Client: Thank you. This was... intense, but I feel like I've made some progress. I'm looking forward to our next session, even if it's a bit scary.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. We'll continue next time."
