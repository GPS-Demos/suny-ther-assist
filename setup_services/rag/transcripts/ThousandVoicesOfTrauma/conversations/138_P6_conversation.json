    "Therapist: Alright, let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's begin. Close your eyes and describe the memory.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back at the cult compound. It's a warm day, and I can smell the grass. I see the leader approaching me, his eyes piercing through me. My heart starts racing...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue.",
    "Client: He's telling me I need to recruit more members. His voice is stern, and I feel small. I remember wanting to run, but my feet felt like lead. The shame is overwhelming...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. My palms are getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: That's alright. Keep going.",
    "Client: I see the faces of the other members, blank and obedient. I feel so alone, even in this crowd. The leader's words echo in my head, telling me I'm worthless without the group. I... I can feel the panic rising in my chest.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with it.",
    "Client: I... I remember wanting to scream, to tell everyone it was all a lie. But I couldn't. The fear of being cast out, of losing everything... it was paralyzing. I can feel that fear now, it's like ice in my veins.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: Still an 8. My heart's pounding.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I see myself nodding, agreeing to do what he says. The self-loathing is intense. I feel like I'm betraying myself, but I don't know how to escape. The walls feel like they're closing in...",
    "Therapist: Current SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down a bit. Maybe a 7 now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: I'm watching myself go through the motions, recruiting people, spreading lies. But inside, I'm screaming. I feel hollow, like a shell of a person. The guilt is crushing...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's back up to an 8. I feel so ashamed.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I... I see the faces of the people I recruited. Their hopeful expressions haunt me. I knew I was leading them into a trap, but I felt so powerless to stop it. The weight of that responsibility is suffocating.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually dropping. Maybe a 6 now.",
    "Therapist: Interesting. What's changed?",
    "Client: I... I'm starting to feel angry. At the leader, at the situation, at myself for not being stronger. It's like a fire in my chest.",
    "Therapist: That anger is valid. Continue.",
    "Client: I'm imagining standing up to the leader, telling him I'm done. It's terrifying, but there's a sense of relief too. I can almost taste the freedom...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 4. I feel... lighter somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... better? Like I've let go of something heavy. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You've done excellent work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was tough, but I'm glad we did this.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. Let's take a moment to breathe before we wrap up."
