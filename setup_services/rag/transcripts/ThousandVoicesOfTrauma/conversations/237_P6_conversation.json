    "Therapist: Alright, let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll check in periodically for your SUDS rating. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's begin. Close your eyes and describe the memory.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm walking home from work. It's late, maybe around 9 PM. The streets are quiet, but I can hear sirens in the distance. I'm thinking about what to make for dinner when suddenly, I see flashing lights behind me. My heart starts racing immediately.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10. I'm feeling tense, but it's manageable.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue.",
    "Client: A police car pulls up beside me. Two officers get out, both white men. They're approaching me quickly, hands on their holsters. I freeze, unsure what to do. One of them shouts, \"Don't move!\" I can feel my palms getting sweaty, and my mouth is dry.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. My heart is pounding just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Keep going.",
    "Client: They're asking for my ID, but I'm scared to reach for my wallet. I try to explain that I live nearby, that I'm just walking home. But they're not listening. One officer grabs my arm roughly, twisting it behind my back. I cry out in pain, but he just pushes me against the wall. I can feel the cold brick against my cheek.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. I can almost feel the officer's hand on me. My chest feels tight, like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) The other officer is searching me, patting me down aggressively. I feel so violated, so helpless. They're calling me names, racial slurs. I want to fight back, to defend myself, but I'm terrified they'll shoot me if I move. I can smell their aftershave, hear their heavy breathing. It's all so vivid.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's a 9 now. I feel like I'm right back there. My hands are shaking, and I feel nauseous.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with it.",
    "Client: They finally let me go, shoving me away. As they leave, one of them says, \"Watch yourself, boy.\" I'm left there, shaking, feeling humiliated and angry. I can't stop thinking about what could have happened if I had reacted differently. Would I have become another statistic?",
    "Therapist: And now? Your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's still high, about an 8. I feel drained, but the anger and fear are still there.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Let's stay here for a moment.",
    "Client: (Breathing heavily) It's hard to shake off these feelings. Even now, years later, I still get anxious when I see police cars. I feel like I'm always on edge, waiting for something like this to happen again.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7? I'm starting to feel more present in the room with you.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's tough reliving this, but I know it's important. I just want to feel safe in my own neighborhood, you know? Is that too much to ask?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. Your feelings are valid.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I think I'm ready to end the exercise now. My SUDS is down to about a 5. I feel exhausted, but also a little relieved to have shared this.",
    "Therapist: You did excellent work today."
