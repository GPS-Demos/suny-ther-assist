    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mrs. Hakim?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. My heart is still racing, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's like I'm right back there, you know? I can still hear the growling, the screaming... It's all so vivid.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: Fear. Overwhelming fear. I keep seeing that poor child's face, the terror in her eyes as the dog lunged at her. I... I feel so helpless, like I should have done something more. My hands are shaking just thinking about it. I can almost smell the blood...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Thank you. It's just... it's hard. I keep thinking, what if it had been my grandchild? I feel guilty for even having that thought. But I can't shake this feeling of... vulnerability. Like the world isn't safe anymore.",
    "Therapist: How does that feeling of vulnerability affect you?",
    "Client: It's... it's paralyzing, really. I find myself avoiding parks, crossing the street when I see a dog. I used to love animals, but now... *sighs* I feel like a prisoner in my own mind. It's affecting my relationship with my husband too. He doesn't understand why I get so anxious when we're out.",
    "Therapist: That sounds challenging. What thoughts come to mind about that?",
    "Client: I feel... old. Useless. Like I should be stronger than this. I've lived through so much in my life, wars even, but this... this has shaken me to my core. I worry that I'm becoming a burden to my family. That they'll see me as weak or... or crazy.",
    "Therapist: Those are heavy feelings. How do they sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... it's a weight, you know? Like a stone in my chest. I want to be the strong matriarch my family needs, but I feel like I'm crumbling. And then I feel angry. Angry at myself for not being able to just \"get over it.\" Angry at the dog owner for not having control. Angry at the world for being so... unpredictable.",
    "Therapist: Anger is a natural response. What else?",
    "Client: Sadness, I suppose. A deep, aching sadness. For that child, for myself, for the innocence lost. I used to find such joy in simple things - a walk in the park, playing with my grandchildren. Now, there's always this... shadow. This fear lurking just beneath the surface.",
    "Therapist: How does talking about it now feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's strange. Part of me feels relief, like I'm finally letting out something I've been holding in for so long. But there's also this... rawness. Like I'm exposing a wound. I'm surprised by how much it still affects me, even after all this time.",
    "Therapist: That's common. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I... I feel a bit lightheaded. My palms are sweaty. But... but I also feel a tiny bit... stronger? Like maybe by facing this, I'm taking back some control. Is that... is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Many find strength in facing their fears.",
    "Client: I see. It's just... it's overwhelming. All these emotions, all at once. I feel like I'm on a rollercoaster. One moment I'm terrified, reliving it all, and the next I'm... I'm almost hopeful. Like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this.",
    "Therapist: That hope is important. What does it feel like?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a small warmth in my chest. A tiny spark amidst all this darkness. It makes me think of my family, of the life I want to reclaim. I want to be able to take my grandchildren to the park without this... this cloud hanging over me. I want to feel joy again, without always waiting for the other shoe to drop.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful motivation. How can we build on that?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. But I think... I think talking about it helps. Even though it's painful, it feels like... like I'm lancing a wound. Letting out the poison, so to speak. Maybe... maybe if I keep facing it, keep talking about it, it'll lose some of its power over me?",
    "Therapist: That's often the case. How else might you move forward?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to be honest with my family. About how I'm feeling, about why I've been so... distant. Maybe if they understand, it'll be easier. And... and maybe I could try some small steps. Like... like sitting on a bench in the park, even if just for a few minutes. Baby steps, you know?",
    "Therapist: Those sound like positive ideas. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, honestly. But also... lighter? Like I've put down a heavy burden, even if just for a moment. There's still fear, still anxiety, but... but also a glimmer of hope. Is... is that progress?",
    "Therapist: It certainly can be. What are your thoughts on that?",
    "Client: I... I think it is. It's hard, and I know there's still a long way to go, but... but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this. Like I'm not alone in this fight. It's... it's a good feeling.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm... I'm exhausted, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Thank you for... for guiding me through this. It means more than I can express.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, Mrs. Hakim."
