    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mr. Singh?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. It's like I was right back there in the trenches. The smell of gunpowder, the deafening explosions... it all felt so real again. My heart is still racing, and my hands are trembling a bit.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: It's a mix of emotions. There's fear, definitely. But also... guilt. I keep thinking about the young soldier in my unit who didn't make it. He was barely 20, you know? I was supposed to look out for him, but in all the chaos... I couldn't save him.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like a heavy weight on my chest. Makes it hard to breathe sometimes. And there's this knot in my stomach that won't go away. It's been there for years, but it gets tighter when I think about that day.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep wondering if I could have done more. Maybe if I had been more alert, or if I had insisted he stay behind... he might still be alive today. And then I think about his family, how they must have felt when they got the news. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What else?",
    "Client: I... I also feel angry. Angry at the war, at the circumstances that put us there. And sometimes, I'm ashamed to admit, I feel angry at him for not being more careful. Then I feel guilty for thinking that way. It's a vicious cycle.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when you first returned home?",
    "Client: They're... less intense now, I suppose. Back then, I could barely function. The nightmares were constant, and I'd jump at every loud noise. I isolated myself, pushed everyone away. Even my wife... she's been so patient through all of this.",
    "Therapist: What's different now?",
    "Client: Well, I can talk about it without completely falling apart, for one. And I've started to accept that... that it wasn't entirely my fault. But it's still hard, you know? Some days are better than others.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope on the difficult days?",
    "Client: I try to keep busy. Gardening helps - something about nurturing life, I suppose. And I've started volunteering at the local veterans' center. Talking to others who've been through similar experiences... it helps me feel less alone.",
    "Therapist: What else have you noticed?",
    "Client: I've become more appreciative of the little things. A quiet moment with my wife, playing with my grandkids... I know how precious life is now. And I try to honor his memory by living fully. It's what he would have wanted, I think.",
    "Therapist: How does that feel?",
    "Client: Bittersweet, I suppose. There's still sadness, but also a sense of... purpose, maybe? Like I owe it to him to make the most of the life I have. It's not always easy, but it gives me a reason to keep going.",
    "Therapist: What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I... I think I need a moment to just breathe. This exercise, it brings up so much. But I also feel... lighter, somehow. Like I've set down a burden I've been carrying for too long. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Many find relief in sharing. How else has this impacted you?",
    "Client: It's made me realize how much I've been holding back from my family. They've always been supportive, but I've never really opened up about the details. Maybe... maybe it's time I did. They deserve to understand why I've been the way I've been all these years.",
    "Therapist: How might that change things?",
    "Client: I think it could bring us closer. There's been this... this wall between us, you know? Built from all the things I couldn't say. If I can start to break that down... maybe I can finally be the husband and father they deserve.",
    "Therapist: What's your next step?",
    "Client: I... I think I want to write him a letter. The young soldier. Tell him all the things I wish I could have said. It won't change what happened, but maybe it'll help me find some peace. And then... maybe I'll talk to my wife about all of this. It's time.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that decision?",
    "Client: Scared, but... hopeful. For the first time in a long while, I feel like I'm moving forward instead of just... existing. It's terrifying, but also... exciting, in a way. Like I'm finally starting to reclaim my life.",
    "Therapist: What support do you need?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to continue these sessions. They're hard, but they're helping. And maybe... maybe some resources on how to talk to my family about all this? I want to do it right, you know?",
    "Therapist: We can certainly arrange that. Anything else?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in decades, I feel like there might be light at the end of this very long tunnel.",
    "Therapist: You've shown immense courage today. How would you like to end our session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to take a few deep breaths, maybe do that grounding exercise you taught me. And then, if it's alright, I'd like to sit in silence for a moment. Just to... process everything.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's do that together."
