    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like I'm still there, you know? My heart's racing, and I can feel the sweat on my palms. The memory feels so vivid, like it just happened yesterday instead of decades ago.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: It's the smell. The smell of gunpowder and... and blood. It's so strong, like it's filling this room. I can see their faces, the other soldiers. Some were so young, barely more than boys. And the noise... the constant barrage of gunfire and explosions. It's all mixing together in my head.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What emotions are you experiencing?",
    "Client: Fear. Overwhelming fear. But also... guilt. I survived when others didn't. Why me? And there's this anger too, bubbling up inside. Anger at the senselessness of it all, at the lives lost, at the part of myself I left behind on that battlefield.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you connect with these emotions?",
    "Client: Tense. So tense. My shoulders are up to my ears, and my jaw feels like it's going to crack from clenching it so hard. There's this heaviness in my chest, like someone's sitting on it. And my stomach... it's in knots. I feel like I might be sick.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"I should have done more.\" Maybe if I'd been faster, stronger, smarter... maybe I could have saved more lives. And then there's this voice saying, \"You don't deserve to be here. You don't deserve peace.\" It's... it's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts relate to your everyday life?",
    "Client: I... I guess they're always there, in the background. That's why I throw myself into work, into taking care of my family. It's like I'm constantly trying to prove that I deserve to be alive, that my life has value. But no matter what I do, it never feels like enough.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Part of me wants to run away, to forget all of this. But another part... another part wants to finally face it. To stop running. I'm so tired of carrying this weight. I want... I want peace. Is that even possible for someone like me?",
    "Therapist: It's a courageous step to confront these memories. How does it feel to share this?",
    "Client: It's... it's scary. But also, there's a small sense of relief. Like I'm finally letting out a breath I've been holding for years. I've never really talked about this before, not in detail. I always worried that if I started, I wouldn't be able to stop. That I'd fall apart completely.",
    "Therapist: What's different about sharing now?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's because I feel safer here. Like maybe I won't completely fall apart. And even if I do, maybe that's okay. Maybe I need to fall apart a little to put myself back together in a better way. It's just... it's so hard to let go of the control I've held onto for so long.",
    "Therapist: How does this experience compare to your expectations?",
    "Client: It's both better and worse than I expected. Worse because the memories are so intense, so real. I didn't expect them to hit me this hard. But better because... because I'm still here. I'm facing them and I haven't completely lost myself. There's a strength in that I didn't know I had.",
    "Therapist: What does that strength mean to you?",
    "Client: It means... it means that maybe I'm not as broken as I thought. That maybe there's hope for me. It's like a tiny light in all this darkness. And for the first time in a long time, I want to move towards that light instead of hiding from it. It's terrifying, but also... also kind of exciting.",
    "Therapist: How might this new perspective influence your path forward?",
    "Client: I think... I think it might help me be kinder to myself. Maybe I can start to see that surviving isn't something to feel guilty about, but something to be grateful for. And maybe I can use this strength to help others who've been through similar experiences. It's like... like I'm starting to see a purpose in all this pain.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but in a good way. Like after a hard workout. There's pain, but also a sense of accomplishment. And there's this... this lightness. Like I've set down a heavy backpack I've been carrying for years. I know I'll have to pick it up again, but now I know I can set it down sometimes. That's... that's huge for me.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to take away from today's session?",
    "Client: I want to remember this feeling. This mix of exhaustion and hope. I want to remember that I can face these memories and survive. That I'm stronger than I thought. And I want to hold onto that little bit of peace I felt. It's small, but it's there. And maybe... maybe it can grow.",
    "Therapist: That's a wonderful intention. How can you support yourself until our next session?",
    "Client: I think I need to be gentle with myself. Maybe take some time to rest and process. And... and maybe I can try writing some of this down. Get it out of my head and onto paper. And I think I'll try to notice those moments of peace when they come, no matter how small. To really let myself feel them instead of pushing them away.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful plan. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: No, I... I think I've shared enough for today. It's a lot to process. But thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. I know we have a long way to go, but for the first time in a long time, I feel like I'm actually moving forward instead of just treading water.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredible work today. We'll continue next week?",
    "Client: Yes, I'll be here. Thank you again. This... this means more than I can say."
