    "Therapist: Let's begin today's imaginal exposure session. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: I... I think so. My heart's already racing a bit, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember, you're safe here. Let's start with your SUDS level.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 right now. Just thinking about it is making me tense up.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath and begin when you're ready.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm walking down a dimly lit street in Bangkok. It's late, maybe around 11 PM. The air is thick and humid, clinging to my skin. I can hear the distant hum of traffic and occasional bursts of laughter from nearby bars. I'm... I'm looking for my daughter, Mei. She's been missing for three days now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue in the present tense.",
    "Client: Right, sorry. I'm approaching a seedy-looking bar. The neon sign flickers, casting an eerie red glow on the wet pavement. My stomach churns as I push open the heavy door. The smell of stale cigarettes and cheap alcohol hits me immediately. I scan the room, my eyes struggling to adjust to the darkness. There are men... everywhere. Some are locals, others clearly tourists. They're drinking, laughing, oblivious to my desperation.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. My palms are sweating, and I can feel my heart pounding in my chest. But I'm also angry. How can these people be so carefree when my daughter is out there somewhere, scared and alone?",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: I approach the bartender, an older Thai man with a weathered face. I show him a picture of Mei, my voice shaking as I ask if he's seen her. He glances at the photo, then quickly looks away. I can see... I can see the recognition in his eyes, but he shakes his head. \"No, no see,\" he mutters, turning away to serve another customer.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm furious. I want to grab him, shake him, make him tell me the truth. But I'm also scared. If he knows something, what does that mean for Mei? My chest feels tight, like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to a 7, I think. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm moving through the bar, showing Mei's picture to anyone who will look. Most ignore me or shake their heads. Then I notice a man in the corner, watching me intently. He's Western, maybe in his 50s, wearing an expensive-looking suit that seems out of place here. As I approach him, he smiles, but it doesn't reach his eyes. They're cold... predatory.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I show him Mei's picture. He looks at it for a long time, then back at me. \"Pretty girl,\" he says in accented English. \"Maybe I can help you find her.\" My skin crawls at his tone, but I'm desperate. I nod, and he gestures for me to follow him out of the bar.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: My legs feel weak, and there's a knot in my stomach. I'm sweating profusely, and my mouth is dry. But I force myself to follow him. We step out into the humid night air. He leads me down a narrow alley, away from the main street. Every instinct is screaming at me to turn back, but I can't. What if he really knows where Mei is?",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. This is really intense.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... We're deeper in the alley now. I can barely see anything. Suddenly, he stops and turns to face me. \"Your daughter,\" he says, his voice low and menacing, \"she's gone. And if you keep looking, you'll disappear too.\" I freeze, terror washing over me. I want to run, to scream, but I'm paralyzed. Then I hear footsteps behind me, multiple sets. I spin around and see three large men blocking the way we came.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I panic. I try to push past the man in the suit, but he grabs my arm. His grip is like iron. \"Last chance,\" he hisses. \"Go home and forget about her.\" I'm shaking, tears streaming down my face. But through the fear, I feel a surge of rage. This man, these people, they took my Mei. Before I can think, I swing my fist, catching him off guard. He stumbles back, and I run.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you run?",
    "Client: My heart is pounding so hard I think it might burst. My lungs are burning, and my legs feel like lead. But adrenaline is coursing through me. I can hear them chasing me, their footsteps echoing off the walls of the alley. I'm gasping for air, choking on sobs as I run.",
    "Therapist: Keep going. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I see a gap between two buildings, barely wide enough for me to squeeze through. I dart into it, scraping my arms on the rough walls. I can hear them cursing, trying to follow. But they're too big to fit. I keep running, not knowing where I am or where I'm going. Eventually, I burst out onto a busy street. The noise and lights are overwhelming after the dark alley.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. Relieved to have escaped, but devastated. They know about Mei. They threatened me. What have they done to her? I'm gasping for air, my whole body shaking. People on the street are staring at me, but I can't stop crying.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. This is almost unbearable.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Remember, you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I stumble down the street, barely able to see through my tears. I need to find help, but I don't know who to trust. Every face I see could be one of them. I spot a police station across the street, but I hesitate. What if they're involved too? But I have no choice. I have to try. I cross the street, my legs barely supporting me. As I reach for the door, I collapse, overwhelmed by fear, exhaustion, and grief.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: A police officer rushes out to help me. I try to explain about Mei, about the men in the alley, but I'm hysterical. They bring me inside, give me water. I show them Mei's picture, begging them to help. But I can see it in their eyes - they've seen this before. They take my statement, but I can tell they don't have much hope. I feel... I feel utterly helpless. Like I've failed Mei completely.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm devastated. My chest aches like my heart is literally breaking. I can't stop shaking. The realization is sinking in that I might never see Mei again. That she might be suffering right now, and I can't do anything to help her. I feel like I can't breathe, like the world is closing in around me.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here in the room with me. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 10. I can't... I can't do this anymore.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well. Let's start bringing you back to the present. Look around the room. Can you name five things you see?",
    "Client: I... I see the clock on the wall. Your desk. The plant in the corner. The bookshelf. And... and the tissue box.",
    "Therapist: Good. Take another deep breath. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm still shaken up. My heart is racing, and I feel drained. But... but I'm starting to feel more grounded.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You did excellent work today. Let's take a few more deep breaths together.",
    "Client: Okay... (takes several deep breaths) I'm feeling a bit calmer now. It's... it's hard to believe how real it all felt.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. Can you tell me what your SUDS level is now?",
    "Client: It's coming down... maybe a 6 now. I'm still upset, but I'm starting to feel more in control.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How are you feeling about the session overall?",
    "Client: It was incredibly difficult. I didn't realize how much I'd been holding back. But... but I also feel like I've taken a step forward. Like I'm finally confronting what happened instead of running from it.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. You showed a lot of courage today. How about we spend the rest of our time discussing some coping strategies you can use when these memories come up?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be helpful. I... I want to be better prepared for when these feelings hit me outside of our sessions.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. Let's start with some grounding techniques..."
