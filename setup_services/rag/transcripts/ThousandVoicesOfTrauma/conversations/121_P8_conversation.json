    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. The memory of that airplane crash... it's so vivid. I can still hear the screeching of metal, feel the violent shaking. My heart's pounding just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's like... it's like I'm right back there, you know? I can feel this tightness in my chest, and my palms are sweaty. I keep thinking about how helpless I felt, strapped into that seat, not knowing if I was going to live or die.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. Where in your body do you feel that fear most intensely?",
    "Client: It's... it's in my stomach. Like a heavy knot that's twisting tighter and tighter. And my throat feels constricted, like I can't get enough air. It's almost suffocating, you know? Like I'm trapped all over again.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind as you experience these sensations?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"Why me? Why did I survive when others didn't?\" There's this guilt that comes with it. And then I think about how fragile life is. How everything can change in an instant. It makes me feel so... small and insignificant in the grand scheme of things.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts relate to your experiences of neglect?",
    "Client: I... I never thought about that connection before. But now that you mention it, I guess... both situations made me feel powerless. Like I had no control over what was happening to me. With the neglect, it was this slow, constant feeling of being unimportant, invisible. And with the crash, it was this sudden, intense realization that my life could end at any moment. Both experiences... they just reinforce this idea that I'm not in control of my own life.",
    "Therapist: I see. What else comes up for you?",
    "Client: There's... there's also this anger. I'm angry at the airline, at the pilots, at whoever was responsible for the crash. But I'm also angry at myself for still being affected by this. It's been years, and I still can't shake it. And then I feel guilty for being angry because I survived when others didn't. It's like this vicious cycle of emotions that I can't escape.",
    "Therapist: How does your chronic pain factor into these feelings?",
    "Client: Oh man, it's like... it's like a constant reminder, you know? Every twinge, every ache brings me back to that moment. Sometimes I wonder if the pain is psychosomatic, like my body's way of keeping the memory alive. And it makes me feel weak, like I can't move on. It's frustrating because I want to be stronger, to be over this, but my body won't let me forget.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your breathing right now?",
    "Client: I... I hadn't even noticed, but it's shallow and rapid. Like I can't quite catch my breath. It's similar to how I felt during the crash, that panic of not getting enough air. And now that I'm aware of it, I can feel my heart racing too. It's like my body's preparing for something terrible to happen all over again.",
    "Therapist: Can you try taking a few deep breaths for me?",
    "Client: Okay... *deep breath* ... *exhale* ... *deep breath* ... *exhale* ... Wow, that... that actually helps a bit. I feel some of the tension leaving my shoulders. It's like... for a moment, I can step back from the memory and remember that I'm here, I'm safe. But there's still this underlying anxiety, you know? Like I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop.",
    "Therapist: What does safety feel like to you in this moment?",
    "Client: Safety... it's hard to define. I guess it's the knowledge that I'm not in immediate danger. But it's more than that. It's... it's feeling grounded, present. Like right now, focusing on my breathing, feeling the chair beneath me, hearing your voice... it reminds me that I'm not in that plane anymore. I'm here, in this room, and nothing bad is happening right now. But it's fragile, you know? Like it could shatter at any moment.",
    "Therapist: How does this experience compare to previous exposures?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a bit easier this time. Don't get me wrong, it's still intense and uncomfortable. But I feel like I can stay with the memory a little longer without completely losing myself in it. Maybe... maybe I'm starting to build some resilience? I don't know. It's just, before, I would have been completely overwhelmed by now, probably dissociating. But today, even though it's hard, I feel more... present. More able to observe my reactions without being totally consumed by them.",
    "Therapist: What do you think has contributed to this change?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's a combination of things. The breathing exercises we've practiced have been helping. And maybe just the repetition of facing this memory is making it a little less scary each time. Also, I've been trying to be kinder to myself lately, not judging my reactions so harshly. It's hard, but I'm trying to remember that it's okay to still be affected by this. It doesn't make me weak or broken. It's just... it's part of my story now.",
    "Therapist: How does that self-compassion feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's new. And honestly, sometimes it feels wrong, like I don't deserve it. But when I can access it, it's... comforting. Like a warm blanket around my shoulders. It doesn't take away the pain or fear, but it makes it more bearable. It's like... it's like I'm finally acknowledging that what happened to me was real and significant, and that it's okay to still be healing from it. But it's a struggle. Sometimes that critical voice in my head is still so loud.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to tell that critical voice right now?",
    "Client: I... I'd like to tell it to back off, you know? To give me a break. I want to say, \"Hey, I'm doing the best I can. I survived something terrible, and I'm still here, still trying to get better. That counts for something.\" And maybe... maybe I'd tell it that I understand where it's coming from. That voice, it's trying to protect me in its own way, by keeping me vigilant. But I don't need that kind of protection anymore. I need... I need kindness and patience now.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to stand up to that critical voice?",
    "Client: It feels... empowering. Like I'm taking back some control. There's this little spark of strength in my chest. It's small, but it's there. And it makes me think that maybe, just maybe, I can get through this. That I can learn to live with what happened without letting it define me. It's scary to think about, but also... hopeful? Yeah, I think that's the word. Hopeful.",
    "Therapist: What do you want to remember from today's session?",
    "Client: I want to remember this feeling of hope. And the fact that I was able to face the memory without completely falling apart. I want to remember that it's okay to still struggle with this, but also that I'm making progress. Even if it's slow, even if there are setbacks, I'm moving forward. And I want to remember the power of self-compassion. That being kind to myself isn't a weakness, it's a strength. It's... it's part of the healing process.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful reflection. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, to be honest. Emotionally drained. But there's also this sense of... I don't know, accomplishment? Like I've done something difficult but important. My body feels heavy, but my mind feels a bit clearer. The fear and anxiety are still there, but they're not as overwhelming as they were at the beginning of the session. It's like... it's like I can see a bit of light peeking through the clouds. It's not sunshine yet, but it's something.",
    "Therapist: That's a beautiful metaphor. What would you like to do to take care of yourself for the rest of the day?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need some quiet time. Maybe I'll go for a walk in the park near my place. Being in nature always helps ground me. And then maybe I'll call a friend, just to chat about normal, everyday things. To remind myself that life goes on, you know? And tonight, I'll try to do something kind for myself. Maybe take a long bath, or read a book I enjoy. Just... just little things to nurture that spark of hope we talked about.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a wonderful plan. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I don't think so. I just... I want to thank you. For guiding me through this, for creating a safe space where I can face these memories. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm making progress. And that means a lot to me.",
    "Therapist: You're very welcome. I'll see you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, definitely. Thank you again. See you next week."
