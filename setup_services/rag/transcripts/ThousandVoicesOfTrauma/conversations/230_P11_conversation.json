    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart is still racing a bit, and I feel kind of drained. Going through that memory of witnessing the violence during my sister's illness... it's just so overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. Watching my sister suffer and not being able to do anything... And then the sudden outburst of violence in the hospital. It all happened so fast, but in my mind, it feels like it's playing in slow motion. I can still hear the shouting, the crash of medical equipment... (voice trembles) I'm sorry, it's just... it's a lot.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. I felt like I was right back there. My palms got sweaty, and I could feel my chest tightening. But... (pauses) I think it was different this time. I mean, it was still awful, but I felt more... I don't know, more in control? Like I could observe it without being completely consumed by it. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. That's progress. How do you think this relates to your PTSD symptoms?",
    "Client: Well, I've been having fewer nightmares lately. And I think... maybe it's because I'm facing these memories head-on now? Before, I'd do anything to avoid thinking about it. But now, even though it's painful, I feel like I'm... reclaiming the memory, if that makes sense. It doesn't have as much power over me.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. How does this progress make you feel?",
    "Client: Honestly? Both scared and hopeful. Scared because I know there's still more work to do, and these sessions are emotionally draining. But hopeful because for the first time in a long time, I feel like I might actually get better. Like I might be able to think about my sister without immediately being thrown back into that traumatic moment.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid feelings. What's helping you push through the fear?",
    "Client: I think... it's the desire to live fully again. I want to be present for my family, to enjoy my work without constant anxiety. And... (tears up) I want to honor my sister's memory by living the life she didn't get to have. She was always so vibrant, you know? I feel like I owe it to her to find that vibrancy in myself again.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful motivation. How can we use that in your ongoing recovery?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I can try to focus on that goal when things get tough? Like, when I'm tempted to avoid something or when the memories feel overwhelming, I can remind myself why I'm doing this. For my sister, for my family, for myself.",
    "Therapist: Excellent idea. How do you feel about continuing with the exposures?",
    "Client: It's daunting, but I'm committed. I've come this far, and I can see the changes. It's like... slowly but surely, I'm taking back control of my life. And that feeling... it's worth the discomfort of these sessions.",
    "Therapist: That's a great perspective. What else can we do to support your progress?",
    "Client: I think... maybe we could work on some more grounding techniques? Sometimes after these sessions, I feel a bit disconnected. And perhaps... (hesitates) could we talk more about how to handle the depression that comes with all of this? Some days it's really hard to stay motivated.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll address both those areas. Any final thoughts on today's session?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. I know I still have a long way to go, but for the first time in years, I feel like I'm on the right path. It's not easy, but... I'm starting to believe that I can get through this. That I can find joy again, even with everything that's happened.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work. We'll continue this journey together."
