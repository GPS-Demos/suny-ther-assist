    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Maria?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Revisiting that memory of being imprisoned after the abuse... it brings up so many emotions. I feel drained, but also... maybe a little lighter? It's hard to explain.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The feeling of helplessness, I think. Being in that cell, knowing what had happened to me, and feeling like I had no control over anything. It was suffocating. But... talking about it now, I realize I survived that. I'm here, and I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. How does that realization feel?",
    "Client: It's... empowering, I suppose. I mean, don't get me wrong, it's still painful to think about. But there's a part of me that feels stronger for having gone through it and come out the other side. I've never really thought about it that way before.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight, Maria.",
    "Client: Yeah... I guess it is. You know, I've always focused on how the trauma weakened me, how it broke me down. But maybe... maybe it also showed me how resilient I can be. Is that crazy to think?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. How does this connect to your recovery goals?",
    "Client: Well, I've always wanted to feel less afraid, less... controlled by my past. If I can start seeing myself as someone who overcame something terrible instead of someone who was just a victim... maybe that's a step towards feeling stronger in my day-to-day life?",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent observation.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's... it's not easy, you know? Sometimes I feel like I'm making progress, and other times it feels like I'm right back where I started. But today, even though it was hard, I feel like I've taken a step forward.",
    "Therapist: How do you think you can build on this?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe I need to remind myself more often of my strength? Or... or maybe I could try to challenge some of the negative thoughts I have about myself when I'm feeling triggered. It's just... it's hard to remember these things in the moment, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Any strategies you think might help?",
    "Client: Hmm... Maybe I could write down some of these realizations? Like, keep a little note with me that reminds me of my strength when I'm feeling overwhelmed. Or... or maybe practice some positive self-talk? I don't know if I'd be very good at that, but it might be worth trying.",
    "Therapist: Those are great ideas, Maria.",
    "Client: Thanks. I... I have to admit, I'm a little surprised at myself. When we started these sessions, I didn't think I'd ever be able to talk about what happened without completely falling apart. But here I am, discussing it and even finding some... some hope, I guess. It's strange, but in a good way.",
    "Therapist: How does this progress make you feel about continuing therapy?",
    "Client: It makes me feel... cautiously optimistic, I think. I mean, it's still hard, and I know we have more difficult sessions ahead. But for the first time in a long time, I feel like there might actually be a light at the end of this very long, dark tunnel. I want to keep going, to see where this path leads. I want to reclaim my life.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling pretty drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know I have a long way to go, but... I'm starting to believe that I can do this. That's... that's huge for me.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today, Maria. Take care.",
    "Client: Thank you. I will. See you next week."
