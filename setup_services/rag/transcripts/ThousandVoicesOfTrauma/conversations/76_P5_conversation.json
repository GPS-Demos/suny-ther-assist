    "Therapist: Hello, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Chen. I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares about the car accident lately, and I'm not sure if I'm ready for this.",
    "Therapist: I understand. It's natural to feel anxious. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried that talking about the accident in detail will make everything worse. I've been trying so hard to push those memories away, and the idea of purposely bringing them up feels... terrifying. Plus, with everything else going on in my life - my business, my relationship - I'm not sure if I can handle any more stress right now.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. Let's discuss the purpose of imaginal exposure.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm listening, but I'm still pretty apprehensive about this whole thing. Can you explain why we need to do this? And what exactly is going to happen?",
    "Therapist: Certainly. Imaginal exposure helps process traumatic memories. It may reduce PTSD symptoms over time.",
    "Client: I see. But how does reliving the trauma actually help? Won't it just make me feel worse? And what if I can't handle it? I'm already struggling with anxiety on a daily basis, and I'm worried this might push me over the edge.",
    "Therapist: It's a gradual process. We'll go at your pace, and I'll support you throughout.",
    "Client: That's somewhat reassuring. But I'm still scared. What if I have a panic attack during the session? Or what if I completely shut down and can't talk about it at all? I've never really talked about the accident in detail with anyone before.",
    "Therapist: Those reactions are normal. We have techniques to manage them if they occur.",
    "Client: Okay, that's good to know. Can you tell me more about what exactly we'll be doing? And how long will this process take? I'm trying to mentally prepare myself, but it's hard when I don't know what to expect.",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit the memory gradually. You'll describe it in present tense, focusing on details and emotions.",
    "Client: That sounds... intense. I'm not sure if I can do that. The thought of putting myself back in that moment... it's overwhelming. How do you know this won't make things worse for me?",
    "Therapist: Research shows it's effective for many. Your bravery in facing this is commendable.",
    "Client: Thank you, I appreciate that. I guess I'm just worried about losing control. In my daily life, I try so hard to keep everything together - my business, my relationship, my anxiety. The idea of deliberately letting all that control go... it's scary.",
    "Therapist: I understand. We'll take it step by step. You're in control throughout the process.",
    "Client: Okay, that helps a bit. Can you tell me more about what I might feel during the exercise? And what should I do if it becomes too much?",
    "Therapist: You may experience strong emotions. We can pause anytime. I'll guide you through grounding techniques.",
    "Client: Alright. I think I'm starting to feel a little more prepared. But I'm still nervous. How long will each session last? And how many sessions will we need to do this?",
    "Therapist: Sessions typically last about an hour. The number varies, but we'll assess progress regularly.",
    "Client: I see. That doesn't sound as bad as I was imagining. I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Is there anything else I should know before we start?",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. This is a crucial step towards healing. Any other questions?",
    "Client: I think I'm okay for now. Thank you for explaining everything and being patient with all my questions. I'm still scared, but I trust you, and I'm willing to give this a try. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Shall we begin?"
