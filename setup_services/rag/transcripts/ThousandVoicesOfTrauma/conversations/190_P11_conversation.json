    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. Reliving that moment in the cult... it's like I was right back there, you know? I could almost smell the incense they always burned during those... those rituals.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The fear. God, the fear was suffocating. I remembered how the leader would tower over me, his eyes... they were so cold. And the way he'd raise his hand, I'd flinch every time, never knowing if he was going to hit me or not. It's like... like I was trapped in this constant state of terror, always on edge.",
    "Therapist: How does recalling that fear impact you now?",
    "Client: It's... it's strange. Part of me feels like that scared little girl again, but there's also this anger bubbling up. I'm angry that they had so much control over me, that I let them manipulate me for so long. But then I feel guilty for being angry because... because they said anger was a sin, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a complex mix of emotions. How do you think this relates to your current symptoms?",
    "Client: I... I think it explains a lot, actually. Like, why I'm always so hypervigilant, always expecting the worst. And why I have such a hard time trusting people or feeling safe in relationships. It's like... like I'm still living with that constant fear, even though I'm not in the cult anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful connection. What else?",
    "Client: Well, I've been having these nightmares where I'm back in the compound, trying to escape but can't find my way out. I guess... I guess that's my brain still processing the trauma, huh? And maybe why I get so anxious in enclosed spaces or when I feel like I don't have control over a situation.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How did it feel to confront this memory today?",
    "Client: It was... tough. Really tough. But also... I don't know, maybe a little empowering? Like, I survived that. I got out. And now I'm here, facing it head-on. It's scary as hell, but I'm doing it, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's giving you strength to continue?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's the hope that I can finally break free from this. Not just physically, but mentally and emotionally too. I want to be able to trust again, to feel safe in my own skin. And... and I'm starting to believe that maybe I deserve that. That what happened wasn't my fault.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant shift. How can we build on this?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to keep facing these memories, as hard as it is. Maybe... maybe write about them? I've been thinking about starting a journal. And I want to work on challenging those old beliefs they drilled into me. Like, it's okay to question things, it's okay to have my own thoughts and feelings.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like great strategies. Anything else?",
    "Client: Yeah, um... I think I need to be kinder to myself. Like, when I have a panic attack or a flashback, instead of beating myself up about it, maybe I can try to remember that it's just my brain trying to protect me. And... and maybe I can start reaching out more when I'm struggling, instead of isolating myself like they taught me to.",
    "Therapist: Excellent insights. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, honestly. But also... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful? Like, this is hard work, but it feels like I'm finally moving forward, you know? It's like... like I can see a tiny light at the end of this really long, dark tunnel.",
    "Therapist: That's a beautiful metaphor. What's your takeaway from today?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's that I'm stronger than I realized. That facing these memories is hard, but not impossible. And that... that maybe, just maybe, I can reclaim the parts of myself that the cult tried to destroy. It's scary, but... but I think I'm ready to keep fighting."
