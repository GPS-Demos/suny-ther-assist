    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is buzzing, but my mind feels numb. That memory of the animal attack... it's always been there, lurking in the background, but reliving it just now... it's intense.",
    "Therapist: What sensations are you noticing in your body?",
    "Client: My heart is racing, and my palms are sweaty. There's this tightness in my chest, like I can't quite catch my breath. And my legs... they feel weak, almost like they did when I was frozen in fear during the attack. It's strange how vivid these physical sensations are, even though it happened years ago.",
    "Therapist: And what thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. Both during the attack and... and during the abuse. It's like my brain is drawing parallels between the two experiences. I'm angry at myself for freezing up, for not being able to fight back or run away. And there's this overwhelming sense of shame, like maybe I deserved it somehow. I know that's not rational, but the feeling is so strong.",
    "Therapist: How does that shame feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like a heavy weight pressing down on my shoulders. My stomach feels knotted, and there's this lump in my throat that I can't swallow past. It's suffocating, really. And I notice I'm hunching over, almost trying to make myself smaller. I guess that's how I've always dealt with shame - trying to disappear.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to run away from these feelings, to push them down like I always have. But another part of me is tired of running. I think... I think I need to feel safe. To know that it's okay to have these feelings, that they don't define me. And maybe... maybe I need to hear that it wasn't my fault. Even though I've been told that before, it's hard to believe sometimes.",
    "Therapist: It wasn't your fault. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (deep breath) Thank you. Hearing that... it helps. It's like a small crack in the wall of shame I've built up. I'm realizing how much energy it takes to keep these memories and feelings at bay. Maybe that's why I've been so depressed lately. It's exhausting, constantly being on guard.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to make that connection?",
    "Client: It's... enlightening, I guess? And a bit scary. I've spent so long trying to compartmentalize everything - the abuse, the attack, my depression. But they're all interconnected, aren't they? It's like I'm seeing the full picture for the first time, and it's overwhelming. But also... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful? Like if I can understand how it all fits together, maybe I can start to heal.",
    "Therapist: What does that hope feel like?",
    "Client: It's a warmth in my chest, like a small flame. It's fragile, but it's there. I haven't felt hopeful in a long time. It's almost foreign, you know? But it feels good. Like maybe there's a way forward, even if I can't see it clearly yet. I'm scared to trust it, though. What if I'm just setting myself up for disappointment?",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel uncertain. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm noticing that my breathing has slowed down a bit. The tightness in my chest isn't as intense. And I'm sitting up straighter, not hunching over as much. It's like... like I'm reclaiming some of my space. I've always felt so small, especially after the abuse and the attack. But right now, I feel... not exactly big, but maybe... present? Like I have a right to exist and take up space.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to take up that space?",
    "Client: It's empowering, but also terrifying. I've spent so long trying to be invisible, convinced that if I were noticed, I'd be hurt again. But sitting here, feeling present in my body... it's like I'm reconnecting with a part of myself I thought I'd lost. I'm realizing how much of my life I've spent on the sidelines, too afraid to fully participate. And that makes me sad, but also angry. I've missed out on so much because of what happened to me.",
    "Therapist: What do you want to do with that anger?",
    "Client: I... I want to use it. Not destructively, but as fuel. Fuel to keep pushing forward in therapy, to confront these memories and feelings instead of running from them. I want to channel it into self-advocacy, into setting boundaries and standing up for myself. For so long, I've seen my anger as something to be ashamed of, but maybe it can be a tool for healing instead.",
    "Therapist: That sounds powerful. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... raw. Exposed. Like I've peeled back a layer and I can't put it back. It's uncomfortable, but also... freeing? I'm exhausted, but there's an undercurrent of energy too. Like I've taken a step towards something important. I'm scared of what other memories and feelings might surface, but I also feel more equipped to handle them. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: It's a common experience. What do you need to feel grounded?",
    "Client: I think I need to reconnect with my surroundings. Maybe... maybe we could do a quick grounding exercise? And then, if it's okay, I'd like to talk about how to carry this awareness forward. How to use what I've learned today in my daily life. Is that something we can do?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's start with grounding. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: I see the soft blue walls of your office, the green plant in the corner, the sunlight streaming through the window. I can feel the texture of the chair beneath me, the coolness of the air on my skin. I hear the faint ticking of the clock, and the distant sound of traffic outside. It's... it's helping. I feel more present, more here.",
    "Therapist: Good. How would you like to move forward?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to set some small, achievable goals for the week. Maybe ways to practice being present in my body, or techniques to use when I feel overwhelmed by memories or emotions. And I'd like to explore more about how my past experiences are affecting my current relationships and work life. Is that something we can work on?",
    "Therapist: Yes, we can definitely focus on that. How about we start now?",
    "Client: That sounds good. I'm feeling a bit drained from the exposure exercise, but also motivated to make some changes. Where do you think we should begin? Maybe with some grounding techniques I can use at home or work when I start feeling overwhelmed? I've never really had tools to deal with these feelings before, so I'm not sure what might be helpful.",
    "Therapist: Let's start with a simple breathing exercise. Ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I'm ready. I appreciate you guiding me through this. It's... it's nice to not feel so alone in dealing with all of this. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe I can do this. Like maybe I can heal and reclaim my life. It won't be easy, but... I think I'm ready to try.",
