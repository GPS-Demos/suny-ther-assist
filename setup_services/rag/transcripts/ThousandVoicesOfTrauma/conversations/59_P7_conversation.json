    "Client: Okay... I'm walking home from the library late at night. It's dark, and the streets are quiet. I hear footsteps behind me, and my heart starts racing. I try to walk faster, but suddenly I'm grabbed from behind. I can smell alcohol on his breath...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: He pushes me against a wall. I'm terrified, frozen. I want to scream, but no sound comes out. His hands are all over me, and I can't breathe. I close my eyes, wishing it would end...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) I... I can't. It's too much. I feel like I'm back there again.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay... He's... he's touching me, and I feel so helpless. I manage to yell for help, and suddenly there are sirens. He runs away, and I collapse on the ground, shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Continue.",
    "Client: The police arrive, but instead of helping me, they start asking accusatory questions. \"Why were you out so late?\" \"What were you wearing?\" I feel humiliated and angry. One officer even suggests I might have been \"asking for it.\" I can't believe this is happening.",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly frustrating.",
    "Client: It was. I felt betrayed by the very people who were supposed to protect me. They took my statement, but their attitude made it clear they didn't believe me. I left feeling even more violated than before.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking a bit. My heart is racing. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I'm facing it instead of running away.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive observation. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to talk about, but I think it's getting a little easier each time. I just wish I could forget about the police's reaction. It makes me so angry and disappointed in the system.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Let's explore that more.",
    "Client: It's just... I always thought the police were there to help. But that night, they made me feel like I was the criminal. Like I had done something wrong by being attacked. It's changed how I view authority figures. I don't trust them anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. How does this affect you now?",
    "Client: Well, I get anxious whenever I see police officers. My heart starts racing, and I feel like I need to escape. It's affecting my daily life. I avoid going out at night, and I'm always looking over my shoulder. I feel like I can't trust anyone to help me if something happens again.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great insight. Keep going.",
    "Client: I've been having nightmares too. Sometimes about the attack, but often about the police interrogation. In my dreams, they're laughing at me, telling me it's my fault. I wake up feeling angry and helpless. It's like I'm reliving the trauma every night.",
    "Therapist: That sounds challenging. How do you cope?",
    "Client: I've been trying some breathing exercises, which help a little. And talking about it here... it's hard, but I think it's making a difference. I'm starting to realize that what happened wasn't my fault, despite what the police implied.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. Well done.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's a slow process, but I think I'm making progress. I still have a long way to go, especially with trusting authority figures again. But I'm hoping that by facing these memories head-on, I can start to regain some control over my life.",
    "Therapist: You're showing remarkable strength. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also a bit lighter. Like I've let go of some of the weight I've been carrying. It's still painful to talk about, but I think it's getting easier. I'm starting to see that I can face these memories without being completely overwhelmed by them.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. This session was intense, but I feel like I've taken a step forward. Thank you for guiding me through it.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Take care of yourself."
