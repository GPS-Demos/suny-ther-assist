    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mr. Patel?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. It's like I'm right back there, you know? The memory of finding out about my daughter's disappearance... it's so vivid. My heart is racing, and I feel this tightness in my chest. It's hard to breathe normally.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... what if I had done something differently? Maybe if I had been more strict about her going out, or if I had insisted on picking her up that night... Maybe she would still be here. And then I feel guilty for even considering that it might be my fault. I know logically it's not, but emotionally... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: I see. How do these thoughts affect you physically?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking, and I feel this knot in my stomach. It's like my body is preparing for bad news all over again. I can even taste that bitter coffee I was drinking when the police came to our door. It's strange how such small details stick with you.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are you experiencing as you recall this?",
    "Client: Anger. So much anger. At the people who took her, at the world for being so cruel, and... and at myself for not being able to protect her. But beneath that, there's this profound sadness. It's like a black hole inside me, threatening to swallow everything. And fear... fear that I'll never know what really happened to her.",
    "Therapist: How does this compare to how you felt immediately after the event?",
    "Client: It's... it's less raw now, I suppose. Back then, it was like being in a nightmare I couldn't wake up from. Every moment was agony. Now, it comes in waves. Sometimes I can almost forget for a little while, but then something triggers the memory, and it all comes flooding back. The pain is still there, but it's... duller, if that makes sense?",
    "Therapist: What's the hardest part for you right now?",
    "Client: The hardest part is... is the not knowing. Every time the phone rings, there's this split second where I think it might be news about her. And then when it's not, I feel this crushing disappointment. It's exhausting, living with this constant hope and fear. Sometimes I wonder if it would be easier if we knew for certain that she was... that she was gone. And then I hate myself for even thinking that.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with these intense feelings?",
    "Client: I try to keep busy. Work helps, sometimes. But other times, it feels meaningless compared to what happened. I've been going to support groups for parents of missing children. It helps to know I'm not alone, but it's also painful to see so many others suffering. My wife and I... we try to support each other, but it's hard. We grieve differently, and sometimes that creates distance between us.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your ability to handle these memories now?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm getting better at sitting with the pain. Before, I would do anything to avoid thinking about it. Now, I can talk about it without completely falling apart. It still hurts, God, it hurts so much. But I'm starting to see that maybe I can carry this pain and still... still live. It's not easy, though. Some days are harder than others.",
    "Therapist: How has this experience changed your view of the world?",
    "Client: It's made me realize how fragile everything is. How quickly life can change. I used to think that if you worked hard and were a good person, things would be okay. Now I know that's not true. The world can be a dark place. But... I've also seen incredible kindness. People I barely knew rallying around us, offering support. It's shown me both the worst and the best of humanity.",
    "Therapist: What helps you find hope or meaning now?",
    "Client: I... I've started volunteering with organizations that work to prevent human trafficking. It feels like the only way I can make sense of what happened. If I can help even one family avoid this pain, maybe... maybe there's some purpose to all of this. And I hold onto the hope that one day we'll know what happened to her. Even if it's not the outcome we pray for, just knowing would be... something.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, after sharing all of this?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, but there's also a sense of relief. Talking about it, really diving into these feelings... it's draining, but it also feels like I'm slowly chipping away at this massive weight I've been carrying. I know the pain won't ever completely go away, but maybe... maybe I'm learning how to live with it.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing so openly. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to work on how to better support my wife through this. And maybe explore more ways to cope with the uncertainty. It's still the hardest part for me.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How about we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that's a good idea. I'm feeling quite drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Thank you for listening and guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
