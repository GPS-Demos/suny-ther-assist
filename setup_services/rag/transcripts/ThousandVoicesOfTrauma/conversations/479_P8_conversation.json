    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart's still racing, and I feel this tightness in my chest. The memories... they were so vivid. I could almost smell the gunpowder and feel the heat on my skin. It's like I was right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: Guilt. So much guilt. I keep thinking about the faces of my comrades, the ones who didn't make it. Their eyes... they haunt me. I should have done more, you know? Maybe if I had reacted faster or made different decisions, they'd still be alive. And then there's this anger, this rage bubbling up inside me. Why did it have to be them? Why did any of us have to be there in the first place?",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings manifest in your body?",
    "Client: It's like... like there's this heavy weight on my chest. My hands are shaky, and I feel this nervous energy coursing through me. I can't seem to sit still. And my stomach... it's in knots. I feel nauseous, like I might be sick at any moment. It's as if my body is trying to reject these memories, but they won't go away.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are accompanying these sensations?",
    "Client: I keep hearing the explosions, the screams. I see flashes of light, and then darkness. There's this voice in my head saying, \"You failed them. You're a coward.\" And then another part of me is trying to rationalize it all, saying, \"You did what you could. It wasn't your fault.\" But the guilt... it's overwhelming. I feel like I don't deserve to be here when so many others aren't.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your everyday life now?",
    "Client: It's... it's everywhere. I can't sleep without nightmares. Loud noises make me jump. I feel on edge all the time, like I'm still in that combat zone. I've pushed away my family, my friends. It's easier to be alone than to explain why I flinch at a car backfiring or why I can't go to crowded places. I feel... disconnected. Like I'm not really here, you know? Like part of me is still back there, reliving it all over and over again.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Part of me wants to run away, to forget it all. But another part knows I need to face this. I guess... I need to feel safe. To know that it's okay to feel this way, that I'm not weak for struggling with this. And maybe... maybe I need to find a way to honor those we lost without letting the guilt consume me. I just... I want to feel normal again. Is that even possible?",
    "Therapist: It's a process. What's one small step you could take?",
    "Client: I suppose... I could try talking to my partner about this. They've been so patient, but I've shut them out. Maybe sharing some of this burden might help. And... I've been avoiding our unit's memorial services. Maybe attending one, paying my respects... it might help me start to process this grief instead of running from it. It's terrifying, but... maybe it's necessary.",
    "Therapist: How does considering these steps make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of emotions. There's fear, definitely. Opening up, facing these memories head-on - it's scary. But there's also a tiny spark of... hope? Like maybe, just maybe, there's a way through this. It's exhausting, carrying all this alone. The idea of sharing it, of not being so isolated... it's both frightening and somewhat relieving. I'm not sure I'm ready, but I think I want to be.",
    "Therapist: What support do you need to take these steps?",
    "Client: I think... I need someone to hold me accountable, to encourage me when I feel like backing out. Maybe... maybe you could help me prepare for that conversation with my partner? And I might need some strategies for managing the anxiety before the memorial service. I'm worried I might have a panic attack or... or that seeing the families of those we lost might be too much. But I want to try. I'm tired of letting this control my life.",
    "Therapist: That's incredibly brave. How can we start preparing?",
    "Client: Could we... could we maybe role-play the conversation with my partner? I'm not sure how to even begin explaining all of this. And perhaps we could work on some grounding techniques for when things get overwhelming? I want to be able to stay present, to really engage with this process instead of dissociating like I usually do. It's going to be hard, but... I think I'm ready to start trying.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Where would you like to begin?",
    "Client: Let's start with the conversation with my partner. I'm most nervous about that. I've kept so much from them for so long, I'm not even sure where to start. Maybe we could work on how to explain why I've been so distant? And how to ask for their support without overwhelming them? I don't want them to feel like they have to fix me, you know? I just... I need them to understand. To be patient with me as I work through this.",
    "Therapist: That's a great place to start. Ready?",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, I think I am. It's scary, but... it feels like the right thing to do. Like maybe this is the first step towards reclaiming my life from these memories. I know it won't be easy, but for the first time in a long while, I feel like there might be a way forward. Let's do this."
