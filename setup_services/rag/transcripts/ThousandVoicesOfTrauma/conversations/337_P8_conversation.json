    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like I'm right back there, you know? The smell of diesel fuel, the chaos... It's all so vivid. My heart is racing, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. I keep seeing flashes of that day when we were fleeing. The sounds of people shouting, children crying... It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's like... it's like I'm still in danger, even though I know I'm safe here. My hands are clammy, and I feel this urge to run, to hide. But there's also this deep sadness. We left everything behind, you know? Our home, our friends, our whole life. It's... it's hard to process.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when you first arrived as a refugee?",
    "Client: They're... they're not as intense now, I suppose. Back then, I was in a constant state of panic. I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat. Every loud noise made me jump. Now, it's more... more like waves. It comes and goes. But when it hits, like during this exercise, it's still so powerful. I feel... I feel helpless, like I did then.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"What if we hadn't made it?\" There were so many close calls. And then I feel guilty for surviving when others didn't. I wonder about the people we left behind. Are they okay? Did they make it out too? And then there's this... this anger. Why did this have to happen to us? We were just living our lives, and suddenly everything was torn apart. It's not fair.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel in your body right now?",
    "Client: My muscles are so tense, especially in my shoulders and jaw. I realize I've been clenching my teeth. There's this knot in my stomach, and I feel a bit dizzy. It's like my body is still stuck in that moment, ready to flee at any second. But at the same time, I feel so, so tired. Like I could sleep for days.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to ground myself. To remind myself that I'm here, that I'm safe now. Maybe... maybe take some deep breaths? And I need... I need to know that it's okay to feel this way. That I'm not going crazy or being weak. It's just... it's a lot to process, even after all these years.",
    "Therapist: Take those deep breaths. You're doing great.",
    "Client: (Takes several deep breaths) Thank you. It helps to focus on my breathing. I'm starting to feel a little calmer now. It's strange, you know? Reliving these memories is so painful, but there's also... I don't know, maybe a sense of release? Like I'm finally letting out something I've been holding in for so long.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to share this experience?",
    "Client: It's... it's both terrifying and relieving. I've kept so much of this bottled up inside. My family, they went through it too, so I always tried to be strong for them. But being able to talk about it, to really delve into these memories and feelings... it's scary, but it also feels like... like I'm finally acknowledging what happened. Like I'm giving myself permission to feel, to grieve, to be angry. It's exhausting, but somehow... somehow freeing.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... I'm feeling a mix of things. There's still fear and sadness, but also... a glimmer of hope, maybe? Like, if I can face these memories and talk about them, maybe I can learn to live with them better. And there's a sense of... of pride, I guess. We survived something terrible. We rebuilt our lives. It wasn't easy, and the scars are still there, but we did it. I did it.",
    "Therapist: How does this realization impact you?",
    "Client: It's... it's powerful. I've spent so long feeling like a victim, like someone who had everything taken away. But thinking about it now, I realize how much strength it took to get through all of that. To start over in a new country, learn a new language, build a new life. It doesn't erase the pain or the trauma, but it... it gives it a different context, I suppose. Like, yes, this awful thing happened, but look at what I've overcome. It's... it's oddly empowering.",
    "Therapist: What do you want to remember from this session?",
    "Client: I want to remember that it's okay to feel these intense emotions. That they're a normal response to an abnormal situation. And I want to hold onto this sense of... of resilience, I guess. The idea that I'm not just a victim of my past, but a survivor who's still here, still fighting. And maybe... maybe I want to remember that talking about it, as hard as it is, helps. It's like... like lancing a wound. It hurts, but it's part of the healing process.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like after a really intense workout. My body feels heavy, but my mind feels... clearer, somehow. The fear and panic have subsided, and there's this... this calmness settling in. I'm sure the memories and feelings will come back - they always do - but right now, I feel... I feel okay. Like I can handle this. Like I'm not alone in this anymore.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredible work today. How would you like to close our session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to take a few more deep breaths. To really ground myself in the present. And maybe... maybe remind myself of something good in my life now. Like my grandchildren, or the garden I've been working on. Something that connects me to the life I've built here, you know? To end on a note of... of hope, I guess. Because even with all the pain and trauma, there's still good in my life. And that's... that's worth holding onto.",
    "Therapist: That's a beautiful way to end. Let's do that together.",
    "Client: (Takes several deep breaths) Thank you. This was... this was hard, but I'm glad we did it. I feel... I feel like I've taken a step forward today. It's a small step, but it's something. And right now, thinking about my granddaughter's smile... it reminds me why all of this - the therapy, facing these memories - why it's worth it. For her, for my family, for myself. We made it here for a reason, and I want to make the most of this second chance we've been given.",
    "Therapist: You've shown immense courage today. We'll continue this journey together."
