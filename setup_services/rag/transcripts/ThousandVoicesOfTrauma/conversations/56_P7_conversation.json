    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and take a deep breath. When you're ready, describe the scene.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in Afghanistan. It's a hot day, and I'm on patrol with my unit. We're walking through a small village, and everything seems quiet. Too quiet.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: Suddenly, I hear a child crying. It's coming from one of the houses. My instincts tell me something's wrong, but we have to investigate. As we approach the house, I feel my heart racing.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: We enter the house, and... oh god. There are children, maybe five or six of them, huddled in a corner. They look terrified. And then I see the men... they're not locals. They're trying to smuggle these kids out.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I feel sick to my stomach. These children are so young, and they look so scared. I want to help them, but I'm frozen. I can't move. I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're here now, and you're safe.",
    "Client: I snap out of it and signal my team. We manage to subdue the traffickers, but the children... they're crying, shaking. One little girl reaches out to me, and I pick her up. She clings to me so tightly, like I'm her lifeline.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. Continue.",
    "Client: I can still feel her tiny arms around my neck, smell the dust and sweat. I want to protect her, to save all of them, but I know I can't take them with me. We have to wait for the proper authorities, and it feels like an eternity.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job describing the scene. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... overwhelmed. Angry at the traffickers, heartbroken for the children. And guilty. So guilty that I couldn't do more.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those feelings. You're processing this well.",
    "Client: As we wait, I try to comfort the children. I give them water, some snacks from my pack. But I can't stop thinking about what might have happened if we hadn't found them. Where they might have ended up. It haunts me.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage facing this memory. Keep going.",
    "Client: When the authorities finally arrive, I have to hand over the little girl. She starts crying again, and I feel like I'm abandoning her. I know it's irrational, but it feels like I'm failing her all over again.",
    "Therapist: You're not failing anyone. You're here, working through this.",
    "Client: As we leave the village, I can't shake the image of those children's faces. I keep wondering what happened to them after we left. Did they get the help they needed? Are they safe now? I feel like I should have done more, followed up somehow.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have those thoughts. You're processing this trauma.",
    "Client: Even now, years later, I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night, hearing that little girl's cries. I feel so helpless, like I'm back in that moment and can't do anything to change it.",
    "Therapist: You're not helpless now. You're facing this memory bravely.",
    "Client: I know rationally that we did the best we could in that situation, but emotionally... it's hard. I struggle with the idea that maybe we could have saved more children, stopped more traffickers. It's a weight I carry every day.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an incredible job expressing these difficult emotions.",
    "Client: Sometimes I wonder if I made the right choice, joining the military. I've seen so much, done so much... but moments like these make me question everything. Was it worth it? Did I make a difference?",
    "Therapist: These are important questions. You're showing great insight.",
    "Client: I try to remind myself of the good we did, the lives we saved. But it's hard when the bad memories are so vivid. That day in the village... it changed me. I'm not the same person I was before.",
    "Therapist: Change can be difficult, but you're handling it well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. But also, in a strange way, a little lighter. Like talking about it has lifted some of the weight. It's still there, but it's not crushing me as much.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. You've done excellent work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's not easy, but I think it helps to talk about it. To remember that I'm not alone in carrying this burden.",
    "Therapist: You're absolutely right. You're not alone. Shall we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that's enough for now. Thank you for listening and guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. You've shown tremendous strength today. We'll continue our work in our next session."
