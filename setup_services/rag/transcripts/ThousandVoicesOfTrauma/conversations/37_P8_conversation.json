    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I'm back there, you know? In that hallway at school, with all those eyes on me. I can still hear their laughter, their taunts. It's like... like a weight pressing down on my chest.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Shame. Definitely shame. It's this overwhelming feeling of... of not being good enough. Like I'm somehow less than everyone else because of how I look, because of my ethnicity. I know logically that it's not true, but emotionally... it still hits hard.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does that shame feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a hot, prickly sensation all over my skin. My face feels flushed, and there's this tightness in my throat. I want to curl up and disappear. It's funny, even now, years later, talking about it brings back those same physical sensations.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep hearing their words... \"Go back to where you came from!\" \"Why are you even here?\" And I'm thinking... I was born here. This is my home too. Why couldn't they see that? Why did they have to make me feel so... alien? And then I start doubting myself. Maybe I don't belong. Maybe I'll never truly fit in.",
    "Therapist: How do those thoughts impact you now?",
    "Client: They... they make me hesitant. Even now, in my professional life, I sometimes hold back. I worry that if I speak up or stand out, I'll be targeted again. It's like I'm always on guard, waiting for someone to point out that I don't belong. It's exhausting, really.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your breathing?",
    "Client: Oh... I didn't even realize, but it's quite shallow. Quick, short breaths. I'm trying to take deeper breaths now that you've mentioned it. It's helping a little, grounding me back in the present.",
    "Therapist: Good. What else helps you feel grounded?",
    "Client: I... I try to remind myself of how far I've come. I have a successful career, a loving partner. I've achieved so much despite what those bullies said. Sometimes I imagine my younger self and try to give her a hug, tell her it'll be okay. That helps... makes me feel stronger.",
    "Therapist: How does that strength feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a warm glow in my chest. It spreads outward, countering that prickly shame feeling. When I connect with that strength, I stand a little taller. My breathing gets easier. I feel more... me. More whole.",
    "Therapist: What's different now compared to when we started?",
    "Client: I feel... calmer. More centered. The memory is still there, but it doesn't have the same grip on me. It's like... I can observe it without being completely overwhelmed by it. There's a bit of sadness, still, for that young girl who went through so much. But there's also pride in how I've grown.",
    "Therapist: How might you use this experience going forward?",
    "Client: I think... I think I can use it as a reminder of my resilience. When I'm facing challenges at work or in social situations, I can remember that I've overcome worse. Maybe I can even use it to help others who might be going through similar experiences. Turn that pain into something positive, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... lighter. Like I've set down a heavy burden I've been carrying for years. There's still work to do, I know that. But I feel more hopeful now. Like I have the tools to face these memories and come out stronger on the other side. It's... it's a good feeling.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to explore more about how these experiences have shaped my professional life. Maybe work on strategies to feel more confident in the workplace, to not let these old fears hold me back. Is that something we could discuss?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll address that next time. How are you feeling about ending today's session?",
    "Client: I'm feeling okay about it. A bit drained, honestly, but in a good way. Like after a hard workout. I know I've done some important work today. I'm looking forward to processing it all and coming back next time to dig deeper. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
