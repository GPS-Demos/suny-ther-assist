    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I know we're going to be talking about some difficult things.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We're here to support you.",
    "Client: Thanks. I appreciate that. I've been thinking a lot about what we discussed last time, about the animal attack. It's been on my mind more than usual.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for facing this. Are you ready to explore that memory?",
    "Client: I think so. It's just... it brings back a lot of emotions.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. We'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: Okay. Well, it was a sunny day. I was at the park near my house. I remember the smell of freshly cut grass and the sound of kids playing nearby. I was walking my dog, Max. He was just a puppy then, maybe six months old. We were having a good time, and I let him off the leash to run around a bit.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: Suddenly, I heard this loud barking. Before I could react, this huge dog came charging towards us. It was so fast, and its teeth were bared. I froze. I couldn't move. Max started yelping and tried to run away, but the big dog caught up to him in seconds.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I can hear Max crying out in pain. The big dog had him in its jaws, shaking him violently. There was blood everywhere. I wanted to help, but I was paralyzed with fear. I felt so helpless, so weak. I should have protected him...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're doing well.",
    "Client: People started shouting and running towards us. Someone managed to pull the big dog off Max, but it was too late. Max was... he was barely moving. I finally found my voice and started screaming for help. My hands were shaking as I tried to pick him up. There was so much blood on my clothes, on my hands...",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel sick to my stomach. My heart is racing, and I can feel tears in my eyes. It's like I'm right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember, you're here now, and you're safe.",
    "Client: I know, but it feels so real. I can still hear the sounds, smell the blood. I remember the ride to the vet, holding Max and begging him to stay alive. But he didn't make it. I lost him, and it was all my fault. If I had just kept him on the leash...",
    "Therapist: It wasn't your fault. You couldn't have known.",
    "Client: But I should have! I was responsible for him. And now, every time I see a dog, especially a big one, I get this rush of panic. I can't even walk in that park anymore. It's like I'm trapped by this memory.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength right now.",
    "Client: It doesn't feel like strength. It feels like weakness. I couldn't protect Max, and now I can't even face my fears. What kind of person does that make me?",
    "Therapist: A human one. It's okay to struggle with this.",
    "Client: I guess. It's just... this incident, it brought back other memories too. Memories of feeling helpless, of not being able to protect myself. It's like it opened up old wounds.",
    "Therapist: Can you tell me more about that?",
    "Client: It's hard to talk about. But when I was younger, I experienced... sexual abuse. And during the dog attack, I felt that same paralyzing fear, that same helplessness. It's like all those emotions came flooding back at once.",
    "Therapist: You're very courageous for sharing that. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved? It's the first time I've really talked about both of these things together. I never realized how connected they were in my mind.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. Well done.",
    "Client: Thanks. I just wish I could move past all of this. I want to be able to walk in the park again, to maybe even have another dog someday. But right now, it all feels so overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to take small steps. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I hope so. It's just hard to see sometimes. But I'm trying. I really am.",
    "Therapist: And that effort is commendable. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. This session was intense, but I'm glad we did it. Thank you for listening and for your support.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Carlos. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
