    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. It's like I'm back there, you know? The memories are so vivid. I can still smell the incense they used to burn in the communal area. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What physical sensations are you noticing right now?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I feel this tightness in my chest, like I can't get enough air. My palms are sweaty, and I have this weird tingling sensation in my fingertips. It's like my body is on high alert, ready to run or something.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how stupid I was to fall for their manipulation. I mean, I was an adult, right? I should have known better. But they were so good at making everything seem normal, like we were just a big, happy family. God, I wasted so many years of my life...",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Angry. So incredibly angry. At them, at myself. But also... scared? Like, what if I'm still that gullible person deep down? What if I haven't really changed? And there's this deep sadness too, for all the time I lost, all the relationships I missed out on.",
    "Therapist: Can you tell me more about that sadness?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a heavy weight in my stomach. I think about all the birthdays, holidays, and just normal days I missed with my family. My sister had two kids while I was in the cult, and I barely know them. I can never get that time back, you know? And it's not just about the past. It's like... I'm still struggling to connect with people now. I feel so out of place sometimes, like I don't know how to be a normal person in society.",
    "Therapist: How does this relate to your experiences in the cult?",
    "Client: I guess... well, in the cult, everything was so structured. We were told what to think, how to feel, even what to wear and eat. Now, having to make all these decisions for myself, it's overwhelming sometimes. And trusting people... that's hard. In the cult, trust was weaponized, you know? Used against us. So now, even though I want to connect with others, there's always this voice in the back of my head telling me to be careful, that people might have hidden agendas.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you share this?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... vulnerable, I suppose. It's scary to admit how much the cult still affects me. But there's also a small sense of... I don't know, maybe hope? Like, by talking about it, by facing these memories and feelings, maybe I'm taking back some control. It's painful, but it also feels like maybe I'm moving forward, even if it's just a tiny bit.",
    "Therapist: How does that sense of hope feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a warm flutter in my chest. Just a small one, but it's there. It's almost fighting against the tightness, you know? And I notice my breathing is a bit easier now. My shoulders feel less tense. It's like... maybe I can see a tiny light at the end of this very long, dark tunnel.",
    "Therapist: What does that light represent to you?",
    "Client: I think... it represents the possibility of healing. Of maybe one day being able to trust again, to form deep connections with people. To feel like I belong in the world outside the cult. It's the idea that maybe, just maybe, I can build a life that's truly mine, free from their influence. It's scary, but also... exciting? Is that weird to say?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. Can you elaborate on that excitement?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... for so long, my life was dictated by the cult. Every decision, every thought, every feeling. But now, even though it's challenging, I have the freedom to shape my own life. I can choose who I want to be, what I want to do. It's terrifying, but there's also this underlying thrill to it. Like I'm rediscovering myself, bit by bit. And each time I face these memories, each time I talk about it, it feels like I'm reclaiming a piece of myself that the cult took away.",
    "Therapist: How does this realization affect your view of recovery?",
    "Client: I think... I'm starting to see that recovery isn't just about getting over the trauma. It's about rediscovering and rebuilding myself. It's a journey, not a destination. And maybe that's okay. Maybe I don't have to have it all figured out right away. Each step, each memory I process, each feeling I allow myself to experience... it's all part of the process. It's hard, and sometimes I feel like I'm not making any progress at all. But then I have moments like this, where I can see how far I've come, and it gives me the strength to keep going.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, to be honest. Emotionally drained. But there's also this strange sense of... I don't know, accomplishment? Like I've run a marathon or something. My body feels heavy, but my mind feels a bit clearer. It's like I've shed a little bit of the weight I've been carrying. I know there's still a long way to go, but right now, in this moment, I feel... okay. Not great, but okay. And maybe that's enough for now.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think that would be good. This was intense, but... helpful, I think. Thank you for guiding me through it.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and we'll continue next session."
