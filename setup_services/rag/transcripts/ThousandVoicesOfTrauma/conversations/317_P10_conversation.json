    "Therapist: Welcome, Jake. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Hey, Dr. Miller. I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is kind of dreading it. It's weird, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start by reviewing the SUDS scale. Where are you now?",
    "Client: Uh, probably around a 4 or 5. My stomach's a bit uneasy, but I'm not panicking or anything.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess so. Where should I start?",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes if you're comfortable. Take us to the moment the cyberbullying began.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm sitting in my dorm room. It's late, maybe 11 PM. I'm scrolling through social media, and... oh god, there it is. A post about me. Someone's shared a really embarrassing photo from a party last weekend. I'm... I'm clearly drunk in the picture, and I'm doing something stupid. My heart starts racing.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's happening in your body?",
    "Client: My palms are sweating. I can feel my face getting hot. I'm... I'm scrolling through the comments, and they're all laughing at me. Calling me names. Some people I thought were my friends are joining in.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe a 7?",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I try to defend myself in the comments. But it just makes it worse. More people pile on. They're bringing up old stuff, things I thought everyone had forgotten about. It's like... it's like they've been waiting for a chance to attack me.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: Humiliated. Angry. Scared. I don't know who I can trust anymore. I want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I shut off my phone. But I can't stop thinking about it. I keep imagining everyone laughing at me, talking about me behind my back. I can't sleep. I'm tossing and turning all night.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. Ground yourself. What do you notice in the room?",
    "Client: I... I can feel the chair beneath me. I hear the hum of the air conditioner.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, what happens the next day?",
    "Client: I... I don't want to go to class. I'm afraid everyone will be staring at me, whispering. But I force myself to go. As soon as I walk into the lecture hall, I hear snickering. I can't tell if it's about me or not, but it feels like it is.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking that I'm a joke. That everyone's laughing at me. That I'll never live this down. I'm wondering if I should just drop out, transfer to another school. I can't focus on the lecture at all.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still an 8. Maybe even a 9.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. This is just a memory. What happens after class?",
    "Client: I... I practically run back to my dorm. I check my phone, and there are more comments, more posts. It's spread to other social media platforms now. People I don't even know are making fun of me. I... I feel so alone.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: I feel sick to my stomach. My hands are shaking. I... I can't stop crying.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. You're doing well. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I don't know what to do. I feel paralyzed. I want to call my parents, but I'm too ashamed. I don't want them to know how stupid I've been. I just... I just curl up in bed and try to shut out the world.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a solid 9 now. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Let's take a pause. Focus on your breathing. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... okay, I'm trying.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, tell me about the next few days.",
    "Client: It's... it's a blur. I skip most of my classes. I can't face anyone. I keep checking my phone, hoping it'll all go away, but it just gets worse. People are making memes about me now. I... I start drinking to numb the pain.",
    "Therapist: How does the drinking affect you?",
    "Client: It... it helps for a little while. But then I wake up feeling worse. More ashamed. And... and I'm worried I'll do something else stupid while I'm drunk, and it'll just give them more ammunition.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Jake. Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I finally break down and call my older sister. She's always been there for me. I tell her everything, and... and she's so angry on my behalf. She helps me report the posts, block the worst offenders. It... it helps a little, but the damage is already done.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel after talking to your sister?",
    "Client: A little better. Like... like maybe I'm not completely alone. But I'm still scared to face everyone.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe a 7?",
    "Therapist: That's progress. What happens in the following weeks?",
    "Client: It's... it's tough. I force myself to go to classes, but I sit in the back, try to be invisible. I avoid the cafeteria, the gym, anywhere I might run into people. I... I start seeing a counselor on campus. It helps a little, but I still feel so exposed, so vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: How does this isolation affect you?",
    "Client: It's... it's awful. I feel so lonely, but I'm too scared to reach out to anyone. I'm falling behind in my classes. I... I start having panic attacks whenever my phone buzzes.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's back up to an 8.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I hit rock bottom. I'm barely eating, barely sleeping. I'm considering dropping out. But then... then my roommate, who's been pretty quiet through all this, he... he sits me down. He tells me he's been worried about me, that he wants to help.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Surprised. Grateful. A little suspicious at first, but... but he seems genuine. He... he helps me start to rebuild. He goes with me to the campus tech support to improve my privacy settings. He stands up for me when people make comments.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a turning point. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down. Maybe a 6?",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going. How do things progress from there?",
    "Client: It's... it's slow. But I start to feel a little better each day. I join a support group for cyberbullying victims. I... I learn I'm not alone. I start to understand that what happened to me wasn't my fault.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization affect you?",
    "Client: It's... it's liberating. I start to feel angry at the people who did this to me, instead of just feeling ashamed. I... I start to fight back, in a way. Not by retaliating, but by speaking out about cyberbullying.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 5, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Jake. How do you see yourself now, compared to when this all started?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm stronger. Still scared sometimes, still have bad days. But I know I can survive this. I'm... I'm more careful online, but I'm not hiding anymore. I'm trying to use my experience to help others.",
    "Therapist: That's really impressive, Jake. What's your SUDS level as we wrap up?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 4 now. I feel drained, but... but okay.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... but kind of proud, I guess? Like I've faced something big.",
    "Therapist: That's exactly right. You should be proud. Let's take a few minutes to debrief and discuss coping strategies for the rest of your day."
