    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure exercise. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the scene when you witnessed the violence during your divorce?",
    "Client: Okay... I can try. It was a sunny afternoon, and I was at home. My wife and I had been arguing a lot lately about the divorce proceedings. She was in the kitchen, and I was in the living room. Suddenly, I heard a crash...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: The crash startled me. I rushed to the kitchen and saw her standing there, breathing heavily. There was a broken plate on the floor. She looked at me with such anger in her eyes... I'd never seen her like that before.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What happened next?",
    "Client: She started yelling at me, accusing me of ruining her life. Her face was red, and she was gesturing wildly. I tried to calm her down, but that only made it worse. She grabbed another plate from the counter and threw it at me.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Keep going.",
    "Client: I managed to duck, and the plate shattered against the wall behind me. I was in shock. I couldn't believe she would actually try to hurt me. We've been married for 40 years, and now... this. She kept screaming and grabbing anything she could throw.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel upset. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can continue. My heart is racing just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Okay... As she was throwing things, I saw our wedding photo on the fridge. It felt like a cruel joke. I remembered our happy times, and now here we were, in this chaos. I felt so helpless and scared.",
    "Therapist: You're showing tremendous courage. What happened after that?",
    "Client: I tried to approach her, to stop her from throwing more things. But as I got closer, she... she slapped me across the face. Hard. I stumbled backward, more from the shock than the force. I never thought she'd actually hit me.",
    "Therapist: That must have been very difficult. How did you feel?",
    "Client: I felt... betrayed. Hurt. Angry. But mostly, I felt incredibly sad. This woman I'd loved for so long had become a stranger to me. I didn't recognize her anymore. I just stood there, holding my cheek, staring at her in disbelief.",
    "Therapist: You're processing this well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: She seemed to realize what she'd done. Her anger suddenly deflated, and she started crying. She sank to the floor, surrounded by the broken dishes. I wanted to comfort her, but I was also afraid to get close. I felt torn between my instinct to protect her and my need to protect myself.",
    "Therapist: That's a complex emotional situation. How did you handle it?",
    "Client: I... I didn't know what to do. I just stood there for what felt like an eternity. Finally, I managed to call her sister to come over. I couldn't stay in that house anymore. I grabbed some clothes and left. I spent the night at a hotel, feeling completely lost and alone.",
    "Therapist: You made a difficult but safe choice. How do you feel now, recalling this?",
    "Client: It's painful. I feel a mix of sadness, anger, and regret. I keep wondering if I could have done something differently, if I could have prevented it from escalating to that point. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I survived something terrible.",
    "Therapist: That's a very insightful reflection. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It still hurts, but it feels... manageable now. Like I can look at it without being overwhelmed by it.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. How do you feel physically?",
    "Client: My heart rate has slowed down now. I feel a bit drained, but also somewhat relieved. It's like I've been carrying this heavy secret, and now that I've shared it, the load is a little lighter.",
    "Therapist: That's a common and positive response. What's your main takeaway?",
    "Client: I think... I'm stronger than I realized. And while this experience was traumatic, it doesn't define my entire marriage or my life. It's a painful chapter, but just one chapter in a longer story.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. We'll end here for today."
