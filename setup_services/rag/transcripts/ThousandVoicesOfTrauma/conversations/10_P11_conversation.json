    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Raj?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. Going through that memory of my brother's death again, it's... it's overwhelming. I can still see his face, you know? The way he looked in the hospital bed. It's like it just happened yesterday.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you this time?",
    "Client: The guilt. I keep thinking I should've done more. Maybe if I had noticed the signs earlier, or if I had pushed him to see a doctor sooner... I don't know. It's just... it's eating me up inside.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt connect to your everyday life?",
    "Client: It's... it's always there, you know? Like a weight on my chest. I find myself being overprotective of my partner, always worrying something might happen. And at work, I'm constantly double-checking everything, afraid I'll miss something important. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: I see. What else did you notice during the exposure?",
    "Client: The anger. I'm angry at the world, at the doctors, at myself. It's not fair that he's gone. And then I feel guilty for being angry, and it's just this vicious cycle. I don't know how to break out of it.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to express that anger today?",
    "Client: It was... liberating, in a way. But also scary. I'm not used to letting those feelings out. I've always tried to be the strong one, you know? For my family, for my partner. But today, it just came pouring out.",
    "Therapist: What do you think about that release?",
    "Client: I... I think I needed it. It's like a pressure valve was opened. I feel drained, but also... lighter? Does that make sense? It's like I've been carrying this burden for so long, and for a moment, I put it down.",
    "Therapist: How might this experience impact your recovery?",
    "Client: I think... maybe it's okay to feel these things. The guilt, the anger, the sadness. Maybe I don't have to be strong all the time. It's hard, but... I think I need to learn to sit with these emotions instead of pushing them away.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight, Raj.",
    "Client: Yeah, it's... it's scary, but I think it's necessary. I've been running from these feelings for so long, and it hasn't helped. Maybe facing them head-on is the only way forward.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's tough, I won't lie. But I think I'm ready. I want to get better, for myself and for the people I love. I don't want to be controlled by this trauma anymore. It's going to be a long road, but... I'm willing to walk it.",
    "Therapist: That's very courageous. What support do you need?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to be more open with my partner. She's been so patient, but I've been shutting her out. And maybe... maybe I need to consider medication for my depression. I've been resistant to the idea, but I'm starting to see how it's all connected.",
    "Therapist: Those are important steps. Anything else?",
    "Client: I want to work on mindfulness. During the exposure, I noticed how caught up I get in my thoughts. Maybe if I can learn to stay present, it'll help with the anxiety and the flashbacks. And... I think I need to be kinder to myself. The guilt isn't helping anyone, least of all my brother's memory.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot of insight, Raj. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... hopeful? For the first time in a long time, I feel like there might be a way through this. It's not going to be easy, but... I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. Thank you, Dr. Patel. This session was... intense, but I think it was exactly what I needed. I appreciate your guidance and support through all of this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Raj. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
