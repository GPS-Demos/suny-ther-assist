    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit on edge. It's been a rough week, you know? With everything going on, it's hard to focus sometimes.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's start with a SUDS rating. How would you rate your distress right now, 0 to 100?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 40? I'm not super stressed, but definitely not relaxed either.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember to describe in present tense, as if it's happening now.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm at work. It's a normal day, nothing special. I'm sitting at my desk, typing away on my computer. The office is quiet, just the usual hum of keyboards and low chatter. Suddenly, the ground starts to shake. It's subtle at first, but then it gets stronger. I... I freeze. My heart starts racing. I can hear things falling off shelves, pictures swinging on the walls. People are starting to panic, shouting. I'm... I'm terrified. I don't know what to do.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you see, hear, feel?",
    "Client: I see my computer monitor shaking. Papers are flying everywhere. I hear screams, crashes. The floor is moving under my feet. I feel... God, I feel so scared. My hands are trembling. I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: The shaking gets worse. I... I try to stand up, but I stumble. I grab onto my desk for support. Someone yells, \"Get under the desks!\" I... I can't move. My legs won't work. I'm frozen in place, watching as others duck for cover. The lights flicker, and then everything goes dark. I hear glass shattering somewhere. I'm panicking now, my chest feels so tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's probably around 70. This is intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... The shaking continues. In the darkness, I hear people crying, praying. I finally manage to crawl under my desk. I'm huddled there, hugging my knees. The building creaks and groans. I'm convinced it's going to collapse. I can smell dust and something electrical burning. My mouth is dry, and I'm shaking uncontrollably. I keep thinking, \"This is it. I'm going to die here.\"",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I can feel the cold floor against my legs. My back is pressed against the metal of the desk. I'm sweating, but I feel cold. The shaking seems to go on forever. I lose track of time. Then, slowly, it starts to subside. But I'm too scared to move. I stay there, curled up, listening. People are starting to call out, checking on each other. I hear sirens in the distance.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Shaken. Literally and figuratively. My heart's still racing. It's... it's hard to talk about this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing very well. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: Maybe 80? It's higher now.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Keep going. What happens after the shaking stops?",
    "Client: I... I slowly uncurl myself. My body aches from being tensed up for so long. I peek out from under the desk. The emergency lights have come on, casting an eerie glow. The office is a mess. Desks overturned, papers everywhere, broken glass. Some people are crying, others are trying to help those who are injured. I stand up on shaky legs. I feel dizzy, disoriented. Someone asks if I'm okay, but I can barely respond. I just nod.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Yeah... okay. I'm trying to calm down, but my heart won't stop racing. I look around, trying to find my phone. I need to call my family, make sure they're okay. But everything's such a mess. I can't find it. I start to panic again. What if something happened to them? What if our building is damaged? I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I join a group of coworkers who are huddled together. We're all in shock. Someone's trying to get news on their phone, but cell service is down. We can hear more sirens outside. The fire alarm starts blaring, telling us to evacuate. But I'm scared to leave. What if there are aftershocks? What if it's not safe outside? I feel trapped.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still pretty high. Maybe 75?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: We start to make our way out of the building. The stairwell is dark, and we have to use our phones for light. It's slow going. People are crying, some are hurt. I'm trying to stay calm, but every little noise makes me jump. I keep expecting another quake to hit. When we finally get outside, it's chaos. There are people everywhere, sirens, dust in the air. I see cracks in the sidewalk, a car crushed by fallen debris. It feels surreal, like I'm in a movie.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: I feel... overwhelmed. Scared. Lost. I don't know what to do or where to go. I'm worried about my family, my home. I feel so small and insignificant in the face of this disaster. And guilty... because I'm okay when others are hurt.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: We're told to gather in a nearby park. It's safer there, away from buildings. I sit on the grass, feeling numb. People around me are on their phones, trying to reach loved ones. I borrow someone's phone to call my mom, but the lines are jammed. I leave a voicemail, hoping she'll get it. Time seems to stretch on forever. We hear reports of damage across the city, of people trapped, of fires. I feel so helpless, just sitting there waiting.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How would you rate your distress now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe 65?",
    "Therapist: That's good. Keep going.",
    "Client: As the day wears on, things start to get organized. Emergency services are everywhere. We're given water, blankets. I finally get through to my mom. She's okay, our apartment is mostly undamaged. I feel a rush of relief, but also guilt. So many others aren't as lucky. We're told it's not safe to go home yet. I end up spending the night in the park with my coworkers. It's cold, uncomfortable. I can't sleep. Every little tremor makes me tense up, expecting another big quake.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with those feelings?",
    "Client: I... I try to focus on helping others. I volunteer to hand out supplies, to comfort those who are more scared than I am. It helps a little, gives me something to do besides worry. But I still feel on edge, like everything could fall apart again at any moment.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. What happens the next day?",
    "Client: The next morning, things are clearer. The damage is extensive. Our office building is deemed unsafe. We're told not to come to work for the foreseeable future. I finally go home, but everything feels different. The city I knew is changed. There are cracks in buildings, roads closed off. At home, things have fallen and broken. It's a mess, but at least it's standing. I spend the day cleaning up, trying to create some sense of normalcy. But every aftershock sends me into a panic. I can't relax. I keep replaying the earthquake in my mind, imagining worse scenarios.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, reflecting on all of this?",
    "Client: It's... it's still hard. Even now, months later, I get anxious when I feel any kind of vibration. Loud noises make me jump. I've lost my job because the company couldn't recover. I feel... stuck. Like I'm still waiting for the next disaster to hit.",
    "Therapist: Your reactions are understandable given what you've been through. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's lower now. Maybe a 50? Talking about it... it's hard, but it also helps somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How do you feel about ending the exposure here?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think that's good. It's... it's a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: You did very well today, Maria. Let's take a few deep breaths together to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: Okay... *takes deep breaths* That helps. I feel a bit calmer now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Remember, what you're feeling is normal after such an experience. We'll continue working through this in our next sessions.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's... it's not easy, but I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: That's great to hear. We'll end here for today. Take care of yourself, and I'll see you next week."
