    "Therapist: Alright, Carlos. Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in our old apartment. I can hear my parents arguing in the kitchen. The air feels thick, tense. I'm sitting on the couch, trying to focus on the TV, but I can't ignore their voices getting louder.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 4. I'm feeling uneasy, but it's manageable.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue.",
    "Client: The shouting gets worse. I hear something crash \u2013 maybe a plate? My heart starts racing. I want to run to my room, but I'm frozen in place. Then I hear my dad's footsteps, heavy and fast. He storms into the living room, face red with anger. My mom follows, crying and pleading.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's going up. Maybe a 6? My palms are sweating just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's alright. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Dad sees me on the couch. He looks... wild. Like he's not really seeing me. He grabs mom's arm, twisting it. She cries out in pain. I want to help, but I'm terrified. My stomach feels like it's in knots. I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's happening in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. My heart's pounding so hard it hurts. I feel like I might throw up.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe higher. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Carlos. Stay with it.",
    "Client: Dad's yelling at mom, calling her names. He raises his hand \u2013 I think he's going to hit her. I finally find my voice and scream, \"Stop!\" They both freeze, looking at me. For a second, everything's quiet. Then dad lets go of mom and storms out. The door slams so hard the walls shake. Mom's crying softly, holding her arm. I'm shaking all over, feeling guilty and scared and angry all at once.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. My emotions are all over the place. I feel drained, but also kind of... relieved? Like some of the tension has left. Maybe a SUDS of 6 now?",
    "Therapist: That's common. How about physically?",
    "Client: My breathing's calmer. The nausea's fading. But I feel exhausted, like I've run a marathon.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well, Carlos. How about we start winding down?",
    "Client: Yeah, that sounds good. This was intense, but... I think it helped. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Many find relief after processing difficult memories.",
    "Client: Thanks. I'm glad we did this, even though it was tough.",
    "Therapist: You showed great courage. Let's take a few deep breaths before we end."
