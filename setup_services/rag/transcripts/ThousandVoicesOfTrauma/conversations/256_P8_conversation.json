    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is buzzing, but also heavy at the same time. My heart is racing, and I feel a bit dizzy. The memory... it was so vivid. I could almost smell the hospital disinfectant again.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: (inhales deeply) It's just... overwhelming. I keep seeing flashes of the hospital room, the machines beeping. I remember feeling so helpless, you know? Like my body wasn't mine anymore. And then... (voice breaks) I remember the doctor's face when he told me about the diagnosis. It was like the world stopped.",
    "Therapist: It sounds like a very intense moment. What emotions are you experiencing?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... anger? I'm angry that this happened to me. Why me? I was just starting university, had my whole life ahead of me, and then suddenly I'm fighting for my life. It's not fair. (pauses) And there's this deep sadness too, like mourning for the life I thought I'd have.",
    "Therapist: How do these emotions feel in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, like there's a weight on it. My hands are clammy, and there's this knot in my stomach. It's like my body is reliving that moment all over again. I can feel my heart pounding in my ears.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... what if it comes back? What if I never fully recover? I worry that I'll always be defined by this illness, that people will only see me as a victim or a patient. And then I feel guilty for even thinking that because I survived when others didn't.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts relate to your broader experience?",
    "Client: I guess... they're all tied to this fear of losing control. The illness took away my sense of security, my belief that I had control over my life and my body. And now, even though I'm better, I still struggle with feeling vulnerable all the time.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much this experience has changed me. Before, I was carefree, maybe even a bit reckless. Now, I'm hyper-aware of every little thing in my body. Any slight pain or discomfort sends me into a panic. It's exhausting living like this, always on edge.",
    "Therapist: How does that impact your daily life?",
    "Client: It's... it's really hard. I find myself avoiding situations that might trigger these feelings. I've missed classes because I was too anxious to leave my apartment. I've pushed away friends because I don't want them to see me like this. Sometimes, I feel so alone with all of this.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in those moments?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants someone to just understand, to not try to fix it or tell me to 'stay positive'. But another part of me is terrified of being vulnerable, of letting anyone see how scared I really am. It's like I'm caught between needing support and pushing it away.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really challenging. How are you coping?",
    "Client: Some days are better than others. I've been trying to meditate, to ground myself when the anxiety gets overwhelming. And talking about it here... it helps, even though it's hard. Sometimes I write too, just to get the thoughts out of my head. But there are still days when it all feels too much.",
    "Therapist: What gives you hope in your recovery journey?",
    "Client: (long pause) That's... that's a tough one. I guess... the fact that I'm here, talking about it. A year ago, I couldn't even imagine doing this. And there are moments, brief ones, where I feel okay, where I can imagine a future beyond all this. Those moments... they're what keep me going.",
    "Therapist: That's very insightful. How do you feel now, after sharing all this?",
    "Client: It's strange. I feel drained, but also... lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time. There's still fear and sadness, but also a tiny bit of relief. And maybe... maybe a little proud of myself for facing this head-on.",
