    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the airplane crash scene?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm at the airport. It's bustling with people, and I'm waiting to board my flight. I'm feeling a bit anxious, but excited for my trip. As I walk down the jet bridge, I can smell the stuffy air and hear the hum of the plane's engines.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Continue.",
    "Client: I find my seat and buckle up. The plane takes off, and everything seems normal at first. But then... there's a sudden jolt. People start murmuring, and I can feel my heart racing. The plane starts shaking violently, and oxygen masks drop from above.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. My hands are shaking as I try to put on the mask. I can hear people crying and praying around me. The plane is nose-diving, and I'm certain we're going to crash. I... I can't breathe. It feels so real.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: The plane is plummeting faster now. I can see the ground getting closer through the window. I'm gripping the armrests so tightly my knuckles are white. I'm thinking about my family, about all the things I never got to do. And then... impact. There's a deafening crash, and everything goes dark.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I come to, surrounded by wreckage. There's smoke everywhere, and I can hear people screaming. I'm trapped in my seat, and my leg is pinned under something heavy. I'm in so much pain, and I'm scared I won't make it out alive.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I'm trying to stay calm, but it's hard. I can smell fuel, and I'm worried the plane might explode. I'm calling out for help, but I don't know if anyone can hear me over the chaos. I feel so helpless and alone.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. Continue.",
    "Client: After what feels like hours, I hear rescue workers. They're calling out, asking if anyone can hear them. I yell back, my voice hoarse from the smoke. When they finally reach me, I break down crying. The relief is overwhelming, but I'm still terrified.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Reliving that moment is exhausting. But I also feel a bit lighter, like I've released some of the weight I've been carrying. It's still scary, but talking about it... it helps.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've shown great courage.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It's still hard, and I feel shaky, but I'm also proud of myself for getting through it.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. Let's take a deep breath together.",
    "Client: *takes a deep breath* That helps. I'm realizing that even though the memory is still painful, I can face it. It doesn't have the same power over me that it used to. I'm starting to believe that maybe, with time, I can move past this.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: I think I can keep going. It's difficult, but I want to work through this. Can we talk about the aftermath? The hospital stay and the recovery process? That's been weighing on me too.",
    "Therapist: Of course. When you're ready, describe that experience.",
    "Client: Okay... After the rescue, I was rushed to the hospital. The lights were so bright, and everything was a blur of doctors and nurses. I remember feeling so scared and confused. They told me I had a broken leg and some internal injuries. The pain was intense, but the worst part was the nightmares. Every time I closed my eyes, I was back on that plane.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue at your own pace.",
    "Client: The recovery was slow and frustrating. Physical therapy was painful, and I felt so angry at times. Why did this happen to me? I struggled with survivor's guilt too. Some people didn't make it out, and I couldn't understand why I did. It felt unfair.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those feelings. Keep going.",
    "Client: As I got physically better, the emotional toll became more apparent. I couldn't get on a plane, obviously, but even driving or being in crowded places was terrifying. I felt so isolated. My friends and family tried to help, but they couldn't really understand what I was going through.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great strength in sharing this.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's been a long journey, and I'm still not fully healed. But being here, talking about it... it gives me hope. I want to get to a place where I can live my life fully again, without this constant fear and anxiety.",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... tired, but also relieved. It's like I've been carrying this heavy secret, and now that I'm sharing it, the load is getting lighter. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I might actually be okay someday.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. Let's end here for today.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you for guiding me through this. It wasn't easy, but I'm glad we did it. I'm looking forward to our next session, even though I know it'll be challenging. I feel like I'm finally moving forward."
