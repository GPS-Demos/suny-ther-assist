    "Therapist: Hello Mrs. Patel, how are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Good afternoon, Dr. Lee. I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been thinking about our last session all week, and I'm not sure what to expect today.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Today, we'll be doing imaginal exposure. Are you familiar with it?",
    "Client: Not really. I've heard the term, but I'm not sure what it entails. Is it... is it going to be difficult?",
    "Therapist: It can be challenging, but it's a crucial step in your healing journey. Shall I explain more?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I'd like to know what I'm getting into.",
    "Therapist: Imaginal exposure involves revisiting your workplace trauma memory in a safe environment. We'll go through it step-by-step.",
    "Client: Oh, I see. That sounds... intense. Will I have to relive everything that happened?",
    "Therapist: We'll approach it gradually. The goal is to process the memory, not overwhelm you. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It's a bit scary, but I trust you, Dr. Lee. I've come this far, and I want to get better. Can you tell me more about what I might feel during this process?",
    "Therapist: You might experience anxiety, sadness, or anger. These reactions are normal and expected. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: I'm worried about losing control of my emotions. What if I can't handle it? I've spent so long trying to keep everything bottled up at work and home.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace, and you can pause anytime. Remember, you're in control here.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I appreciate your patience with me, Dr. Lee. I know I can be a bit hesitant sometimes. It's just... this bullying at work, it's affected me so much more than I ever thought it would. Even at my age, I feel so vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are entirely valid. Your courage in facing this is commendable. Shall we discuss some coping strategies?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think that would help me feel more prepared. Do you have any specific techniques you recommend?",
    "Therapist: We'll use grounding techniques and deep breathing. Would you like to practice one now?",
    "Client: That sounds good. I've tried deep breathing before, but I'm not sure if I'm doing it correctly. Could you guide me through it?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's try a simple 4-7-8 breathing exercise. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I'm ready. This anxiety has been with me for so long, especially since the workplace incidents. It'll be nice to have a tool to manage it better.",
    "Therapist: Great. Inhale for 4 counts, hold for 7, exhale for 8. Let's try it together.",
    "Client: (After trying the exercise) Wow, that does feel calming. I can see how this could help during the exposure therapy. Dr. Lee, I'm still nervous, but I think I'm ready to try this. Can you tell me once more how this will help with my PTSD symptoms?",
    "Therapist: It helps by processing the memory, reducing its emotional impact over time. Your symptoms should gradually decrease.",
    "Client: I understand. It's like facing my fears head-on, isn't it? I've avoided thinking about what happened for so long. Maybe it's time to confront it. You'll be with me the whole time, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'll guide you through each step. Your bravery is admirable, Mrs. Patel.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Lee. Your support means a lot to me. I never thought I'd be dealing with something like this at my age, but I'm grateful to have professional help. Shall we begin?",
    "Therapist: Yes, let's start. Remember, we can pause anytime. Are you ready?",
    "Client: I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Let's do this."
