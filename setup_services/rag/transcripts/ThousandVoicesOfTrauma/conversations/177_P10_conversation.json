    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Patel. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a knot in my stomach. I know we've talked about this, but actually diving into it feels... overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Yes, let's... let's try.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm standing outside the prison gates. The air feels heavy, like it's pressing down on me. There's a chill, even though it's supposed to be summer. I can hear the buzz of the electric fence, it's constant, almost mocking.",
    "Therapist: Good. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The smell. It's... antiseptic, but also musty. Like they're trying to cover up years of despair with cheap cleaning products. My hands are shaking as I clutch the visitor's pass. I... I don't want to go in.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 70. My heart's racing.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay. I'm walking through the first set of gates. The clang as they shut behind me... it's so final. I feel trapped already. There's a guard, he's patting me down. His hands are rough, impersonal. I feel... violated, even though I know it's procedure.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Scared. Angry. I shouldn't have to be here. My son... he shouldn't be here.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm led down a long corridor. The fluorescent lights are harsh, making everything look sickly. There are other visitors, some look resigned, others nervous like me. I catch a glimpse of myself in a reflective surface - I look old, tired. When did I start looking so... defeated?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The visiting room. It's... it's so sterile. Plastic chairs, tables bolted to the floor. And then... I see him. My son. He looks... God, he looks so thin. His eyes, they're... they're not the same. It's like the light's gone out of them.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 85. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Remember your grounding technique. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Right, okay. I'm... I'm sitting across from him. There's this plastic barrier between us, and I want to reach out and touch him so badly, but I can't. We pick up the phones to talk, and his voice... it sounds hollow.",
    "Therapist: What do you say to him?",
    "Client: I... I tell him I miss him. That I love him. But the words feel inadequate. He nods, but he won't meet my eyes. I ask him how he's doing, if he's safe. He just shrugs. It's like... it's like I'm losing him all over again.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I've failed him. I should have done more, been there more. Maybe if I hadn't been so focused on my career, on the divorce... maybe he wouldn't have fallen in with the wrong crowd. It's my fault he's here.",
    "Therapist: Remember, we've discussed this. Are those thoughts helpful?",
    "Client: No, I... I know they're not. But sitting here, seeing him like this... it's hard not to blame myself.",
    "Therapist: I understand. What happens next in the visit?",
    "Client: We sit in silence for a while. It's... it's excruciating. I try to make small talk, ask about his classes in prison, but his answers are short, disinterested. I can feel the gulf between us widening with every passing minute.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Helpless. Angry. Sad. It's... it's a mix of everything. My chest feels tight, like there's a weight pressing down on it.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's hovering around 90 now.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay. I'm... I'm trying to hold it together. I don't want him to see me cry. But then... then he looks at me, really looks at me for the first time since I arrived. And he says, \"I'm sorry, Dad.\" And I... I break down. I can't help it.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel emotional. What happens then?",
    "Client: The guard... he's watching us. I can feel his eyes. It makes me feel so... exposed. Vulnerable. I try to compose myself, but it's hard. My son, he looks uncomfortable. Like he doesn't know how to handle my emotions.",
    "Therapist: How does that affect you?",
    "Client: It... it hurts. We used to be so close. Now it's like we're strangers. I want to reach out, to comfort him, but I can't. This barrier, these rules... they're suffocating.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's your body telling you?",
    "Client: My shoulders are tense. My stomach's in knots. I feel... I feel like I'm going to be sick.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're doing well.",
    "Client: The visit... it's coming to an end. A guard announces it, and I feel this surge of panic. I don't want to leave him here. I stand up, and my legs feel weak. My son, he... he gives me a small smile. It's not much, but it's something. I press my hand against the barrier, and after a moment, he does the same. It's the closest we can get to touching.",
    "Therapist: How does that moment feel?",
    "Client: Bittersweet. There's a connection there, but it's... it's not enough. It's like a pale imitation of what we used to have.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 85.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're almost through this.",
    "Client: I... I watch him being led away. His shoulders are slumped. He looks back once, and I try to smile, to be strong for him. But as soon as he's out of sight, I... I collapse into the chair. I can't move. The guard has to come and tell me it's time to leave.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel as you're leaving?",
    "Client: Drained. Empty. Like I've left a part of myself behind those walls. The walk back through the corridors, it's... it's a blur. I barely register the process of leaving, the gates opening and closing. Before I know it, I'm back in the parking lot.",
    "Therapist: And how do you feel standing there?",
    "Client: Lost. The world seems too big, too loud after the confines of the prison. I get to my car, but I can't drive. I just... I sit there, gripping the steering wheel, and I cry. I cry until I have nothing left.",
    "Therapist: You've done very well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. My head hurts. But there's also... I don't know, maybe a tiny bit of relief? Like I've let out something that's been bottled up for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down. Maybe to a 60?",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's take a few deep breaths together.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay. I... I think I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength today. How do you feel about what we've accomplished?",
    "Client: It was... it was hard. Really hard. But I think... I think it might have been necessary. I've been avoiding thinking about that day for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You've faced a difficult memory head-on. We'll end here for today, but I want you to remember how you've pushed through this. You're making progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I appreciate your support.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later. We'll discuss this more next time.",
    "Client: Alright. I'll... I'll try to take care of myself.",
    "Therapist: That's good. I'll see you next week. Take care, Mr. Patel.",
    "Client: Thank you. Goodbye."
