    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure exercise. Can you describe the moment you learned about your loved one's illness?",
    "Client: It was a normal Tuesday afternoon. I was in my dorm room, studying for an exam when my phone rang. It was my mom, and I could tell something was wrong by her voice. She told me that my dad had been diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer. I felt like the world stopped spinning. My heart started racing, and I couldn't breathe. I remember dropping my phone and just sitting there, frozen.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I picked up the phone again, and my mom was still talking, but I couldn't really hear her. It was like everything was muffled. I remember asking her to repeat what she said, and when she did, it hit me all over again. I started crying uncontrollably. My roommate came in and found me like that, curled up on my bed, sobbing.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you recall?",
    "Client: I remember feeling so alone, even though my roommate was there. She tried to comfort me, but I couldn't explain what was happening. I felt like I was drowning in this overwhelming sense of fear and sadness. I kept thinking about my dad, how he was always so strong, and now he was... he was dying. It didn't seem real.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. It's okay to feel these emotions.",
    "Client: I remember calling my boyfriend at the time, but he didn't pick up. That made me feel even more isolated. I wanted to go home immediately, but I couldn't think straight enough to plan anything. I just sat there, staring at the wall, for what felt like hours. My roommate eventually convinced me to eat something, but I couldn't taste anything. It was like all my senses were dulled.",
    "Therapist: Keep going. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: The next few days were a blur. I somehow managed to tell my professors I needed to go home, but I don't remember packing or the trip back. When I got home and saw my dad, he looked so different already. He was pale and seemed smaller somehow. That's when it really hit me that this was real, that I might lose him. I felt this crushing weight on my chest, like I couldn't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Continue sharing what you experienced.",
    "Client: I tried to be strong for my dad, but inside I was falling apart. I kept having these moments where I'd be okay, and then suddenly I'd remember why I was home, and it would hit me all over again. I couldn't sleep properly; I'd wake up hoping it was all a bad dream, but then reality would set in. The worst part was seeing my dad in pain and knowing there was nothing I could do to help him.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Keep going.",
    "Client: As the days went on, I felt like I was living in a nightmare. Every time the phone rang, I'd jump, thinking it was bad news from the hospital. I started avoiding my friends' calls because I didn't know how to talk about what was happening. I felt guilty for being away at school when my dad had been getting sick. I kept wondering if I could have noticed something earlier if I had been home more often.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those feelings. Continue.",
    "Client: The hardest part was watching my dad deteriorate so quickly. He went from being this strong, vibrant person to someone who needed help with basic tasks in just a matter of weeks. I remember one day, I was helping him walk to the bathroom, and he stumbled. As I caught him, I realized how frail he had become. That's when I broke down completely. I couldn't hold it together anymore. I felt like I was losing him bit by bit every day, and there was nothing I could do to stop it.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Talking about it... it's bringing back all those intense emotions. My chest feels tight, and I can feel tears coming. But at the same time, there's a small sense of relief in sharing this. It's like I've been carrying this weight alone for so long, and now, even though it still hurts, I feel less isolated in my grief. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Your feelings are valid.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to revisit these memories, but I think it's helping. I've never really talked about those first few days in detail before. I always tried to focus on being strong for my family, especially my mom. But reliving it now, I realize how much I was struggling too. I wish I had reached out for help sooner instead of trying to handle everything on my own.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: I think I can go on. It's difficult, but I feel like I need to get this out. The weeks that followed were a rollercoaster. There were moments of hope when a treatment seemed to be working, followed by crushing disappointment when it didn't. I remember one particular day when the doctor told us the chemotherapy wasn't having the effect they'd hoped for. It felt like the floor dropped out from under me. I had to excuse myself and I ended up crying in the hospital bathroom for what felt like hours.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going at your own pace.",
    "Client: The worst part was seeing my dad lose hope. He had always been so optimistic, but I could see the light fading from his eyes. One night, I overheard him talking to my mom about not wanting to continue treatment. I felt so angry - at the cancer, at the doctors, at the world. I wanted to scream, but instead, I just silently went back to my room and cried into my pillow. I felt so helpless and scared.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: As his condition worsened, I found myself torn between wanting to spend every moment with him and being afraid of seeing him suffer. There were times when I'd sit by his bed, holding his hand, and I'd catch myself wishing it would all be over soon. And then I'd feel incredibly guilty for even thinking that. It was like being pulled in a million different directions emotionally.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this remarkably well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The last few days were the hardest. We knew the end was near, and there was this heavy silence that seemed to fill the house. I remember sitting with him, trying to memorize every detail of his face, the sound of his voice, even though by then he could barely speak. When he finally passed, I was holding his hand. I felt his last breath, and it was like a part of me died with him. The pain was... is... indescribable. It's like there's this huge hole in my life that nothing can fill.",
    "Therapist: You've shown immense strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, emotionally drained. But there's also a strange sense of relief. Talking about it, really delving into those memories, it's painful but also cathartic. I've kept so much of this bottled up inside for so long. I think I needed to let it out, to really confront these feelings instead of trying to push them away. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today. Let's take a moment to breathe."
