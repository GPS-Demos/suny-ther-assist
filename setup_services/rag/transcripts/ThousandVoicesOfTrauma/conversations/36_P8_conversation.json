    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. My heart is still racing a bit. It felt so real, reliving that moment when the dog attacked me. I can still hear the growling, you know? It's like... it's echoing in my head.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What physical sensations are you noticing right now?",
    "Client: My palms are sweaty, and there's this tightness in my chest. I keep flexing my right arm - that's where the dog bit me. It's like... like my body remembers even if I don't want it to. And I feel... I feel shaky, like I might cry at any moment.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"Why me?\" You know? I was just trying to help that stray, and it turned on me so suddenly. I... I feel stupid for not being more careful. And then I think about how it could have been worse. What if it had gone for my face? Or my throat? God, I... I can't shake this feeling of vulnerability.",
    "Therapist: How does that vulnerability feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a hollowness in my stomach. Like I'm exposed, you know? And there's this tension, like I need to be ready to run or fight at any moment. It's exhausting, always feeling on edge like this.",
    "Therapist: I hear that. What else comes up for you?",
    "Client: I... I feel angry. Not just at the dog, but at myself. I should have known better. I'm a professional, for God's sake. I should have been able to read the signs, to protect myself. And now... now I can't even walk down the street without flinching at every barking dog. It's pathetic.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that self-judgment?",
    "Client: It... it hurts. I know I'm being hard on myself, but I can't seem to stop. It's like there's this voice in my head constantly criticizing me, telling me I'm weak for not getting over this already. And then... then I feel guilty because I know people go through much worse traumas. I should be stronger than this.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to be \"stronger\"?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. To not feel this way, I guess. To be able to walk past a dog without my heart racing. To not have nightmares. To... to be normal again. But then I wonder if I'll ever feel normal again. And that scares me.",
    "Therapist: How does that fear manifest for you?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a weight on my chest. Sometimes I feel like I can't breathe. And it affects everything - my work, my relationships. I find myself withdrawing, you know? It's easier to stay home than to face the world. But then I feel guilty for not being present for my partner, for letting this control my life.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about that guilt?",
    "Client: It's... it's constant. Like a low hum in the background of everything I do. I feel guilty for being affected by this, for not being stronger. I feel guilty for the strain it's putting on my marriage, for the times I've snapped at my partner because I'm so on edge. And... and I feel guilty for turning to alcohol to numb these feelings. I know it's not healthy, but sometimes it feels like the only way to quiet my mind.",
    "Therapist: How does sharing all of this make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of things. Part of me feels relieved, like I'm finally letting out all these thoughts I've been holding in. But there's also this vulnerability, you know? Like I'm exposing all my weaknesses. And there's a part of me that's worried you'll judge me, even though I know that's not rational.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean if I did judge you?",
    "Client: I... I guess it would confirm all my fears. That I am weak, that I should be handling this better. But... but I know that's not true. Logically, I know trauma affects everyone differently. It's just... it's hard to apply that logic to myself.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to recognize that disconnect?",
    "Client: It's... it's frustrating. Like, I can see the irrationality of my thoughts, but I can't seem to change them. It's like... like I'm stuck in this loop of fear and self-doubt. And I'm tired, you know? I'm so tired of feeling this way.",
    "Therapist: What does that tiredness feel like?",
    "Client: It's... it's deep. Like it's in my bones. Some days it's hard to even get out of bed. The thought of facing another day of this exhausts me. But then I feel guilty for feeling that way, and the cycle starts all over again. I just... I want to feel like myself again.",
    "Therapist: What would feeling like yourself look like?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure anymore. I guess... being able to enjoy things again without this constant fear in the background. Being able to go for a walk without scanning for potential threats. Being present with my partner without my mind constantly wandering to that day. Just... feeling at peace, I suppose. But that feels so far away right now.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to imagine that peace?",
    "Client: It's... it's bittersweet. There's a part of me that feels hopeful, like maybe I can get there someday. But there's also this sadness, you know? For all the time I've lost, for how much this has changed me. And... and there's fear. Fear that I'll never fully get back to who I was before.",
    "Therapist: What do you think about that fear?",
    "Client: I... I think it's holding me back. It's like... like I'm so afraid of never fully recovering that I'm not allowing myself to make any progress at all. And I know that's not helpful, but it's hard to shake. It's like this trauma has become a part of my identity, and I'm not sure who I am without it anymore.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... it's uncomfortable. I don't want this to define me, you know? I want to be more than just a victim of a dog attack. But at the same time, I can't deny how much it's affected me. I guess... I guess I need to find a way to integrate this experience into my life without letting it control me. But that feels like such a daunting task.",
    "Therapist: What small step could you take towards that?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe trying to go for a short walk each day? Or... or talking to my partner more openly about how I'm feeling instead of bottling it up? It's scary to think about, but... but I know I can't keep living like this. I want to get better, even if it's hard.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to voice that desire?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of emotions. There's fear, definitely. But there's also a glimmer of hope, you know? Like maybe, just maybe, I can work through this. And there's... there's a sense of determination. I'm tired of letting this control my life. I want to take it back, even if it's just in small ways at first.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: I... I feel a bit lighter, actually. Like maybe there's a way forward. It's still scary, and I know it won't be easy, but... but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe I can do this. Maybe I can find a way to live with what happened without letting it consume me. And that... that feels good.",
    "Therapist: How would you like to end our session today?",
    "Client: I... I think I'd like to sit with this feeling for a moment. This glimmer of hope. It's been so long since I've felt anything positive about this situation. I know we have a long way to go, but... but I'm grateful for this moment. And I'm... I'm looking forward to our next session. Thank you for listening and guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. I'll see you next week."
