    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the hostage situation you witnessed?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure if I can do this. It was so terrifying. I was at the bank, just a regular day, you know? And then suddenly, these men burst in with guns. They were shouting, waving their weapons around. I remember feeling frozen, like I couldn't move.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. So, these men, they were demanding money. They made everyone lie face down on the floor. I could hear people crying, whimpering. The smell of fear was so thick in the air. I kept thinking, \"This is it. This is how I die.\"",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're doing great.",
    "Client: My heart was pounding so hard, I thought it might burst out of my chest. I could barely breathe. One of the robbers kept pacing back and forth, his boots squeaking on the polished floor. It was such a mundane sound in the middle of all that terror.",
    "Therapist: You're describing it vividly. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I remember hearing sirens in the distance. The robbers started to panic. One of them grabbed a young woman and held her at gunpoint. She was sobbing, begging for her life. I wanted to help her, but I was so scared. I felt so helpless.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: The police arrived, and there was so much shouting. I thought for sure someone was going to get shot. The woman was screaming, and I just kept my face pressed to the floor, praying it would all be over soon. It felt like it lasted forever.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: Eventually, the robbers surrendered. When we were allowed to get up, my legs were shaking so badly I could barely stand. Everyone around me looked shell-shocked. I remember walking out of the bank and just breaking down in tears. I felt so relieved to be alive, but also so... broken.",
    "Therapist: You've done an excellent job describing the experience.",
    "Client: Ever since then, I've had nightmares. I can't go into banks anymore. Loud noises make me jump. I feel like I'm constantly on edge, waiting for something terrible to happen again. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: Your reactions are normal. You're making progress.",
    "Client: Sometimes I feel guilty for being so affected by it. I wasn't even the one held at gunpoint. But I can't shake the feeling of helplessness, the terror of thinking I was about to die.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. It's a traumatic experience.",
    "Client: I want to move past this, but it's so hard. Every time I close my eyes, I'm back in that bank. I can hear the screams, smell the fear. How do I make it stop?",
    "Therapist: We'll work through this together. You're not alone.",
    "Client: Thank you. It helps to talk about it, even though it's painful. I just want to feel normal again, you know? To be able to go about my day without this constant fear hanging over me.",
    "Therapist: That's a good goal. We'll take it step by step.",
    "Client: I appreciate your support. It's been so isolating, feeling like no one understands what I'm going through. But talking about it here, it feels like maybe there's hope. Maybe I can get through this.",
    "Therapist: There is hope. You're showing great courage.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think... I think I'm ready to try and work through this. It won't be easy, but I want to reclaim my life. I don't want to let those robbers take anything more from me than they already have.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Well done.",
    "Client: I just hope I have the strength to see this through. Some days are harder than others, and I worry about falling back into that pit of fear and anxiety.",
    "Therapist: You're stronger than you realize. We'll continue this work.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm grateful for your guidance and support. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't judge me for my reactions. I'm going to do my best to keep pushing forward, no matter how difficult it gets.",
    "Therapist: You're making excellent progress. Our time is up for today.",
    "Client: Already? Wow, time flew by. Thank you again. I feel... not exactly better, but maybe a little lighter? Like I've taken a small step forward. I'll see you next week.",
    "Therapist: Take care. Remember to practice your coping techniques."
