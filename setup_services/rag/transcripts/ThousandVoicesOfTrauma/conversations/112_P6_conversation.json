    "Therapist: Welcome back, Priya. Are you ready to continue our imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Anderson. Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember, you're in control. Let's start with your SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10 right now. Just thinking about revisiting that memory makes me anxious.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that night.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Alright. I'm... I'm in the kitchen. I can hear my parents arguing in the living room. The shouting is getting louder. My hands are shaking as I try to finish washing the dishes. I'm scared to go out there, but I'm worried about my mom.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. My heart is racing, and I feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The shouting turns into a crash. I hear my mom cry out. I drop the plate I'm holding, and it shatters in the sink. I'm frozen, unsure what to do. Should I call for help? Should I go out there? I'm so scared.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. I feel like I can't breathe. My chest is so tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (breathes deeply) I... I peek around the corner. My dad has my mom pinned against the wall. His face is red with anger. Mom's crying, begging him to stop. I want to help her, but I'm paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's still an 8. My hands are clammy, and I feel dizzy. I hate feeling so helpless.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're processing a difficult memory.",
    "Client: I watch as my dad raises his hand. I want to scream, to do something, but no sound comes out. He... he slaps her. The sound echoes through the room. I flinch as if I've been hit too. Mom crumples to the floor, sobbing.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. I feel like I'm right back there. My whole body is shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Priya. Remember, you're here with me, safe.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) I finally find my voice and yell, \"Stop!\" Dad turns to me, his eyes blazing. For a moment, I think he might come after me too. But something in his face changes. He looks... ashamed? Confused? He stumbles back, looks at Mom, then at me, and just... leaves. Slams the door behind him.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's still high, maybe an 8.5. I'm feeling a mix of relief that he's gone and guilt that I didn't act sooner.",
    "Therapist: Those are common reactions. What happens next?",
    "Client: I rush to Mom. She's still on the floor, crying softly. I help her up, get her some water. We sit together on the couch, not speaking. I'm holding her hand, and I can feel it trembling in mine. I want to say something, anything, but words fail me.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's coming down a bit, maybe a 7 now. I feel drained, but also angry. Why did this have to happen to us?",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel angry. How does the memory end?",
    "Client: We just sit there for what feels like hours. Eventually, Mom gets up, says she's going to bed. She kisses my forehead and tells me she loves me. I'm left alone on the couch, feeling lost and confused about what to do next.",
    "Therapist: Final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6 now. I feel exhausted, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I survived reliving it.",
    "Therapist: You did very well, Priya. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Drained, but... okay. It's hard, but I think it's helping. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll end here for today. Well done."
