    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is buzzing, you know? My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kinda sweaty. The memory... it was so vivid this time. I could almost smell the antiseptic in that hospital room again.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: It's a jumble, really. Part of me is relieved it's over, but another part feels guilty for feeling relieved. I keep thinking about how helpless I felt in that moment, strapped to the bed, not knowing what was happening. And then... then I think about all those other people who might be going through something similar right now, you know? It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: I hear you. Can you tell me more about that feeling of being overwhelmed?",
    "Client: It's like... it's like I'm drowning in emotions. There's fear, definitely. A lot of anger too, at the people who did this to me and to others. But there's also this deep sadness, you know? For the person I was before all this happened. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel... normal again. And then I feel ashamed for even thinking that because I know I'm one of the lucky ones who got out.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to process. How are you coping with these intense emotions?",
    "Client: I'm trying to use those grounding techniques we talked about. Deep breaths, focusing on the present moment. But it's hard, man. Sometimes I feel like I'm right back there, and it takes everything I've got to remind myself that I'm safe now. It's exhausting, you know? And then there's the anxiety... it's always there, just waiting to pounce.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I... I think I just need a moment. To breathe, to remember where I am. It's funny, you know? Before all this, I never really paid attention to my surroundings. Now, I'm constantly aware of every exit, every person around me. It's like my brain is always on high alert. But right now, I'm trying to focus on the fact that I'm here, in this room, with you. That I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. How does your body feel as you focus on being here?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to calm down a bit. My heart isn't racing as much anymore. I can feel the chair under me, solid and real. My hands... they were clenched before, but now they're relaxing. It's like... like I'm slowly coming back to myself, you know? But there's still this heaviness in my chest. A reminder, I guess, of everything that's happened.",
    "Therapist: I see. What's that heaviness telling you?",
    "Client: It's... it's complicated. Part of it is sorrow, I think. For everything I've lost, for the innocence that's gone. But there's also... I don't know if this makes sense, but there's a kind of strength there too. Like, I've been through hell, but I'm still here. I'm still fighting. And maybe... maybe that counts for something, you know?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How does recognizing that strength feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's empowering, in a way. But also terrifying. Because now I feel like I have a responsibility, you know? To use this strength, to help others who might be going through what I went through. But then I wonder if I'm ready for that. If I'll ever be ready. It's like I'm constantly walking this tightrope between wanting to move forward and feeling pulled back by my past.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful metaphor. Can you elaborate on that tightrope feeling?",
    "Client: Yeah, it's... it's like I'm balancing between two worlds. On one side, there's the person I was before all this happened. Carefree, trusting, maybe a bit naive. On the other side, there's who I am now. Cautious, always on guard, but also... stronger in some ways, I guess. And I'm trying to find my footing somewhere in the middle. Some days I lean more towards one side, some days towards the other. It's exhausting, man. Always trying to find that balance.",
    "Therapist: How do you see your future on this tightrope?",
    "Client: That's... that's a tough one. Some days, I can see a future where I've found my balance. Where I can use my experience to help others, but also live my life without constant fear. Other days, it feels impossible. Like I'll always be stuck in this in-between place. But I guess... I guess the fact that I can even imagine a positive future is progress, right? A few months ago, I couldn't see any future at all.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What helps you move towards that positive vision?",
    "Client: Talking about it helps, believe it or not. These sessions... they're tough, but they make me feel less alone. And my wife, she's been my rock through all of this. Just knowing she's there, that she sees me... all of me, even the parts I'm ashamed of... that means everything. And then there are moments, you know? Little things. Like when I can go to the store without having a panic attack, or when I can laugh at a joke without feeling guilty. Those moments... they give me hope.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful. How does sharing this make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of things. There's relief, definitely. Like I'm lightening the load a bit by talking about it. But there's also this vulnerability, you know? Like I'm exposing parts of myself that I usually keep hidden. It's scary, but also... freeing, in a way. And there's gratitude too. For having someone to share this with, someone who understands. It makes me feel... I don't know... maybe a little less broken?",
    "Therapist: You're incredibly resilient. What's your takeaway from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's that healing isn't linear. There are good days and bad days, and that's okay. And maybe... maybe I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. I mean, just being able to talk about this stuff without completely falling apart... that's something, right? And I guess... I guess I'm learning that it's okay to hope for a better future, even if I'm not quite there yet. It's a journey, and I'm... I'm on it, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you want to care for yourself after this intense session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need some quiet time. Maybe I'll take a walk in the park near our house. Just... be in nature for a bit, you know? And then maybe call my wife, let her know I'm okay. She always worries on therapy days. And tonight... maybe we'll watch a movie or something. Something light, to balance out all this heaviness. Just... normal stuff, you know? To remind myself that life goes on, even after all this.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I don't think so. I mean, there's always more, right? But for now... I think I've shared what I needed to share. It's a lot to process, but... I'm glad I did it. Thank you for... for creating this space where I can be honest about all this stuff. It means more than I can say.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. I'm proud of the work you're doing. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yeah, definitely. See you next week. And... thanks again. Really."
