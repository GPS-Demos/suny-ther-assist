    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Singh. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a part of me that wants to get this over with, but another part that's... well, dreading it. My hands are a bit clammy just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0-100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 40. It's not overwhelming, but definitely there.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we're here to work through this together. Are you ready to begin the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Yes, let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm at the protest. It's a warm day, and there are so many people around me. The energy is... it's electric, you know? We're all here for a reason, to stand up against police brutality. I can smell the asphalt, feel the sun on my skin. There are chants, people holding signs. I'm holding one too, it says \"Justice Now.\"",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: Everything seems peaceful at first. But then... then I hear shouting. It's coming from the front of the crowd. I can't quite see what's happening, but people are starting to push and shove. My heart... it's beating faster now.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. I'm... I'm starting to sweat. The crowd is surging now, and I'm being pushed along with it. I can hear sirens in the distance, getting closer. Oh god, I see the police now. They're in riot gear, advancing towards us.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 60. I can feel the panic rising.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: Someone next to me stumbles, and I reach out to help them. But as I do, I lose my balance. I... I fall to the ground. People are stepping over me, around me. I can't get up. The police are getting closer, and I can hear the crack of batons, people screaming.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I'm trying to get up, but someone steps on my hand. The pain is sharp, sudden. I cry out, but my voice is lost in the chaos. I can smell tear gas now. My eyes are starting to burn. I'm... I'm terrified.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's 80. Maybe higher. I can barely breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here in the room with me. Can you feel the chair beneath you?",
    "Client: Yes... yes, I can. But in my mind, I'm still there. I finally manage to get to my feet, but I'm disoriented. The crowd is scattering. I see a young woman get hit with a baton. She falls, and there's blood. So much blood.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you doing?",
    "Client: I... I want to help her, but I'm frozen. I can't move. A police officer is coming towards me now. His face is hidden behind his helmet visor. He's shouting something, but I can't understand. My ears are ringing.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: He grabs my arm. It hurts. I try to pull away, but his grip is too strong. I'm shouting that I didn't do anything wrong, but he's not listening. He's twisting my arm behind my back now. The pain... it's intense.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're doing well.",
    "Client: I feel something hit my back. It's his baton. The impact knocks the wind out of me. I fall to my knees. I can taste blood in my mouth. I think I bit my tongue. Everything is spinning. I can hear more shouting, more sirens.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's 95. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Can you feel the ground beneath your feet?",
    "Client: Yes... yes, I can. But in my memory, I'm being dragged now. My face scrapes against the pavement. It burns. They're putting handcuffs on me. They're too tight. I can feel the metal digging into my wrists.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking this can't be happening. I didn't do anything wrong. I'm scared. I'm in pain. I keep seeing that young woman's face, the blood. I wonder if she's okay. I wonder if I'll be okay.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: They're lifting me up now. Roughly. My shoulder feels like it's on fire. They're pushing me towards a police van. I can see other protesters being arrested too. Some are crying. Some are still shouting. I feel... I feel helpless.",
    "Therapist: What's happening in your body?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I can feel it pounding in my chest. My breathing is shallow. I'm shaking. They push me into the van. It's dark, cramped. There are others in here too. We're all scared, all in pain.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still at 95. I can't seem to calm down.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Remember, you're here in the room with me.",
    "Client: The van starts moving. We're all being jostled around. Someone is crying. I want to comfort them, but I can't move. My wrists are bleeding from the handcuffs. I keep thinking about my family. Will they know where I am? What's going to happen to me?",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm angry. And scared. And confused. This wasn't supposed to happen. We were peaceful. We were just standing up for what's right. How did it turn into this?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those emotions. What happens next?",
    "Client: We arrive at the police station. They're processing us like... like we're not even human. Just numbers. They take my fingerprints, my photo. I try to explain that I didn't do anything wrong, but they're not listening. No one's listening.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: Everything hurts. My back where I was hit, my wrists, my face. I'm exhausted. Drained. They put me in a cell. It's cold, sterile. I can hear others crying, shouting. I sit on the hard bench and... and I break down. I start crying. I can't stop.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 90. I can feel the tears on my face even now.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Can you feel the chair beneath you?",
    "Client: Yes... yes, I can. But in my memory, I'm still in that cell. Hours pass. I don't know how many. I'm worried about the others from the protest. About that young woman. I'm worried about myself. What will this mean for my job? My life?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those thoughts. What happens next?",
    "Client: Eventually, they come and tell me I'm being released. No charges. They act like it's some kind of favor. Like they didn't just... just assault me and violate my rights. I'm angry, but I'm also relieved. I just want to go home.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel as you're leaving?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel broken. Physically and emotionally. But there's also this... this determination. This wasn't right. What happened to us wasn't right. As I walk out of the station, I see others who were arrested. We look at each other, and there's this... this understanding. This shared trauma.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down. Maybe 75 now. I'm starting to feel more present here in the room.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. Can you open your eyes and look around the room?",
    "Client: Yes... yes, I can. I'm here. I'm safe. But... but I can still feel it all so vividly.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've been very brave today. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. But also... I don't know. There's a part of me that feels stronger for having faced this.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you. I... I didn't think I could do this, but I did.",
    "Therapist: You did indeed. We'll continue to work through this together."
