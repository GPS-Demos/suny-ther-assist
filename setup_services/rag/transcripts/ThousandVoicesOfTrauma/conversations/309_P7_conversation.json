    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the natural disaster experience?",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. It was a few years ago, during my honeymoon in the Philippines. We were staying at a beachfront resort when the typhoon hit. The wind was so loud, and the rain was relentless. I remember looking out the window and seeing palm trees bending almost to the ground.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you saw and felt.",
    "Client: The hotel staff told us to stay in our rooms, but I was terrified. The power went out, and it was pitch black. I could hear things crashing outside, and the windows were rattling so hard I thought they might break. My husband tried to comfort me, but I couldn't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I kept thinking about my family back home, wondering if I'd ever see them again. The storm seemed to last forever. At some point, water started seeping under our door. I panicked, thinking we might drown if the room flooded.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can continue. My heart is racing just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: Okay... The next morning, when the storm finally passed, we went outside. The destruction was overwhelming. Trees were uprooted, buildings damaged, and debris everywhere. I saw people crying, looking for their belongings. It was like a war zone.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved? It's hard to talk about, but I've never really shared all the details before.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I still have nightmares sometimes. I'll wake up thinking I'm back there, hearing the wind and rain. And now, whenever there's a storm, I get really anxious. I know it's irrational, but I can't help it.",
    "Therapist: Your reactions are understandable. Let's explore those feelings.",
    "Client: It's just... I feel so helpless when I think about it. Like I have no control. And it brings back memories of other times I've felt that way, like... like during the abuse.",
    "Therapist: You're very insightful. Can you tell me more?",
    "Client: Well, during the typhoon, I felt trapped and powerless, just like I did when... when the abuse was happening. I couldn't escape, couldn't make it stop. It's the same feeling of dread and panic.",
    "Therapist: You're making important connections. Keep going.",
    "Client: I guess that's why storms affect me so much now. They trigger those same feelings of helplessness and fear. And then I turn to substances to numb myself, to escape those memories and emotions.",
    "Therapist: I understand. You're showing great strength.",
    "Client: But talking about it like this... it's hard, but I think it's helping. It's like I'm facing the fear instead of running from it. I want to get better, to not let these experiences control my life anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. You should be proud.",
    "Client: Thank you. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe there's hope. Like maybe I can work through this and come out stronger on the other side.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent perspective. Shall we continue?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm ready. There's more I want to share about that day, about how it's affected my relationship with my husband and my views on safety. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Go ahead when you're ready."
