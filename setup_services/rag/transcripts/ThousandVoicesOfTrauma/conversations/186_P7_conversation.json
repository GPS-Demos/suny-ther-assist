    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the scene of the accident?",
    "Client: Okay... I was driving home from work, it was late, around 10 PM. The streets were quiet, and I remember feeling tired. I was approaching an intersection when suddenly...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Suddenly, I saw flashing lights in my rearview mirror. A police car was signaling me to pull over. I felt confused because I knew I hadn't done anything wrong. I pulled over to the side of the road, my heart starting to race.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happened next?",
    "Client: The officer approached my car. He seemed agitated, aggressive even. He demanded I step out of the vehicle. I was scared, but I complied. As I got out, he roughly grabbed my arm and...",
    "Therapist: It's okay. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: He roughly grabbed my arm and slammed me against the side of my car. I cried out in pain and shock. I kept asking what I'd done wrong, but he wouldn't answer. He just kept yelling at me to stop resisting, but I wasn't resisting at all. I was terrified.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Take a deep breath if you need to.",
    "Client: I took a deep breath, trying to stay calm. The officer started patting me down aggressively. I felt violated and helpless. I could feel tears streaming down my face. I kept thinking, \"This can't be happening. This isn't right.\"",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel those emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Then, out of nowhere, he twisted my arm behind my back. The pain was excruciating. I screamed, begging him to stop. I heard a pop and realized he had dislocated my shoulder. The pain was unbearable.",
    "Therapist: I know this is difficult. You're very brave for sharing this.",
    "Client: I collapsed to the ground, sobbing in pain. The officer seemed to realize he'd gone too far. He called for backup and an ambulance. I lay there on the cold pavement, feeling broken and humiliated. Other officers arrived, and they all stood around talking while I was still on the ground.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... angry. So angry. And scared. It's like I'm right back there on that pavement, feeling helpless and in pain. My heart is racing, and I can feel my hands shaking.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are valid. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how unfair it all was. I hadn't done anything wrong. I was just driving home, and suddenly my life changed. The physical pain eventually went away, but the emotional scars... they're still so raw.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Keep going.",
    "Client: The aftermath was almost as bad as the incident itself. The endless questions, the suspicious looks from people who should have been helping me. The officer faced no real consequences. It felt like the whole system was against me. I lost faith in the people who were supposed to protect us.",
    "Therapist: That's a heavy burden. You're handling it well.",
    "Client: It's been years, but I still get anxious when I see police cars. I avoid driving at night now. Sometimes, I wake up in a cold sweat, reliving that moment. I feel like I lost a part of myself that night, a sense of security and trust that I'm not sure I'll ever get back.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable resilience. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Drained. But also... maybe a little lighter? Talking about it is hard, but keeping it all bottled up inside was harder. I'm glad I could share this with you, even though it's painful.",
    "Therapist: You've done exceptionally well today. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your support through this. It's not easy to relive these moments, but I hope it's a step towards healing. Can we take a break now? I need a few minutes to compose myself.",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've made significant progress today."
