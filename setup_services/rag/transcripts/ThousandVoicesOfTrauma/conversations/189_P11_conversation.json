    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving that moment when I saw my neighbor being attacked... it brings back so many emotions. I feel drained, but also somehow... lighter? Is that strange?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. Can you tell me more about feeling lighter?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... for years, I've been carrying this heavy weight of that memory. Always trying to push it down, you know? But now, after talking about it in detail, it's like some of that weight has lifted. Don't get me wrong, it's still painful, but it's not crushing me anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant observation. What stood out to you most during the exposure?",
    "Client: The sounds. I could hear everything so clearly - the shouting, the struggle, the sirens in the distance. It's funny, I thought I'd forgotten those details, but they came rushing back. And then there was this overwhelming feeling of helplessness. I wanted to do something, anything, but I was frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to confront those memories today?",
    "Client: It was tough, really tough. My heart was racing, and I felt that familiar panic rising in my chest. But... I got through it. And now, sitting here, I realize I'm okay. The memory didn't destroy me like I feared it would.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does this connect to your everyday experiences?",
    "Client: You know, I've been avoiding busy streets or any place where I might witness conflict. Even watching the news became unbearable. But maybe... maybe I don't need to be so afraid anymore. The memory is just a memory now, not a constant threat.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. What do you think this means for your recovery?",
    "Client: I suppose it means I'm making progress, doesn't it? I've spent so long running from these feelings, but facing them head-on... it's like I'm reclaiming some control. I'm not saying it's easy, but I feel a glimmer of hope that I haven't felt in years.",
    "Therapist: That hope is valuable. How can we build on this experience?",
    "Client: Well, I'm thinking... maybe I could try watching the news again. Just for a few minutes at first. And perhaps I could take a short walk down the busier street near my daughter's house. Small steps, you know?",
    "Therapist: Those sound like thoughtful goals. How are you feeling about continuing with the exposures?",
    "Client: I'm... cautiously optimistic. It's not pleasant, reliving these moments, but I can see how it's helping. And knowing that I have support, both here and at home with my family, it makes it feel more manageable. I want to keep going, to see where this leads.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is commendable. Is there anything else you'd like to share?",
    "Client: I... I just want to thank you. For guiding me through this, for being patient. I know I'm not the easiest patient - I've cancelled appointments, I've resisted. But you've stuck with me, and I'm starting to see why this process is so important. It's like... I'm finally starting to heal an old wound instead of just covering it up.",
    "Therapist: Your progress is your own achievement. What's your takeaway from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's that I'm stronger than I realized. The memory is painful, yes, but I can face it. And each time I do, it loses a bit of its power over me. I'm not just a victim of my past anymore - I'm actively working towards my future. And that feels... empowering."
