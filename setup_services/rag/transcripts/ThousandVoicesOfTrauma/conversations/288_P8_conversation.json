    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. My heart's still racing, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's like I'm right back there in that moment, you know? The screeching tires, the crunch of metal... it's all so vivid.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how powerless I felt. One minute I was driving home from work, thinking about what to make for dinner, and the next... chaos. I couldn't do anything to stop it. And then there's this guilt... why did I survive when the other driver didn't? It doesn't seem fair.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does that guilt feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a heavy weight in my stomach. Sometimes I feel nauseous when I think about it. And my shoulders tense up, like I'm carrying this invisible burden. It's exhausting, really.",
    "Therapist: What else comes up for you as you sit with these feelings?",
    "Client: I... I find myself getting angry. Not just at the other driver, but at myself. I keep replaying the moment in my head, thinking maybe if I'd reacted faster or done something differently... But then I remind myself that's not fair. It happened so quickly. I just... I wish I could let go of this anger and guilt.",
    "Therapist: How does expressing that wish make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... liberating, in a way. But also scary. Part of me feels like holding onto these feelings is a way of honoring the other driver's memory. Like if I let go, I'm somehow forgetting or disrespecting what happened. Is that... is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Many people experience similar thoughts. How does that idea sit with you?",
    "Client: It's comforting to know I'm not alone in feeling this way. But it also makes me sad. I wouldn't wish these feelings on anyone. I guess... I guess I'm realizing that holding onto this pain isn't really helping anyone, is it? It's not bringing the other driver back, and it's certainly not helping me move forward.",
    "Therapist: What do you think moving forward might look like for you?",
    "Client: I... I'm not entirely sure. I think it might involve being kinder to myself, maybe? Accepting that accidents happen and that I'm not to blame. It's hard though. Sometimes I feel like I don't deserve to move on or be happy. But then I think about my family, how worried they've been about me. Maybe moving forward is also about reconnecting with them, being present instead of always lost in these memories.",
    "Therapist: How does the idea of reconnecting feel?",
    "Client: It's... bittersweet. On one hand, I miss feeling close to them. I've been so wrapped up in my own pain that I've pushed them away at times. But on the other hand, it's scary. What if I can't be the person they need me to be anymore? What if I'm too changed by this experience?",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to be the person they need?",
    "Client: I... I guess I've always seen myself as the strong one, you know? The one who holds everything together. But now, I feel so fragile sometimes. I worry that if I let them see how much I'm struggling, it'll somehow disappoint them or burden them. But maybe... maybe that's not giving them enough credit. They've been so patient with me through all of this.",
    "Therapist: How might showing vulnerability affect your relationships?",
    "Client: That's... that's a tough question. I suppose it could bring us closer, couldn't it? If I let them in, let them see the real me - struggles and all. It's terrifying, but also... maybe a little exciting? The thought of not having to pretend I'm okay all the time is actually quite a relief.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you consider this?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... hopeful, I think. For the first time in a while. Like maybe there's a way through this that doesn't involve me being stuck in this loop of guilt and anger forever. It's not going to be easy, I know that. But the idea that I could have a future where the accident doesn't define every moment of my life... it's powerful.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you express that hope?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a warmth spreading through my chest. The tightness is still there, but it feels less constricting. I can breathe a little easier. My shoulders have relaxed a bit too. It's like... like I've put down a little bit of that burden I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: What do you want to remember from this session?",
    "Client: I think... I want to remember this feeling of hope. And the idea that moving forward doesn't mean forgetting or disrespecting what happened. It's about honoring my own life and the people in it. And maybe, just maybe, it's okay to let others support me through this. I don't have to do it all alone.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you want to carry this forward?",
    "Client: I think... I think I want to start with small steps. Maybe I'll try talking to my husband tonight, really talking, about how I'm feeling. And perhaps I could reach out to my sister - we used to be so close, but I've been distant lately. Just... baby steps towards reconnecting and being more open. It's scary, but I think it might be worth it.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... lighter, I suppose. Still a bit shaky from the exposure exercise, but there's a sense of... I don't know, possibility? Like maybe I'm not as stuck as I thought I was. It's a mix of emotions, really. Hopeful, but also a little nervous about the changes I want to make. But overall, I think I feel... ready. Ready to try, at least.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. Thank you for guiding me through this. It wasn't easy, but I feel like I've gained some valuable insights. I'm looking forward to putting some of these ideas into practice, even if it's just small steps at first. I appreciate your support and patience throughout this process.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
