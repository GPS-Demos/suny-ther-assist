    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're in control here. Can you start by describing the event?",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. It was a warm evening in June. I was walking home from work, taking my usual route through the park. The sun was setting, and the sky had this beautiful orange glow. I remember feeling tired but content after a long day at the office. As I walked along the path, I noticed a man sitting on a bench. He seemed to be watching me...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: As I got closer, he stood up and started walking towards me. I felt uneasy, but I told myself I was being paranoid. Then, suddenly, he grabbed my arm. I tried to pull away, but he was so strong. I can still feel his grip... (voice trembles)",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel emotional. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) He dragged me off the path into some bushes. I tried to scream, but he covered my mouth. The fear was overwhelming. I could smell alcohol on his breath, and his eyes... they were so cold. I felt so helpless, so violated...",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. Keep going.",
    "Client: He... he forced himself on me. I tried to fight back, but I couldn't. It felt like it lasted forever. When it was over, he just left me there. I was in shock. I couldn't move for what seemed like hours. I felt so dirty, so ashamed...",
    "Therapist: Remember, it wasn't your fault. You're showing incredible strength.",
    "Client: After I finally managed to get up, I stumbled home. I didn't tell anyone for days. I was scared and confused. I blamed myself for taking that route, for not fighting harder. The guilt and shame were overwhelming. I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw his face...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: The worst part was feeling like I couldn't tell anyone. I was afraid they would judge me or not believe me. I felt so alone, so isolated. It took me weeks before I finally told my husband. He was supportive, but I could see the pain and anger in his eyes. I felt like I had let him down somehow...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this very well. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel a mix of emotions. There's still fear and anger, but also a strange sense of relief in talking about it. It's like a weight is slowly lifting. But it's hard, really hard to relive these moments.",
    "Therapist: That's completely normal. You're making progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. It helps to hear that. I've carried this secret for so long, it's both terrifying and liberating to speak about it. I still struggle with trusting people, especially men. Sometimes, I catch myself being overly cautious or paranoid in public spaces. But I'm trying to reclaim my life, my sense of safety.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of your resilience.",
    "Client: I'm trying to be. Some days are better than others. I've started volunteering at a women's shelter, which has been healing in its own way. It helps me feel like I'm turning my pain into something positive. But there are still moments when the memories flood back, and I feel that same helplessness...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have those moments. You're coping admirably.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your support through this. It's not easy to talk about, but I know it's part of the healing process. I want to move forward, to not let this define me. But it's a journey, and sometimes it feels like two steps forward, one step back.",
    "Therapist: That's a natural part of healing. You're doing excellent work.",
    "Client: I think I need a moment. This session has been intense, but in a good way, I think. It's exhausting to relive these memories, but I also feel a sense of accomplishment for facing them head-on. Is it okay if we wrap up for today?",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've done remarkably well today."
