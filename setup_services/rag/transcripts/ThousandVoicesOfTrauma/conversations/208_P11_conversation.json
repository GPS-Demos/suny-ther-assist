    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. I feel drained, but also kind of... I don't know, maybe relieved? Going through that memory of the cyber bullying incident was harder than I expected. It brought back so many emotions I thought I had buried.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you?",
    "Client: The overwhelming sense of shame, I think. Reliving how it felt when those awful messages and photos started circulating... God, it was like being back in that moment, feeling so exposed and violated. I could feel my heart racing and my palms getting sweaty, just like they did back then. It's crazy how vivid it all still is.",
    "Therapist: How does that compare to your day-to-day experiences?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... I still feel that shame sometimes, especially when I'm scrolling through social media. But it's not as intense as it was during the exposure. In my daily life, it's more like a constant, low-level anxiety. Like I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop, you know? Always wondering if someone's going to use something against me online.",
    "Therapist: I see. How did you cope during the exposure?",
    "Client: I tried to use those grounding techniques we talked about. Focusing on my breathing helped a bit, and reminding myself that I'm safe now. But it was still really hard. There were moments when I wanted to just stop and run out of the room. But I didn't. I guess that's progress, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What else did you notice?",
    "Client: I realized how much anger I still have. Not just at the people who bullied me, but at myself for not standing up to them sooner. And at the school for not doing more to help. It's like this ball of rage that's been sitting in my chest all this time, and I never really acknowledged it before.",
    "Therapist: How does recognizing that anger feel?",
    "Client: It's... oddly empowering, actually. Like, maybe I'm not just a victim. Maybe I have a right to be angry. But it's also scary. I don't really know what to do with all this anger.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. How might you channel it?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe I could use it to advocate for better anti-bullying policies? Or to help other students who are going through similar things? It feels good to think about using this experience for something positive.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great idea. What else?",
    "Client: I also noticed that... well, it's hard to admit this, but I still blame myself sometimes. Even though I know logically that it wasn't my fault, there's still this voice in my head saying I should have done something differently.",
    "Therapist: How does that self-blame impact you?",
    "Client: It holds me back, I think. Makes me hesitant to put myself out there or try new things. I'm always second-guessing myself, wondering if I'm going to mess up and give people a reason to target me again. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: I understand. How might we work on that?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe we could focus more on building my self-esteem? Or work on challenging those negative thoughts when they come up? I want to feel more confident in myself and my decisions.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent suggestions. Anything else?",
    "Client: Yeah, actually. During the exposure, I had this moment where I could see how far I've come. Like, even though it was hard to go through that memory, I did it. And I'm still here, still fighting. It made me feel... I don't know, kind of proud of myself. Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a sign of progress. How can we build on that?",
    "Client: Maybe we could set some goals for the future? Things I want to accomplish that I've been too scared to try before? I think I'm ready to start pushing myself a little more, to reclaim some of the confidence I lost.",
    "Therapist: That's a great idea. Shall we discuss that next time?",
    "Client: Yeah, I'd like that. This session was tough, but I feel like I've learned a lot about myself. Thank you for guiding me through it.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Well done today, Sarah."
