    "Therapist: Hello Amir. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hey Dr. Thompson. I'm... I don't know. Nervous, I guess. Last session you mentioned we'd be doing something different today, and I've been anxious about it all week.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's talk about that.",
    "Client: Okay. What exactly are we doing? You said something about imaginal exposure? It sounds... intimidating.",
    "Therapist: It's a technique to help process trauma. We'll revisit the event in a safe space.",
    "Client: Revisit? You mean... I have to think about it? I've been trying so hard not to.",
    "Therapist: Yes, but with support. It can help reduce PTSD symptoms over time.",
    "Client: I don't know if I can do this. What if I panic? Or get too upset?",
    "Therapist: That's normal to worry. We'll go at your pace, and I'll guide you through it.",
    "Client: Okay... I trust you, but I'm still scared. Will it be like reliving it all over again?",
    "Therapist: It might feel intense, but you're safe here. We can pause anytime.",
    "Client: Alright. I guess I'm willing to try. How long will this take?",
    "Therapist: About 30-45 minutes. We'll start and end with relaxation exercises.",
    "Client: That's a long time to think about... that night. What if I can't handle it?",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Remember, you're in control. We can stop if needed.",
    "Client: Okay. I appreciate that. So, what exactly do I need to do?",
    "Therapist: You'll describe the event out loud, in present tense, with as much detail as possible.",
    "Client: That sounds really hard. But I want to get better. I'm tired of feeling this way all the time.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable, Amir. Shall we begin with a breathing exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I could use some calming down right now. My heart's already racing.",
    "Therapist: Let's start. Close your eyes and take a deep breath..."
