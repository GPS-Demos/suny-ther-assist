    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do. Last session, you mentioned something about imaginal exposure? It's been on my mind all week.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... the idea of reliving those experiences with the bullying, it's scary. I've spent so long trying to forget, you know? And now you're asking me to remember it all in detail. I'm worried it might be too much. What if I can't handle it? What if it makes everything worse?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. Let's discuss how this can help.",
    "Client: Okay, I'm listening. But I have to admit, I'm still skeptical. How can purposely thinking about something I've been avoiding for years possibly be beneficial?",
    "Therapist: By facing memories, we reduce their power over you.",
    "Client: Reduce their power? That sounds... well, it sounds good in theory, but in practice? I'm not sure. These memories have controlled so much of my life for so long. It's hard to imagine them losing their grip.",
    "Therapist: It's a gradual process. We'll take it step by step.",
    "Client: Step by step... that does sound a bit less overwhelming. Can you give me an idea of what these steps might look like? What exactly will we be doing?",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit memories safely, processing emotions as we go.",
    "Client: Safely? That's reassuring to hear. But how can you ensure it's safe? When these memories come up unexpectedly, it feels anything but safe. It feels like I'm right back there, helpless and scared.",
    "Therapist: I'll guide you throughout. We can pause anytime you need.",
    "Client: That's good to know. I appreciate that you'll be there with me. It makes me feel a bit more secure. But what if I freeze up? Or if I start panicking? I'm worried I might not be able to continue if it gets too intense.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. We'll develop coping strategies together first.",
    "Client: Coping strategies... that sounds helpful. What kind of strategies are we talking about? I've tried deep breathing before, but it doesn't always work when I'm really anxious.",
    "Therapist: We'll explore various techniques tailored to your needs.",
    "Client: Okay, that sounds good. I'm still nervous, but I think I'm starting to understand the process a bit better. How long does this usually take? Is it something we'll do in one session, or is it an ongoing thing?",
    "Therapist: It's a process over several sessions. We'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: That's a relief. I was worried it would be like ripping off a band-aid all at once. Knowing we can take it slow makes it seem more manageable. So, what should I expect to feel during and after these sessions?",
    "Therapist: You may experience strong emotions. That's normal and temporary.",
    "Client: Strong emotions... I guess that's to be expected. It's just, I've spent so long trying to avoid these feelings. The idea of voluntarily bringing them up is daunting. But you say it's temporary?",
    "Therapist: Yes, the intensity will decrease with each session.",
    "Client: That's encouraging. I hope you're right. It's hard to imagine these feelings ever becoming less intense, but I trust your expertise. Is there anything I should do to prepare for our next session?",
    "Therapist: Just come as you are. Your courage is all you need.",
    "Client: Thank you, that means a lot. I'm still scared, but I'm also feeling a glimmer of hope. Maybe this could really help me move forward. I appreciate your patience in explaining all of this to me.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your bravery is commendable. Any other questions?",
    "Client: I think I'm good for now. I'm sure I'll have more questions as we go along, but you've really helped ease my mind today. Thank you for taking the time to walk me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll tackle this together. See you next week."
