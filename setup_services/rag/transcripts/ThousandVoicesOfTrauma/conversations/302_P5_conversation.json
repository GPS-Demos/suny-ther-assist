    "Therapist: Mrs. Thompson, today we'll begin imaginal exposure. Are you ready to discuss this?",
    "Client: I suppose so, but I'm feeling quite nervous about it. What exactly does imaginal exposure involve? It sounds a bit daunting, to be honest.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel nervous. Imaginal exposure involves revisiting your trauma memory in a safe environment. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: Oh dear, that does sound challenging. I've spent so long trying not to think about those experiences as a refugee. The idea of purposely bringing them up is... well, it's frightening. Will it make things worse?",
    "Therapist: Your concern is valid. However, this process helps reduce PTSD symptoms over time. Shall we discuss how it works?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I'd like to understand more before we start. It's all a bit overwhelming, you know. At my age, I sometimes wonder if it's worth stirring up old memories. But then again, they still affect me so much...",
    "Therapist: I understand your hesitation. The goal is to process these memories safely, reducing their power. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about losing control of my emotions. What if I can't handle it? And how long will this process take? I'm not as resilient as I used to be, you know.",
    "Therapist: Your resilience has brought you this far. We'll go at your pace, and I'll support you throughout. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's somewhat reassuring. I appreciate your patience with me. It's just... these memories are tied to so much loss and fear. The journey here was traumatic enough, but the medical issues I faced in the refugee camp... those are the hardest to revisit. How will talking about them help?",
    "Therapist: Talking helps process the memories, reducing their emotional impact. Your courage in facing this is admirable. Shall we set some expectations for today?",
    "Client: Yes, that would be helpful. I need to know what I'm getting into. Sometimes I feel like I'm too old to be dealing with all this, but then I remember how it still affects my daily life. My family notices when I'm having a bad day, and I hate worrying them.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll start slowly. You might feel strong emotions, but remember, you're safe here. How does that feel?",
    "Client: It's a bit scary, but I think I can manage. Knowing that you'll be here to guide me helps. I've come this far in life; I suppose I can face this too. Will we be doing this every session from now on?",
    "Therapist: We'll incorporate it regularly, but not every session. Your comfort is important. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm still nervous, but I understand why we're doing this. It's like facing a storm, isn't it? You have to go through it to get to the calm on the other side. I just hope I'm strong enough for this journey. My husband has been so supportive, but there are things I haven't even told him about those times.",
    "Therapist: Your analogy is apt. Your strength is evident. Shall we start with a breathing exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, that sounds good. I could use something to calm my nerves a bit. It's strange, isn't it? How events from so long ago can still have such a hold on us. But I'm here, and I'm willing to try. Let's begin with that breathing exercise, and then... well, then I suppose we'll face those memories together.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's begin. Take a deep breath in..."
