    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing but also blank at the same time. I can still see her in that hospital bed, you know? The beeping of the machines, the smell of disinfectant... it's all so vivid.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Guilt. Overwhelming guilt. I keep thinking about all the times I was too busy with school to visit her. All those missed opportunities... And now she's gone. I can't shake this feeling that I let her down.",
    "Therapist: Hmm. Can you tell me more about that guilt?",
    "Client: It's like a heavy weight on my chest. I feel like I can't breathe sometimes when I think about it. She was always there for me, you know? Through everything. And when she needed me most, I wasn't there enough. I was so focused on my studies, on my future... I didn't realize her future was slipping away.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind as you sit with these feelings?",
    "Client: I... I keep hearing her voice. The last time we spoke on the phone, she sounded so weak. She told me not to worry, to focus on my exams. But I should have known better. I should have dropped everything and gone to see her. Maybe if I had been there, things would have been different. Maybe she wouldn't have... (voice breaks)",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking. My stomach feels like it's in knots. I can feel my heart racing, and there's this tightness in my throat like I'm about to cry but can't. It's like my body is reliving that moment when I got the call that she... that she was gone.",
    "Therapist: How does this compare to how you felt immediately after her passing?",
    "Client: It's... it's different. Back then, I was in shock. I couldn't feel anything. Now it's like all those emotions I should have felt then are hitting me at once. The sadness, the anger, the regret... it's overwhelming. But at the same time, it's like I'm finally allowing myself to grieve, you know?",
    "Therapist: What do you think your grandmother would say if she could see you now?",
    "Client: (long pause) She... she'd probably tell me to stop being so hard on myself. She was always like that, always putting others before herself. She'd tell me that she was proud of me, that she understood why I couldn't be there all the time. But it's hard to believe that when I feel like I failed her.",
    "Therapist: How does imagining her response make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... comforting, in a way. But it also makes me sad. I wish I could hear her say those things for real. I wish I had one more chance to tell her how much she meant to me, how much I loved her. It's like there's this gaping hole in my life now, and I don't know how to fill it.",
    "Therapist: What's one positive memory of her that stands out to you right now?",
    "Client: (smiles slightly) There was this time when I was little, maybe seven or eight. I was struggling with math, and I was so frustrated. She sat with me for hours, patiently explaining everything. She made up these silly songs to help me remember the multiplication tables. I can still hear her singing them sometimes. It's... it's a bittersweet memory now.",
    "Therapist: How does recalling that memory affect your current emotions?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. There's a warmth there, a fondness. But it also makes the loss feel more acute. It's like I'm realizing all over again that I'll never have moments like that with her again. But... I guess it also reminds me of how lucky I was to have her in my life for as long as I did.",
    "Therapist: What do you think you've learned from this experience?",
    "Client: I... I think I've learned that life is fragile. That we shouldn't take the people we love for granted. I've also learned that grief isn't linear. Some days I feel okay, and others it hits me like a truck. And I'm learning that it's okay to not be okay sometimes. That healing takes time.",
    "Therapist: How do you see this affecting your future relationships?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'll be more present. More appreciative of the time I have with people. I don't want to have any more regrets about not spending enough time with the people I care about. But I'm also scared. Scared of getting close to people and losing them. It's like I'm caught between wanting to love deeply and wanting to protect myself from more pain.",
    "Therapist: What coping strategies have you found helpful so far?",
    "Client: Talking about her helps. Sharing memories with my family, looking at old photos. I've started journaling too, writing letters to her that I'll never send. It's... it's cathartic. And being here, in therapy, facing these emotions head-on... it's hard, but I think it's necessary. I don't want to run from this pain anymore.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel now compared to when we started this session?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but in a good way? Like I've released some of the pressure that's been building up inside me. There's still sadness, still guilt, but it feels... I don't know, more manageable somehow. Like I can breathe a little easier. And there's a part of me that feels... hopeful? Like maybe, eventually, I'll be able to think about her without this overwhelming sense of loss.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant shift. What do you want to focus on for next time?",
    "Client: I think... I want to work more on processing this guilt. On finding ways to honor her memory without getting stuck in regret. And maybe... maybe start thinking about how I can use this experience to become a better person, the kind of person she always believed I could be.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. We'll pick up there next session.",
    "Client: Thank you. This... this isn't easy, but I'm glad I'm doing it. I think she would be proud of me for facing this head-on.",
    "Therapist: I believe she would be too. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
