    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Patel?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. It's like I'm back there again, you know? The memory feels so vivid. I can still hear their taunts, feel the sting of their words. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: It's a mix of emotions. There's anger, definitely. But also... shame. I feel this deep sense of shame, like I should have done something, anything, to stop it. My hands are trembling a bit, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's hard to breathe normally.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"Why me?\" Why did they single me out? Was it because I was different? Because I couldn't speak English well? And then I think about all the others who've suffered worse. The people I've seen, the stories I've heard about human trafficking. It makes me feel... I don't know, guilty for feeling so affected by mere bullying when others have endured so much more.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt manifest for you?",
    "Client: It's like a weight, you know? Pressing down on my shoulders. I feel small, insignificant. But at the same time, there's this... this rage bubbling up. I want to scream, to fight back. Not just for myself, but for all those who couldn't. It's... it's confusing, these conflicting emotions.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice in your body as you experience these emotions?",
    "Client: My jaw is clenched tight. I can feel the tension spreading down my neck, into my shoulders. My heart is racing, and there's this... this heat in my face. I feel restless, like I need to move, to do something. But I'm also frozen, you know? Like I can't escape this moment, these memories.",
    "Therapist: How does this compare to how you felt during the actual events?",
    "Client: It's... it's similar in some ways, but different in others. Back then, I felt more helpless, more alone. Now, there's still fear, but also... I don't know, maybe a bit of strength? Like I've survived it once, I can face it again. But it's still hard, you know? It still hurts.",
    "Therapist: What do you think has changed?",
    "Client: I guess... I guess I've grown. I'm not that scared kid anymore. I've seen more of the world, understood more about why people do cruel things. It doesn't make it okay, but it helps me see it differently. And talking about it here, it's... it's like I'm not carrying this burden alone anymore.",
    "Therapist: How does sharing this experience make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a relief, in a way. Like I'm finally letting out a breath I've been holding for years. But it's also scary, you know? Opening up like this, it makes me feel vulnerable. Yet, there's also this sense of... I don't know, maybe pride? That I'm finally facing this, that I'm not letting it control me anymore.",
    "Therapist: What does this mean for your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I think... I think it means I'm making progress. It's painful, and sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. But then I remember how much this has affected my life, my relationships, even my struggles with substance use. And I realize, this is necessary. It's hard, but it's necessary if I want to truly move forward, to live fully.",
    "Therapist: How do you see yourself coping with these memories moving forward?",
    "Client: I... I'm not entirely sure. But I think I'll be better equipped to handle them. Maybe they won't have such a strong hold on me. I hope I can use this experience, turn it into something positive. Maybe help others who've been through similar things. It's still scary, but... but I feel a bit more hopeful now.",
    "Therapist: What's one thing you'd like to remember from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's that I'm stronger than I realized. That facing these memories, as painful as it is, is possible. And that there's no shame in what happened to me. It wasn't my fault. I was a victim, yes, but I'm also a survivor. And maybe... maybe that's something to be proud of.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing, Mr. Patel. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, to be honest. Emotionally drained. But there's also this strange sense of... I don't know, lightness? Like I've put down a heavy load I've been carrying for years. It's not gone completely, but it feels... manageable now. I'm grateful for this session, even though it was tough. Thank you for guiding me through it.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great courage today. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?"
