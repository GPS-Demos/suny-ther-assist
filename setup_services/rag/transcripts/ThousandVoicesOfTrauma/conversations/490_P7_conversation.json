    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Can you take me through your combat experience?",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. It was a hot day in Afghanistan. We were on patrol, and everything seemed quiet. Too quiet. I remember feeling tense, my hands sweating on my rifle. Suddenly, there was an explosion. The sound was deafening, and I felt the ground shake beneath me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I was thrown to the ground. My ears were ringing, and I couldn't hear anything clearly. I saw smoke everywhere. As I tried to get up, I realized I couldn't move my left leg. The pain hit me all at once, and I started to panic.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can. It's too much.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: Okay... I looked around and saw my squad mates. Some were down, others were shouting, but I couldn't hear them. I dragged myself behind a nearby wall, my leg leaving a trail of blood. I was terrified, thinking I might die there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Continue.",
    "Client: I tried to apply a tourniquet to my leg, but my hands were shaking so badly. I kept thinking about my family back home, wondering if I'd ever see them again. The gunfire started, and I felt so helpless. I couldn't move, couldn't help my team.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I saw one of my closest friends get hit. He fell just a few feet away from me, and I couldn't do anything to help him. I called out to him, but he didn't respond. I felt so angry, so scared, and so guilty all at once.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The firefight seemed to last forever. I was in and out of consciousness from the blood loss. When I finally heard the choppers coming, I felt a mix of relief and dread. I didn't know who was alive or dead. As they loaded me onto the helicopter, I caught a glimpse of the carnage we left behind. That image... it haunts me still.",
    "Therapist: You've done an excellent job. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. My heart is racing, and I'm sweating. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've let something out that I've been holding in for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You've shown great courage.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to talk about, but I think it's getting a little easier each time. I just wish I could forget some of those images.",
    "Therapist: Remember, processing is key. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I know. It's just... sometimes I feel guilty for surviving when others didn't. I keep thinking about what I could have done differently.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are common. You're not alone.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It helps to know that what I'm feeling isn't unusual. Sometimes I worry that I'm not getting better fast enough.",
    "Therapist: Healing takes time. You're doing well.",
    "Client: You're right. I need to be patient with myself. It's just hard when the nightmares come, or when I hear a loud noise and suddenly I'm back there.",
    "Therapist: Those are normal responses. We'll work through them.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm glad I have this space to talk about it. Sometimes I feel like I can't share these things with anyone else because they wouldn't understand.",
    "Therapist: This is a safe space. You're doing great work.",
    "Client: I think I'm starting to see that now. It's still difficult, but I feel like I'm making progress. I just hope I can keep it up.",
    "Therapist: You're showing real strength. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. I feel emotionally exhausted, but in a way that feels... productive? If that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: It does. You've done excellent work today."
