    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like my whole body is vibrating with tension. The memories feel so vivid, like I'm right back there in that moment, you know? I can still hear the screams, the chaos... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's this cold, gripping sensation in my chest. I feel like I can't catch my breath properly. It's as if I'm still in danger, even though I know I'm safe here. But there's also this... guilt, I think. Like I should have done more to help.",
    "Therapist: I see. Can you tell me more about that guilt?",
    "Client: Well, it's... it's like I was frozen. I saw people running, crying, begging for help, and I just stood there. I couldn't move. I couldn't think. I should have done something, anything. But I was just... paralyzed. And now, remembering it, I feel so ashamed. Like I failed them, you know?",
    "Therapist: How does that shame feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's heavy. Like a weight pressing down on my shoulders. And there's this knot in my stomach that just won't go away. It's making me feel nauseous, actually. I keep replaying those moments in my head, thinking of all the things I could have done differently.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind as you remember this?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"I'm a coward. I'm weak. I should have been braver.\" And then there's this voice saying, \"You're lucky it wasn't you. You should be grateful.\" But that just makes me feel worse, you know? Like I don't deserve to be here when others didn't make it. It's all so... confusing and overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts and feelings compare to when you first experienced the event?",
    "Client: They're... they're actually a bit less intense now. I mean, it's still awful, but back then, it was like I couldn't function at all. I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat. I was constantly on edge, jumping at every little sound. Now, it's more like... waves. It comes and goes. Sometimes I feel okay, and then something triggers me, and it all comes flooding back.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your ability to sit with these feelings now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard, but I can do it. Before, I would have done anything to avoid thinking about it. I'd drink, or work myself to exhaustion, anything to numb it out. But now, even though it's painful, I can sit here and talk about it. That feels... I don't know, important somehow?",
    "Therapist: How does that realization make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's kind of empowering, actually. Like, I'm not completely at the mercy of these memories anymore. Don't get me wrong, it's still incredibly difficult, and part of me wants to run away. But there's also this tiny sense of... pride, maybe? That I can face this, even if it's just for a little while.",
    "Therapist: What does this tell you about your own strength?",
    "Client: I... I guess it shows that I'm stronger than I thought. That even though I feel weak sometimes, I can handle more than I give myself credit for. It's strange, because I've always seen myself as a failure in this situation. But maybe... maybe just surviving was an act of strength in itself?",
    "Therapist: How might this perspective shift impact your recovery journey?",
    "Client: That's... that's a big question. I suppose it could change a lot. If I start seeing myself as strong rather than weak, maybe I'll be more willing to face these memories head-on. Maybe I'll be less afraid of the flashbacks because I know I can handle them. It's like... it's like I'm reclaiming some power that I thought I'd lost forever.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you consider this?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of emotions, really. There's hope, which feels new and a bit scary. But there's also this sadness, you know? Like I'm grieving for the person I was before all this happened. And there's anxiety too, about the work ahead. But underneath it all, there's this tiny spark of... determination, I guess? Like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this and come out the other side.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel now compared to when we started?",
    "Client: It's... it's different. The tension is still there, but it's not as overwhelming. My breathing feels a bit easier, and that knot in my stomach has loosened a little. I feel... drained, but also somewhat lighter? Like I've put down a heavy backpack I've been carrying for miles. It's exhausting, but also... a relief, in a way.",
    "Therapist: What do you need right now to take care of yourself?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need some quiet time. Maybe a walk in the park, or just sitting somewhere peaceful. And... and I think I need to be gentle with myself. I've been so hard on myself for so long, always pushing and judging. Maybe it's time to try a little kindness, you know? It feels scary, but also... necessary.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How do you feel about ending our session here?",
    "Client: I think... I think that's good. It's been intense, but I feel like we've made some progress. I'm tired, but it's a different kind of tired than when I came in. More... more hopeful, I guess. Thank you for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone listen and understand.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and we'll continue next week."
