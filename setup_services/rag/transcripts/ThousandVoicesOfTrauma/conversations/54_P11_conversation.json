    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Hernandez?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's strange, you know? I've been retired for years now, but reliving that moment in the office... it brought everything back so vividly. The fluorescent lights, the smell of coffee, even the scratchy feeling of my old work blazer. It's like I was right there again, hearing my boss tell me about Juan's accident. I can still see the pity in his eyes...",
    "Therapist: What stood out to you most about revisiting that memory?",
    "Client: (long pause) I think... it was the overwhelming sense of helplessness. In that moment, I realized how little control we have over life. Juan was fine that morning when he left for work, and then suddenly... he was gone. It made me question everything. Why him? Why then? I remember feeling like the ground was crumbling beneath my feet.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to experience those emotions again today?",
    "Client: It was hard, really hard. My heart was racing, and I felt that familiar tightness in my chest. But... (deep breath) I also noticed something different this time. The pain was there, but it didn't completely overwhelm me like it used to. I was able to stay present, even when describing the worst parts. Is that... is that progress?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What do you think has changed?",
    "Client: Well, I've been practicing those breathing exercises you taught me. And I think... I think I'm starting to accept that feeling the pain doesn't mean I'm going backwards. It's part of the process, right? (voice wavers) It's just... Juan was more than my husband. He was my best friend, my partner in everything. Losing him felt like losing half of myself.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How does this connect to your day-to-day life now?",
    "Client: I've noticed that I'm not avoiding photos of Juan as much. I even told my granddaughter a funny story about him last week without feeling like I was going to break down. But there are still moments, you know? Like when I smell his favorite cologne or when our anniversary comes around. It hits me all over again that he's gone.",
    "Therapist: What helps you in those difficult moments?",
    "Client: I try to remember what we've talked about here. That it's okay to feel sad, that it doesn't negate the good memories. Sometimes I use that grounding technique, focusing on things I can see and touch. And I've started reaching out to friends more when I'm struggling, instead of isolating myself like I used to.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. How do you feel about continuing with these exposures?",
    "Client: It's scary, I won't lie. But I also feel... hopeful? Like maybe I'm finally starting to process everything instead of just trying to push it away. I want to keep going. I want to get to a place where I can think about Juan and smile more than I cry. Do you think that's possible?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What gives you hope?",
    "Client: (thoughtful pause) I think it's the small changes I'm noticing. Being able to talk about him without falling apart. Enjoying things again, even if it's just in small doses. And... the support I feel here, in these sessions. It makes me believe that maybe, just maybe, I can find a way to honor Juan's memory while still living my life. That's what he would have wanted for me, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's beautiful. How can we build on this progress?",
    "Client: I think... I want to try talking more about the good memories. Maybe even visit some of our favorite places together. It scares me, but I also feel like it might help me reconnect with the joy we shared, not just the pain of losing him. And I want to keep working on opening up to my family. They've been so patient with me, and I think it's time I let them in more.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Shall we set some specific goals for next time?",
    "Client: Yes, I'd like that. Maybe I could try looking through our old photo albums? And perhaps call my sister-in-law? She lost her husband a few years ago, and I've been avoiding her calls. I think... I think it might be good to connect with someone who understands.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like great goals. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... lighter? Like I've put down a heavy load I've been carrying. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know we have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I might be okay eventually. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: It's a very positive sign. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: Could we maybe explore more strategies for dealing with the anniversary? It's coming up in a few months, and I want to be prepared. And perhaps we could talk more about how to balance honoring Juan's memory with moving forward in my own life? I'm still struggling with feeling guilty when I enjoy things without him.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll address those next time. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. I know I say it every time, but I truly mean it. This process is hard, but I'm starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel. I'm grateful for your guidance and patience. (voice softens) Juan would have liked you, you know. He always said that healing takes courage, and he'd be proud that I'm doing this work.",
    "Therapist: That's very kind. I look forward to our next session, Mrs. Hernandez."
