    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Chen. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit apprehensive, to be honest. We're going to dive into some pretty heavy stuff today, aren't we?",
    "Therapist: Yes, we are. Remember, you're in control. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. As ready as I'll ever be, I guess.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in my office. It's late, probably around 9 PM. The fluorescent lights are harsh, making everything look too bright and artificial. I can smell the stale coffee from my mug... God, I've been here for hours.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: My phone buzzes. It's a text from him... my boss. He wants me to come to his office. My stomach immediately knots up. I know what this means.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 40? It's uncomfortable, but I can handle it.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I get up. My legs feel heavy. I can hear my heart pounding in my ears as I walk down the hallway. The carpet muffles my footsteps, but each step feels like it echoes through the empty office.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... I'm thinking I should run. Just turn around and leave. But I can't. He'll... he'll make my life hell if I don't go. He always does.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I reach his office door. It's slightly ajar, and I can see the warm glow of his desk lamp. I knock softly, hoping maybe he won't hear, but... \"Come in,\" he says. His voice makes my skin crawl.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe 60?",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here. What happens when you enter?",
    "Client: I step inside. He's sitting behind his desk, leaning back in his chair. He's smiling, but it doesn't reach his eyes. They're cold, calculating. \"Close the door,\" he says. I do, and I feel like I'm sealing my fate.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What do you feel in your body?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking. I can feel sweat forming on my brow. My mouth is dry... so dry. I want to speak, to ask why he called me in, but I can't form the words.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: He stands up, walks around the desk. \"I have a special assignment for you,\" he says. My heart sinks. I know what that means. It's never just work. He puts his hand on my shoulder, and I flinch. I can smell his cologne... it's overpowering.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 75. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember to breathe. What happens next?",
    "Client: He starts talking about a \"client\" who needs \"special attention.\" But I know... I know he's talking about human trafficking. He wants me to use my connections, my position, to help move people. Innocent people. I feel sick.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What do you want to do?",
    "Client: I want to scream. I want to punch him. I want to run. But I just... I just stand there. Frozen. I can feel the bile rising in my throat.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. How does your body feel?",
    "Client: Tense. So tense. My muscles are coiled like springs. I'm clenching my fists so hard my nails are digging into my palms.",
    "Therapist: Keep breathing. What happens next?",
    "Client: He keeps talking, laying out the details. Each word feels like a weight on my chest. I'm nodding, but I'm not really hearing him anymore. All I can think is, \"How did I get here? How did I become this person?\"",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's at 85 now. This is really tough.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Stay with it. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm thinking about all the people I've already helped him move. Their faces... they haunt me. And now he wants more. I feel so ashamed, so dirty. But I'm also scared. What if I say no? What will he do to me?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I hear myself agreeing. My voice sounds far away, like it's not even me speaking. But it is. It's me, condemning more people to suffering. I hate myself for it.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're not that person anymore. How does your body feel now?",
    "Client: Heavy. So heavy. Like I'm carrying the weight of all those lives on my shoulders. My chest feels tight, it's hard to breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. In through your nose, out through your mouth. What happens after you agree?",
    "Client: He... he looks pleased. Pats me on the back like we're friends, like we're not ruining lives. \"I knew I could count on you,\" he says. And then he dismisses me, just like that. Like we were discussing a normal business deal.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's at 90. This is really intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Stay with me. What do you do as you leave his office?",
    "Client: I... I walk out. My legs feel like jelly. The hallway seems longer, darker. I make it back to my office and collapse in my chair. I can't believe what I've just agreed to do. I feel like I'm going to be sick.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I reach for my phone. I want to call someone, anyone. But who? Who can I tell about this? Who would understand? I feel so alone, so trapped.",
    "Therapist: That must have been a terrifying moment. What do you do?",
    "Client: I end up just sitting there, staring at my phone. Hours pass. The office gets darker. I can't move, can't think. I just keep replaying the conversation in my head, over and over.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still at 90. My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take another deep breath. What happens as the night goes on?",
    "Client: Eventually, I... I force myself to stand up. My body aches from sitting so long. I gather my things, move like a zombie. As I'm leaving, I see the cleaning staff coming in. They smile at me, say goodnight. I wonder if they know, if they can see the guilt written all over me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. How do you feel?",
    "Client: Exposed. Vulnerable. Like everyone can see right through me, see the monster I've become. I hurry out of the building, into the night air.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level as you leave?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to 80. The fresh air helps a little.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens when you get home?",
    "Client: I... I fumble with my keys, nearly drop them. Inside, my apartment feels alien, like it belongs to someone else. Someone better than me. I head straight for the shower, turn the water as hot as I can stand.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that sensation. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm trying to wash it all away. The guilt, the shame, his touch on my shoulder. But it doesn't work. I can still feel it all, no matter how hard I scrub.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens after your shower?",
    "Client: I can't sleep. I pace my apartment, thinking about what I've agreed to do. I consider running, just packing a bag and disappearing. But where would I go? He'd find me. He always does.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's at 75. I'm exhausted, but the fear and guilt are still there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: Okay... *deep breath* I'm... I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. Slowly open your eyes. You're safe here in my office.",
    "Client: *opens eyes* That... that was intense.",
    "Therapist: You did very well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. But also... I don't know. Maybe a little lighter? Like I've let some of it out.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after these sessions. Your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 50, I think. Still there, but not as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. Remember, you're not that person anymore. You've taken brave steps to change.",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, I have. It's still hard to believe sometimes.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. We'll continue to work through this. For now, let's do some grounding exercises before you leave.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you... for helping me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. You did the hard work. I'm here to support you."
