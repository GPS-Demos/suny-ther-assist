    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like my body is still there, you know? I can still feel the ground trembling beneath my feet, and hear the creaking of the building. It's so vivid, even though it happened years ago.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What physical sensations are you noticing right now?",
    "Client: My hands are clammy, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's like I can't take a full breath. And my heart... it's racing. I keep expecting another aftershock, even though I know I'm safe here.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. How I froze when the shaking started. I should have known what to do, but I just... couldn't move. And then I think about my colleagues, how some of them got hurt because they panicked. I feel guilty, like I should have done more to help them.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a heavy weight on my shoulders. And there's this knot in my stomach. It's making me feel nauseous. I know logically that I couldn't have done anything differently, but emotionally... it's hard to shake off that responsibility.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm surprised by how angry I feel. Not just at the situation, but at myself. I've always prided myself on being level-headed, you know? But in that moment, I was useless. And now, even years later, I still feel on edge at work. Every little sound or vibration makes me tense up. It's affecting my performance, my relationships with colleagues... everything.",
    "Therapist: How does talking about this now compare to the actual experience?",
    "Client: It's... it's different. When I'm actually reliving it, it's like I'm there again. But talking about it now, it's like I can see it from the outside. I can recognize that my reactions were normal, even if they weren't what I expected of myself. But it's still hard. There's still this... this shame, I guess. Like I should be over it by now.",
    "Therapist: What do you think that shame is telling you?",
    "Client: I... I think it's telling me that I'm weak. That I should be stronger, more resilient. But at the same time, I know that's not fair. If a friend went through this, I wouldn't judge them like that. It's just... it's harder to extend that same compassion to myself.",
    "Therapist: How might showing yourself that compassion feel?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me thinks it would be a relief. To not be so hard on myself all the time. But another part... it's like I'm afraid if I let go of that self-criticism, I'll be even less prepared if something like that happens again. It's... it's confusing.",
    "Therapist: What does that confusion feel like?",
    "Client: It's... it's like being pulled in two directions. My logical brain knows that being kind to myself is probably healthier, but emotionally... it's scary. It's like I've been holding onto this tension for so long, I'm not sure who I'd be without it. And that uncertainty... it's unsettling.",
    "Therapist: How does this relate to your broader experience of the trauma?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's all connected to this loss of control. The earthquake took away my sense of safety, my belief that I could handle anything. And now, even though I'm trying to heal, there's this fear that if I let my guard down, something else will blindside me. It's exhausting, but it feels safer than being vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to allow yourself to be vulnerable?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. I guess it would mean accepting that I can't control everything. That sometimes, things will happen that I'm not prepared for, and that's... that's okay. It's a scary thought, but... maybe it's also freeing? To not have to be on high alert all the time. To trust that even if something happens, I'll find a way through it.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea sit with you right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's both terrifying and tempting. Like standing on the edge of a cliff, knowing there's water below but not being sure how deep it is. Part of me wants to take that leap, to see what it would be like to live without this constant fear and self-doubt. But another part... it's clinging to the familiar, even if the familiar is painful. It's... it's a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to sit with this for a while. To let myself feel these conflicting emotions without trying to resolve them immediately. And maybe... maybe I need to practice being a little kinder to myself. Even if it's just in small ways. It's not going to change overnight, but... I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good place to pause. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained, but in a good way? Like I've released something that's been bottled up for a long time. There's still a lot to work through, but I feel... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like maybe there's a path forward, even if I can't see the whole thing yet. It's... it's a start.",
