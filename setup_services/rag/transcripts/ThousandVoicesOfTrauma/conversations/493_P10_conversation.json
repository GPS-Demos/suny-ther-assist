    "Therapist: Welcome, Margaret. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Oh, hello Dr. Thompson. I... I'm feeling a bit uneasy, to be honest. My arthritis is acting up today, and I'm not sure I'm ready to talk about... well, you know.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's start slowly. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Yes, yes, of course. It's just... even after all this time, it still feels so raw.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Shall we begin? On a scale of 0-100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: I'd say... about a 40. My heart's already beating a bit faster.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes when you're ready, and describe that night.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Alright... It's... it's a chilly autumn evening. Robert and I are watching the news after dinner. The house is quiet, just the ticking of the grandfather clock in the hall. I'm... I'm feeling drowsy, thinking about heading to bed soon.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: There's... there's a sudden crash from the kitchen. I jolt awake, my heart pounding. Robert looks at me, his face pale. \"What was that?\" I whisper. He... he puts a finger to his lips and slowly stands up.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, Margaret?",
    "Client: Terrified. My hands are shaking, just like they did that night. I can feel the cold sweat on my palms.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 60 now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *inhales shakily* Robert creeps towards the kitchen. I want to tell him to stop, to call the police, but I'm frozen. Then... then I hear it. Hushed voices, the sound of drawers being opened. Oh God, there's someone in our house!",
    "Therapist: Stay with it, Margaret. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Robert turns back to me, his eyes wide with fear. He mouths \"Call 911\" and points to the phone. But as I reach for it, there's another crash, louder this time. And then... and then...",
    "Therapist: Take a moment, Margaret. Breathe with me. In... and out.",
    "Client: *follows breathing exercise* Thank you. I... I can continue.",
    "Therapist: What's happening now?",
    "Client: Two men burst into the living room. They're wearing dark clothes, masks. One of them has a crowbar. I... I scream, I can't help it. Robert tries to block them, but he's 78, he's no match. The man with the crowbar shoves him aside, and Robert falls, hitting his head on the coffee table.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling seeing this?",
    "Client: Helpless. Terrified. I want to run to Robert, but I can't move. My legs won't work.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 80 now. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. This is just a memory. Keep going when you're ready.",
    "Client: The other man, he grabs me. His hands are rough, and he smells of cigarettes. He demands to know where we keep our valuables. I can barely speak, I'm shaking so hard. I point towards the bedroom, hoping they'll just take what they want and leave.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Margaret. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: They drag me to the bedroom. I can hear Robert groaning in the living room. I'm praying he's okay, that he can call for help. The men are tearing through our drawers, our closet. They find my jewelry box, the one Robert gave me for our 50th anniversary. I... I start to cry.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel at this moment?",
    "Client: Like ice. I'm cold all over, but my face is burning. My heart is pounding so hard I think it might burst.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What happens next?",
    "Client: They... they start arguing over something. I can't understand what they're saying, but one of them sounds angry. He raises the crowbar, and for a moment, I think... I think he's going to hit me. But then we hear sirens in the distance. They panic. The one with the crowbar grabs my arm, hard enough to bruise, and hisses, \"If you tell anyone about us, we'll come back.\" And then... they're gone.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Margaret. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still around 80. I can still feel his grip on my arm.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe now. This is just a memory. What do you do after they leave?",
    "Client: I... I stumble back to the living room. Robert is trying to sit up, there's blood on his forehead. I help him to the couch and grab the phone. My hands are shaking so badly I can barely dial 911. I keep looking at the door, terrified they'll come back.",
    "Therapist: How long does it take for help to arrive?",
    "Client: It feels like hours, but it's probably only minutes. I hear the police cars pull up, see the flashing lights through the window. When the officers come in, I just... I just break down. I can't stop crying.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction, Margaret. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. Exhausted. But... also a little relieved? Like... like I've let something out that I've been holding in for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's good. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down to about 60 now.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today, Margaret. How about we start winding down?",
    "Client: Yes, I think... I think that would be good. It's still so vivid, you know? The fear, the helplessness. But talking about it... it helps, somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's the goal. Can you tell me three things you see in this room right now?",
    "Client: I see... the painting on your wall, the plant in the corner, and the box of tissues on the table.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, two things you hear?",
    "Client: I hear the clock ticking and... and the sound of traffic outside.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Lastly, one thing you can feel?",
    "Client: I can feel the softness of this chair cushion.",
    "Therapist: Very good. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Better. Calmer. My heart's not racing anymore.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 30, I'd say.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Margaret. How do you feel about today's session?",
    "Client: It was... difficult. But I feel like I've accomplished something. Like I'm starting to take back control, if that makes sense?",
    "Therapist: It absolutely does. You've shown incredible strength today.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Thompson. I... I appreciate your guidance through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Margaret. Remember, you're not alone in this journey. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. I'm feeling quite tired now.",
    "Therapist: That's normal after such an intense session. Take care of yourself for the rest of the day. We'll continue next week.",
    "Client: Alright. Thank you again, Doctor. I'll see you next week.",
    "Therapist: Take care, Margaret. Goodbye."
