    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the airplane crash?",
    "Client: It was a sunny day. We were on vacation, heading to Fiji. The takeoff seemed normal, but then... (voice trembles) I felt the plane shaking. People started screaming. I... I don't know if I can do this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (inhales deeply) Okay... The oxygen masks dropped. I fumbled with mine, my hands shaking. The plane was tilting, and luggage was falling from the overhead compartments. I could hear the engines making a horrible screeching noise.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happened next?",
    "Client: We started descending rapidly. My stomach lurched. I... I thought I was going to die. (starts crying) I saw the ocean getting closer through the window. People were praying, crying... I closed my eyes and gripped the armrests so hard my knuckles turned white.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel emotional. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: (wiping tears) The impact was... it was like nothing I've ever felt before. A deafening crash, then water started pouring in. I was disoriented, but somehow I managed to unbuckle my seatbelt. The plane was filling with water so fast...",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: I remember gasping for air as I tried to swim out. The current from the sinking plane was pulling me down. I thought my lungs would burst. Somehow, I made it to the surface. The sun was so bright, and there was debris everywhere. I could hear people screaming for help.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an incredible job. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I... I feel shaky. My heart's racing. It's like I'm back there again.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: (nods) I grabbed onto a floating piece of the plane. The waves were so big, I kept getting pushed under. I was terrified of sharks. I could see other survivors, but they seemed so far away. The salt water burned my eyes and throat.",
    "Therapist: You're very courageous. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I don't know how long I was in the water. It felt like hours. My arms and legs were so tired from treading water. I kept thinking about my family, wondering if I'd ever see them again. Then... I heard the sound of helicopters. I've never felt such relief in my life.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained, but also... lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been holding onto for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. You've done excellent work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It's still hard, but... I feel like I'm making progress.",
    "Therapist: You absolutely are. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we end?",
    "Client: I think... I think that's enough for today. I'm exhausted, but I'm proud of myself for getting through it.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. We'll end here for today. Well done."
