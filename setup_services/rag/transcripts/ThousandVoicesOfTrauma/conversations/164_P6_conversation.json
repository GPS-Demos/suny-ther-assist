    "Therapist: Welcome, Priya. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your current SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10. My heart's beating a little faster than usual.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day of the airplane crash. Describe what you see.",
    "Client: I'm... I'm at the airport. It's crowded, noisy. I can smell coffee from the nearby cafe. My family and I are waiting to board our flight to Mumbai for a wedding. The kids are excited, but I'm feeling uneasy.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue.",
    "Client: We're on the plane now. It's hot and stuffy. The engines are so loud. I'm gripping the armrests tightly. My palms are sweaty. Oh god, the plane is shaking. It's... it's not normal turbulence.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 7. My heart is racing. I can feel my chest tightening.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: There's panic all around. People are screaming. The oxygen masks have dropped. I'm fumbling with mine, trying to help my children. The plane is diving. I can't breathe. I'm terrified.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with the memory. What's happening now?",
    "Client: We're... we're crashing. The impact is deafening. Metal screeching, glass shattering. I'm thrown forward. Pain... everywhere. I can smell fuel. Smoke is filling the cabin. I can't see my family. I'm calling for them, but I can't hear their voices.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's a 9. I feel like I'm right back there. My hands are shaking. I can barely catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're here with me. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I... I know. It just feels so real. I'm crawling through the wreckage. There's blood, so much blood. I find my daughter, but she's not moving. I'm screaming for help, but everything is chaos. The heat from the fires is intense. I can hear distant sirens.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Overwhelmed. Guilty. Why did I survive when others didn't? My SUDS is still at 9. My chest feels so tight.",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. You're processing a traumatic event. Keep going.",
    "Client: Rescue workers are here now. They're pulling me away from my family. I'm fighting them, trying to stay. But I'm so weak. Everything goes dark. I... I wake up in the hospital. The doctor's face tells me everything before he even speaks. I've lost them all.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. I feel drained, but the tightness in my chest is easing a bit.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling about the memory now?",
    "Client: It's still painful, but... I feel like I faced it. It didn't overwhelm me completely this time.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm focusing on my breathing. The room is coming back into focus. I can feel the chair beneath me.",
    "Therapist: Good. And your current SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5 now. I feel exhausted, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger?",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've done difficult work today. How do you feel about our session?",
    "Client: It was tough, but I think it helped. I didn't think I could face those memories without falling apart.",
    "Therapist: You showed great courage. We'll end here for today. Remember to use your coping strategies.",
    "Client: Thank you. I will. I'm looking forward to a cup of chai when I get home. It always helps me feel grounded.",
    "Therapist: That's a wonderful idea. Take care, Priya. I'll see you next week."
