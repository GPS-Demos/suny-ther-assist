    "Therapist: Welcome, Mei. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about today's session. We're going to talk about my divorce, right?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's right. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. It's just... it brings up a lot of emotions.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay. Well, it was about two years ago. I remember the day clearly. I came home from work, and Tom was sitting at the kitchen table. He looked... different. Cold. He said, \"Mei, we need to talk.\" My heart just sank. I knew something was terribly wrong.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: He told me he'd been unhappy for a long time. That he'd met someone else. I felt like the floor was falling away beneath me. I couldn't breathe. All I could think was, \"This can't be happening. Not again.\" It brought back all those feelings of abandonment from my childhood.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I felt so small. So worthless. Just like when my father left. I started crying, begging Tom not to leave me. I was on my knees, clutching at his shirt. God, it's humiliating to remember that.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're very brave for sharing.",
    "Client: I just kept thinking, \"What's wrong with me? Why does everyone leave me?\" I couldn't stop sobbing. Tom just stood there, looking uncomfortable. He tried to pat my shoulder, but I flinched away. I couldn't bear him touching me.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I ran to the bathroom and locked myself in. I could hear Tom calling my name, but I couldn't face him. I sat on the floor, hugging my knees, rocking back and forth. I felt like I was that little girl again, hiding in the closet while my parents fought.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Mei. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: I... I started thinking about the bottle of sleeping pills in the medicine cabinet. I thought, \"If I take all of these, the pain will stop.\" I even reached for them, but then I remembered my promise to my therapist. I'd promised I wouldn't hurt myself again.",
    "Therapist: I'm proud of you for remembering that promise.",
    "Client: I sat there for hours, just crying and shaking. When I finally came out, Tom was gone. He'd left a note saying he'd stay at a hotel. The house felt so empty, so cold. I crawled into bed and just... shut down. I didn't go to work for a week. I barely ate or slept. It was like I was underwater, everything muffled and distant.",
    "Therapist: You're very strong for getting through that. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... hard. My chest feels tight. I can feel that despair creeping back in. But... I'm here. I'm talking about it. That's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're showing incredible resilience.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still painful, but... I think I'm starting to see that it wasn't my fault. Tom's choices were about him, not me. It doesn't make the pain go away, but it helps a little.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Well done, Mei.",
    "Client: I just... I wish I could stop connecting it to my childhood. Every rejection feels like my father leaving all over again. Will that ever stop?",
    "Therapist: With time and work, it can improve. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I hope so. It's exhausting, carrying all this around. But talking about it... it does help. Even if it hurts in the moment.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Shall we take a break?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think I need a moment to collect myself. This was... intense. But thank you for guiding me through it.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Mei. Take all the time you need."
