    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. It's not easy to talk about this stuff.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to help you process these experiences. Let's start with your SUDS level.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say it's about a 5 right now. Just thinking about it makes my stomach feel a bit tight.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Let's begin. Close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm in the school cafeteria. It's lunchtime, and the room is buzzing with noise. I can smell the greasy pizza and hear the clattering of trays. I'm sitting alone at a table near the corner, trying to make myself invisible.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I see Marco and his friends enter. They're laughing and shoving each other playfully. My heart starts racing because I know they might notice me. I try to focus on my food, but my hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's going up. Maybe a 7? I can feel my palms getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Marco spots me and nudges his friends. They start walking towards my table. I want to disappear, to melt into the floor. But I'm frozen in place. Marco leans over the table, grinning. \"Hey, loser,\" he says. \"Eating alone again? What a surprise.\"",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel right now?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, like I can't breathe properly. My face is hot with embarrassment. I... I want to run away, but I can't move.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: One of Marco's friends grabs my backpack and starts rifling through it. I try to protest, but my voice comes out weak and shaky. \"P-please don't,\" I stammer. They laugh at me, mocking my voice.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe even a 9. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Carlos. Take a deep breath. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... Marco dumps my lunch tray onto the floor. The clatter makes everyone in the cafeteria turn to look. I feel so humiliated. Tears are welling up in my eyes, but I'm trying desperately not to cry. I don't want to give them the satisfaction.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My stomach is in knots. I feel nauseous, like I might throw up. My shoulders are hunched, and I'm trying to make myself as small as possible.",
    "Therapist: Stay present with those sensations. What happens next?",
    "Client: Marco leans in close and whispers, \"No wonder your girlfriend dumped you. Who'd want to be with such a pathetic loser?\" That... that really hits hard. My recent breakup was already painful, and now he's using it against me.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind at this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking maybe he's right. Maybe I am pathetic. Maybe that's why she left me. I feel so alone and worthless. It's like a weight crushing down on me.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's definitely a 9 now. I can feel tears starting to spill over.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Carlos. Remember, you're safe here. Continue.",
    "Client: A teacher finally notices and starts walking over. Marco and his friends quickly scatter, but not before Marco hisses, \"This isn't over, freak.\" I'm left there, food scattered on the floor, trying to hold back sobs. Everyone's staring at me, whispering. I've never felt so alone and exposed.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Embarrassed. Angry. But also... relieved that it's over? My heart is still racing, though.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's ground ourselves. Can you name five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: Uh, yeah. I see... the plant in the corner, your desk, the bookshelf, the clock on the wall, and the tissue box.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, what's your current SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's coming down. Maybe a 6 now?",
    "Therapist: That's progress. Let's continue. What happened after the incident?",
    "Client: I... I gathered my things and left the cafeteria. I went to the bathroom and locked myself in a stall. I sat there for the rest of lunch period, trying to stop crying. I felt so weak and helpless.",
    "Therapist: How does recalling that make you feel now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still painful. But maybe not as intense? I don't know. I just remember feeling so alone.",
    "Therapist: You're not alone now. We're working through this together. What happened next?",
    "Client: The bell rang, and I had to go to class. I splashed water on my face, trying to hide that I'd been crying. But when I got to class, I could feel everyone staring at me. They all knew what had happened.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's hovering around a 7. My face feels hot again, remembering their stares.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I couldn't focus in class. My mind kept replaying what Marco had said about my ex-girlfriend. I started wondering if she'd heard about what happened. If she was laughing at me too. It made the breakup feel fresh all over again.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you recall this?",
    "Client: My shoulders are tense. I notice I'm clenching my fists. There's this knot in my throat, like I'm holding back tears again.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Let's continue.",
    "Client: After school, I couldn't face taking the bus home. I walked instead, even though it took over an hour. I kept looking over my shoulder, afraid Marco and his friends might show up. When I finally got home, I locked myself in my room and didn't come out for dinner. My mom kept asking if I was okay, but I couldn't tell her. I felt so ashamed.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about a 5, I think. Talking about it... it's hard, but it also feels like I'm letting something go.",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. How do you feel about your younger self in this memory?",
    "Client: I... I feel sorry for him. He was so scared and alone. But I also wish he'd stood up for himself more. I don't know. It's complicated.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid feelings. Let's continue. What happened in the following days?",
    "Client: I started avoiding the cafeteria. I'd eat lunch in the library or an empty classroom. I was constantly on edge, watching for Marco and his friends. My grades started slipping because I couldn't concentrate. And I... I started having nightmares about the incident.",
    "Therapist: How does recalling this period make you feel now?",
    "Client: It's... it's sad. I lost a lot of time to fear. But I also feel a bit angry. Angry at Marco, but also at myself for letting it affect me so much.",
    "Therapist: That anger is understandable. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's around a 4 now. Talking about it... it's like the memory is losing some of its power over me.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress, Carlos. How do you feel overall now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also a bit lighter? Like I've been carrying this weight for so long, and now I'm starting to put it down. It's still there, but it's not crushing me anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a great insight. Let's take a moment to breathe deeply together.",
    "Client: *takes a deep breath* Yeah, that helps. I... I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without falling apart.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength today. How would you like to close our session?",
    "Client: Can we just sit quietly for a minute? I need some time to process everything we've talked about.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take that time now.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for your courage today, Carlos. How are you feeling as we end our session?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... okay. Tired, but okay. Maybe even a little hopeful? I didn't think I could face these memories, but I did. That means something, right?",
    "Therapist: It absolutely does. You've taken a significant step in your healing journey today. We'll continue to work through this in our future sessions. Remember to be kind to yourself this week.",
    "Client: I'll try. Thank you... for listening and for helping me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Carlos. I'll see you next week."
