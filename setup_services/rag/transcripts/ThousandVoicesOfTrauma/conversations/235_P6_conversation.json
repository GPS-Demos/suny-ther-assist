    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Singh. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Let's start with your SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10 right now. My heart's beating a bit faster than usual.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath and begin when you're ready.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm eight years old again. It's a hot summer day, and I'm playing in the courtyard of our family home in Delhi. Suddenly, I hear shouting and see men in uniforms bursting through the gate. They're yelling something about my father... I'm confused and scared.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My palms are getting sweaty. The fear is creeping in, just like it did back then. Maybe a 6 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The men are grabbing my father. My mother is screaming, begging them to stop. I'm frozen in place, watching helplessly as they drag him away. The neighbors are all peering out their windows, whispering. I feel so ashamed, so exposed...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Probably an 8. My chest feels tight, and I'm having trouble breathing.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: (deep breath) Okay... They push my father into a van. I run after them, crying, pleading. But they drive away, leaving me in a cloud of dust. I can still taste it in my mouth, that bitter, gritty taste of helplessness.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking. I feel nauseous, like I might be sick. The memory is so vivid... it's like I'm there again.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I haven't felt this overwhelmed in years.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it if you can.",
    "Client: I... I remember the silence afterward. The house felt so empty. Days turned into weeks, and still no word from my father. I'd sit by the window for hours, hoping to see him walk up the street. But he never did.",
    "Therapist: And now?",
    "Client: The sadness is crushing. I feel like that little boy again, lost and alone. But... the intensity is starting to fade a bit. Maybe back down to a 7.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Keep going.",
    "Client: Months passed. We finally got word that my father was in prison. No trial, no explanation. Just gone. I had to grow up so fast after that. I became the man of the house at eight years old.",

    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to a 4 again. I feel drained, but... lighter somehow.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. How about we start winding down?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end."
