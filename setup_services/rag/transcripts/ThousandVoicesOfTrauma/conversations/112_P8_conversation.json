    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart is still racing, and I feel a bit shaky. The memories were so vivid, you know? It's like I was right back there, watching it all happen again.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: I can still hear the shouting, the sound of glass breaking. I remember feeling so helpless, so scared. I wanted to do something, to stop it, but I couldn't move. I was frozen.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you noticing?",
    "Client: My hands are clammy, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's hard to breathe normally. I feel... I feel like I need to be on high alert, you know? Like I can't relax because something bad might happen at any moment.",
    "Therapist: How does that relate to your everyday experiences?",
    "Client: I guess... I guess I'm always on edge, even when I'm not thinking about what happened. It's exhausting. I'm constantly scanning for danger, even in safe places. It's like I can never fully let my guard down.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... what if I had done something? What if I had tried to stop it? Maybe things would be different now. And then I feel guilty for not doing more, even though I know I was just a kid. It's confusing and frustrating.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts affect you?",
    "Client: They... they make me feel powerless. Like I'm still that scared little girl watching everything fall apart. But there's also anger. I'm angry at the people who were supposed to protect me, angry at myself for not being able to forget it all.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to curl up and hide, to make all these feelings go away. But another part knows that's not the answer. I guess... I guess I need to feel safe. To know that it's okay to feel all of this without being overwhelmed by it.",
    "Therapist: How can we work towards that?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe by talking about it more? It's hard, and it hurts, but keeping it all inside isn't helping either. I want to learn how to process these memories without feeling like I'm reliving them every time.",
    "Therapist: That's a great insight. What else?",
    "Client: I think I need to work on self-compassion too. I'm so hard on myself for how I react to these memories. I keep telling myself I should be \"over it\" by now, but that's not fair, is it? This isn't something you just get over.",
    "Therapist: How does recognizing that make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a relief, actually. Like I'm giving myself permission to heal at my own pace. But it's also scary. If I accept that this is a long process, it means I have to face these feelings and memories head-on. That's daunting.",
    "Therapist: What gives you strength in this process?",
    "Client: I guess... knowing that I've survived this far. That despite everything, I'm still here, still trying. And... and the support I have now. My partner, my friends, this therapy. It makes me feel less alone in all of this.",
    "Therapist: How can you nurture that strength?",
    "Client: I think... I need to be more open with the people I trust. To let them in when I'm struggling instead of trying to handle everything on my own. And maybe... maybe I need to start acknowledging my progress, even the small steps.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive approach. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired, but in a different way. It's like I've let go of something heavy I've been carrying. I still feel shaky, but there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe hope? Like maybe I can actually work through this.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to explore more ways to ground myself when the memories become overwhelming. And maybe we could talk about how to communicate better with my partner about all of this? Sometimes I struggle to explain what I'm going through.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent goals. Is there anything else you'd like to add?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm finally starting to understand myself better. It's scary, but also... kind of empowering?",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength today. How would you like to close our session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to take a few deep breaths together. To help me transition back to the present, you know? And maybe remind myself that I'm safe now, that I've got support. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's do that together."
