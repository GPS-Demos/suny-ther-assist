    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling pretty shaken up, to be honest. It's like I was right back there, you know? My heart's still racing a bit, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's hard to shake off the images, the sounds... everything felt so real again.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how vulnerable I felt during the home invasion. It's like... all the security I thought I had just vanished in an instant. I'm remembering how I froze when I heard the glass break downstairs. I couldn't move, couldn't breathe. I feel so ashamed that I didn't do more to protect my family.",
    "Therapist: And how does that shame feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a heavy weight on my shoulders. My stomach feels knotted up. I can feel my jaw clenching. It's this mix of anger at myself and fear that it could happen again. I know logically that I did what I could, but emotionally... it's hard to shake off this feeling that I failed.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm noticing how different this feels from my combat experiences. In war, I felt prepared, trained. But in my own home? I was caught completely off guard. It's bringing up a lot of confusion... like, how do I reconcile these two parts of myself? The soldier who could face danger, and the homeowner who felt paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: How does that confusion manifest for you?",
    "Client: It's... it's like an internal struggle. Part of me wants to be constantly vigilant, to fortify our home, to be ready for anything. But another part of me is exhausted by that hypervigilance. I want to feel safe in my own home again, to relax with my family without constantly scanning for threats. It's mentally draining, you know?",
    "Therapist: What else comes up as you reflect on this?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much this has affected my relationship with my wife and kids. I've been so focused on keeping them safe that I've become distant. I'm not as present with them as I used to be. There's this constant undercurrent of anxiety that's hard to shake off. I miss the easy-going dad and husband I used to be.",
    "Therapist: How does recognizing that impact make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's painful. I feel a deep sadness, like I've lost a part of myself. But there's also a glimmer of hope. Talking about it like this, I can see more clearly how the trauma has affected me. It makes me want to work harder to reclaim those parts of myself, to be more present for my family.",
    "Therapist: What's that hope telling you?",
    "Client: It's telling me that maybe I can find a balance. That I can be aware and protective without letting fear control every aspect of our lives. I want to use the strength I found in combat to face this fear head-on, to work through it instead of letting it dictate how I live. I want to show my kids that it's okay to be vulnerable, to face your fears and grow from them.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea sit with you right now?",
    "Client: It feels... empowering, actually. Like I'm taking back some control. I've been so focused on the physical aspects of safety, but maybe the real work is internal. Learning to feel safe again, to trust in my ability to handle whatever comes our way. It's scary, but also exciting to think about moving forward like that.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you noticing as you consider this?",
    "Client: I can feel some of the tension in my shoulders easing up. My breathing feels a bit deeper, more relaxed. There's still some nervousness in my stomach, but it's not as overwhelming as before. It's like... a mix of anticipation and determination.",
    "Therapist: How does this compare to how you felt at the start of our session?",
    "Client: It's... it's quite different, actually. I came in feeling heavy, burdened by the memory. Now, even though it's still painful to think about, I feel like I have a bit more perspective. The fear is still there, but it doesn't feel as all-consuming. I feel more... I don't know, grounded maybe? Like I can start to see a path forward.",
    "Therapist: What do you think has contributed to this shift?",
    "Client: I think... talking through it, really allowing myself to feel those emotions instead of pushing them away. It's like, by facing the memory head-on, I'm starting to see it for what it is - a terrible event that happened, but one that doesn't have to define my entire life. And hearing myself talk about wanting to be there for my family, it reminds me of what's really important.",
    "Therapist: How might you carry this forward?",
    "Client: I think... I want to try to be more open with my family about what I'm going through. Maybe if I share some of this with them, it'll help bridge that distance I've been feeling. And I want to work on finding that balance between being aware and being present. Maybe start with small steps, like having a family game night where I really focus on just enjoying the moment with them.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful plan. How are you feeling as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... cautiously optimistic, I guess. It's still overwhelming to think about everything, but I feel like I have a bit more clarity now. There's still a lot of work to do, but for the first time in a while, I feel like it might actually be possible to move forward. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue next session."
