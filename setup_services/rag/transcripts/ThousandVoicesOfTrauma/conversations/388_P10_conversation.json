    "Therapist: Welcome, James. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a part of me that wants to dive in, but another part that's... hesitant, I guess. It's a mix of emotions.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start slowly. Can you close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day?",
    "Client: Okay... (takes a deep breath) I'm there. It's early morning, and I'm at the airport. The air feels cool and crisp. I'm waiting for my sister's flight to arrive from her volunteer work overseas.",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: There are people everywhere, rushing with luggage. The smell of coffee from a nearby caf\u00e9. I'm standing near the arrivals board, checking her flight number again and again.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: Excited, but there's this... knot in my stomach. Something doesn't feel right. I keep telling myself I'm being paranoid, but...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: The board updates. Her flight's landed. I move closer to the gate, scanning faces in the crowd. Minutes pass... then an hour. No sign of her. My phone buzzes \u2013 it's a message from an unknown number.",
    "Therapist: What does the message say?",
    "Client: (voice trembling) \"We have your sister. Don't contact authorities.\" I... I feel like I can't breathe. The world's spinning. I stumble to a chair, trying to process...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, James. You're safe here. What's your distress level right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. Maybe an 8 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Let's ground ourselves. Feel your feet on the floor. Now, continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (after a pause) I'm sitting there, staring at my phone. My hands are shaking so badly I can barely hold it. I try calling her number, but it goes straight to voicemail. I feel so helpless, so scared for her.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I don't know what to do. Part of me wants to scream for help, but I'm terrified of what might happen to her if I do. I force myself to stand up, legs weak, and make my way to the airport police station.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling physically at this point?",
    "Client: My heart's racing. I feel nauseous, lightheaded. It's like I'm moving through a fog. Everything seems surreal.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What happens at the police station?",
    "Client: I... I tell them everything. Show them the message. They look concerned, start making calls. I'm answering questions, but it all feels mechanical. Inside, I'm screaming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, James. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe a 7.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take another deep breath. Remember, you're here with me, safe in this room.",
    "Client: (nods) The next few hours are a blur. More police, then federal agents. They're asking about her work, her contacts. I realize how little I actually know. I feel... I feel like I've failed her somehow.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: That I should have known something was wrong. That I should have warned her, protected her somehow. God, what if I never see her again? What if they're hurting her right now?",
    "Therapist: These are normal thoughts, James. Remember, this isn't your fault.",
    "Client: (voice breaking) But it feels like it is. Days pass, and there's no news. I can't eat, can't sleep. Every time my phone rings, my heart stops. I'm living in this constant state of fear and hope.",
    "Therapist: How are you coping during this time?",
    "Client: I... I'm not, really. I'm just existing. I move back home with my parents. We're all just... waiting. The silence is deafening. Every day feels like an eternity.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's lower. Maybe a 5. Talking about it... it's hard, but it helps.",
    "Therapist: That's good, James. You're doing really well. Can you tell me about the day you received news?",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) It was two weeks later. I was sitting on the couch, staring at nothing. The doorbell rang. There were two agents at the door. My mom started crying before they even spoke. I knew...",
    "Therapist: What did they tell you?",
    "Client: They... they found her. In a raid on a trafficking ring. She was alive, but... (voice breaks) she was hurt. Badly. They were taking her to a hospital.",
    "Therapist: How did you feel in that moment?",
    "Client: Relief, overwhelming relief. But also... guilt. Anger. Why her? Why didn't I protect her? And fear... fear of what she'd been through, what it would do to her.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings, James. What happened next?",
    "Client: We rushed to the hospital. Waiting to see her was... excruciating. When we finally did... (pauses, struggling) She looked so small, so fragile. Bruises everywhere. Her eyes... they were different. Haunted.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. My chest feels tight. But I want to continue.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember to breathe. What do you remember about that hospital room?",
    "Client: The beeping of machines. The sterile smell. How tightly she held my hand when she saw me, like she was afraid I'd disappear. She couldn't talk much, but her eyes... they said everything.",
    "Therapist: What did you say to her?",
    "Client: I told her I loved her. That she was safe now. That I was sorry... so sorry. I promised her I'd be there, no matter what. But inside, I felt... broken. Like I'd let her down in the worst possible way.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to remember that promise now?",
    "Client: Bittersweet. I've kept it \u2013 I'm there for her. But it's been... hard. Watching her struggle, seeing how much it's changed her. Sometimes I feel like I lost my sister that day, even though she came back.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization, James. How has this experience affected your life?",
    "Client: It's... it's changed everything. I dropped out of school. Couldn't focus. I have nightmares, panic attacks. I'm always on edge, waiting for the next bad thing to happen. And the guilt... it never really goes away.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with these feelings day to day?",
    "Client: Some days are better than others. I try to focus on her recovery, on being there for her. But it's hard not to get lost in the 'what ifs'. What if I had picked her up myself? What if I had convinced her not to go?",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those thoughts, but remember, you're not responsible for what happened. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around a 4, I think. Talking about it... it hurts, but it also feels like lifting a weight.",
    "Therapist: You're doing very well, James. Can you tell me about a recent moment with your sister that stands out?",
    "Client: Last week, we were watching a movie together. Just a silly comedy. And she laughed \u2013 really laughed. It was the first time I'd heard that sound in months. It felt like... like a tiny piece of her old self shining through.",
    "Therapist: How did that make you feel?",
    "Client: Hopeful. For the first time in a long time, I felt hopeful. Like maybe, someday, we might be okay. Not the same as before, but... okay.",
    "Therapist: That's a beautiful moment to hold onto. As we start to wrap up, how are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Drained, but... lighter, somehow. Like I've released some of the pressure that's been building up inside me.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today, James. This is difficult work, but you're making progress. How would you rate your distress now?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 3. I'm tired, but... I feel like I can breathe a little easier.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. Let's take a few deep breaths together to ground ourselves before we end.",
    "Client: (takes several deep breaths) Thank you. This... this helps. It's hard, but it helps.",
    "Therapist: You're very welcome, James. Remember, healing takes time. We'll continue to work through this together."
