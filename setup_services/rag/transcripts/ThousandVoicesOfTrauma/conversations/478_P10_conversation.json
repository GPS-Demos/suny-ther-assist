    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Lee. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is dreading it. My hands are a bit shaky just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I suppose we should. *deep breath*",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that night. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I'm in my living room. It's late, maybe around 11 PM. I'm watching the news, but I'm dozing off a bit. The room is dim, just the TV light and a small lamp.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: There's a sudden noise. At first, I think it's from the TV, but then I realize it's coming from the back door. My heart starts racing. I... I can hear my pulse in my ears.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Um, about a 40, I'd say.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath and continue.",
    "Client: The noise gets louder. It's a scraping sound, like metal on metal. I stand up, my legs feel weak. I'm thinking, \"This can't be happening. Not here, not to me.\"",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you doing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm frozen. I want to run, but I can't move. Then I hear a crash. Oh god, they're in. They're in my house.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *breathing heavily* I see a shadow. It's big, menacing. I can hear heavy footsteps. My heart is pounding so hard I think it might burst.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 70.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I finally snap out of it. I run to the kitchen, fumbling for my phone. My hands are shaking so much I can barely dial. I hear them in the living room, knocking things over.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. I can't breathe properly. I'm sweating, and my mouth is dry. I feel like I might pass out.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe in deeply.",
    "Client: *takes a deep breath* Okay... I'm hiding behind the kitchen counter. I can hear them talking, but I can't make out the words. It's like my ears are stuffed with cotton.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear the police sirens. They're faint at first, but getting louder. The intruders start cursing. There's a crash - I think they've knocked over my bookshelf.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Terrified, but... also a little hopeful. Help is coming. My distress is maybe 80 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Continue.",
    "Client: The sirens are really close now. I hear the intruders running. The back door slams. I'm still crouched behind the counter, shaking. I can't move.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I feel so helpless. So violated. This is my home, my safe place. And now... now it feels tainted. I'm angry and scared at the same time.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. What happens as the police arrive?",
    "Client: I hear them at the door. They're calling out, asking if anyone's inside. I try to answer, but my voice is so weak. I manage to croak out a response.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel at this point?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted. My muscles ache from being tense for so long. I'm still shaking, but it's different now. More like I'm cold.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's down to about 60 now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going.",
    "Client: The police come in. They help me up. I'm crying now, I can't stop. One officer asks me questions, but I can barely focus. Everything feels surreal, like a bad dream.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. You're safe now.",
    "Client: *deep breath* They check the house. Nothing's stolen, just messed up. They tell me the intruders probably ran when they heard the sirens. I should feel relieved, but I don't.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling instead?",
    "Client: Numb. Shocked. Like this isn't really happening to me. But also... angry. Why me? Why my home?",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. What happens after the police leave?",
    "Client: I... I can't stay there. I call my daughter. She comes to pick me up. I pack a bag with shaking hands. I can't even look at the mess in the living room.",
    "Therapist: How does leaving make you feel?",
    "Client: Guilty. Like I'm abandoning my home. But also relieved. I feel safer the moment I step out of the house.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 50.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Let's continue.",
    "Client: In my daughter's car, I break down. I'm sobbing uncontrollably. She's trying to comfort me, but I can barely hear her. All I can think about is how close it was, how helpless I felt.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking about what could have happened. What if the police hadn't come? What if they had found me? I feel so vulnerable, so... old.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those thoughts. How does your body feel now?",
    "Client: Drained. Completely drained. My eyes burn from crying. My throat is sore. I feel like I've aged ten years in one night.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe now.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* At my daughter's house, I can't sleep. Every noise makes me jump. I keep replaying the night in my head, over and over.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 40 now.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're doing great. What happens in the following days?",
    "Client: I... I don't want to go home. My daughter suggests I stay with her for a while. I feel guilty, like I'm imposing, but I'm too scared to go back.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Ashamed. I'm a grown man, I shouldn't be afraid of my own home. But every time I think about going back, my heart starts racing again.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are normal after such an experience. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I start seeing you. We talk about installing better security. My son-in-law helps me set up cameras and alarms. It helps a little, but I still feel on edge.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about those changes?",
    "Client: Safer, I guess. But also sad. I hate that I need them. I miss feeling secure in my own home.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 30.",
    "Therapist: You're doing very well. Let's continue.",
    "Client: The first night I go back home, I can barely sleep. Every creak, every shadow makes me tense up. I keep checking the locks, over and over.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking about how vulnerable I am. I'm not as strong or quick as I used to be. What if it happens again? What if next time, I'm not so lucky?",
    "Therapist: Those are normal concerns. How do you cope with these thoughts?",
    "Client: I... I try to keep busy. I start volunteering at the community center. Being around people helps. But at night, when I'm alone, the fear comes back.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 25.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How do things change over time?",
    "Client: Slowly... very slowly. I start sleeping better. I don't check the locks as often. But I still get startled easily. Loud noises make me jump.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. How do you feel about your progress?",
    "Client: Frustrated sometimes. I wish I could just snap out of it. But also... proud, I guess. I'm still here. I'm still in my home.",
    "Therapist: That's a great perspective. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 20.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. You've done very well today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Tired. Drained. But... also a bit lighter, if that makes sense. Like I've let go of something heavy.",
    "Therapist: That's a good sign. Remember, healing takes time. You're making progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I needed to hear that.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Let's end here for today. Remember to use your coping techniques if you feel overwhelmed later.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again.",
    "Therapist: Take care, Mr. Lee. I'll see you next week."
