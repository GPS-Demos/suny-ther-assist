    "Therapist: Alright, Sarah, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your current SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10. My stomach feels a bit tight.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and begin describing the accident.",
    "Client: I was driving home from work, it was raining heavily. The windshield wipers were barely keeping up. I remember gripping the steering wheel tightly, leaning forward to see better. Suddenly, there were flashing lights behind me. A police car. My heart started racing...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. My palms are getting sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Keep going. You're doing well.",
    "Client: I pulled over, confused about why I was being stopped. The officer approached, his hand on his holster. I felt a wave of panic. He started yelling at me to get out of the car. I couldn't understand why he was so aggressive. I tried to explain that I hadn't done anything wrong, but he just got angrier...",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. My chest feels tight. I can almost hear his shouting in my ears.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (inhales deeply) He yanked open my car door and dragged me out into the rain. I slipped on the wet road and fell. He didn't help me up, just kept yelling. I was soaked, scared, and humiliated. People were driving by, staring...",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: Still at an 8. My heart's pounding. I feel so helpless remembering this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: He handcuffed me roughly, pushed me against the car. I was crying, begging him to tell me what I'd done wrong. He said I'd run a red light, but I knew that wasn't true. I tried to explain about the rain, how hard it was to see, but he wouldn't listen...",
    "Therapist: Current SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... actually gone down a bit. Maybe a 7 now. I'm feeling more angry than scared at this point.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. Continue.",
    "Client: He put me in the back of the police car. I was shivering, wet, and terrified. We drove to the station in silence. I kept thinking about my husband, how worried he'd be when I didn't come home. At the station, they finally realized it was a case of mistaken identity. The officer didn't even apologize...",
    "Therapist: SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's back up to an 8. I feel so frustrated and powerless. My jaw is clenched just thinking about it.",

    "Client: It's actually coming down. Maybe a 6 now. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger for facing this memory.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How do you feel about stopping here?",
    "Client: I think that would be good. I'm exhausted, but I feel like I've confronted something important.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today, Sarah. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end."
