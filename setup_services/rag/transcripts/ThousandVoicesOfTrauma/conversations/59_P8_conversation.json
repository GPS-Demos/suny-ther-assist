    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart is still racing, and I feel like I can't catch my breath. The memory of that police officer... it's so vivid. I can still hear the sirens, smell the pavement. It's like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: Fear. Intense fear. I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. The officer's face, it was so... cold. Unfeeling. I remember thinking, \"This is it. This is how I die.\" And then... shame. So much shame. Why didn't I fight back? Why couldn't I do something?",
    "Therapist: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot. Can you tell me more about that shame?",
    "Client: It's... it's crushing. I feel like less of a person. Like I should have been stronger, you know? But I just froze. And now, every time I see a police officer, I feel that same paralysis. It's like my body remembers even when I try to forget. And then I think about the abuse from my childhood, and it's just... it's too much. It's all connected, somehow.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel right now as you're talking about this?",
    "Client: Tense. Really tense. My shoulders are up to my ears, and my stomach feels like it's in knots. I've got this pressure in my chest, like someone's sitting on it. And my hands... they're shaking. I can't seem to stop them from shaking.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why me?\" Why did this have to happen to me? And then I feel guilty for even asking that because I know others have it worse. But I can't shake this feeling that I'm... broken. Damaged goods. Like I'll never be normal again. And then I get angry. So angry at the officer, at the world, at myself for not being able to just... move on.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have these feelings. How does the anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: Hot. It's like this burning sensation in my gut. My jaw is clenched so tight it hurts. I want to scream, to hit something. But then... then I feel scared of my own anger. What if I lose control? What if I become like them? The ones who hurt me?",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to process. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Part of me wants to curl up and disappear. Another part wants to run, just keep running and never look back. But there's also this tiny voice inside that's saying, \"You're here. You're talking about it. That's something.\" I guess... I guess I need to know that it's okay to feel all of this. That I'm not crazy for still being affected by it.",
    "Therapist: It's absolutely okay. How does it feel to acknowledge that?",
    "Client: It's... oddly relieving. Like a weight has been lifted, even if it's just a small one. I've been holding onto this for so long, trying to be \"normal,\" you know? But maybe... maybe this is part of the process. Feeling all of this, talking about it. It's terrifying, but also... I don't know. Maybe necessary?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm noticing that as I talk, my breathing is getting a bit easier. The shaking in my hands is less intense. I still feel on edge, but it's like... like I'm starting to come back to the present. The memory is still there, but it's not as overwhelming. Is that... is that progress?",
    "Therapist: What do you think?",
    "Client: I... I think it might be. It's small, but it's something, right? I mean, a few weeks ago, I couldn't even think about that night without having a full-blown panic attack. And now, it's still awful, but I'm here. I'm talking about it. That has to count for something. It's just... it's hard to believe that things can get better when they've been bad for so long.",
    "Therapist: How does that possibility make you feel?",
    "Client: Hopeful, I guess. But also scared. What if I'm getting my hopes up for nothing? What if I put in all this work and I'm still... broken? But then again, the fact that I can even consider the possibility of getting better... that's new. It's like a tiny light at the end of a very long, very dark tunnel. I want to believe in it, but it's hard.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have mixed feelings. What would it mean to you if things did get better?",
    "Client: It would mean... everything. To be able to walk down the street without constantly looking over my shoulder. To see a police officer and not immediately panic. To be in a relationship without fearing intimacy because of my past abuse. It would mean freedom. But it also feels so far away, you know? Like trying to climb a mountain when I can barely walk.",
    "Therapist: Small steps are still progress. What's one small thing you can do today?",
    "Client: I... I guess just being here, talking about this, that's something. Maybe... maybe I could try that grounding technique you taught me when I start to feel overwhelmed. And perhaps... perhaps I could try to be a little kinder to myself. Not beat myself up so much for having these feelings. It's not much, but it's a start, right?",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent start. How do you feel about that plan?",
    "Client: It's... it's both scary and exciting. Like I'm standing on the edge of something big. I'm terrified of falling, but also... maybe a little excited about the possibility of flying? I don't know if that makes sense. It's just... for the first time in a long time, I feel like maybe, just maybe, there's hope. And that's... that's something worth holding onto.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. We're out of time, but let's continue next session.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you. I... I think I needed this today. It's hard, but... I'm glad I came. See you next week."
