    "Therapist: Welcome back, Mr. Johnson. Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: I'm... not sure, to be honest. I've been thinking about it since our last session, and I'm a bit nervous. Can you explain more about what we'll be doing?",
    "Therapist: Of course. It's natural to feel nervous. Imaginal exposure involves revisiting your trauma memory in a safe environment. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about reliving those moments. I've spent years trying to forget what I saw as a child. The violence... it's not something I want to remember. Will this make things worse?",
    "Therapist: I understand your concern. The goal isn't to retraumatize you, but to process the memory. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It sounds... challenging. But I trust you, doc. I've been struggling with this for so long, and nothing else has worked. I guess I'm willing to try if you think it'll help. Can you tell me more about what to expect?",
    "Therapist: Certainly. We'll go at your pace, and you can pause anytime. What's your biggest worry?",
    "Client: I'm afraid I might lose control. You know, with my history of substance use, I've always used that to numb these memories. What if I can't handle it sober?",
    "Therapist: Your concern is valid. We have strategies in place to help you stay grounded. How does that reassure you?",
    "Client: It helps a little. I appreciate that you're prepared. I just... I've never really talked about this with anyone before. Not even my wife knows all the details. It's been my burden to bear for so long.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. Remember, you're in control here. Shall we discuss some coping techniques?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think that would help me feel more prepared. And... thank you for saying that. About my courage. Sometimes I don't feel very courageous at all.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Let's start with a grounding exercise. Are you ready?",
    "Client: I think so. You know, it's strange. Part of me is terrified, but another part feels... almost relieved? Like maybe finally facing this head-on might be the key to moving forward. I've carried this weight for 50 years. Maybe it's time to set it down.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How does it feel to recognize that?",
    "Client: It feels... liberating, in a way. But also scary. It's like I'm standing on the edge of something big, you know? But I'm glad you're here to guide me through it. I couldn't do this alone.",
    "Therapist: You're not alone in this journey. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I'm ready. Let's do this. I know it won't be easy, but I'm hoping it'll be worth it in the end. Thank you for being here with me, doc."
