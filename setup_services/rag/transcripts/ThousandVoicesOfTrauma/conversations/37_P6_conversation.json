    "Therapist: Welcome, Priya. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the bullying incident.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in the office break room. It's lunchtime, and I can smell the strong aroma of my homemade curry. As I sit down, I notice a group of coworkers whispering and glancing at me. One of them, Sarah, wrinkles her nose and says loudly, \"Ugh, what's that smell? It's stinking up the whole room!\" I feel my cheeks burning with embarrassment.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Um... I'd say about a 6 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Continue.",
    "Client: I try to ignore them, but I can hear their snickering. Another coworker, Mike, joins in, \"Maybe some people should stick to sandwiches.\" My hands are shaking as I try to eat, and I'm fighting back tears. I feel so isolated and different.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My heart is racing, and I feel a knot in my stomach. It's like I'm reliving it all over again.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's gone up to an 8.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I want to defend myself, but the words won't come out. I feel frozen. Sarah starts mimicking an Indian accent, mocking the way I sometimes speak. The others laugh. I'm overwhelmed with shame and anger. I quickly pack up my lunch and leave, hearing their laughter follow me down the hallway.",
    "Therapist: SUDS now?",
    "Client: (voice trembling) It's... it's a 9. I feel so helpless and angry.",
    "Therapist: I hear you. It's tough, but you're handling it well. What happens next?",
    "Client: I lock myself in a bathroom stall and cry silently. I'm questioning why I even came to this country, why I'm trying so hard to fit in when it's clear I never will. I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. SUDS?",
    "Client: Still a 9. My chest feels tight, and I'm sweating.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it.",
    "Client: I... I calm down enough to wash my face and return to my desk. But for the rest of the day, I can't focus. I keep replaying their words and laughter in my head. I feel so alone and out of place.",
    "Therapist: And now?",
    "Client: The intensity is dropping a bit. Maybe a 7? I still feel upset, but not as overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's wrap up. Open your eyes when you're ready.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay, I'm back.",
    "Therapist: Well done. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Drained, but... also a bit relieved? It's like I've released something.",
