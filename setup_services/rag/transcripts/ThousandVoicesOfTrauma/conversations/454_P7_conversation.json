    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the car accident for me?",
    "Client: Okay... I was driving home from work. It was raining, and the roads were slippery. I remember gripping the steering wheel tightly, feeling tense. Suddenly, I saw headlights coming towards me in my lane. My heart started racing...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The car was getting closer, and I panicked. I tried to swerve, but my car started to skid. I felt like everything was moving in slow motion. The other car was right there, and I knew we were going to crash. I closed my eyes and...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What happened next?",
    "Client: There was a loud crash, and I felt a jolt through my whole body. The airbag deployed, hitting me in the face. I could taste blood in my mouth, and my chest hurt from the seatbelt. I was so scared, I couldn't move.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Continue.",
    "Client: I opened my eyes, and everything was blurry. I could hear people shouting outside. The windshield was cracked, and I saw steam rising from the hood. I tried to unbuckle my seatbelt, but my hands were shaking so much...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel emotional. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I can't... It's too much. I feel like I'm back there again. My heart is racing, and I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... I managed to get out of the car. My legs felt weak, and I stumbled. A bystander caught me and helped me sit on the curb. I was shivering, partly from the rain and partly from shock. I kept thinking about how close I came to dying...",
    "Therapist: You're showing real strength. Keep going.",
    "Client: The paramedics arrived, and they started checking me over. I couldn't stop crying. I kept asking about the other driver, but no one would tell me anything. I was so worried that I had hurt someone. They put me in the ambulance, and I felt so alone and scared...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... shaky. My hands are clammy, and my heart is still racing. But I also feel a bit relieved, like a weight has been lifted. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to talk about, but I think it helps. After the accident, I had nightmares for weeks. I'd wake up in a cold sweat, feeling like I was trapped in the car again. Even now, when I hear screeching tires or see headlights at night, I get panicky.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable. How do you cope with those feelings?",
    "Client: I try to remind myself that I'm safe now. Sometimes I do deep breathing exercises or call a friend. But there are days when it's overwhelming, and I avoid driving altogether. I hate feeling so powerless.",
    "Therapist: You're not powerless. You're facing this bravely.",
    "Client: I guess you're right. It's just... the accident changed everything. I used to love driving, and now it's a source of anxiety. I worry about my passengers, about other drivers. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel completely safe on the road again.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have those concerns. We'll work through them.",
    "Client: I hope so. I want to get back to normal, you know? To be able to drive without constantly reliving the accident. To enjoy a rainy day without feeling anxious. It's exhausting being on high alert all the time.",
    "Therapist: Your awareness is a positive step. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also a bit lighter. Talking about it is hard, but I can see how it might help in the long run. I just want to feel like myself again.",
    "Therapist: That's a good goal. We'll work towards it together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your support. It's not easy opening up about this, but I'm glad I did. I know it's a long process, but for the first time in a while, I feel hopeful that things can get better.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. This session was intense, but I feel like I've taken a step forward. Thank you for guiding me through it.",
    "Therapist: You've done well. We'll continue next time."
