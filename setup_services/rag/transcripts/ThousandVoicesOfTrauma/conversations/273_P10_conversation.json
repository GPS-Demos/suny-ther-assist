    "Therapist: Welcome, Mara. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: Oh, um... I'm not quite sure. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is... well, terrified, I suppose. It's been so long since I've allowed myself to really think about what happened.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to support you. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: I... yes, I think so. Where should I start?",
    "Therapist: Start by closing your eyes and taking us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: (deep breath) Okay... I'm... I'm in our old house. The one with the yellow kitchen. I'm small, maybe six or seven. I can smell bacon frying, but it's mixed with something else... cigarette smoke, I think. Mum's cooking breakfast, but her movements are jerky, angry. Dad's not home yet.",
    "Therapist: Good, Mara. What happens next?",
    "Client: The front door slams. It's Dad. He's... he's shouting something, but I can't make out the words. Mum turns off the stove and... and... (voice trembles)",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 6? My heart's racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Right... okay. Dad storms into the kitchen. His face is red, and I can smell the alcohol on him. He's yelling at Mum, saying she's useless, that she can't do anything right. Mum's trying to calm him down, but it's not working. I'm... I'm hiding behind the kitchen door, peeking through the crack. I want to help her, but I'm so scared.",
    "Therapist: What do you see and hear?",
    "Client: Dad's getting louder. He... he grabs Mum's arm, twisting it. She cries out, and I can see tears in her eyes. She's begging him to stop, saying the neighbors will hear. But he doesn't care. He... (voice breaks) he slaps her across the face. Hard. The sound... it's like a crack. Mum stumbles, falls against the counter.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment, Mara. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I... I feel sick. My stomach's in knots. It's like I'm right there again.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8, I think.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here in the present, safe with me. Take a few deep breaths.",
    "Client: (breathing deeply) Okay... I'm... I'm still there, but I know I'm here too. Dad's still yelling, throwing things now. A plate shatters against the wall. Mum's crying, trying to shield herself. I want to run, to hide, but I can't move. My legs won't work.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My... my hands are shaking. I feel cold, like ice in my veins. And there's this pressure in my chest, like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: Dad grabs Mum by the hair, dragging her towards the living room. She's screaming now, really screaming. I... I can't take it anymore. I run out from behind the door, yelling at Dad to stop. But he... he doesn't even look at me. It's like I'm not even there.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Helpless. So... so incredibly helpless. And angry. I want to help Mum, but I'm just a little girl. What can I do? (starts crying)",
    "Therapist: It's okay to cry, Mara. You're safe here. Take your time.",
    "Client: (after a moment) Mum sees me. Her eyes... they're so wide, so scared. She manages to break free from Dad and runs to me, pushing me towards the back door. She's telling me to run, to go to Mrs. Thompson next door. I don't want to leave her, but she's insisting. I can hear Dad coming after us...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Let's take a moment. Feel your feet on the floor. You're here, in my office. You're safe.",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) Okay... okay. I'm... I'm here. (takes a deep breath) I run out the back door. I can hear crashes and screams behind me. I'm running as fast as I can, but it feels like I'm moving through molasses. My legs are so heavy. I reach Mrs. Thompson's door, pounding on it, screaming for help. But no one's answering. Why isn't anyone answering?",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I feel so alone. So terrified. Why won't anyone help us? Don't they hear? Don't they care? I keep pounding on the door, my hand hurts, but I can't stop. I have to get help for Mum.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Mara. Keep going.",
    "Client: Finally, Mrs. Thompson opens the door. She looks confused, then scared when she sees my face. I'm crying so hard I can barely speak, but I manage to tell her about Dad hurting Mum. She rushes to the phone to call the police, pulling me inside. I can still hear the screams from our house...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Exhausted. But also... relief? Because I know help is coming. But I'm still so scared for Mum.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 7, I think.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're doing great. What happens next?",
    "Client: Mrs. Thompson is holding me, trying to comfort me, but I can't stop shaking. I hear sirens in the distance, getting closer. Part of me is relieved, but another part is terrified of what they'll find. The police cars pull up outside our house. I watch from Mrs. Thompson's window as they rush in. There's shouting, then... silence.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Dread. Pure dread. Like the world has stopped spinning. I... I can't breathe. What if... what if Mum's...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Mara. Remember, you're here with me.",
    "Client: (inhales shakily) Right... I'm here. I'm safe. (exhales) After what feels like forever, they bring Dad out in handcuffs. He's still yelling, but he looks... smaller somehow. Then I see Mum. She's walking, supported by a policewoman. Her face is bruised, and she's holding her arm funny, but she's alive. She's alive.",
    "Therapist: How does seeing your mother alive make you feel?",
    "Client: Relieved. So incredibly relieved. But also... angry. Angry that this happened, that I couldn't do more to help. And... and guilty. Because part of me is glad Dad's being taken away.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings, Mara. What happens after that?",
    "Client: Mrs. Thompson takes me outside. Mum sees me and reaches out. I run to her, and she hugs me so tight it hurts, but I don't care. We're both crying. She keeps saying she's sorry, over and over. I want to tell her it's not her fault, but I can't find the words. We just stand there, holding each other, while the world seems to spin around us.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well, Mara. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Like I've run a marathon. But also... lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after an imaginal exposure. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 5 now. I'm still shaky, but I feel... I don't know, more grounded?",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves. Can you tell me three things you see in this room?",
    "Client: Um... I see the blue painting on your wall. The plant in the corner. And... and the box of tissues on the table.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, two things you can hear?",
    "Client: I hear the clock ticking. And... traffic outside.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Lastly, one thing you can feel?",
    "Client: I can feel the softness of this chair cushion.",
    "Therapist: Very good, Mara. You've done incredibly well today. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. Tired, but okay. It was hard, reliving that, but... I think it helped. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it's very normal. Many people find relief in working through these memories. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we end our session?",
    "Client: I... I don't think so. I just want to sit here for a moment, if that's okay.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take all the time you need. You've made significant progress today, Mara. I'm proud of you.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I'm starting to feel proud of myself too.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful to hear. When you're ready, we can start wrapping up our session."
