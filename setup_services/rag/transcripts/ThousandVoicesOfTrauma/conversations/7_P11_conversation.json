    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not really sure. It's a lot to process. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a bit lighter? It's strange. Going through that memory of the accident again was intense. I could almost feel the impact, you know? The screeching tires, the crunch of metal... (pauses, takes a deep breath) But this time, I felt like I could observe it without being completely overwhelmed. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: I think... the moment right after the crash. I remember feeling so helpless, trapped in the car. But this time, I noticed how quickly help arrived. People were there, trying to get me out, calling for an ambulance. I hadn't really focused on that part before.",
    "Therapist: How did that realization feel?",
    "Client: It's... comforting, I guess? Like, even in that terrible moment, there was some good. People cared. I wasn't alone. (voice wavers) But it also makes me think about those who don't get help in time, you know? Like victims of human trafficking. God, that must be so terrifying.",
    "Therapist: I hear your empathy. How does this connect to your recovery?",
    "Client: Well, um... (long pause) I suppose it reminds me that support is out there. Even when things seem hopeless. Maybe I need to be better at accepting help, not just in emergencies but in everyday life too. It's hard though. I'm used to being so independent.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful connection. What else?",
    "Client: I noticed my body's reaction was different this time. Usually, when I think about the accident, my heart races and I feel panicky. But today, even though it was vivid, I felt more... in control? Is that progress?",
    "Therapist: It could be. How do you interpret that change?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I'm starting to separate the memory from the present moment? Like, I can acknowledge it happened without feeling like I'm right back there. It's still uncomfortable, but not as overwhelming. (sighs) I just wish I could feel this way all the time, not just in therapy.",
    "Therapist: That's a common desire. Any strategies you've found helpful?",
    "Client: The breathing exercises help a lot. And... (hesitates) I've been trying that grounding technique you taught me, focusing on objects around me when I start to feel anxious. It doesn't always work, but when it does, it's like... a little victory, you know?",
    "Therapist: Those are great tools. How else has this impacted you?",
    "Client: I've been thinking about my work a lot. As a self-employed person, I've always prided myself on being tough, handling everything on my own. But now... I'm wondering if that's really serving me. Maybe it's okay to ask for help sometimes, to delegate. It's scary, but... maybe it's necessary for my healing?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How might you act on it?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure yet. Maybe start small? Like, asking my roommate for help with some tasks around the house? Or hiring an assistant for a few hours a week? (laughs nervously) God, even saying that out loud makes me anxious. But I know I need to make changes if I want to get better.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to start small. What's your next step?",
    "Client: I think... I want to keep working on processing these memories. It's hard, but I can see how it's helping. And maybe... maybe I'll talk to my roommate this week about sharing some responsibilities. Baby steps, right?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: Scared, but... determined? I know it won't be easy, but for the first time in a while, I feel like there's hope. Like I'm not just stuck in this cycle of fear and anxiety. I want to keep going. I need to.",
    "Therapist: That's great. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I guess. For guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone to talk to who understands. Someone who doesn't judge me for struggling with this. I know we still have a long way to go, but... I'm grateful for the progress we've made so far.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue next week?",
    "Client: Definitely. I'll be here. (pauses) You know, I used to dread these sessions, but now... now I look forward to them. It's like... I don't know, like I'm slowly reclaiming pieces of myself. It's both terrifying and exciting at the same time. Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a common experience in therapy.",
    "Client: That's... that's good to hear. Sometimes I worry that I'm not doing this 'right', you know? Like there's some perfect way to recover and I'm messing it up. But hearing that... it helps. Makes me feel less alone in this process.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. See you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. See you then. (deep breath) Here's to another week of healing, right?"
