    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. Going through that memory of being imprisoned, it just brings up so many emotions. I feel drained, but also kind of... I don't know, maybe relieved? It's confusing.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you?",
    "Client: The sense of helplessness, I guess. Being locked up, not knowing when or if I'd get out. It was like... like being trapped in my own mind, you know? I could feel my heart racing just like it did back then. And the silence... it was deafening.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to share that today?",
    "Client: It was tough, really tough. But... there's a part of me that feels lighter, somehow. Like I'm not carrying this burden alone anymore. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How does this connect to your daily life?",
    "Client: Well, I've noticed I get really anxious in small spaces or when I feel trapped. Even in class sometimes, I'll start panicking if I'm sitting in the middle of a row. I guess... I guess that's related to this, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: It seems like it. What else have you noticed?",
    "Client: I've been having trouble sleeping lately. Sometimes I wake up in a cold sweat, feeling like I'm back there. And during the day, I'm always on edge, like something bad is about to happen. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: How has this affected your relationships?",
    "Client: It's... it's been hard. My girlfriend tries to understand, but I can see it's taking a toll on her too. And my parents... they don't really get it. They think I should just \"get over it,\" you know? But it's not that simple.",
    "Therapist: It's not. What strategies have helped so far?",
    "Client: The breathing exercises we've been practicing have been helpful. And... talking about it here, as hard as it is, I think it's making a difference. I'm starting to understand my reactions better.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What's been challenging?",
    "Client: Honestly? Staying present. Sometimes I feel like I'm slipping back into that place, and it's terrifying. And the guilt... I feel guilty for not being \"normal,\" for putting my loved ones through this.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. How can we address that?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe I need to be more open with them about what I'm going through? And remind myself that this isn't my fault?",
    "Therapist: Those sound like good ideas. What else?",
    "Client: I think I need to be more patient with myself. This isn't going to get better overnight, right? And... maybe I could try to find others who've gone through similar experiences. It might help to know I'm not alone in this.",
    "Therapist: Excellent insights. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: It's scary, but... I want to keep going. I want my life back, you know? I don't want this to control me anymore. So yeah, I'm in. It's not easy, but I'm starting to see that it's worth it.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful commitment. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I guess. For listening, for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't judge. I know we have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like there's hope."
