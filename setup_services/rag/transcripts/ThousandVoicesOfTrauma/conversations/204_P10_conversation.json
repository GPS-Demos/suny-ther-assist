    "Therapist: Welcome, Jake. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Uh, honestly? I'm a bit on edge. This whole thing about reliving racial trauma... it's not exactly something I'm looking forward to, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to help you process these experiences. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I guess so. Yeah, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in the campus library. It's late, maybe around 10 PM. I'm at my usual spot, the quiet corner on the third floor. I've got my textbooks spread out, and I'm trying to focus on this massive economics assignment.",
    "Therapist: Good. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The place is pretty empty. There's just a few other students scattered around. I can smell the musty scent of old books, and hear the hum of the air conditioning. It's... it's peaceful, you know? At least it was.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear footsteps. A group of guys, maybe three or four, they come around the corner. They're laughing, talking loudly. I try to ignore them, keep my head down. But then... (voice falters)",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: Um, about a 5... maybe 6.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Right. So, these guys, they start making comments. At first, I think they're just being obnoxious, but then I realize... they're talking about me. \"Look at the model minority,\" one of them says. \"Bet he's acing all his classes.\" I feel my face getting hot, but I try to keep working.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in that moment?",
    "Client: Angry. Embarrassed. I want to say something, but I'm... I'm scared. My heart's pounding, and I can feel sweat on my palms.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that feeling. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe a 7.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. What happens next?",
    "Client: One of them walks over to my table. He leans in, way too close. I can smell beer on his breath. He says, \"Hey, Jackie Chan, why don't you do my homework while you're at it?\" His friends laugh. I... I feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: How do you respond?",
    "Client: I don't. I just... I just sit there, frozen. I want to stand up, to tell them off, but I can't move. I can't even look at them. I just stare at my textbook, pretending I can't hear them.",
    "Therapist: That must have been difficult. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... why me? What did I do to deserve this? I'm just trying to study, to get good grades. And suddenly, I'm reduced to... to a stereotype. It's like everything I've worked for doesn't matter. I'm just... I'm just my race to them.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. Like an 8 or 9.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: They hang around for what feels like forever, making more comments. About my eyes, about how I must be good at math. One of them tries to speak in a mock Asian accent. I feel... I feel so small. So powerless.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel?",
    "Client: Tense. My shoulders are hunched, and my jaw is clenched so tight it hurts. I can feel my heart racing, and there's this knot in my stomach.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I realize I'm holding my breath. Like if I breathe, they'll notice me more. My hands are shaking. I'm trying so hard to look calm, but inside, I'm falling apart.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens after that?",
    "Client: Eventually, they get bored. They leave, laughing and high-fiving each other like it's all just a big joke. But I... I can't move. I sit there for a long time, just staring at my books. I can't focus. The words are all blurry.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel once they're gone?",
    "Client: Relieved, but... but also ashamed. Angry at them, but even angrier at myself. Why didn't I say something? Why did I just sit there and take it? I feel... I feel weak.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid feelings. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still pretty high. Maybe an 8.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I try to keep studying, but I can't concentrate. My hands are still shaking. I keep replaying their words in my head. After about an hour, I give up. I pack my stuff and leave.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel as you're leaving?",
    "Client: Defeated. Like... like I don't belong here. Like no matter how hard I work, I'll always be seen as... as different. As less than.",
    "Therapist: That's a heavy feeling. Stay with it. What happens when you get home?",
    "Client: I... I don't want to talk to anyone. My roommates are in the living room, but I just go straight to my room. I close the door and... and I break down. I cry. I haven't cried like that in years.",
    "Therapist: Allow yourself to feel those emotions. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm thinking about my parents. How hard they worked to give me this opportunity. And now... now I feel like I'm letting them down. Like I'm not strong enough to handle this.",
    "Therapist: Those are powerful thoughts. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe a 7 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Take a deep breath. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I call my mom. I don't tell her what happened. I can't. I just... I just need to hear her voice. She asks if I'm okay, and I lie. I say I'm just stressed about exams.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Guilty. Like I'm hiding part of myself. But also... also protected. I don't want her to worry. I don't want her to think she made a mistake sending me here.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to carry. What happens in the following days?",
    "Client: I... I start avoiding the library. I study in my room instead. I'm always looking over my shoulder on campus. Every time I hear laughter, I tense up. I start to isolate myself more.",
    "Therapist: How does this affect your daily life?",
    "Client: It's... it's exhausting. I'm constantly on edge. My grades start to slip. I'm not sleeping well. I keep having nightmares about that night.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe a 6.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's take a moment to breathe. How are you feeling right now, in this room?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. A bit drained, but... but also relieved. Like I've finally let some of this out.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You've shown a lot of strength today. How would you like to close this session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I just want to sit here for a moment. To remind myself that I'm safe now.",
    "Therapist: That's a good idea. Let's take a few deep breaths together.",
    "Client: (Takes several deep breaths) Thank you. I... I think I needed this more than I realized.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today, Jake. How are you feeling as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... lighter, I guess. Still a bit raw, but... but also like maybe I can start to process this. To move forward.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. Remember, healing takes time. We'll continue to work through this together.",
    "Client: Yeah, I... I appreciate that. I'm glad I have this space to talk about it.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad too. We'll pick this up next session. Take care of yourself this week, okay?",
    "Client: I will. Thanks, doc."
