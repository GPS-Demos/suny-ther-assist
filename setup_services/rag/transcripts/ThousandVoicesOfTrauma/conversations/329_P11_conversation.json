    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving that moment when I witnessed the violence... it's brought up so many emotions I thought I'd buried long ago. I can still hear the shouting, the crash of objects being thrown. My heart is racing just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The fear. The absolute terror I felt, not just for myself, but for my sister. I was frozen, unable to move or call for help. I keep thinking, \"Why didn't I do something?\" It's... it's hard to shake that feeling of helplessness, even now.",
    "Therapist: How does that helplessness relate to your everyday life?",
    "Client: Well, I suppose... I've always struggled with asserting myself. Even in my marriage, I often find it difficult to speak up when something bothers me. It's like I'm still that scared little girl, afraid to make any noise or draw attention to myself.",
    "Therapist: I see. What did you learn about yourself today?",
    "Client: I realized that... maybe I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. I survived that experience, and here I am, facing it again. It's painful, yes, but I'm doing it. That has to count for something, doesn't it?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How might this strength help you moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I can start being more open with my husband about my feelings. And perhaps I can finally talk to my sister about what happened. We've never really discussed it, you know? It's always been this unspoken thing between us.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive step. What's your biggest challenge right now?",
    "Client: The nightmares. They've gotten worse since we started these sessions. I wake up in a cold sweat, feeling like I'm right back there in that moment. It's... it's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: That's common during this process. How are you coping?",
    "Client: I've been trying those breathing exercises you taught me. They help a bit. And I've started keeping a journal by my bed. Writing down the nightmares somehow makes them less scary.",
    "Therapist: Great. What else might help you feel safe?",
    "Client: I've been thinking about that. Maybe... maybe I could ask my husband to hold me when I wake up from a nightmare? I've always been too embarrassed to ask, but I think it might help.",
    "Therapist: That's a wonderful idea. How do you feel about our progress so far?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard, harder than I expected. But I also feel like I'm finally facing something I've run from my whole life. There's a strange sense of... I don't know, relief? Like I'm finally letting go of a burden I've carried for far too long.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. What's your focus for this week?",
    "Client: I want to try talking to my sister. Just... just a little. Maybe mention that I'm in therapy and see how she reacts. It's scary, but I think it's time.",
    "Therapist: That takes courage. How can you support yourself in this?",
    "Client: I'll make sure to practice my breathing before I call her. And maybe I'll reward myself afterwards, regardless of how it goes. A nice cup of tea and some quiet time in the garden.",
    "Therapist: Excellent plan. Any final thoughts before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I just... I want to thank you. This isn't easy, but I feel like I'm finally moving forward. It's like I'm reclaiming parts of myself I thought were lost forever. I'm scared, but I'm also... hopeful. Is that strange?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a sign of your progress. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, I'll be here. Thank you again."
