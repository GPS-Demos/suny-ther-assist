    "Therapist: Welcome, Raj. Today we'll start imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of reliving that night... it's not easy. But I understand it's necessary. I just hope I can handle it without falling apart completely.",
    "Therapist: Your apprehension is normal. We'll take it step by step. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. But before we start, can you explain again why we need to do this? I mean, I've spent so much time trying to forget that night. It seems counterintuitive to deliberately bring it all back.",
    "Therapist: It helps process the trauma. By facing it, we reduce its power over you.",
    "Client: I see. That makes sense, but it's still scary. Will it be intense? I'm worried about how I'll react. What if I panic or can't continue?",
    "Therapist: It may be intense, but I'm here to support you. We can pause anytime.",
    "Client: Okay, that's reassuring. I appreciate your support. It's been hard dealing with this alone. Sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy, you know? Like I can't escape the memories, but I also can't face them. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. This process takes courage. How shall we proceed?",
    "Client: I think I'm ready to try. But can we start slowly? Maybe just talk about the lead-up to the incident first? I'm not sure I can jump right into the worst parts.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll start where you're comfortable. What do you recall first?",
    "Client: Well, it was a Friday night. I remember because I had just finished a big project for work and was looking forward to relaxing over the weekend. I was home alone, my roommate was out of town. I had just settled on the couch with a book when I heard a noise...",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's pause here. How are you feeling so far?",
    "Client: I'm okay, I think. My heart's beating a bit faster, but it's manageable. It's strange how vivid the memories are, even just talking about the beginning of that night. I can almost smell the scented candle I had lit earlier that evening.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we continue?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. It's hard, but I want to get through this. I want to be able to feel safe in my own home again, you know? Ever since that night, I've been jumpy, always looking over my shoulder. It would be nice to relax again someday.",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. Let's work towards it. What happened next?",
    "Client: The noise... it was like a scratching sound at the back door. At first, I thought it might be a stray cat or something. But then I heard a louder thud, and I knew someone was trying to break in. I froze. I couldn't move. I just sat there, paralyzed with fear...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Raj. Let's take a deep breath together. Ready?",
    "Client: Okay, yes. *takes a deep breath* That helps, thank you. It's intense, reliving it like this. But I think I can continue. Is this... is this normal? To feel so shaken even just talking about it?",
    "Therapist: Completely normal. Your reactions show you're processing the event. Continue when ready.",
    "Client: Alright. So, I was frozen on the couch. Then I heard the door burst open. I remember the sound of wood splintering. It was so loud in the quiet house. I finally managed to stand up, but before I could do anything else, they were there. Two men, wearing masks...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Raj. Let's pause here. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking a bit. My palms are sweaty. But I'm okay. It's strange, but talking about it like this, it feels different. Like I'm starting to see it from the outside, if that makes sense. It's still scary, but maybe a little less overwhelming?",
    "Therapist: That's a positive sign. You're gaining perspective. Shall we stop here for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that might be good. It's a lot to process. But... I think I want to continue this in our next session. Is that okay? I feel like I'm finally starting to face this head-on, and as difficult as it is, I don't want to lose momentum.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll continue next time. You've shown incredible strength today, Raj.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your guidance through this. It's not easy, but I'm starting to see how it might help. I'm looking forward to the day when these memories don't have such a hold on me anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a great outlook. Remember to use your coping strategies this week.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again. See you next week."
