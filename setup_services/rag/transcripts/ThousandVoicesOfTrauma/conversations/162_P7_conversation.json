    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Are you ready to revisit the memory of losing your loved one?",
    "Client: I... I think so. It's still hard to think about, but I'll try.",
    "Therapist: You're brave for facing this. Take your time.",
    "Client: Okay... I remember getting the phone call. It was late at night, and I was just about to go to bed. The ringtone startled me. When I answered, it was my sister's voice, but she sounded different, choked up. She said, \"It's Mom. She's gone.\" I felt like the world stopped spinning. I couldn't breathe. I kept asking her to repeat herself, hoping I'd heard wrong.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: I... I remember sliding down the wall, my legs giving out. My partner came running, asking what was wrong, but I couldn't speak. I just handed them the phone. The room felt so cold suddenly, and I could hear my heartbeat in my ears. It was like everything was moving in slow motion.",
    "Therapist: That's it. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I started shaking uncontrollably. My mind was racing, thinking about all the things left unsaid, the last time I saw her. I felt this overwhelming guilt because we'd had an argument the week before, and I hadn't called to make amends. Now I'd never get the chance.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. Keep going.",
    "Client: The next few hours were a blur. I remember packing a bag, but I couldn't focus. I kept forgetting things, my hands were trembling so much I could barely zip up the suitcase. The drive to my childhood home felt eternal. Every mile closer was like a knife twisting in my chest. I kept hoping it was all a mistake, that when we got there, she'd be okay.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: When we arrived, the house was full of people, but it felt so empty without her. I walked into her room, and... (voice breaks) her favorite sweater was still draped over the chair. The book she was reading was on the nightstand, bookmark still in place. It hit me then that she'd never finish it. I collapsed on her bed, clutching that sweater, and I just... I couldn't stop crying.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: The smell of her perfume was still on the sweater. It made everything feel so real, so final. I remember thinking about all the future moments she'd miss - holidays, birthdays, my niece's graduation. The thought of facing life without her guidance, her love... it was overwhelming. I felt so lost, so alone, even with all those people around.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still painful, but talking about it... it feels a little less overwhelming. Like I can breathe a bit easier.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. I didn't think I could get through describing that day without falling apart. It's still hard, but... I feel like I'm starting to process it better. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're making strides.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's strange, but revisiting the memory, as painful as it is, also brings back some good memories of her. Like how she always knew exactly what to say when I was struggling, or her laugh that could light up a room. I miss her so much, but I'm starting to feel like I can carry those good memories with me without being completely overwhelmed by the loss.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive shift. Keep going.",
    "Client: I think... I think she would be proud of me for working through this. She always encouraged me to face my fears head-on. It's almost like I can hear her voice telling me to be strong, to keep moving forward. It doesn't make the pain go away, but it does give me a sense of purpose, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization.",
    "Client: Yeah, it is. I hadn't thought about it that way before. Maybe... maybe part of honoring her memory is learning to live with this loss, to grow from it. It's still going to be hard, and I know I'll have bad days, but for the first time since it happened, I feel like I might be okay eventually. Is that... is that a normal part of the grieving process?",
    "Therapist: Everyone's journey is unique, but yes.",
    "Client: That's... that's comforting to hear. I've been so worried that I'm not grieving \"correctly,\" whatever that means. But talking about it like this, facing the memories head-on... it's painful, but it also feels like I'm finally moving through something instead of being stuck. I'm grateful for this space to process everything.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: Thank you. I am, in a way. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm honoring her by working through this. I think... I think I'd like to try talking about some of the good memories next time. Is that something we could do?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll explore that together.",
    "Client: That sounds good. I'm nervous about it, but also a little excited. It feels like a step towards healing, you know? Like I'm reclaiming those happy memories from the shadow of loss. I know it won't be easy, but I feel more prepared to face it now.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but in a good way? Like I've done something important and difficult. There's still sadness, of course, but it doesn't feel as suffocating as before. I'm actually looking forward to our next session, which is not something I thought I'd say when we started this process.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive outlook. Well done today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I really appreciate your guidance and support through this. It means a lot to have someone to talk to who understands the process. I think I'm going to take some time to rest now, maybe look at some old photo albums. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Take care.",
    "Client: Thank you. I will. See you next week."
