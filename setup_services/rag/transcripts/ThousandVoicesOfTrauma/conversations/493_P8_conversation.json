    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mrs. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. It's as if I'm right back there in that moment, you know? My heart is racing, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's like I can't catch my breath properly. The memory of those men bursting into our home... it's so vivid. I can see their faces, hear their voices... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: Fear. Overwhelming fear. I remember feeling so helpless, like I couldn't protect myself or my husband. I keep thinking about how they pushed past us, how rough they were. I can still feel the cold metal of the gun against my temple... (voice breaks) I... I thought we were going to die. Even now, I feel this... this panic rising in my chest. It's like I'm right back there, frozen, unable to move or speak.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. And as you're feeling that fear now, where do you notice it in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's mostly in my chest and stomach. My stomach feels like it's in knots, and my chest feels so tight. My hands are shaking too, just like they did that night. I feel cold all over, even though I know the room is warm. It's like my body is remembering everything, not just my mind.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... why us? Why did they choose our home? I wonder if we could have done something differently, if we could have prevented it somehow. And then I feel guilty for even thinking that because I know it wasn't our fault. But then I think about how it's affected our lives, how I can't sleep properly anymore, how I jump at every little noise... and I get angry. Angry at them for taking away our sense of safety, our peace of mind.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot of complex emotions. How are you coping with these feelings?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. Some days are better than others. I try to remind myself that we survived, that we're safe now. But it's difficult when the memories feel so real, so present. I've been trying those breathing exercises you taught me, and they help sometimes. But other times, like now, it all feels so overwhelming. I worry that I'll never feel truly safe again, that this fear will always be with me.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I... I think I need a moment to just... breathe. To remind myself that I'm here, in this room, and that I'm safe. Maybe... maybe we could do one of those grounding exercises? I find they help me come back to the present when the memories feel too strong.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take a few deep breaths together.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Thank you. That helps. It's strange, you know. Even though reliving that memory is so difficult, there's a part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe 'relieved' isn't the right word, but... like I'm finally facing it instead of trying to push it away all the time. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Can you tell me more about that?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... for so long, I've been trying to avoid thinking about that night. I've been pushing the memories away, trying to pretend it never happened. But doing that... it's exhausting. And it doesn't really work, does it? The memories still come back, often when I least expect them. But now, talking about it like this, facing it head-on... it's terrifying, yes, but there's also this sense that maybe, just maybe, I can learn to live with this. That it doesn't have to control my life forever.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How does that realization make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... a mix of emotions, really. There's hope, definitely. Hope that I can move forward, that I can reclaim some of what was taken from me that night. But there's also fear. What if I can't do it? What if it's too hard? And then there's this... determination, I suppose. A part of me that wants to fight, to not let those men win by letting this trauma define the rest of my life. It's like... for the first time in a long while, I can see a path forward, even if it's a difficult one.",
    "Therapist: That's very insightful. What do you think this means for your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I think... I think it means I'm ready to really commit to this process. To face these memories and work through them, no matter how hard it gets. I want to be able to sleep through the night again, to not feel afraid in my own home. I want to be able to enjoy time with my family without constantly looking over my shoulder. It won't be easy, I know that. But I think I'm ready to really try, to put in the work. Because the alternative... living in fear for the rest of my life... that's not really living, is it?",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, honestly. Emotionally exhausted. But there's also this strange sense of... I don't know, maybe clarity? Like I've taken a step forward, even if it's a small one. My heart isn't racing as much now, and the tightness in my chest has eased a bit. I still feel shaky, but it's not as overwhelming as it was earlier. It's like... like I've looked at the monster under the bed and realized that, while it's still scary, it's not as all-powerful as I thought it was. Does that make any sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. What would you like to focus on in our remaining time?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to talk about some strategies for when these memories come up outside of our sessions. Ways to ground myself, to remind myself that I'm safe now. And maybe... maybe we could discuss how I can talk to my family about this? They've been so supportive, but I know they worry, and I want to be able to explain to them what I'm going through, how they can help. Is that something we could work on?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's start with grounding techniques..."
