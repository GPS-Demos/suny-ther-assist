    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's begin. Close your eyes and recall the memory of your severe illness.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in the hospital room. The beeping of machines is constant. I feel so weak, like I can barely move. The smell of disinfectant is overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably about a 5 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The doctor comes in. His face is serious. I can tell it's not good news. My heart starts racing. I'm all alone, and I've never felt so scared in my life.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My palms are sweating. I feel like I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 7.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The doctor starts explaining my condition. I can barely focus on his words. All I can think about is how no one is here with me. My parents should be here, but they're not. They never came.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are coming up?",
    "Client: Anger. Sadness. I feel so abandoned.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: I'm trying to listen to the doctor, but I keep thinking about my parents. Why aren't they here? Don't they care that I might... that I might not make it? My chest feels so tight.",
    "Therapist: How's your breathing?",
    "Client: It's shallow. Fast. I feel lightheaded.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Your SUDS?",
    "Client: Still an 8. Maybe... maybe edging towards 9.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The doctor finishes talking. He asks if I have any questions, but I can't think. I just nod. As he leaves, I feel so small in that big hospital bed. So alone. I want to cry, but I can't even do that.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you noticing?",
    "Client: My whole body feels heavy. Like I'm sinking into the bed. I'm exhausted.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7 again.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're processing this. Continue.",
    "Client: I close my eyes, trying to sleep, but I can't. The machines keep beeping. I keep hoping to hear footsteps, to see my parents walk in. But they don't come. Hours pass, and I'm just... alone.",
    "Therapist: How does that feel?",
    "Client: Empty. Like I don't matter to anyone.",
    "Therapist: Your current SUDS?",
    "Client: It's back to a 6. I feel... drained.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're doing well. Let's start wrapping up.",
    "Client: Okay. As I open my eyes, I'm back in the present. I feel... I don't know. Sad, but also relieved it's over.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... okay. Like I've released something.",
    "Therapist: Final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to a 4 now.",
    "Therapist: Well done, Sarah. You've shown great courage today."
