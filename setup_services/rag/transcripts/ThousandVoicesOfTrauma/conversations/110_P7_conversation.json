    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the workplace incident?",
    "Client: Okay... I was at my office, working late one night. It was about 9 PM, and I was the only one there. Suddenly, the building started shaking. At first, I thought it was just a truck passing by, but then it got stronger. I realized it was an earthquake.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: The shaking intensified, and I could hear things falling off shelves. I tried to get under my desk, but I was panicking. The lights went out, and I could hear glass shattering. I was terrified, thinking the building might collapse.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What were you feeling?",
    "Client: I felt... helpless. My heart was racing, and I couldn't breathe properly. I kept thinking about my family, wondering if I'd ever see them again. The darkness made everything worse.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Keep going.",
    "Client: As the shaking continued, I managed to crawl under my desk. I could feel the floor moving beneath me, and there was this horrible creaking sound. I was crying and shaking uncontrollably. I tried to call my husband, but the cell networks were down.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I don't know how long I was under there. It felt like hours. When the shaking finally stopped, I was too scared to move. I kept thinking there might be aftershocks. Eventually, I heard sirens outside and people shouting.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What happened next?",
    "Client: I slowly came out from under the desk. The office was a mess - papers everywhere, broken glass, fallen ceiling tiles. I was shaking so much I could barely walk. When I got to the stairwell, it was dark, and I was terrified of going down in case there was another quake.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: I made my way down slowly, holding onto the railing. When I finally got outside, it was chaos. People were crying and hugging each other. Cars were damaged, and some buildings had partially collapsed. I just stood there, frozen, not knowing what to do.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel overwhelmed. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Recalling this... it's hard. My hands are sweating, and I feel anxious. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I survived something terrible.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. You did survive.",
    "Client: Yeah, I did. But it's still so vivid in my mind. Sometimes at work, when there's a loud noise or the building shakes slightly, I get panicky. I worry it's happening again.",
    "Therapist: Those reactions are common. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I guess so. It's just... I used to feel so safe at work. Now, I'm always on edge, always looking for the nearest exit. I hate feeling this way.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to acknowledge these feelings. You're working through them.",
    "Client: You're right. I am trying. It's just hard sometimes. I want to feel normal again, to not jump at every little sound or movement.",
    "Therapist: That's a good goal. We'll work towards it together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your support. It helps to talk about this, even though it's difficult. I want to get better, for myself and my family.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage. Shall we continue?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I can. After I got outside, I finally managed to reach my husband on the phone. Hearing his voice... I just broke down crying. He was okay, but our house had some damage. I felt so guilty for being relieved that I was safe when others weren't as fortunate.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel relief. You're not alone in that.",
    "Client: I know, but it still feels wrong somehow. The aftermath was almost as bad as the quake itself. For weeks, we had aftershocks. Each one would send me into a panic. I couldn't sleep, couldn't concentrate at work. I kept reliving that night over and over.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well facing these memories. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: It's still scary to think about, but talking about it... it feels like I'm taking some of its power away. Like I'm not just a victim anymore, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. You're reclaiming control.",
    "Client: Yeah, I think I am. It's a long process, but I feel like I'm making progress. Sometimes I worry I'll never fully get over it, though.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have those concerns. We'll address them together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I really appreciate your help with this. It's not easy, but I'm glad I'm doing it. I want to be able to go to work without feeling afraid all the time.",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. You're making significant strides.",
    "Client: I hope so. Sometimes it feels like two steps forward, one step back. But I'm trying to stay positive and keep working at it.",
    "Therapist: That's all we can ask. You're doing well. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. This session was intense, but I feel... lighter somehow. Thank you for guiding me through it.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care of yourself this week. We'll continue next time."
