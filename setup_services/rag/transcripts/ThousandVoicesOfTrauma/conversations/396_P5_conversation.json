    "Therapist: Mr. Talanoa, today we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: Oh, I'm not sure, doctor. It sounds a bit scary. What exactly does it involve? I've been having more nightmares lately about my time in the refugee camp, and I'm worried this might make things worse.",
    "Therapist: I understand your concerns. Let's discuss the process and its benefits.",
    "Client: Alright, I suppose that would help. It's just... those memories are so painful. I've tried so hard to forget them, you know? The violence we witnessed, the constant fear... it's not easy to talk about.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. This technique aims to reduce those painful memories' power over you.",
    "Client: Reduce their power? That sounds... well, I guess it sounds good, but how does it work? I'm not sure I can handle reliving those experiences.",
    "Therapist: We'll guide you through recounting the trauma safely. It may be uncomfortable, but it's controlled.",
    "Client: I see. And you'll be here with me the whole time? I don't think I could face those memories alone. Sometimes, even now, I wake up in a cold sweat, thinking I'm back there.",
    "Therapist: Yes, I'll be here throughout. Your safety is my priority.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I trust you, doctor. But what if I panic? Or if it becomes too much?",
    "Therapist: We can pause anytime. You're in control. We'll practice coping strategies first.",
    "Client: Okay, that makes me feel a bit better. I suppose if it helps with the nightmares and the anxiety, it's worth trying. My family has been so worried about me lately.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. This can significantly improve your PTSD symptoms.",
    "Client: Thank you, doctor. I'm still nervous, but I'm willing to give it a try. Can you tell me more about what to expect during the session?",
    "Therapist: We'll start slowly. You'll recount the memory, focusing on sensory details and emotions.",
    "Client: Sensory details? You mean like what I saw, heard, and felt? That's... that's going to be intense. But I understand why it might help. Will it get easier over time?",
    "Therapist: Yes, typically it becomes less distressing with each session. Your resilience will grow.",
    "Client: I hope so. I've carried this burden for so long. The idea of it becoming less overwhelming... well, that would be life-changing. Is there anything I should do to prepare?",
    "Therapist: Just come as you are. Bring any concerns. We'll face this together.",
    "Client: Thank you, doctor. Your support means a lot. I'm grateful for this opportunity, even if it's daunting. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is inspiring. We'll take it one step at a time."
