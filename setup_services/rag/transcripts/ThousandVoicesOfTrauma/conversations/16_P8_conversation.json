    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling shaky. My heart's still racing a bit. That memory of the police brutality incident, it just... it brings everything back so vividly. I can still hear the shouting, the sirens. It's like I'm right there again.",
    "Therapist: What's the most prominent emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... anger? Yeah, I'm angry. Angry that this happened, angry that I still feel so affected by it. I thought I was past this, you know? But reliving it, it's like... it's like my body doesn't know it's not happening right now.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's hot. Like this burning sensation in my chest. My fists are clenched too, I just noticed that. And there's this tension in my jaw. It's like my whole body is ready to fight or... or run away. But I can't do either. I'm just stuck with these feelings.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are accompanying these sensations?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"This isn't fair. Why did this have to happen to me?\" And then I feel guilty for thinking that because... well, because it happens to so many people, doesn't it? But then I think, \"No, it shouldn't happen to anyone.\" It's this cycle of thoughts that just keeps going round and round.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your everyday life?",
    "Client: It's... it's everywhere. I'm always on edge, especially around authority figures. Even seeing a police car drives my anxiety through the roof. And it's affecting my work too. I'm a professional, I need to be composed, but sometimes I just... I just can't. I'll hear a loud noise or someone will raise their voice, and suddenly I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about how you're coping with these feelings now?",
    "Client: I... I guess I'm talking about it more easily than I used to. That's something, right? But it still feels so raw. Like, logically, I know I'm safe here, but my body doesn't seem to get the message. It's frustrating. I want to move past this, but it's like... like the memory has hooks in me, and I can't shake it off.",
    "Therapist: How does this compare to when you first started therapy?",
    "Client: Oh, it's... it's different. Before, I couldn't even talk about it without having a full-blown panic attack. Now, I can at least put it into words. But it's still so hard. I feel like I should be further along, you know? Like, shouldn't I be over this by now?",
    "Therapist: What would \"being over it\" look like to you?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. I guess being able to see a police officer without my heart rate skyrocketing? Being able to watch the news without feeling like I'm going to be sick? Just... just feeling normal again. Whatever that means. Sometimes I can't even remember what normal felt like before all this.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about the progress you've made so far?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. On one hand, I know I've come a long way. I mean, I'm here, talking about it. That's huge. But on the other hand, it still hurts so much. It's like... like I'm climbing a mountain, and I've made it pretty far up, but I look up and the peak still seems so far away. And sometimes... sometimes I'm afraid I'll never reach it.",
    "Therapist: What gives you hope in your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I... I guess moments like this, actually. Being able to talk about it, to face it. And my family, they've been so supportive. My husband, he... he's been my rock through all of this. And there are days, good days, where I feel almost like my old self. Those days give me hope. They remind me that maybe, just maybe, I can get through this.",
    "Therapist: How can we build on that hope moving forward?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. I guess keep doing what we're doing? These sessions, they're hard, but I can feel them making a difference. And maybe... maybe I need to be kinder to myself. Recognize the progress I've made instead of always focusing on how far I still have to go. It's just... it's not easy.",
    "Therapist: What small step could you take this week towards self-kindness?",
    "Client: Hmm... maybe... maybe I could start a journal? Write down one thing each day that I'm proud of, no matter how small. Even if it's just... getting out of bed on a bad day. Because that is an accomplishment sometimes, isn't it? Yeah... yeah, I think I'll try that.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that idea?",
    "Client: It feels... good. A little scary, maybe? Like, what if I can't think of anything to write? But also... hopeful. Like maybe if I start looking for things to be proud of, I'll start noticing more of them. And maybe... maybe that will help me see how far I've really come.",
    "Therapist: What else is coming up for you as we near the end of our session?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... tired. Drained. But also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've set down a heavy bag I've been carrying. It's still there, I still have to pick it up again, but... but for now, I can breathe a little easier. And I'm grateful for that. For this space to just... be. To feel what I'm feeling without judgment.",
    "Therapist: How would you like to close our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to take a few deep breaths. Just... center myself before I head back out into the world. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's do that together."
