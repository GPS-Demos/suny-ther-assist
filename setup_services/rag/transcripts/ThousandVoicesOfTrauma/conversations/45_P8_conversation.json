    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like my whole body is trembling on the inside. Remembering those moments in that small, dark cell... it's bringing up so much. I can almost smell the musty air and feel the cold concrete beneath me.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's like a cold hand gripping my heart. I keep thinking about how helpless I felt, how utterly alone. I was so young when it happened, you know? Just a child, really. And the darkness... it was so complete. I remember curling up in the corner, trying to make myself as small as possible, hoping that if I was quiet enough, they'd forget about me.",
    "Therapist: How does that fear feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a knot in my stomach. My throat feels tight, like I can't swallow properly. And my hands... they're clammy and shaky. It's as if my body is preparing to run, but there's nowhere to go. I'm right back there, in that moment, feeling trapped and terrified.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep hearing echoes of what they told me... that no one cared, that I deserved to be there. Part of me still believes it, you know? Even though I know it's not true. I keep thinking, \"What if they were right? What if I really am worthless?\" And then I feel angry at myself for even entertaining those thoughts after all these years.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger feel different from the fear?",
    "Client: The anger... it's hot. It burns in my chest. It's directed at them, sure, but also at myself. Why didn't I fight back? Why did I let their words sink in so deep? But then I remind myself that I was just a child. I didn't have the tools to fight back then. It's a constant battle between the scared little girl I was and the woman I am now.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about that internal conflict?",
    "Client: It's exhausting, really. Part of me wants to comfort that little girl, to tell her it wasn't her fault. But another part... it's like I'm still trying to prove something. To show them, and maybe myself, that I'm strong, that I've overcome it. But have I? Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever truly be free from that cell, you know?",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to share these thoughts out loud?",
    "Client: It's... oddly liberating. Scary, but liberating. For so long, I've kept these feelings bottled up inside. I was afraid that if I let them out, they'd overwhelm me. But talking about it... it's like I'm shining a light into that dark cell. It doesn't make the memories go away, but it makes them feel less powerful, somehow.",
    "Therapist: What do you think that means for your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I think... I think it means I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. Each time we do this, each time I face these memories, it's like I'm reclaiming a piece of myself. It's painful, and there are moments when I want to run away from it all. But I'm here. I'm talking about it. And maybe, just maybe, that's the first step towards truly breaking free from that cell.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... comforting, in a way. Like a warm blanket wrapped around my shoulders. For so long, I've felt defined by what happened to me. But now, I'm starting to see that I'm more than just a victim. I'm a survivor. And that... that feels powerful. It doesn't erase the pain or the fear, but it gives me hope. Hope that one day, I'll be able to look back on this without feeling like I'm right back in that moment.",
    "Therapist: What does that hope feel like?",
    "Client: It's like a small flame in my chest. Fragile, but persistent. It's not always there - sometimes the darkness feels too overwhelming. But in moments like this, when I've faced my fears and come out the other side, it burns a little brighter. It reminds me that I'm not that helpless child anymore. I have resources now, support. And most importantly, I have my voice. I'm not silent anymore.",
    "Therapist: How might you carry this feeling forward?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to be gentler with myself. To acknowledge the progress I've made, even when it feels small. Maybe I can start by writing down these moments of strength, to remind myself on the harder days. And perhaps... perhaps I can start opening up more to my partner. They've been so patient, but I've always held back, afraid of being a burden. But if I can face this here, maybe I can start facing it at home too.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a meaningful step. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. Emotionally drained. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, accomplishment? Like I've climbed a mountain. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel a little shaky, but it's different now. It's like the fear has loosened its grip a little. I know we'll have to do this again, and part of me dreads it. But another part... another part of me is ready to keep fighting, to keep reclaiming my story.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing so openly. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to explore more about how this experience has affected my relationships. Especially with my partner. There's so much I haven't told them, so much I've kept bottled up. Maybe it's time to start unpacking that. It's scary, but after today... I think I might be ready to take that step.",
    "Therapist: That's a brave decision. We'll work on that together. How would you like to close our session today?",
    "Client: Could we... could we just sit in silence for a moment? I need to catch my breath, to let everything we've talked about settle. And maybe... maybe you could remind me of those grounding techniques we practiced? I think I need to feel anchored before I leave.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take a few deep breaths together."
