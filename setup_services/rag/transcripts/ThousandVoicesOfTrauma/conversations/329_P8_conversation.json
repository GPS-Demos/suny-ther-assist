    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mrs. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. It's like I was right back there, watching it all happen again. My heart is still racing a bit, and I feel a bit nauseous. It's strange, isn't it? How something from so long ago can still affect me like this.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. Can you tell me more about those physical sensations?",
    "Client: Well, my palms are sweaty, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's like... like I can't quite catch my breath. And my stomach feels like it's in knots. I keep seeing flashes of that night, you know? The sounds, the smells... it's all so vivid.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... why didn't I do something? I was just frozen there, watching. I should have helped, should have called for help, anything. But I just... couldn't move. And then I think about how unfair it all is. Why did this have to happen? Why did I have to see it? It's... it's overwhelming sometimes.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts make you feel emotionally?",
    "Client: Guilty, mostly. And angry. So, so angry. At the perpetrators, at myself, at the world for letting this happen. But there's also this deep sadness, you know? For the innocence lost, for the person I might have been if this hadn't happened. And fear... even after all these years, there's still fear.",
    "Therapist: I see. How do you cope with these intense emotions?",
    "Client: I... I try to distract myself, usually. Read a book, watch TV, anything to get my mind off it. But sometimes, especially after sessions like this, I find myself reaching out to my husband more. Just being near him helps, even if we don't talk about it. And I've started writing in a journal, which helps get some of these thoughts out of my head.",
    "Therapist: That's good. How do you feel your coping has changed over time?",
    "Client: Well, it's... it's better now, I suppose. In the beginning, I would just shut down completely. Wouldn't talk to anyone, barely left the house. Now, I can at least function day-to-day. But it's still hard. Some days are better than others. I think... I think I'm learning to be kinder to myself, if that makes sense?",
    "Therapist: Mm. Can you elaborate on that?",
    "Client: It's like... I'm starting to understand that what happened wasn't my fault. That being frozen was a normal reaction. I'm trying to... to forgive myself, I guess. For not doing more, for letting it affect me for so long. It's a slow process, but I think I'm making progress.",
    "Therapist: How does this progress make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of emotions, really. There's relief, definitely. Hope, too. Like maybe I can actually move past this someday. But there's also fear. What if I can't keep making progress? What if I slip back? And sometimes, there's this weird guilt about getting better, like I'm somehow betraying what happened by moving on. It's all so complicated.",
    "Therapist: I understand. What helps you stay motivated in your recovery?",
    "Client: My family, mostly. My husband, my children, my grandchildren. I want to be present for them, you know? To enjoy the time I have left without this... this shadow hanging over me. And, well, I suppose I'm doing it for myself too. I'm tired of letting this control my life. I want to feel... free, I guess. To be able to remember without being overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful motivation. How do you feel about your progress so far?",
    "Client: It's... it's been hard, but I think I'm getting somewhere. There are still bad days, of course. Days when I feel like I'm right back where I started. But overall, I think I'm stronger now. I can talk about it without completely falling apart, which is something I never thought I'd be able to do. And these sessions, as difficult as they are, they're helping. It's like... like I'm finally facing it head-on instead of running away.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. What do you think has contributed most to this progress?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's been a combination of things. These sessions, definitely. Having a safe space to talk about it, to really confront these memories. But also, the support of my family. My husband's patience, my children's understanding. And, well, time, I suppose. It's given me some perspective, allowed me to start processing it all. And maybe... maybe just getting older. Realizing that I don't want to carry this burden for the rest of my life.",
    "Therapist: I see. How do you envision your future now?",
    "Client: That's... that's a good question. I think... I hope for peace, mostly. To be able to remember without being consumed by it. To enjoy my retirement, my family, without this constant shadow. I don't think I'll ever forget, and maybe that's okay. But I want it to be a part of my past, not something that defines my present or my future. I want to be... just me. Not a victim, not a survivor, just... me.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. How are you feeling now, after our discussion?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired, honestly. Emotionally drained. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, lightness? Like I've set down a heavy load, even if just for a moment. It's still there, waiting to be picked up again, but for now... for now, I feel like I can breathe a little easier. It's hard, facing all of this, but I think... I think it's worth it. I'm grateful for these sessions, even when they're difficult. Thank you for listening, for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we end?",
    "Client: No, I... I think I'm okay for now. It's a lot to process, but I feel... I feel okay. A bit shaky, but okay. I'll make sure to use those grounding techniques we talked about if things get overwhelming later. And I'll write in my journal, try to get some of these thoughts out. Thank you again, doctor. I'll see you next week?",
    "Therapist: Yes, same time next week. Take care, Mrs. Johnson."
