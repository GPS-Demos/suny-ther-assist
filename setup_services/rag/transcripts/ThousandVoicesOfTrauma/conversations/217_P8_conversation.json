    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like my body is still tense, you know? I can feel my heart racing, and my hands are clammy. It's as if I'm right back there, watching that car accident happen all over again. The screeching tires, the sound of metal crunching... it's all so vivid in my mind.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. I mean, I was just standing there on the sidewalk, and suddenly... chaos. There was nothing I could do to stop it. And then I think about the people in those cars, how their lives changed in an instant. It makes me realize how fragile life is, you know? One moment you're just going about your day, and the next... everything's different.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does that realization affect you?",
    "Client: It... it scares me, to be honest. I find myself being overly cautious now, always looking over my shoulder, expecting something bad to happen. I used to love driving, but now I get anxious every time I have to get in a car. It's like I'm constantly on edge, waiting for the next accident to happen. And I feel guilty too, like maybe I could have done something to help more.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice in your body as you talk about this?",
    "Client: I feel this tightness in my chest, like I can't get a full breath. And my shoulders are so tense, they're practically up to my ears. I notice I'm clenching my fists too. It's like my body is getting ready to... I don't know, run or fight or something. Even though I know I'm safe here, it's like my body hasn't gotten the message, you know?",
    "Therapist: Mmm. How do these physical sensations compare to what you felt during the actual event?",
    "Client: They're... they're similar, but not as intense. When it actually happened, I felt like I was frozen in place. My legs were like lead, and I couldn't move. Now, it's more like... like an echo of that feeling. I can move, but there's this heaviness, this reluctance. And the images... they're not as sharp as they were in the moment, but they're still there, flickering in the back of my mind.",
    "Therapist: I see. What else comes up for you?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking about the sounds. The screams, the shattering glass. It's like they're stuck in my head on a loop. And I find myself getting angry too. Angry at the driver who caused the accident, angry at myself for not being able to do more. But then I feel guilty for being angry, because I know accidents happen and... it's just this confusing mess of emotions, you know?",
    "Therapist: How do you make sense of these conflicting emotions?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me knows it's normal to feel this way, but another part feels like I shouldn't be so affected. I mean, I wasn't even directly involved in the accident. But then I think about how it's changed my life, how I can't even enjoy a simple car ride anymore without feeling panicked. It's like... like the accident stole something from me, my sense of safety maybe? And I'm struggling to get it back.",
    "Therapist: Mm. What does it mean to you to try to get that sense of safety back?",
    "Client: It means... it means being able to live my life without constantly looking over my shoulder. To be able to drive or be a passenger without my heart racing. To walk down the street without flinching at every car that passes by. I want to feel in control again, you know? Like I have some say in what happens to me. Right now, it feels like danger is lurking around every corner, and I hate living like that. I want to be able to enjoy life again, to not let this one moment define everything for me.",
    "Therapist: How do you think this therapy process is contributing to that goal?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard, really hard. Reliving these memories, feeling all these intense emotions... sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. But then I notice small changes. Like, the other day, I was able to sit in a car for a short trip without having a full-blown panic attack. It was still uncomfortable, but it felt like progress. And talking about it here, facing it head-on... it's terrifying, but it also feels like I'm taking back some control. Like I'm not just a victim of my memories anymore, but actively working through them. It's exhausting, but... I think it's helping. Slowly, but it's helping.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What's coming up for you now as you reflect on this?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... I don't know, a mix of things. There's still fear and anxiety, definitely. But there's also a tiny spark of hope. Like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this. It's not going to be easy, and I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I can see a possibility of things getting better. And that's... that's something to hold onto, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How would you like to use this insight moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I think I want to try to hold onto that hope, even when things get tough. To remind myself that even though the process is painful, it's leading somewhere. Maybe I can try to be a little kinder to myself too, you know? Recognize that it's okay to struggle, that healing takes time. And maybe... maybe I can try to take small steps outside my comfort zone. Like, perhaps I could try sitting in a parked car for a few minutes, just to get used to the feeling again. Baby steps, but steps forward nonetheless.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful plan. How are you feeling now, as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, honestly. Talking about this, reliving it... it takes a lot out of me. But I also feel a bit lighter, like I've let go of some of the weight I've been carrying. There's still a lot to work through, but I feel like I understand my reactions a bit better now. And even though it's scary, I'm... I'm grateful for this process. It's hard, but it feels important, you know?",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. We'll pick up here next time."
