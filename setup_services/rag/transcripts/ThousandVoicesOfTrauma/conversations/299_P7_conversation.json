    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Johnson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit nervous about diving into this again.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Right, thank you. I'll try to keep that in mind. So, where should I start?",
    "Therapist: Let's begin with the cult experience you mentioned last time.",
    "Client: Okay... It was about 15 years ago. I was feeling lost, you know? My divorce had just finalized, and I was struggling with anxiety. That's when I met them. They seemed so welcoming, so understanding. At first, it felt like I'd found a family.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: They had these meetings, rituals really. We'd gather in this dimly lit room, candles everywhere. The leader, he'd speak for hours about how we were special, chosen. I remember the incense, it was thick in the air. Sometimes, I can still smell it, and it makes my stomach turn.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. You're safe now.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's just... they started asking for more and more. More time, more money. They isolated us from our families, our friends. I lost touch with my kids for a while. God, how could I have been so stupid?",
    "Therapist: You weren't stupid. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: Right, right. Sorry. Um, there was this one night. They told us we needed to prove our dedication. They... they wanted us to drink something. Said it would \"purify\" us. I was scared, but I felt like I couldn't say no. Everyone was watching, expecting me to do it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What happened next?",
    "Client: I drank it. It tasted bitter, metallic almost. Within minutes, I started feeling dizzy, nauseous. The room was spinning, and I could hear chanting, but it sounded distant, like I was underwater. I remember feeling so alone, so scared. I wanted to call for help, but I couldn't move.",
    "Therapist: That must have been terrifying. You're very brave.",
    "Client: It was. I... I think I passed out. When I woke up, I was in a different room. My clothes were gone, and I was covered in some kind of oil. I felt violated, used. That's when I knew I had to get out, but I was afraid they wouldn't let me leave.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My heart's racing. I can feel the panic rising, just like it did then. It's hard to breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm trying. It's just... remembering all this, it brings it all back. The fear, the shame, the anger at myself for falling for it all.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel those emotions. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: Thanks. It took me weeks to finally leave. I had to sneak out in the middle of the night, leaving everything behind. I was homeless for a while after that. It was rough, but still better than being there. Sometimes I still have nightmares about it, about them finding me and dragging me back.",
    "Therapist: You showed incredible strength. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Drained, but... maybe a little lighter? It's strange, talking about it like this. It's painful, but it also feels like I'm taking some of its power away. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's a common experience. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I hope so. I want to move past this, to not let it control me anymore. But sometimes it feels impossible.",
    "Therapist: It's not impossible. You're proving that right now.",
    "Client: You're right. I am here, talking about it. That's something, isn't it? I just wish I could shake this feeling of shame, of being weak for falling for it all.",
    "Therapist: You weren't weak. You were vulnerable and taken advantage of.",
    "Client: I know that logically, but emotionally... it's harder to accept. But I'm trying. I really am. I want to be able to trust people again, to not always be looking over my shoulder.",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. We'll work towards that together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your help with all this. It's not easy, but I think it's necessary. I want to be able to look back on this as something I survived, not something that defines me.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent perspective. You're making real progress.",
    "Client: I hope so. It's been a long journey, and I know I still have a way to go. But for the first time in a long time, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can get there.",
    "Therapist: You absolutely can. Our time is almost up. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... okay. Better than I expected, actually. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You did the hard work. I'm proud of your efforts today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm looking forward to our next session, even if it's challenging. I feel like I'm finally moving forward.",
    "Therapist: That's great to hear. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
