    "Therapist: Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: I'm not really sure what to expect. I've been dreading this part of the therapy, to be honest. The idea of reliving those moments... it's scary. Plus, with my chronic pain, I'm worried it might make things worse physically.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. Let's take it slow. Can you tell me more about your worries?",
    "Client: Well, I'm afraid of losing control. What if I can't handle the memories? And honestly, I'm embarrassed about some of the things that happened. It's hard to talk about the neglect I experienced, especially as a man. In my culture, we're expected to be strong and not show vulnerability.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your honesty. How can I support you today?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe just reassure me that it's okay to feel overwhelmed? And maybe explain a bit more about what we're going to do? I'm feeling pretty anxious about the whole thing.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Feeling overwhelmed is normal. We'll go at your pace. Shall I explain the process?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think knowing what to expect might help calm my nerves a bit. And... is it okay if we take breaks if my pain flares up? Sometimes stress makes it worse.",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll pause whenever you need. Now, about the process...",
    "Client: Okay, I'm listening. Sorry if I seem a bit on edge. It's just... this is bringing up a lot of emotions I've tried to bury for a long time. But I want to get better, so I'll do my best to engage with the process.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is admirable. Let's start with a brief overview. Ready?",
    "Client: I think so. Just... please be patient with me if I struggle. This isn't easy for me to talk about, especially with another man. In my family, showing emotions was seen as weakness. But I'm trying to unlearn that.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Your courage is commendable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Okay, yes. I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Just... if you see me tensing up or if I look like I'm in pain, could you remind me to breathe? Sometimes I forget when I'm stressed, and it makes my chronic pain worse.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'll guide you through. Let's start with a deep breath..."
