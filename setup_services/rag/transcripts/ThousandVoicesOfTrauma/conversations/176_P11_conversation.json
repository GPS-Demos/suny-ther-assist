    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sam?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is still racing, you know? Going through that airplane crash memory again... it's intense. My heart's still pounding a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. But at the same time, there's this weird sense of relief? Like, I got through it, you know?",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you this time?",
    "Client: The sounds. God, the sounds were so vivid. The screeching of metal, people screaming... It's like I was right back there. And the smell of smoke, it was so strong in my nose. I could feel the panic rising in my chest, just like it did that day. But... I don't know, something felt different this time. Like, I knew I was here, in this room, even while I was reliving it. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it does. How did that feel?",
    "Client: It felt... empowering, I guess? Like, yeah, I was scared, but I wasn't completely lost in the memory. I could remind myself that I survived, that I'm safe now. It's still hard, don't get me wrong. But it feels like maybe I'm gaining some control over it?",
    "Therapist: That's a significant observation. How does this relate to your day-to-day experiences?",
    "Client: Well, I've been having fewer flashbacks lately. And when they do happen, they're not as overwhelming. Like yesterday, I heard a loud bang outside, and it startled me, but I didn't spiral into a full-blown panic attack like I used to. I was able to take some deep breaths and remind myself where I was. It's... it's progress, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What do you think has contributed to this change?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's because we've been facing these memories head-on. Before, I was always trying to run from them, you know? But now, it's like... the more I confront them, the less power they have over me. And the breathing techniques you taught me, they've been a lifesaver. It's like I have tools now, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's great insight, Sam. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's scary, for sure. Part of me still wants to avoid it all. But... I can see the progress I'm making. And that makes me want to keep going. I want my life back, you know? I don't want to be afraid of flying forever, or jump at every loud noise. I want to be able to help others who've been through similar things. So yeah, I'm in. It's hard, but I'm in.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is admirable. What's your focus for this week?",
    "Client: I think... I want to try using the bus again. I've been avoiding public transportation since the crash, but I know I can't keep relying on others for rides. Maybe I'll start with a short trip, use those breathing techniques if I start feeling anxious. And I'll keep practicing the imaginal exposure at home, even though it's tough. Baby steps, right?",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a solid plan. How can I support you?",
    "Client: Just... keep doing what you're doing, I guess? Having this space to process everything, knowing I'm not alone in this... it means a lot. And maybe we could go over some strategies for managing anxiety on public transport next time? I'm nervous about that.",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll address that in our next session. Anything else?",
    "Client: No, I think that's it for now. Thanks for... you know, for everything. For helping me face this stuff. I know I've got a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I might actually be okay someday. That's... that's huge for me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work, Sam. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yeah, definitely. See you then."
