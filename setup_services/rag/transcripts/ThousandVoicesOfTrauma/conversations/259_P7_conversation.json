    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about some difficult things, and I'm not sure if I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel nervous. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. I guess we should start. I remember that day so vividly. I was in my cell, alone. The walls felt like they were closing in on me. I could hear the guards' footsteps echoing down the hallway.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I was curled up on my bunk, trying to make myself as small as possible. I knew what was coming. Every time I heard those footsteps, my heart would race. I felt so helpless, so trapped.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) The door opened, and he was there. The guard. He had this look in his eyes that made my skin crawl. I wanted to disappear, to melt into the wall. But there was nowhere to go.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: (starts crying) He... he came closer. I could smell his breath. It was awful. He grabbed my arm, and I felt like I was going to be sick. I tried to pull away, but he was so strong. I felt so weak, so powerless.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to cry. You're doing great.",
    "Client: (through sobs) He pushed me down on the bunk. I closed my eyes. I didn't want to see his face. I tried to think of something else, anything else. But I could feel everything. His hands, his weight on me. I felt like I couldn't breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Remember, you're here now.",
    "Client: (taking deep breaths) It felt like it went on forever. When it was over, he just left. Didn't say a word. I lay there, feeling broken, dirty. I wanted to scream, but no sound would come out. I felt so alone, so ashamed.",
    "Therapist: You're incredibly strong. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's hard. Remembering all of this... it makes me feel like I'm back there. But I also feel... I don't know... maybe a little stronger? Like I can talk about it without falling apart completely.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. You should be proud.",
    "Client: I guess so. It's just... sometimes I still have nightmares. I wake up feeling like I'm still in that cell, like it's about to happen all over again. Will that ever go away?",
    "Therapist: It can improve with time and work. You're doing well.",
    "Client: I hope so. I want to be able to sleep without fear. To live without constantly looking over my shoulder. To feel safe in my own skin again. Is that even possible after what happened?",
    "Therapist: It is possible. You're already showing strength.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm trying. It's just... sometimes I feel so angry. At him, at the system that allowed it to happen, at myself for not being able to stop it. How do I deal with all this anger?",
    "Therapist: Anger is normal. We can work on managing it.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's just... sometimes I feel like I'm drowning in all these emotions. The fear, the anger, the shame. It's overwhelming. How do I keep going when it feels like too much?",
    "Therapist: One step at a time. You're doing it right now.",
    "Client: (sighs) You're right. I am here, talking about it. That's something, isn't it? I never thought I'd be able to do even this much. Maybe there is hope for me after all.",
    "Therapist: There absolutely is. You're making progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think... I think I need a break now. This has been intense. But I feel... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've let go of a tiny piece of the burden I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. We'll stop here for today.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you for listening, for helping me through this. I know it's not easy to hear these things either. I appreciate your support.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care of yourself this week.",
    "Client: I will. See you next time."
