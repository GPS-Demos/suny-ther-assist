    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart is still racing, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. The memory of that dog attack... it's like I'm right back there in that moment, you know? I can still hear the growling, feel the fear coursing through my body. It's like I'm that scared little boy all over again.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Terror. Absolute terror. Even though I know I'm safe here, there's this primal fear that won't let go. My palms are sweaty, and I keep wanting to look over my shoulder, like that dog might suddenly appear out of nowhere. It's... it's exhausting, really. I didn't realize how much energy it takes to relive these memories.",
    "Therapist: How does this compare to when you usually think about the attack?",
    "Client: It's... it's much more intense. Usually, I try to push the memories away as quickly as possible. But now, it's like I'm fully immersed in it. I can smell the grass in the park where it happened, feel the summer heat on my skin. And the pain... God, I can almost feel the dog's teeth again. It's making me nauseous just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"Why me?\" Why did this have to happen to me? I was just a kid, you know? And then I feel angry. Angry at the owner who couldn't control their dog, angry at my parents for not being there to protect me. And then I feel guilty for being angry at them. It's this whole mess of emotions that I don't know how to untangle.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings connect to your day-to-day life?",
    "Client: I... I never really thought about it before, but I guess it explains a lot. My constant anxiety, always being on edge. I've always been overprotective of my own kids, never letting them play in the park alone. And my drinking... I think I've been using it to numb these feelings, to forget. It's like this trauma has been controlling my life without me even realizing it.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your body right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking a little. My muscles are so tense, especially in my shoulders and jaw. I keep clenching my fists without realizing it. And there's this hollow feeling in my stomach, like I'm about to be sick. It's amazing how vivid these physical sensations are, even after all these years.",
    "Therapist: How does talking about this make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's strange. Part of me feels relieved, like I'm finally letting out something I've been holding in for decades. But there's also this vulnerability that scares me. I've spent so long trying to be strong, to pretend this didn't affect me. Admitting how much it still hurts... it's terrifying. But also... maybe a little freeing?",
    "Therapist: What's the hardest part about revisiting this memory?",
    "Client: The hardest part is... feeling so helpless again. In my daily life, I'm successful, I'm in control. But when I go back to that memory, I'm just a scared, powerless kid. It makes me question everything about myself. Am I really as strong as I think I am? Or am I just pretending, and deep down I'm still that frightened child?",
    "Therapist: How do you see this experience shaping your life?",
    "Client: I... I think it's shaped everything, in ways I'm only now beginning to understand. My need for control, my anxiety, my drinking... it all traces back to this. But it's also made me who I am. I'm protective, yes, but also empathetic. I can't stand to see others suffer. Maybe... maybe there's a way to acknowledge this part of me without letting it control me anymore.",
    "Therapist: What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I... I think I need a moment to breathe. To remind myself that I'm here, in the present, and I'm safe. And... I think I need to not be alone right now. Just having someone here, listening, understanding... it helps. It makes me feel less... broken, I guess. Like maybe I can get through this.",
    "Therapist: Take all the time you need. I'm here with you.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I never thought I'd be able to talk about this. It's always been this dark, secret thing I carried alone. But sharing it, as hard as it is, it's like... like I'm starting to see a way forward. A way to maybe not let this define me anymore. It's scary, but... I think I'm ready to keep going.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm nervous, but I think I'm ready. For the first time in a long time, I feel a glimmer of hope. Like maybe I can finally start to heal from this. It won't be easy, I know that. But I'm tired of letting this control my life. I want to be free from it, to be the father and husband I know I can be. So yeah, I'm scared, but I'm also... determined. I want to keep going.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's giving you hope?",
    "Client: I think... it's the fact that I was able to face this memory and survive it. For so long, I thought if I really let myself remember, it would destroy me. But here I am, shaken up, sure, but still standing. And having you here, guiding me through it, makes me feel like I'm not alone in this fight anymore. It's like... for the first time, I can see a future where this doesn't control me.",
    "Therapist: How would you like to close our session today?",
    "Client: I... I think I need a few minutes to just sit quietly, if that's okay. To let everything we've talked about settle. And then... maybe we could go over some grounding techniques? Something to help me feel more centered when these memories come up outside of our sessions. I know this is just the beginning, but I feel like I've taken a huge step today. It's exhausting, but also... kind of exhilarating.",
