    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the accident you experienced?",
    "Client: Okay... It was a sunny day, and I was driving to work. The roads were busy, but nothing out of the ordinary. I remember feeling good that morning, looking forward to a project I was working on. Then, out of nowhere, I heard a loud screeching noise. Before I could even react, I felt a massive impact from behind. My car lurched forward, and I lost control. Everything happened so fast...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: My car spun around, and I remember seeing other vehicles coming towards me. I was terrified, thinking I was going to be hit again. The airbag deployed, and there was this awful smell of burning rubber. I couldn't move, and my chest felt so tight. I was gasping for air, thinking I might be seriously hurt or even dying. The pain was intense, especially in my neck and back.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I can hear people shouting outside the car. Someone's asking if I'm okay, but I can't respond. I'm just frozen, staring at the cracked windshield. There's glass everywhere. I can taste blood in my mouth, and my hands are shaking uncontrollably. I'm overwhelmed by this feeling of helplessness and fear. What if I can't work again? What if I'm permanently injured?",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The next few minutes felt like hours. I could hear sirens in the distance, getting closer. I was still struggling to breathe normally, and the pain was getting worse. When the paramedics arrived, they had to cut me out of the car. That was terrifying - the loud noise of the tools, the feeling of being trapped. As they were working, I kept thinking about how close I came to dying, how everything could have ended right there on that road.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. What happened next?",
    "Client: They put me on a stretcher and into the ambulance. The ride to the hospital was a blur of pain and fear. I remember staring at the ceiling of the ambulance, trying to make sense of what had just happened. At the hospital, there were so many tests - X-rays, CT scans. I was diagnosed with whiplash, a concussion, and some broken ribs. But even after they told me I would recover, I couldn't shake this feeling of vulnerability. It was like my sense of safety had been shattered along with my car.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: The recovery was slow and painful. Physically, I was healing, but mentally, I was struggling. I had nightmares about the accident, and I'd wake up in a cold sweat, reliving those terrifying moments. Driving became a huge challenge. Every time I got behind the wheel, my heart would race, and I'd feel this overwhelming anxiety. It affected my work, my relationships... I felt like I wasn't the same person anymore.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How do you feel now, recalling this?",
    "Client: It's... it's still hard. My heart is racing, and I feel a tightness in my chest. But it's different now. I'm here, safe in this room, and I know it's just a memory. It's strange, but talking about it like this, it feels like I'm starting to process it differently. It's still painful, but maybe... maybe I'm starting to regain some control over how it affects me.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's take a deep breath together.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It's still intense, but I feel like I'm facing it now, instead of running from it. Is this... is this what healing feels like?",
    "Therapist: It can be. You're showing remarkable strength.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's been a long journey, and I know I still have a way to go. But for the first time in a while, I feel a glimmer of hope. Like maybe I can work through this and not let it define me forever. It's scary, but also... empowering, I guess?",
    "Therapist: That's a positive outlook. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling drained, but also a bit lighter. Like I've released some of the weight I've been carrying. It's still there, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming. I'm grateful for this space to process everything. It's not easy, but I think it's helping. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Let's end here."
