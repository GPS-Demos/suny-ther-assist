    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Lim. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, Dr. Chen. I know we're going to talk about the earthquake again, and it's always hard for me.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'll try my best. Where should I start?",
    "Therapist: Begin with the moment you first felt the tremors.",
    "Client: Okay... It was early morning. I was in the kitchen, making tea. Suddenly, the floor started shaking. At first, I thought I was dizzy, but then the cups started rattling. The shaking got stronger, and I realized it was an earthquake. I froze, not knowing what to do.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The shaking intensified. I could hear things falling and breaking all around me. I wanted to run, but I couldn't move. I was paralyzed with fear. The walls were creaking, and I thought the house would collapse any second.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe now.",
    "Client: It's hard... I remember the fear, the panic. I couldn't breathe properly. I kept thinking about my husband, who was still upstairs. I wanted to call out to him, but no sound came out of my mouth.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Continue.",
    "Client: The ground was moving so violently, I lost my balance and fell. I crawled under the kitchen table, hugging my knees to my chest. I could hear screams from outside, car alarms going off. It felt like the world was ending.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) I... I don't know if I can continue. It's too much.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay... As I was under the table, I heard a loud crash. Part of the ceiling had collapsed in the living room. I was terrified that the same would happen to me. I closed my eyes tightly, praying for it to stop.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Keep going.",
    "Client: The shaking seemed to go on forever. I lost all sense of time. When it finally stopped, everything was eerily quiet for a moment. Then I heard my husband calling for me. His voice sounded so far away. I tried to respond, but my voice was weak and shaky.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How did you feel then?",
    "Client: I felt... helpless. Vulnerable. Like the world I knew had just been shattered. I was afraid to move, afraid that any movement might trigger another quake. When I finally crawled out from under the table, I saw the destruction around me. Our home, which we'd built over decades, was in ruins.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (wiping tears) The aftermath was almost worse than the quake itself. We had to live in a shelter for weeks. The uncertainty, the fear of aftershocks, the loss of our home and possessions... it was overwhelming. Even now, years later, any small tremor sends me into a panic.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable resilience. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. Talking about it brings back all those feelings of fear and helplessness. But also... maybe a little relieved? Like I'm finally facing it instead of running away from the memory.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. You should be proud.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Chen. It's still hard, but I think it's getting a little easier each time we talk about it. I just hope one day I can think about it without feeling so overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's the goal. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I appreciate your support. It means a lot to have someone listen and understand. Sometimes I feel silly for still being so affected by something that happened years ago.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Healing takes time.",
    "Client: You're right. I need to be patient with myself. It's just... sometimes I wish I could forget it all and move on. But I know that's not how it works.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. Processing is important. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think I'm ready to end for today. This session was particularly intense, but I feel like I've made some progress.",
    "Therapist: You have. We'll continue next week.",
    "Client: Alright. Thank you again, Dr. Chen. I'll see you next week.",
    "Therapist: Take care, Mrs. Lim. Remember to use your coping strategies."
