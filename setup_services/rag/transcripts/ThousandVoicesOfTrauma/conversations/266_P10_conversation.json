    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. The idea of revisiting that day at work... it's making my stomach churn a bit. But I know we need to do this, so I'm trying to stay focused.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say... about a 6 out of 10 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. When you're ready, close your eyes and describe that day.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Alright... I'm at my office. It's a Tuesday morning, around 9:30. I remember because I had just poured my second cup of coffee. The sky outside is... oddly dark for that time of day. I can hear my colleagues chatting, the usual morning buzz.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's this... low rumbling sound. At first, I think it's just a truck passing by, but it keeps getting louder. The building starts to shake. My coffee mug... it slides off my desk and shatters. I can hear people starting to shout.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm frozen. My heart is racing. I can't... I can't seem to move. The shaking is getting worse, and I can hear things falling, crashing all around me. Oh God, the windows... they're starting to crack!",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're safe here. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: (Voice shaking) It's... it's an 8. Maybe higher. I can feel my hands trembling, just like they did that day.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Ground yourself. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I finally snap out of it. I dive under my desk, but I can barely fit. The noise is deafening now. I can hear people screaming, furniture toppling over. I'm... I'm terrified. I think, \"This is it. The building's going to collapse.\"",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about my wife. Our last conversation was an argument over something so stupid. And now... now I might never see her again. I'm filled with regret, with fear. I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. Keep going.",
    "Client: The shaking seems to last forever. I can hear glass shattering, people crying out. There's dust everywhere, making it hard to breathe. I'm... I'm praying, begging for it to stop. And then... suddenly... it does.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice in that moment of silence?",
    "Client: It's... it's eerily quiet. For a second, I think maybe I've gone deaf. But then I start to hear whimpers, groans. Someone's sobbing nearby. I'm... I'm afraid to move. What if there's an aftershock?",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe a 9. My chest feels tight, just like it did then.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) Okay... okay. After a minute or two, I slowly crawl out from under the desk. The office is... it's unrecognizable. Desks overturned, papers everywhere. There's a huge crack in the wall near my cubicle. I see one of my colleagues, Sarah, she's bleeding from a cut on her forehead.",
    "Therapist: What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I try to help her. My hands are shaking so badly I can barely hold the tissue I'm pressing to her cut. We're both in shock, I think. I keep expecting the floor to start moving again. Every little sound makes me flinch.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How are you feeling as you help Sarah?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified, but also... I don't know, maybe a bit relieved? That we're alive? But then I start thinking about everyone else in the building, in the city. Are they okay? Did the whole city just... crumble?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those thoughts. What happens next?",
    "Client: We start to hear sirens outside. Lots of them. Someone... I think it's our manager, starts shouting that we need to evacuate. But I'm... I'm paralyzed again. What if the stairwell collapsed? What if there's another quake while we're going down?",
    "Therapist: How do you manage those fears?",
    "Client: I... I force myself to move. One step at a time. We help Sarah up, and a few of us start making our way to the stairs. It's slow going. There's debris everywhere, and we're all unsteady on our feet. The stairwell is dark, and we can hear creaking noises. Every step feels like it might be our last.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8. My palms are sweating just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Inhales deeply) Right... okay. We finally make it outside. The street is... it's chaos. Car alarms blaring, people running, crying. There's dust and smoke everywhere. I can see cracks in the road, a fire hydrant spewing water. It's like... like a war zone.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling as you take in this scene?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm overwhelmed. Shocked. It doesn't feel real. I keep thinking I'll wake up any moment. But the screams, the sirens... they're too vivid to be a nightmare. I'm... I'm scared for my wife. I need to know if she's okay, but cell networks are down.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with that uncertainty?",
    "Client: I... I try to focus on what's in front of me. We gather in a nearby park with other evacuees. I help set up a makeshift first aid station. It gives me something to do, keeps me from spiraling. But every aftershock sends a new wave of panic through me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens as time passes?",
    "Client: Hours go by. We start hearing reports of the damage across the city. It's... it's devastating. I keep trying my phone, desperate to reach my wife. Finally, around sunset, I get through. She's okay. She's okay, and I... I break down. All the fear, the tension... it just comes pouring out.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful moment. How do you feel now, recalling it?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. But also... I don't know, maybe a bit stronger? Like, we survived that. It was horrible, but we made it through.",
    "Therapist: That's a great observation, John. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down. Maybe a 5 or 6? I'm still shaky, but not as overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay... yeah, that sounds good. I... I appreciate you guiding me through this. It's tough, but... I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. Let's do some deep breathing exercises...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, John?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm calmer. Still a bit shaky, but... better. More present.",
    "Therapist: That's great. You've made significant progress today. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later. We'll continue working on this in our next session.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I'm starting to see how this process can help. It's not easy, but... I'm committed to it.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent attitude. Take care of yourself, and I'll see you next week."
