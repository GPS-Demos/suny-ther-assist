    "Therapist: Alright, Priya. Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start. Close your eyes and describe the cult meeting.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in the dimly lit room. The air is thick with incense. I see our leader, Guru Raj, sitting on his elevated cushion. His eyes are piercing, scanning the room. I feel small, insignificant. My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably a 6 out of 10. I can feel my palms getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: Guru Raj starts speaking. His voice is hypnotic, drawing everyone in. He's talking about sacrifice, about giving everything to the cause. I remember feeling conflicted, part of me wanting to believe, another part screaming to run. My stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to an 8. I feel nauseous remembering this.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: He... he's singling people out now. Praising some, shaming others. I'm terrified he'll pick me. My whole body is tense. I can hear my heartbeat in my ears. He's walking towards me now, his hand reaching out...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep breathing. What happens next?",
    "Client: He touches my forehead, says I have potential but I'm holding back. Says I need to let go of my family, my studies. That they're holding me back from enlightenment. I feel so ashamed, so torn. Part of me wants to please him, to belong. But I also feel angry, violated.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: Still at a 9. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: After the meeting, everyone's congratulating me for being \"chosen.\" But I feel hollow inside. Like I've lost a piece of myself. I want to cry but I can't. I'm smiling on the outside but screaming on the inside. I feel so alone, so trapped.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down a bit. Maybe a 7 now. I feel drained.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this. How do you feel now, thinking back on it?",
    "Client: I feel angry. At Guru Raj, at myself for falling for it. But also... relieved? Like I can see it for what it was now. It still hurts, but I feel stronger somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant insight. Final SUDS?",
    "Client: I'd say a 5. I'm exhausted, but I feel like I've faced something important.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today, Priya. Let's start winding down."
