    "Therapist: Mr. Patel, today we'll be starting imaginal exposure. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so, Dr. Singh. But I'm not entirely sure what to expect. Can you explain a bit more about what we'll be doing?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Imaginal exposure involves revisiting your traumatic memory in a safe environment. It helps reduce PTSD symptoms over time.",
    "Client: I see. But won't that be... difficult? I mean, thinking about what happened when I witnessed that human trafficking incident... it's not easy.",
    "Therapist: It can be challenging, yes. How are you feeling about it?",
    "Client: To be honest, I'm nervous. My heart's already racing just thinking about it. And with my chronic pain acting up lately, I'm worried it might make things worse.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace and can pause anytime. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's somewhat reassuring. I appreciate your understanding, Dr. Singh. It helps that you're closer to my age and can relate to some of my experiences. But I'm still apprehensive. What if I can't handle it?",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. Remember, you're in control. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Well, how long will this session last? And what exactly am I supposed to do? Just... talk about what happened?",
    "Therapist: The session will last about 45 minutes. You'll describe the event in detail, in the present tense, as if it's happening now.",
    "Client: That sounds intense. I'm not sure if I can do that for 45 minutes straight. What if I get overwhelmed or my pain flares up?",
    "Therapist: We can take breaks as needed. Your well-being is the priority. How else can I support you?",
    "Client: I appreciate that, Dr. Singh. Maybe... could we have a signal if I need to stop? And is it okay if I bring up how this relates to losing my brother? That loss is still raw, and somehow it feels connected to witnessing the trafficking incident.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's use a hand signal for pauses. And yes, discussing your brother is welcome. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Okay, I think I'm ready. It's strange, feeling scared but also hopeful. This might help me process both traumas, right? I want to be able to think about these events without feeling paralyzed by fear and grief. And maybe it'll help me be more present for my family too.",
    "Therapist: Your insight is spot-on. This process can indeed help with both experiences. Are you comfortable starting now?",
    "Client: Yes, I am. Thank you for your patience and guidance, Dr. Singh. I'm nervous, but I trust you and this process. Let's do this."
