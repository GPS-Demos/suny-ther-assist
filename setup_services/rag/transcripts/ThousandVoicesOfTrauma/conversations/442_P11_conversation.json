    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Maria?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like I'm right back there in that hospital room, you know? The beeping of the machines, the smell of disinfectant... it's all so vivid. I can still feel the fear and helplessness washing over me.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The moment when the man pulled out the gun. I remember freezing, my heart racing. I couldn't believe it was happening. I kept thinking about my family, wondering if I'd see them again. It's... it's overwhelming to relive that.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to share that now?",
    "Client: It's... difficult, but also a bit relieving? Like, I've carried this weight for so long, and now I'm finally letting some of it out. But it also makes me anxious, you know? Like, what if talking about it makes it worse?",
    "Therapist: That's a common concern. How has it been affecting you?",
    "Client: Well, I've been having trouble sleeping lately. Nightmares about being trapped, feeling powerless. And during the day, I'm constantly on edge, especially in crowded places. It's affecting my work, my relationships... I feel like I'm not fully present anymore.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does this connect to your recovery goals?",
    "Client: I... I guess I want to feel safe again. To be able to go to a hospital without panicking, to not flinch every time I hear a loud noise. I want to be present for my family without this constant fear looming over me.",
    "Therapist: Those are important goals. What's helping you move forward?",
    "Client: Talking about it, as hard as it is, helps. And... learning to breathe through the panic attacks has been a lifesaver. Sometimes, I catch myself using those techniques even when I'm not in a full-blown attack, and it helps me stay grounded.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Maria. What else have you noticed?",
    "Client: I've started opening up to my husband more. He's been so patient, and it feels good to not carry this burden alone. And at work, I've been more honest about needing breaks or having difficult days. It's scary, but also... freeing?",
    "Therapist: How does that openness feel?",
    "Client: It's a mix of vulnerability and strength, if that makes sense? Like, I'm admitting I'm not okay, which is terrifying, but also empowering because I'm taking control of my healing.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What's challenging right now?",
    "Client: The flashbacks. They still catch me off guard sometimes. Like yesterday, I was at the grocery store and someone dropped a can. The sound... it took me right back to that hospital room. I had to leave my cart and get out of there.",
    "Therapist: How did you cope with that moment?",
    "Client: I... I used the grounding techniques we've practiced. Focused on my breathing, named five things I could see. It helped, but I still felt shaken for hours after.",
    "Therapist: You're applying what you've learned. How does that feel?",
    "Client: It feels... good, I guess? Like I'm not completely helpless anymore. But it's also frustrating that I still react so strongly. I want to be \"normal\" again, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What does \"normal\" look like to you?",
    "Client: Being able to go about my day without constantly looking over my shoulder. Enjoying time with my family without this dark cloud hanging over me. Being able to watch a medical drama on TV without having a panic attack. Just... living without fear.",
    "Therapist: Those are great goals. How can we work towards them?",
    "Client: I think... continuing these sessions, for sure. Maybe practicing more with real-life situations? Like, could we work on strategies for when I need to go to a doctor's appointment? And... I'd like to involve my family more in my recovery, if that's possible.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll explore those ideas. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... hopeful? Like, reliving that memory was brutal, but talking it through like this... it makes it feel more manageable somehow. Less like this big, scary monster and more like something I can face, bit by bit.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful shift. What's one thing you're proud of today?",
    "Client: I'm proud that I made it through the imaginal exposure without completely falling apart. A few months ago, I couldn't even think about that day without having a panic attack. Now, it's still hard, but... I did it. I faced it.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress, Maria. How will you take care of yourself today?",
    "Client: I think I'll take a long bath when I get home, maybe do some of those mindfulness exercises we talked about. And I'll let my husband know I had a tough session so he can give me some extra support tonight.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a good plan. Remember, you're not alone in this.",
    "Client: Thank you. It means a lot to hear that. Sometimes I feel so isolated in this experience, you know? But these sessions... they help me remember that I'm not the only one who's gone through something like this. And that recovery is possible.",
    "Therapist: That's right. Is there anything else you want to discuss today?",
    "Client: No, I think I'm pretty drained. But... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm finally moving forward instead of just treading water.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work, Maria. I'll see you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, definitely. Thank you again."
