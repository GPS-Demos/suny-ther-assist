    "Therapist: Welcome. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. A bit on edge, I guess. We're going to talk about the earthquake, right? It's been on my mind a lot lately.",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's our focus. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. It's just... it feels so vivid still. But I want to work through this.",
    "Therapist: Understood. Let's start with your SUDS level.",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 6 right now. My stomach's in knots just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath and describe the scene.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm in my dorm room. It's late afternoon, and I'm trying to study for a big exam. The room starts to shake. At first, I think it's just a truck passing by, but then... then everything starts rattling. Books fall off the shelves, and I can hear people screaming in the hallway.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: My desk is shaking so hard, my laptop almost falls off. The floor feels like it's moving under my feet. I... I can't keep my balance. I grab onto the doorframe, but it's still shaking. God, it feels like it's never going to stop.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to an 8. My heart's racing just talking about it.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I try to get out of the room, but the door is jammed. I'm panicking now. I can hear glass breaking somewhere. The lights flicker and go out. It's so dark, and I can't see anything. I'm trapped, and I don't know if the building is going to collapse.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking I might die here. That no one will find me. I'm thinking about my family, my partner... oh god, I can't breathe...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're here now, safe. Take a moment.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... okay. I'm here. It's just... it felt so real again.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. What happens after the shaking stops?",
    "Client: It's quiet. Too quiet. I can hear some people crying in the distance. I'm still in the dark, and I don't know if it's safe to move. I'm shaking so bad, I can barely stand. I try to use my phone for light, but the network's down. I feel so alone, so helpless.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still at an 8. My hands are sweating just talking about it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I manage to force the door open. The hallway is a mess. There's debris everywhere, and some of the ceiling tiles have fallen. I can see some of my floormates huddled together at the end of the hall. They look as scared as I feel. We don't know what to do, whether to stay or try to get out.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel in that moment?",
    "Client: Terrified. Lost. I'm supposed to be an adult, but I feel like a scared child. I want someone to tell me what to do, to make it all okay. But everyone around me is just as scared and confused.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. What do you do next?",
    "Client: We... we decide to try to get out of the building. We're all holding hands, like kids on a field trip. It feels silly, but also comforting. We make our way down the stairs slowly. Every aftershock sends us into a panic. I keep thinking about how the stairs could collapse at any moment.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe a 7 now. Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also making it feel less overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: We finally make it outside. The campus is chaos. People are everywhere, some crying, some just staring blankly. I can see some buildings have partially collapsed. There's dust in the air, and sirens in the distance. It's like a scene from a disaster movie, but it's real. It's happening to us.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling as you look around?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in shock, I think. It doesn't feel real. I keep expecting to wake up. But then I see someone I know, a girl from my class. She's bleeding from a cut on her forehead. That's when it really hits me. This is real. This happened. We could have died.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that realization. What thoughts go through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I think about how fragile everything is. How in just a few minutes, our whole world changed. I think about my family, wondering if they're okay, if they know I'm alive. I feel guilty for not calling them more often, for all the petty arguments we've had. What if I never see them again?",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually down to a 6 now. Talking about it... it's helping. It's still hard, but it feels less overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: We spend the night on the campus lawn. No one wants to go back inside. There are aftershocks all night. Every time the ground shakes, people scream. I can't sleep. I just lie there, staring at the stars, wondering how something so beautiful can exist in a world that feels so chaotic and dangerous.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind during that night?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking about how unprepared I am for something like this. How I've taken so much for granted. I think about all the things I wanted to do, the places I wanted to see. I promise myself that if I make it through this, I'll live differently. I'll appreciate things more. But I also feel so small and insignificant. Like nothing I do really matters in the face of something so powerful.",
    "Therapist: Those are profound thoughts. How do you feel now, remembering that night?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of emotions. There's still fear, definitely. But also a kind of... I don't know, maybe gratitude? For surviving, for being here now. It's complicated.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What happens the next morning?",
    "Client: The sun rises, and it feels surreal. Like, how can the world just go on after something like this? We start to hear news trickling in. The extent of the damage, the number of casualties. It's overwhelming. But there's also this sense of community forming. People sharing food, comforting strangers. It's beautiful and heartbreaking at the same time.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually down to a 5 now. Talking about it, going through it again... it's helping. It's still hard, but it feels less like this big, scary thing I can't face.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. How do you feel about the progress you've made today?",
    "Client: I... I feel proud, actually. And a little surprised. I was so scared to talk about this, but it feels good to get it out. Like I'm taking some control back.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. We'll continue working through this in our next session. For now, let's do a grounding exercise before we end.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you. This... this really helped.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad. Let's start the grounding exercise. Name five things you can see in this room."
