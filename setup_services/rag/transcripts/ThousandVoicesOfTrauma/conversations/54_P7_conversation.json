    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Can you describe the workplace incident?",
    "Client: Okay... It was a typical day at the office. I was working late, finishing up some reports. The building was mostly empty. I heard footsteps coming down the hall, but I didn't think much of it. Suddenly, my coworker Juan burst into my office. He looked... terrified. He was sweating and shaking. He told me there was an armed man in the building. I... I froze. I didn't know what to do.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I remember my heart started racing. I could hear it pounding in my ears. Juan and I ducked under my desk. We were trying to be as quiet as possible. The footsteps were getting closer. I was shaking so badly, I thought the desk might move. I kept thinking about my family, wondering if I'd ever see them again.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: It was... overwhelming. The fear was suffocating. We heard glass breaking in the distance, and I had to fight the urge to scream. Juan was silently crying next to me. I reached out and held his hand. It felt like hours, but it was probably only minutes. Then we heard sirens. The footsteps moved away quickly. We stayed under the desk, unsure if it was safe to come out.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: When the police finally found us, I was in shock. I couldn't stop shaking. They told us the gunman had been apprehended, but I still felt so... vulnerable. In the days after, I couldn't sleep. Every little noise made me jump. I kept reliving those moments under the desk, feeling trapped and helpless. I... I had to quit my job. I couldn't go back to that building. Even now, years later, I still have nightmares about it.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel emotional. You're doing great.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) Sometimes I feel so angry. Angry that this happened to me, that it changed my life so drastically. I was looking forward to retiring from that job, you know? I had friends there, a routine. And in one night, it was all taken away. I feel... I feel robbed of the life I was supposed to have.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Keep going.",
    "Client: The worst part is the guilt. Juan... he never came back to work either. Last I heard, he was struggling with severe anxiety and depression. I wonder if I could have done more to help him that night, or afterward. Maybe if I had been braver, or thought faster, things would have turned out differently. (starts crying) I'm sorry, I... I didn't expect this to hit me so hard.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to cry. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (taking deep breaths) Thank you. It's just... even after all this time, it feels so raw. I've tried to move on, to focus on my family and my retirement, but it's always there in the background. Every time I see a news story about a workplace shooting, I'm right back under that desk. I feel like I lost a part of myself that night, a sense of security that I'll never get back.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (sighs) I suppose the one positive thing is that it made me appreciate my family more. After that night, I never took a moment with them for granted. But it also made me more anxious about their safety. I worry constantly when my husband is at work or my grandkids are at school. It's exhausting, always waiting for the other shoe to drop. I just want to feel normal again, you know? To not be scared all the time.",
    "Therapist: Your resilience is admirable. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also a little lighter. Talking about it is hard, but I can see how it might help. I want to be able to think about that night without falling apart. I want to remember the strength it took to survive, rather than just the fear. It's a long road, but I'm willing to keep trying. Thank you for listening and guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. We'll end here."
