    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's like my emotions are all over the place. The memory of losing my father feels so fresh again, even though it's been two years. I can still see his face in the hospital bed, and it's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Guilt. Overwhelming guilt. I keep thinking about all the times I was too busy with work to visit him. And now, with this cyberbullying situation... it's like I'm failing him all over again. I should be stronger, you know? He always taught me to stand up for myself, but I feel so... helpless.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt manifest in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a heavy weight on my chest. My shoulders feel tense, and there's this knot in my stomach that won't go away. I feel like I can't breathe properly. It's almost like... like I'm drowning in these feelings.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are accompanying these physical sensations?",
    "Client: I keep hearing his voice, telling me to be strong. But then I see those awful comments online, and I feel like I'm letting him down. I think, \"What would he say if he saw me now, unable to defend myself?\" It's... it's like I'm failing him all over again. And then I wonder, if I had been a better daughter, spent more time with him, maybe... maybe things would be different now.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts connect to your broader experience of trauma?",
    "Client: I... I guess it's all tied together. Losing Dad was the biggest trauma of my life, and now this cyberbullying... it's like I'm losing myself too. I feel vulnerable and exposed, just like I did when he was sick. There's this constant fear that I'm not good enough, that I'm always letting someone down. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Part of me wants to curl up and hide from the world. But another part... another part wants to find a way to be strong, to make Dad proud. I just... I wish I knew how to do that without feeling so overwhelmed and scared all the time.",
    "Therapist: How might your father respond to your current struggles?",
    "Client: (long pause) He... he would probably tell me to take it one day at a time. Dad was always patient, always kind. He'd remind me that it's okay to feel scared, but not to let fear stop me. I can almost hear him saying, \"My little warrior, you're stronger than you know.\" But it's so hard to believe that sometimes, especially when I see those horrible messages online.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you could take to honor his memory?",
    "Client: I... I could try to be kinder to myself, I suppose. Dad always said I was my own worst critic. Maybe... maybe I could try to see myself through his eyes, even for just a moment each day. And with the cyberbullying, perhaps I could reach out for help instead of trying to handle it all alone. That's what he would want, I think.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... it's both comforting and terrifying. The thought of opening up, of being vulnerable... it scares me. But I also feel a tiny spark of hope. Like maybe, just maybe, I can find a way through this. It's not going to be easy, but... but I want to try. For Dad, and for myself.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's a mix. There's still sadness and fear, but also... a glimmer of determination. I'm tired of feeling helpless. I want to find a way to honor Dad's memory and stand up for myself. It's scary, but... but I think it's necessary. I just hope I have the strength to follow through.",
    "Therapist: How can we support that determination in our sessions?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need help developing coping strategies. Both for dealing with the grief that still hits me in waves, and for handling this cyberbullying situation. Maybe we could work on building my confidence? And... and perhaps explore ways to set boundaries online without completely isolating myself. I want to feel strong again, like the person my father believed I could be.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Shall we start there next session?",
    "Client: Yes, I... I think that would be good. It's still scary, and I know there will be difficult moments, but I feel... I feel a bit more hopeful now. Like maybe I can find a way to navigate through this and come out stronger on the other side. Thank you for listening and guiding me through this process. It means more than I can express.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. I'm here to support you on this journey.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's... it's been a long time since I've felt like I had someone in my corner like this. It reminds me of how Dad used to make me feel - supported and understood. I know we have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can face these challenges. It won't be easy, but... but I'm willing to try.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. How are you feeling as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've released some of the pressure that's been building up inside me. There's still a lot to process, and I know we've only scratched the surface, but I feel... lighter somehow. More grounded. It's as if sharing these thoughts and feelings has helped me reconnect with a part of myself I thought I'd lost. I'm nervous about what's to come, but also... cautiously optimistic.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. We'll continue next time.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm looking forward to it, even though I know it won't be easy. But I think... I think Dad would be proud of me for taking this step. For trying to face my fears and work through these issues. I just hope I can hold onto this feeling of determination when things get tough again. But knowing I have this support... it makes a big difference. Thank you for your patience and guidance today.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care until our next session.",
    "Client: I will, thank you. And... and thank you for creating a safe space for me to explore these difficult emotions. It means more than I can say. I'll try to practice some self-compassion before our next meeting, just like we discussed. It's a small step, but... but it's a start. Goodbye for now, and thank you again."
