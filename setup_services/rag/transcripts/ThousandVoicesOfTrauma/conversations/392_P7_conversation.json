    "Therapist: Welcome back. Are you ready to continue our imaginal exposure work today?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here.",
    "Client: Okay. Well, I guess I should start by describing that day at the hospital again. It was a Thursday, and I'd just gotten off work. The call came from my sister. She said Mom had collapsed and was in the ICU. I remember feeling like the world was spinning as I rushed to my car. The drive to the hospital felt like it took forever, even though it was only about 20 minutes. When I got there, the waiting room was so cold and sterile. The smell of disinfectant was overwhelming. I kept pacing back and forth, waiting for news.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's hard to think about. When the doctor finally came out, his face was so serious. He started talking about a massive stroke, and how they were doing everything they could. But I could tell from his tone that it wasn't good. I felt like I couldn't breathe. My sister was crying next to me, but I just felt... numb. Like I was watching everything happen from outside my body.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: It's overwhelming. I remember thinking, 'This can't be happening. Not to Mom.' She was always so strong, so full of life. The idea of her being gone... I couldn't process it. We waited for hours, hoping for good news. But then... (voice breaks) then the doctor came back. He said they couldn't save her. That she was gone. And I just... I broke down. I've never felt pain like that before.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) It's like reliving it all over again. The shock, the disbelief. I remember my sister hugging me, both of us sobbing. But I also felt this intense anger. Why her? Why now? She was only 65. She was supposed to retire next year, travel the world. We had so many plans... (starts crying)",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: (through tears) I miss her so much. Sometimes I still reach for the phone to call her, and then I remember... she's not there anymore. It's been two years, but the pain is still so fresh. I keep thinking about all the things she's missing. My nephew's graduation, my sister's wedding... She should be here for all of that.",
    "Therapist: Your grief is valid. Keep expressing those feelings.",
    "Client: It's just not fair. She was such a good person, always helping others. She volunteered at the animal shelter, was active in her church. Everyone loved her. And now she's just... gone. Sometimes I feel guilty for being angry, but I can't help it. I'm angry at the world, at whatever higher power might exist, for taking her away from us.",
    "Therapist: Anger is a natural part of grief. You're doing well.",
    "Client: I guess so. It's just... hard. Some days are better than others, but then something will remind me of her - a song on the radio, her favorite flower in bloom - and it all comes crashing back. I feel like I'm drowning in grief sometimes. And I worry... what if I forget her voice? Or the way she laughed? It terrifies me to think I might lose those memories.",
    "Therapist: Those fears are common. You're not alone in this.",
    "Client: Thank you. It helps to talk about it, even though it's painful. I know Mom wouldn't want me to be stuck in this grief forever. She always taught us to be strong, to keep moving forward. But it's so hard without her guidance. I feel lost sometimes, like I'm trying to navigate life without a compass. She was always the one I turned to for advice, for comfort. And now... now I have to figure things out on my own.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm trying. I know she'd be proud of how we've all come together as a family since she passed. My sister and I are closer than ever now. We make sure to call each other every week, just to check in. And we've been going through Mom's things, sharing memories. It's bittersweet, but it helps. We found her old recipe book last month, and we've been taking turns making her famous dishes. It's like having a little piece of her with us.",
    "Therapist: That's a beautiful way to honor her memory.",
    "Client: It is. And I know she'd love it. She always said food was love. (pauses, takes a deep breath) I think... I think I'm starting to accept that she's gone. It still hurts, and I still miss her every day. But I'm trying to focus on the good memories, on the lessons she taught us. She always said that life was precious, that we should make the most of every moment. I'm trying to live by that now, to make her proud.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted, honestly. But also... lighter, somehow. Like talking about it has lifted some of the weight off my chest. It still hurts, but maybe... maybe it's a good hurt? If that makes sense? Like I'm processing it all, finally.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive sign. We'll end here for today.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you for listening, for helping me through this. It means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
