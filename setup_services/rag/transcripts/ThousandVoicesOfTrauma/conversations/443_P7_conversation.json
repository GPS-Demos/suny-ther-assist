    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure exercise. Can you describe the accident you mentioned last time?",
    "Client: Yes, I... I can try. It was a car accident. I was driving home from work, and it was raining heavily. The roads were slick, and visibility was poor. I remember gripping the steering wheel tightly, trying to focus on the road ahead.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: As I approached an intersection, I saw a flash of headlights to my right. It all happened so fast. I heard the screeching of tires and then a loud crash. The impact was... it was overwhelming. I felt my car spinning, and I couldn't control it. I remember the sound of breaking glass and twisting metal. It was terrifying.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I can smell the burning rubber and feel the airbag against my face. My heart was racing, and I couldn't catch my breath. I was trapped in the car, and I could hear people shouting outside. I was so scared, thinking I might die there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I tried to move, but my body wouldn't respond. I felt a sharp pain in my chest and realized I was bleeding. The rain was coming in through the broken windows, and I was getting wet and cold. I kept thinking about my wife and how I might never see her again. It was... it was overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I'm sorry, it's just so vivid. I can hear the sirens approaching, and there's this sense of relief mixed with fear. The firefighters had to use the jaws of life to get me out. I remember the sound of metal being cut and the feeling of being carefully moved onto a stretcher. The pain was excruciating.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. What happened next?",
    "Client: In the ambulance, I was in and out of consciousness. The paramedics were talking, but their voices sounded distant. I kept thinking about my wife, wondering if anyone had called her. I was afraid I might not make it to the hospital. The guilt of potentially leaving her alone was... it was crushing.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those thoughts. You're doing great.",
    "Client: At the hospital, everything was a blur of bright lights and urgent voices. I remember being wheeled into the emergency room, doctors and nurses surrounding me. They were cutting away my clothes, attaching monitors, asking me questions I could barely answer. The pain was intense, and I felt so helpless and vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I... I feel shaken. My heart is racing, and I can feel my hands trembling. It's like I'm reliving it all over again. The fear, the pain, the uncertainty... it's all coming back. But... but I also feel a sense of relief, like I'm finally confronting this memory instead of running from it.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's... it's hard, but I think it's helping. I've avoided thinking about the accident for so long, but talking about it... it's like I'm starting to process it. I still feel the anxiety and fear, but it's not as overwhelming as it used to be. I'm realizing that I survived, that I'm here now, and that feels... significant.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. How would you like to end our session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to take a moment to ground myself. Maybe we could do a brief relaxation exercise? I feel drained, but also... lighter, in a way. Like I've taken a step towards healing. I'm grateful for your guidance through this difficult memory.",
    "Therapist: That's a great idea. Let's do that."
