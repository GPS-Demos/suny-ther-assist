    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like I'm still there, you know? The screeching tires, the smell of burning rubber... it's all so vivid. I didn't expect it to hit me this hard.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. In that moment, I saw the other car coming towards me, and I just... froze. I couldn't do anything. It's like I was watching it happen to someone else, but feeling everything at the same time. It's strange, isn't it? To feel so present and absent simultaneously?",
    "Therapist: Not strange at all. How did reliving that memory feel today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. My heart's still racing a bit. But, you know, it's different from when I usually think about it. Usually, I try to push it away as quickly as possible. This time, staying with it... it was hard, but I feel like I noticed things I hadn't before.",
    "Therapist: What new things did you notice?",
    "Client: Well, I realized that even though I felt helpless, I did actually do something. I turned the wheel at the last second. It probably saved my life. I've always focused on the fear and panic, but I never gave myself credit for that split-second decision.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does that change things for you?",
    "Client: It... it makes me feel stronger, I guess. Like maybe I'm not as powerless as I thought. Don't get me wrong, it's still terrifying to think about, but... maybe I'm more resilient than I give myself credit for?",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. How might this connect to your daily life?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe it means I can handle more than I think I can? I've been avoiding driving since the accident, but perhaps I've been underestimating myself. It's scary, but... maybe I could try short drives again?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a brave step. How do you feel about that idea?",
    "Client: Nervous, definitely. But also... a little excited? It's been so long since I've felt any hope about getting past this. It's like a tiny light at the end of a very long tunnel.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What else came up for you during the exposure?",
    "Client: I noticed how much tension I was holding in my body. My shoulders were up to my ears, my jaw was clenched... I didn't realize how much physical stress I was carrying. Is that... is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How might you address that tension?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe some relaxation techniques? I used to do yoga before the accident. I stopped because I was afraid of triggering memories, but maybe it could help me manage this physical stress?",
    "Therapist: That's a thoughtful idea. How else might this experience inform your recovery?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's showing me that facing these memories head-on, while scary, isn't as devastating as I feared. It's hard, really hard, but I'm still here, still breathing. Maybe... maybe I can start to reclaim some of the parts of my life I've been avoiding?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's daunting, but... I think I'm ready. For the first time in a long time, I feel like there might be a way forward. It's not going to be easy, but... I want to keep trying. I want my life back.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. What's one small step you can take this week?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I'll try that short drive. Just around the block. And maybe I'll look into some yoga classes. Baby steps, right?",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a great plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... hopeful. It's like I've climbed a mountain. Exhausting, but the view from up here... it's worth it. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You did the hard work. I'm proud of your progress today."
