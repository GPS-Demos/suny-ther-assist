    "Therapist: Welcome back, Mr. Singh. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I suppose. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more flashbacks lately, especially at night. It's been affecting my sleep and my work.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you familiar with this?",
    "Client: Not really. I've heard you mention it before, but I'm not sure what it entails. Is it... is it going to make things worse?",
    "Therapist: It's a powerful tool to help process your trauma. Can you share your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about reliving that hostage situation. It was terrifying, being trapped there, not knowing if I'd see my family again. The physical abuse... I've tried so hard to forget it. Won't talking about it in detail just bring it all back?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How do you typically cope with memories?",
    "Client: I try to push them away, keep busy with work. But they always come back, stronger. It's exhausting, and I feel like I'm losing control.",
    "Therapist: Avoidance can intensify symptoms. Imaginal exposure helps process memories safely.",
    "Client: I see. But how does it work exactly? And what should I expect during the session?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the event in detail. I'll guide you through it safely.",
    "Client: That sounds... challenging. I'm not sure I can do that without breaking down. What if I panic or can't continue?",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. You can pause anytime. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It's a bit reassuring, but I'm still apprehensive. Will this really help me in the long run?",
    "Therapist: Many find it reduces PTSD symptoms over time. Your courage is admirable.",
    "Client: Thank you. I guess I'm willing to try if it means I can finally move past this. But I have to admit, I'm scared. What if I discover something about myself I don't like? Or what if I realize I could have done something differently to prevent it?",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are normal. We'll address any realizations together.",
    "Client: Okay. I appreciate your support. It means a lot, especially since I haven't really talked about this with anyone else, not even my wife. She knows something happened, but I've never given her the details. I feel like I'm carrying this burden alone.",
    "Therapist: You're not alone anymore. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm ready. Or as ready as I'll ever be. Just... please be patient with me if I struggle. This isn't easy for me to talk about.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Your bravery is commendable. Let's start slowly."
