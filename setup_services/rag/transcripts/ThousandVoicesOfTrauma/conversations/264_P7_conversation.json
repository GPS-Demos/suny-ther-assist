    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure exercise. Can you describe the animal attack you witnessed?",
    "Client: Okay... I was at the beach with my family. It was a beautiful day, and we were all enjoying ourselves. Suddenly, I heard screaming coming from further down the shore. I looked up and saw a large shark fin circling near a group of swimmers. My heart started racing...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you saw.",
    "Client: I... I saw the water turn red. People were panicking, trying to swim to shore. I felt frozen, unable to move. A lifeguard was rushing towards the scene, but it seemed like everything was moving in slow motion. I couldn't believe what I was seeing...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What were you feeling?",
    "Client: I felt... terrified. Helpless. I wanted to do something, but I couldn't move. My stomach was in knots, and I felt like I couldn't breathe. I remember thinking, \"This can't be real. This only happens in movies.\"",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. What happened next?",
    "Client: The lifeguard reached the injured swimmer and started pulling them to shore. Other people were helping too. I could hear sirens in the distance. My husband was trying to shield our children from seeing what was happening, but I couldn't look away. It was like I was paralyzed...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I'm sorry. This is harder than I thought it would be. I can still hear the screams, see the blood in the water. It's like it's happening all over again...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Okay... The paramedics arrived and started treating the victim on the beach. I remember feeling sick to my stomach. I wanted to help, but I also wanted to run away. I felt so guilty for just standing there...",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have conflicting feelings. Continue.",
    "Client: The beach cleared out pretty quickly after that. But I couldn't move. I just stood there, staring at the ocean. It looked so calm and beautiful, but I knew what had just happened. I felt... changed. Like the world wasn't as safe as I thought it was.",
    "Therapist: You're showing a lot of strength. How did you feel afterwards?",
    "Client: For weeks after, I couldn't sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that fin, the red water. I had nightmares about being in the water myself, unable to escape. I avoided the beach, avoided water altogether. I felt... broken. Like I'd lost something I couldn't get back.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to acknowledge those feelings.",
    "Client: I kept thinking about the victim, their family. How life can change in an instant. I felt guilty for being so affected when I wasn't even the one who was hurt. But I couldn't shake the fear, the feeling of helplessness...",
    "Therapist: Your reactions are valid. Keep going.",
    "Client: I started having panic attacks, especially near large bodies of water. I couldn't watch TV shows or movies with ocean scenes. I felt ridiculous, but I couldn't control it. It was like my body was constantly on high alert, waiting for something terrible to happen...",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job describing your experience.",
    "Client: Thank you... It's hard to talk about. I've never really told anyone all of this before. I felt like I should just \"get over it,\" you know? But I couldn't. It's affected so much of my life. I used to love the ocean, and now I can't even look at it without feeling sick...",
    "Therapist: It's brave of you to share this. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also a little relieved. Talking about it is hard, but it also feels like I'm finally acknowledging how much this has affected me. I want to feel normal again, to not be afraid all the time. I miss the person I used to be before this happened...",
    "Therapist: That's a natural desire. We'll work on that together.",
    "Client: I hope so. I'm tired of feeling this way, of letting this control my life. But being here, talking about it... it feels like a step in the right direction. It's scary, but I'm ready to try to move forward.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive outlook. Shall we conclude for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. This was intense, but I'm glad we did it. Thank you for guiding me through it. I'm looking forward to our next session, even though I know it won't be easy.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. We'll continue next time."
