    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. The earthquake, it felt so real again. I could almost feel the ground shaking beneath me. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The sound. The deafening rumble. It's like... it's like it was happening all over again. I remember feeling so helpless, you know? Like the world was literally crumbling around me and there was nothing I could do to stop it.",
    "Therapist: How did your body react during the memory?",
    "Client: My heart was racing. I felt tense all over, especially in my shoulders and chest. I... I think I was holding my breath at some points. It's strange how vivid it all felt, even though it happened years ago.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts went through your mind?",
    "Client: I kept thinking, \"This is it. I'm going to die.\" It's the same thought I had during the actual earthquake. But then... then I remembered I was here, in your office, safe. It's confusing, like being in two places at once.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your day-to-day experiences?",
    "Client: I guess... I guess it explains why I'm always on edge. Why loud noises freak me out so much. It's like part of me is still there, waiting for the next disaster to strike. God, it's exhausting living like this.",
    "Therapist: What did you learn about yourself today?",
    "Client: That I'm stronger than I thought. I mean, I survived reliving that memory, right? And... and maybe that I don't have to let this control my life anymore. It's hard, but... but I want to move forward.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's scary, I won't lie. But I think it's worth it. I'm tired of feeling trapped by this. I want my life back, you know? I want to feel normal again.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe we could work on how to deal with the anxiety when it hits? Like, practical things I can do when I start feeling overwhelmed. Is that... is that something we can do?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll work on coping strategies next session.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I know this isn't easy, but I appreciate your help. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever fully get over this, you know? But I guess that's part of the process, right?",
    "Therapist: It is. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, but... but also kind of relieved? Like I've let go of something I've been holding onto for too long. It's a weird mix of exhaustion and hope, if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: That's common. What will you do to take care of yourself today?",
    "Client: I think I'll go for a walk, try to clear my head. Maybe call my partner, let them know how it went. Just... just try to be gentle with myself, I guess. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great plan. Remember, you're making progress.",
    "Client: Thanks. I... I needed to hear that. Sometimes it's hard to see how far I've come. But I'm trying. I really am. And sessions like this, as tough as they are, they help me see that maybe... maybe I can get through this after all."
