    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like I'm right back there, you know? The memory of leaving my home in Venezuela, it's so vivid. I can still smell the musty scent of our packed bags and hear the hushed whispers of my parents as they tried to keep us calm. My heart's racing a bit, and my palms are sweaty.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how scared I was. We didn't know what was waiting for us, you know? I remember clutching my little sister's hand so tightly, afraid I might lose her in the chaos. And there's this... guilt. I left behind friends, my grandparents. I wonder if I could have done more to help them. It's like a heavy weight on my chest.",
    "Therapist: How does that weight feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a pressure, right here in the center of my chest. Like I can't take a full breath. And there's this knot in my stomach that won't go away. I feel restless, like I need to move, but at the same time, I'm frozen. It's strange, isn't it? To feel so much about something that happened years ago?",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's sadness. A deep, overwhelming sadness. Not just for what I lost, but for what my whole family lost. Our home, our community, our sense of security. I remember my mom's face as we crossed the border. She tried to smile, to be strong for us, but I could see the pain in her eyes. It breaks my heart all over again.",
    "Therapist: How does this sadness connect to your life now?",
    "Client: I... wow, I've never really thought about it like that. I guess it's always there, under the surface. It comes out in unexpected ways. Like, I have trouble trusting that good things will last. I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop, you know? And I push people away sometimes, afraid of getting too close and then losing them. It's like I'm still that scared kid, always ready to run.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about sharing this memory now?",
    "Client: It's... it's different than I expected. It still hurts, but it's not overwhelming me like it used to. I feel more... I don't know, more in control? Like I can look at the memory without being completely sucked into it. And talking about it... it's hard, but it also feels like I'm letting go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: How does this experience compare to previous times you've recalled this memory?",
    "Client: It's less... intense, I guess. Before, whenever I thought about it, it was like I was right back there. I could feel the panic rising, the urge to run. But now, it's like I'm watching it from a distance. I can see it, feel it, but I'm not lost in it. And I'm noticing things I didn't before. Like how brave my parents were, how they put everything on the line for us. It's still sad, but there's also this... I don't know, maybe pride? Gratitude?",
    "Therapist: What does this shift mean to you?",
    "Client: It means... it means maybe I'm healing? I've always thought of this memory as this terrible, painful thing that I had to avoid. But now, it feels like maybe it's just a part of my story. A hard part, yeah, but not something that has to define everything about me. It's like... like I'm starting to see myself as more than just a refugee, more than just someone who lost everything. I'm someone who survived, who's building a new life. That feels... powerful.",
    "Therapist: How might this new perspective influence your future?",
    "Client: I think... I think it might help me be more open. To relationships, to opportunities. Maybe I don't have to always be on guard, always expecting the worst. And maybe I can use this experience to help others. There are so many people going through what I went through. If I can show them that it's possible to heal, to build a new life... that would mean a lot. It's like, for the first time, I can see a future that isn't overshadowed by the past.",
    "Therapist: What's one thing you'd like to remember from this session?",
    "Client: I want to remember this feeling of... I guess, empowerment? The realization that my past doesn't have to control my future. That I can acknowledge the pain and the loss, but also recognize the strength it took to get through it. And that sharing my story, as hard as it is, can be healing. It's like... like I'm reclaiming my narrative, you know? That feels really important.",
    "Therapist: How do you want to care for yourself after this session?",
    "Client: I think I need some time to process all of this. Maybe go for a walk in the park near my apartment. There's something about being in nature that helps me feel grounded. And I might call my sister. We don't talk about the past much, but maybe it's time we did. Not to dwell on it, but to acknowledge how far we've come. And honestly, I might just take a nap. This was exhausting, but in a good way. Like I've done important work, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful plan. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I just... I want to say thank you. I was so scared to do this, to face these memories. But I feel lighter now. Like I've put down a burden I didn't even realize I was carrying. It's not gone completely, but it feels manageable now. And for the first time in a long time, I'm actually curious about what comes next in my life, instead of being afraid of it. That's... that's huge for me.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible courage today. How do you feel as we end our session?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel hopeful. Tired, but hopeful. Like I've taken a big step forward. It's scary, but exciting too. I'm looking forward to seeing how this changes things. And... I'm proud of myself. I didn't think I could do this, but I did. That feels really good.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing so openly. We'll continue this work in our next session."
