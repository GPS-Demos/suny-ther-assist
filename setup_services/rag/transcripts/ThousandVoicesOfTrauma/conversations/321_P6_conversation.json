    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Can you share your initial SUDS rating?",

    "Therapist: Alright. When you're ready, start describing the home invasion.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) It was a quiet evening. My husband and I were watching TV when we heard a loud crash from the kitchen. At first, I thought maybe a shelf had fallen, but then we heard footsteps. My heart started racing immediately. I remember feeling frozen in place, unable to move.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to about 60. My palms are getting sweaty, and I can feel my heart beating faster.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Nods) We heard more noise, and then a man's voice shouting. My husband stood up, telling me to call the police. But before I could reach the phone, two men burst into the living room. They were wearing masks and carrying... carrying guns. (Voice trembles) I've never felt so terrified in my life.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 75 now. I feel like I'm back there. My chest feels tight, and I'm starting to shake a little.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: (Closes eyes) They demanded money and valuables. My husband tried to reason with them, but one of them hit him with the gun. (Tears form) I screamed, and the other man pointed his gun at me. I thought... I thought they were going to kill us both.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's at 85. I feel so helpless, just like I did then. My throat feels constricted, and I'm having trouble catching my breath.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe slowly.",
    "Client: (Takes several deep breaths) They ransacked the house, taking jewelry, cash, anything valuable. The whole time, I kept thinking about our grandchildren, wondering if we'd ever see them again. It felt like hours, but it was probably only about 20 minutes before they left.",
    "Therapist: Current SUDS?",
    "Client: It's still high, about 80. My heart is pounding, and I feel a bit dizzy.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: After they left, we called the police. I remember feeling numb, like it wasn't real. But seeing my husband's bruised face... (voice breaks) that's when it hit me how close we came to losing everything.",
    "Therapist: And now?",
    "Client: The SUDS is coming down a bit, maybe 70. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger for facing this memory.",
    "Therapist: That's common. How do you feel physically?",
    "Client: My breathing is steadier now, but I feel exhausted. My muscles are tense, especially in my shoulders and jaw.",
