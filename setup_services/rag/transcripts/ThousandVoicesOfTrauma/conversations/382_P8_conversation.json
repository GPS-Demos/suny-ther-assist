    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mr. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel... I don't know, sort of shaky? Like I've had too much coffee or something. It's strange, reliving that memory of being bullied at school. I could almost smell the musty corridors and hear the echoing laughter.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: Well, I keep thinking about how small I felt back then. How helpless. It's funny, you know, I'm a grown man now, retired even, but remembering those moments... it's like I'm that scared little boy all over again. I can feel the fear in the pit of my stomach, just like I did then. And there's this... this anger too. At the bullies, sure, but also at myself for not standing up to them. I know it's not rational, but part of me still feels like I should have done more, been braver somehow.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a heat in my chest. My fists are clenched, I've just noticed. And my jaw feels tight. It's not just the bullying incidents themselves, you know. It's all the times afterwards when I'd lie awake at night, replaying everything in my head, wishing I'd said or done something different. I'd imagine these scenarios where I'd stand up to them, be some kind of hero. But in reality, I just... I just took it. Day after day.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about those wishes now?",
    "Client: I... hmm. I guess I notice that they were just a child's fantasies. Unrealistic, maybe. But they were also a way of coping, weren't they? A way of feeling less powerless. It's odd, but talking about it now, I feel almost... protective of that young me. Like I want to reach back in time and tell him it's not his fault, that he's doing the best he can.",
    "Therapist: How does that protectiveness feel?",
    "Client: It feels... warm. Comforting, in a way. But also sad. There's a lump in my throat thinking about it. I wish... I wish someone had been there to protect me then. To really see what was happening and step in. My parents, they tried, but they didn't really understand. And the teachers... well, they mostly turned a blind eye. It's left me with this... this lingering feeling of being alone, I suppose. Even now, living in shared accommodation, I sometimes feel like that scared, isolated kid.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your experiences with domestic violence?",
    "Client: Oh... oh, I see what you mean. I've never really made that connection before, but... yes, I can see similarities. That same feeling of helplessness, of being trapped. The way my ex-partner would belittle me, it was like being back in that school corridor. And the worst part is, I reacted the same way. I just... took it. Didn't stand up for myself. It's like I never really grew out of being that bullied kid, did I?",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you make that connection?",
    "Client: It's... it's a lot to process. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, to be honest. There's sadness, definitely. A deep, aching kind of sadness for all the years I've spent feeling... less than. But there's also... I don't know, maybe a glimmer of hope? Like, now that I can see this pattern, maybe I can start to change it. It's scary, but also... maybe empowering? I'm not sure. My hands are shaking a bit as I say this.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I... I think I need a moment. Just to sit with this. It's a lot to take in, you know? But I'm glad we're talking about it. It feels... important. Like I'm finally starting to understand some things about myself. I'm feeling tired, but also... lighter, somehow. Like I've put down a heavy bag I've been carrying for years without even realizing it. Is that... is that normal?",
    "Therapist: There's no 'normal' in healing. What matters is your experience.",
    "Client: Right, of course. It's just... it's intense, you know? But I think it's good. Scary, but good. I'm remembering other things now, little incidents I'd forgotten. Times when I did stand up for myself, even if it was in small ways. It's like... like I'm seeing my whole life through a new lens. It's overwhelming, but also... I don't know, exciting? Like maybe I'm not as helpless as I've always believed. Maybe there's still time to change, to be... stronger. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: It makes perfect sense. How do you feel about exploring this further?",
    "Client: I... I think I'd like that. It's not going to be easy, I know that. But for the first time in a long time, I feel like maybe there's hope. Like maybe I can learn to stand up for myself, to be the protector that little boy needed all those years ago. It's scary, but... I'm ready. I want to understand more, to heal. I... I want to be free of this weight I've been carrying. Can we... can we keep working on this?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll take it one step at a time.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I'm grateful, you know? For this space, for your guidance. It's not easy, facing all this, but I feel... I feel like I'm finally on the right path. Like maybe, just maybe, I can learn to feel safe and strong. It's a strange feeling, after all these years, but... I think I'm ready to embrace it.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How would you like to end today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to just sit quietly for a moment, if that's okay. Just to let all of this sink in. And maybe... maybe to send some kindness to that scared little boy inside me. To let him know that he's not alone anymore, that we're going to look after him now. Is that... is that alright?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a perfect way to end. Take all the time you need."
