    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like I'm right back there again, you know? The screeching tires, the smell of burning rubber, the screams... It's all so vivid. I can feel my heart racing even now.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. Watching it all unfold and not being able to do anything. I keep replaying that moment when the car swerved... God, those poor people. I can't shake the image of their faces right before impact.",
    "Therapist: How does that helplessness connect to your daily life now?",
    "Client: Well, I... I guess I've been feeling pretty powerless in general lately. Like I can't control anything. I'm always on edge, waiting for something terrible to happen. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: I see. What else did you notice during the exposure?",
    "Client: I realized how tense I get when I think about it. My whole body just locks up. And there's this overwhelming guilt... like maybe I could have done something, you know? Even though logically I know there's nothing I could have done.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt manifest in your life?",
    "Client: It's... it's always there, lingering. I find myself constantly second-guessing my decisions, afraid that if I make the wrong choice, something terrible will happen. It's affecting my work, my relationships... I'm so tired of feeling this way.",
    "Therapist: Understandable. What felt different this time compared to previous exposures?",
    "Client: I... I think I was able to stay with the memory a bit longer this time. It was still incredibly difficult, but I didn't feel like I was going to completely fall apart. There were moments when I could observe what was happening without getting totally overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: It's... it's a relief, actually. I mean, it's still awful to go through, but knowing that I can face it, even a little bit... it gives me hope. Maybe I'm not as weak as I thought I was.",
    "Therapist: What strategies helped you stay present?",
    "Client: The breathing techniques we practiced really helped. And reminding myself that I'm safe now, that it's just a memory. It's still hard, but... I feel like I have a bit more control.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How might you apply this to everyday triggers?",
    "Client: I... I guess I could use those same techniques when I start feeling anxious or when something reminds me of the accident. Maybe if I can face the memory, I can face the smaller reminders too.",
    "Therapist: Good insight. What's your takeaway from today's session?",
    "Client: That... that maybe I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. And that even though it's painful, facing this head-on might actually be the way forward. It's scary, but... I think I'm ready to keep trying.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: I'm nervous, but... I think I'm ready. It's not easy, but if it helps me get my life back, it's worth it. I want to be present for my family again, to enjoy life without this constant fear hanging over me.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is admirable. Any final thoughts?",

    "Therapist: You're doing great work. We'll continue next week?",
    "Client: Yes, definitely. I'll be here. Thank you again, Doctor."
