    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. It was intense. Reliving that cyberbullying incident... it brought back a lot of emotions I thought I'd buried. My heart's still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The isolation, I think. Remembering how alone I felt when those messages kept coming in. It was like the whole world was against me, you know? And I couldn't escape it because it was all online, following me everywhere.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was harder than I expected. I felt that same panic, that same helplessness. But... it's weird. It also felt different somehow. Like I was watching it happen to someone else.",
    "Therapist: Different how?",
    "Client: I guess... I felt more in control this time? Like, I know it's just a memory now. It can't hurt me the same way anymore. But man, the emotions were still so raw.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant observation. How does this relate to your current experiences?",
    "Client: I think... I think I've been carrying that fear with me. Always worried about what people might say or do online. It's affected how I interact on social media, how I approach new relationships. I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop, you know?",
    "Therapist: I see. How might this insight impact your recovery goals?",
    "Client: Well, maybe I need to work on trusting people more? And not letting past experiences dictate my present. It's just... it's hard to let go of that fear, you know? But I want to. I want to be able to connect with people without always being on guard.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's one small step you could take?",
    "Client: Hmm... Maybe I could try being more open on social media? Not oversharing, but just... not hiding so much. Posting a status update or a photo without overthinking it for hours. That sounds terrifying, but also kind of liberating.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that idea?",
    "Client: Nervous, definitely. But also... excited? Like, maybe this is a chance to reclaim that space, you know? To show myself that I can exist online without being attacked. It's a small thing, but it feels big.",
    "Therapist: It is big. How else might you apply what you've learned?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I need to talk to my roommates more. I've been so closed off, always in my room. But that's not so different from isolating myself online, is it? Maybe I could suggest a movie night or something. Start small, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great idea. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Better, actually. Still a bit shaky, but... lighter? Like I've put down a weight I didn't know I was carrying. It's scary, but also kind of hopeful. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What's your takeaway from today's session?",
    "Client: I guess... that the past doesn't have to control my future. That I'm stronger than I thought. And that maybe, just maybe, I can start trusting people again. It's not going to be easy, but... I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: I'm nervous, but I'm in. It's tough, but I can see how it's helping. And honestly? I'm kind of proud of myself for getting through today. I didn't think I could do it, but here I am. So yeah, I'm ready for whatever comes next.",
    "Therapist: That's great to hear. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: I don't think so. I feel like I need some time to process all of this. It's a lot to take in, you know? But in a good way. I'm just... I'm grateful. For this space, for your guidance. It means a lot.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate that. How would you like to end our session today?",
    "Client: Could we just sit in silence for a minute? I know that might sound weird, but... I think I need a moment to just breathe and center myself before I head back out into the world. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take that minute now.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Calmer. More grounded. Thank you for this. I think I'm ready to face the rest of my day now. Same time next week?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Take care, and remember to be kind to yourself.",
    "Client: I will. Thanks again. See you next week."
