    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Patel. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's begin. Close your eyes and recall the memory we discussed.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm back in my childhood home. It's dark, and I can hear my parents arguing in the next room. The shouting is getting louder, and I'm curled up in my bed, trying to block out the noise.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10. I'm feeling tense, but it's manageable.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The argument is escalating. I can hear things being thrown, and my mother is crying. I want to help her, but I'm too scared to move. My heart is racing, and I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's getting more intense. Maybe a 6 out of 10 now. My palms are sweating, and I feel a knot in my stomach.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) Suddenly, there's a loud crash. I hear my mother scream, and then silence. The silence is worse than the shouting. I'm shaking uncontrollably, wondering if I should check on her or stay hidden.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. I feel like I can't breathe properly. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I finally gather the courage to peek out of my room. I see my mother on the floor, crying silently. There's broken glass everywhere. My father is nowhere to be seen. I want to comfort her, but I don't know how.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling at this moment in the memory?",
    "Client: It's overwhelming. A 9 out of 10 now. I feel so angry and scared at the same time. Why didn't anyone help us?",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel those emotions. You're doing great. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: (Sniffling) I slowly approach my mother. She looks up at me, her face bruised and tear-stained. She tries to smile, but it breaks my heart. I feel so guilty for not helping her sooner.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's still high, about an 8. But it's different now. I feel more sadness than fear.",
    "Therapist: I see. Can you describe what happens next?",
    "Client: I help my mother up, and we clean the mess together in silence. The air feels heavy with unspoken words. I want to ask her why we don't leave, but I'm afraid of the answer.",

    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay. I'm starting to feel more grounded now.",
    "Therapist: Good. How would you rate your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 5. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger?",
    "Therapist: That's common. How are you feeling overall about this exercise?",
    "Client: It was tough, but I think it helped. I've never talked about that night in so much detail before.",
    "Therapist: You did very well. Let's take a moment to relax before we discuss further."
