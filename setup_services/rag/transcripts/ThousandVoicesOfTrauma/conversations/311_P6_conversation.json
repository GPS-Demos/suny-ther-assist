    "Therapist: Alright, Sarah, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm a bit nervous, but I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your current SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and begin describing the natural disaster experience.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) It was a sunny day in Afghanistan. I was on patrol with my unit when suddenly the ground started shaking. At first, I thought it was an explosion, but then I realized it was an earthquake. The buildings around us started crumbling...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's going up. Maybe a 6 now. My heart is racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: The air filled with dust and screams. I saw a child trapped under some rubble. I ran to help, but another aftershock hit. I stumbled, feeling so helpless...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. SUDS?",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) It's an 8 now. I can almost taste the dust in my mouth again.",
    "Therapist: That's intense. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: (Nods) The ground kept shaking. I managed to reach the child, but more buildings were collapsing around us. I was terrified we'd both be crushed...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling physically right now?",
    "Client: My palms are sweaty, and my chest feels tight. It's like I'm back there.",
    "Therapist: That's common. Keep going. What happened next?",
    "Client: I lifted the debris off the child. She was crying, bleeding. I scooped her up and ran, dodging falling concrete. The chaos was overwhelming...",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: (Breathing heavily) It's... it's a 9. I feel so anxious.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it.",
    "Client: We made it to a clear area. I started first aid on the girl, but I kept thinking about my team, the other civilians. The guilt of not being able to help everyone...",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: Still a 9. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Continue.",
    "Client: The aftershocks kept coming. We set up a makeshift triage area. I worked for hours, treating injuries, comforting people. The devastation was unreal...",
    "Therapist: And now? How are you feeling?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down a bit. Maybe an 8 now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep describing what you remember.",

    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's a 7 now. I feel... drained.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: We worked through the night. The next morning, seeing the destruction in daylight was... overwhelming. But there was also hope. People coming together, helping each other...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5. I feel sad, but also... proud of how we responded.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's start winding down. How do you feel overall?",
    "Client: (Opens eyes) I feel... exhausted, but also relieved. It's like a weight has lifted a bit.",
    "Therapist: You did excellent work today, Sarah. How would you rate your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's back down to a 4. Thank you... this was hard, but I think it helped.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. We'll process this more next time."
