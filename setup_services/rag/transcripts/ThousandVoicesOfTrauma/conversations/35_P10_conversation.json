    "Therapist: Welcome back. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I... I think so. To be honest, I'm feeling a bit jittery. My hands are kind of shaky.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here together. Let's start with a deep breath.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Okay... I'm as ready as I'll ever be, I suppose.",
    "Therapist: Good. Close your eyes and bring yourself to that day at the park. What do you see?",
    "Client: It's... it's a sunny afternoon. I can see the trees, hear the birds chirping. I'm walking along the path, feeling the warmth on my skin. There are a few people around, but it's not crowded.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I hear a growl. My heart starts racing immediately. I turn and see this massive dog, no... more like a wolf. It's snarling, foam at its mouth. I freeze. I can't move. My legs feel like lead.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Terror. Pure terror. My mouth is dry, and I can hear my heartbeat in my ears. I want to run, but I'm paralyzed.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 70. Maybe 75.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *breathes deeply* The dog... it lunges at me. I finally manage to move, but I stumble backward. I fall hard on the ground. The impact knocks the wind out of me. I can smell the dog's breath... it's horrible, like rotting meat.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay in the moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: Its teeth... they sink into my arm. The pain is excruciating. I'm screaming, but it feels like no sound is coming out. I can feel the warmth of my blood trickling down my arm. I'm kicking, trying to get it off me, but it's so strong.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you survived this. You're here now, safe. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I... I feel sick. My stomach is churning. The memory is so vivid... I can almost feel the pain again.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. Ground yourself. What do you see around you now?",
    "Client: I... I see your office. The blue walls, the painting of the ocean. My hands are gripping the armrests tightly.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, return to the memory.",
    "Client: Okay... People are shouting now. Someone's running towards us. The dog is still on me, shaking its head, tearing at my arm. I think I'm going to pass out from the pain and fear.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: A man... he's hitting the dog with a stick. It finally lets go of my arm. I curl up into a ball, sobbing. The dog runs away. I can hear people talking, asking if I'm okay, but it all sounds muffled.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Overwhelmed. Shaky. But... also a bit relieved that the worst part is over.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: Maybe... 85? It peaked higher during the attack.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: Someone's pressing something against my arm. It hurts, but not as much as the bite. I'm still crying, can't seem to stop. I'm embarrassed, scared, in pain... all at once. The paramedics arrive. They're talking to me, but I can barely focus on their words.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: *takes a shaky breath* They help me onto a stretcher. As they lift me, I catch a glimpse of my arm. It's... it's a mess. Blood everywhere. I feel lightheaded and close my eyes.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking, \"Why me? Why did this happen to me?\" I feel so vulnerable, so helpless. Like the world isn't safe anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. How does your body feel?",
    "Client: Tense. So tense. My muscles ache from being so rigid. And I feel cold, despite the warm day. I'm shivering.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're doing well.",
    "Client: In the ambulance, the paramedic is asking me questions. Name, age, allergies... I answer mechanically. It feels surreal, like I'm watching it happen to someone else.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are you experiencing?",
    "Client: Fear... still a lot of fear. But also... anger? Yeah, I'm angry. Why wasn't that dog on a leash? Why did this have to happen?",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel angry. What happens at the hospital?",
    "Client: It's a blur of activity. Doctors, nurses, questions, pain... They clean the wound. It hurts so much, I nearly pass out. They give me something for the pain. It helps, but I still feel on edge.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, recalling this?",
    "Client: It's... intense. My heart is racing again. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I'm facing it head-on.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: I'd say about 60 now. It's coming down.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's continue.",
    "Client: They tell me I need surgery. Something about repairing muscle damage. I'm terrified of going under anesthesia. What if I don't wake up? What if there are complications?",
    "Therapist: Those are natural fears. How do you cope with them?",
    "Client: I... I try to focus on my breathing. Like you taught me. In for four, hold for four, out for four. It helps a little. The nurse is kind, holds my hand as they prepare me for surgery.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great resilience. What happens after the surgery?",
    "Client: I wake up groggy. My arm is heavily bandaged. The pain is duller now, but still there. A constant reminder. The doctor explains the procedure, but I'm having trouble focusing.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about your recovery at this point?",
    "Client: Overwhelmed. The thought of physical therapy, of potentially having limited use of my arm... it's daunting. But there's also a small part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe proud? That I survived?",
    "Therapist: That's a positive perspective. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired. Emotionally drained. But... also a bit lighter? Like I've released some of the pent-up fear.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: I'd say it's down to about 40.",
    "Therapist: Well done. Let's start wrapping up. Take a few deep breaths and slowly bring yourself back to the present.",
    "Client: *breathes deeply* Okay... I'm back in your office. The memory feels... less overwhelming now.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... accomplished? Like I've faced something I've been avoiding for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's exactly what you've done. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: Thank you. It wasn't easy, but... I'm glad we did this.",
    "Therapist: You've made significant progress. We'll end here for today. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
