    "Therapist: Welcome back. Today we'll be doing an imaginal exposure focusing on your workplace trauma. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm feeling a bit jittery, to be honest. But I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember, you're in control. Let's start with your SUDS level.",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 4 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and take us to that day.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Alright. I'm walking into the office. It's early, maybe 7:30 AM. The fluorescent lights are harsh, and there's this... oppressive silence. I can smell coffee brewing somewhere.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I see my boss's door is open. My stomach immediately knots up. I know he's waiting for me. God, I can feel my palms getting sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe a 6?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: I force myself to walk to his office. Each step feels like I'm wading through molasses. My heart's pounding in my ears. I... I knock on the door frame, and he looks up with this... this cold, calculating expression.",
    "Therapist: What do you see in his eyes?",
    "Client: Contempt. Pure contempt. He gestures for me to sit down, and I feel like I'm shrinking. He starts talking, but his words are muffled at first. Then they come into focus: \"Your performance has been abysmal. You're a disappointment to this entire team.\"",
    "Therapist: Stay present. How does your body feel?",
    "Client: I... I feel like I can't breathe. My chest is so tight. My face is burning with shame. I want to defend myself, but no words come out. I'm just... frozen.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: He keeps berating me. Every word feels like a physical blow. \"You're incompetent. How did you even get this job?\" I'm gripping the arms of the chair so hard my knuckles are white. I feel tears welling up, but I'm desperately trying not to cry.",
    "Therapist: What are you telling yourself in this moment?",
    "Client: That... that I'm worthless. That maybe he's right. That I don't deserve to be here. God, it hurts so much to remember this.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're safe now.",
    "Client: He stands up, looming over me. \"I should fire you right now,\" he snarls. I flinch like he's going to hit me, even though I know he won't. But the emotional punch is just as bad. I feel so small, so insignificant.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I can't do this.",
    "Therapist: You can. You're stronger than this memory. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *inhales shakily* Okay. He's still talking, but it's like I'm underwater. I see his mouth moving, but the words are distorted. All I can focus on is the pounding of my heart and this overwhelming sense of shame.",
    "Therapist: What do you want to do in this moment?",
    "Client: I want to run. I want to disappear. But I'm rooted to the spot. My legs feel like lead. I'm nodding mechanically, agreeing to whatever he's saying just to make it stop.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Finally, he dismisses me with a wave of his hand. I stumble out of his office, feeling like I've been hit by a truck. The hallway seems to stretch endlessly. I can feel eyes on me, judging me. I make it to the bathroom and lock myself in a stall.",
    "Therapist: What happens in the bathroom?",
    "Client: I... I break down. Silent sobs wrack my body. I'm gasping for air, trying not to make any noise. My whole body is shaking. I feel so utterly alone, so worthless. I can't stop replaying his words in my head.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's still a 9. Maybe even a 10. I feel like I'm reliving it all over again.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. This is just a memory.",
    "Client: I know, but it feels so real. I spend what feels like hours in that stall, trying to pull myself together. My face is blotchy, my eyes are red. I splash water on my face, but I still look like a wreck.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I force myself to go back to my desk. Every step is agony. I feel like everyone can see right through me, can see how broken and useless I am. I sit down and stare at my computer screen, but I can't focus. The words blur together.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel now?",
    "Client: Drained. Completely drained. My shoulders are hunched, my stomach is in knots. I feel like I might throw up. The rest of the day is a blur of anxiety and self-loathing.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down a bit. Maybe an 8 now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's start to bring you back to the present.",
    "Client: *exhales slowly* Okay. I... I can feel the chair I'm sitting in now. I can hear the ticking of the clock in your office.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You're here, you're safe.",
    "Client: I'm opening my eyes now. The light seems so bright. I feel... exhausted, but also like a weight has been lifted somehow.",
    "Therapist: You did very well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, but... okay, I think. My SUDS is probably down to a 5 or 6 now.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's take a few minutes to process what you experienced.",
    "Client: Yeah, I... I didn't realize how much that day still affected me. It's like I could feel everything all over again.",
    "Therapist: That's the power of this exercise. What stood out to you?",
    "Client: I think... how small and powerless I felt. And how much I internalized his words. I really believed I was worthless.",
    "Therapist: And how do you feel about that now?",
    "Client: I... I can see that it wasn't true. He was the one with the problem, not me. But god, it still hurts to remember.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You're showing great courage.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I need a moment to just sit with this.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take all the time you need.",
    "Client: *sits quietly for a few minutes* I'm... I'm okay now. It's strange, but I feel lighter somehow. Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's often the result of these exposures. How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 3, I think. I'm tired, but... okay.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. How do you feel about continuing these exposures?",
    "Client: It's hard, but... I can see how it's helping. I want to keep going.",
    "Therapist: That's great to hear. We'll end our session here, but I want you to practice some self-care for the rest of the day.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you... this means more than I can say.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. I'll see you next week."
