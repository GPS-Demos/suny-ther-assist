    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Take a deep breath and begin when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm at the park with my dog, Bella. It's a sunny day, and we're walking along the trail. I can hear birds chirping and feel the warm breeze on my skin. Suddenly, I see a large, unleashed dog running towards us. My heart starts racing, and I feel my palms getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10. I'm starting to feel anxious, but it's still manageable.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: The dog is getting closer, and I can see it's not friendly. Its teeth are bared, and it's growling. I try to pick up Bella, but before I can, the other dog lunges at us. I'm frozen in fear, and I can hear Bella yelping in pain. The sound is... it's horrible.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's going up. Maybe a 6 or 7 now. My chest feels tight, and I'm having trouble breathing normally.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Take a moment to breathe. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay... The other dog is attacking Bella, and I'm screaming for help. I try to pull the dog off, but it's so strong. I can feel its fur under my hands, and I smell blood. Oh god, there's so much blood...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's an 8. Maybe even a 9. I feel like I'm back there. My hands are shaking, and I can't stop seeing the blood.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're here in a safe place.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) I... I can hear people shouting in the distance, but no one's coming to help. Bella's cries are getting weaker, and I feel so helpless. I'm hitting the dog, trying to make it let go, but it's not working. I'm sobbing and screaming, \"Please, someone help us!\"",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 10. I feel like I can't breathe. My heart is pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. This is just a memory.",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) I... I know. It just feels so real. Finally, someone comes running up with a stick. They manage to scare the dog away, but Bella... she's lying there, not moving. There's blood everywhere, and I'm covered in it. I pick her up, and she whimpers softly. I'm crying, telling her she'll be okay, but I don't know if she will be.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's still high, maybe a 9. I feel so guilty and scared.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: (sniffling) We rush to the vet. Everything's a blur. I'm holding Bella, trying to keep pressure on her wounds. The vet takes her immediately, and I'm left standing there, covered in blood, shaking. I can't stop replaying the attack in my mind. What if she doesn't make it? What if I had done something differently?",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7 now. I'm still shaky, but I know Bella survived.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this well. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay. I'm here. Bella's okay now. We're safe.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How do you feel about ending the exercise here?",
    "Client: I think that would be good. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger?",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've done great work today. Let's debrief..."
