    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Chen?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's strange, you know? Reliving that night of the home invasion... it's like I was right back there. I could almost smell the musty odor of those men who broke in. My heart is still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The fear. It was so intense. I remember hiding in the closet, hearing their footsteps. I was terrified they'd find me. And my poor husband... I kept thinking about him downstairs, wondering if he was hurt. It's like... like I was helpless all over again.",
    "Therapist: How does that feeling of helplessness affect you now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still there, you know? Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night, thinking I hear something. I check the locks over and over. It's exhausting. I feel like I can't relax in my own home anymore.",
    "Therapist: I see. How did it feel to confront that memory today?",
    "Client: It was hard. Really hard. But... I don't know, maybe a little different this time? I mean, I was scared, but I also felt... maybe a tiny bit stronger? Like, I survived it once, I can face it again. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What do you think has changed?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... talking about it here, in a safe place, it's helping me see it differently. I'm not alone with it anymore. And maybe... maybe I'm starting to believe that I'm stronger than I thought.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How might this affect your daily life?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe I could try to relax a bit at home? Not check the locks so many times? It's scary to think about, but I want to feel normal again. I want to enjoy my retirement with my husband, not live in fear.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like meaningful goals. What's one small step you could take?",
    "Client: Hmm... Maybe I could try sitting in our living room with the curtains open in the evening? Just for a little while. It's been so long since I've done that. I miss watching the sunset from our window.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent idea. How do you feel about trying that?",
    "Client: Nervous, definitely. But also... a little excited? It's like I can see a glimmer of my old life. I want that back so badly. I'm tired of letting fear control everything.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is admirable. Shall we discuss how to approach this?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think... I think I'll need some strategies to manage my anxiety when I try it. And maybe... could we talk about how to involve my husband? He's been so patient, but I know this affects him too.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's work on that together.",
    "Client: Thank you. You know, it's strange. Even though remembering is painful, I feel... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I'm finally starting to process it all instead of just trying to forget.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant shift. How does it feel to notice that change?",
    "Client: It feels... good. Scary, but good. Like maybe there's hope, you know? I've been so focused on the fear and anxiety, I forgot what hope felt like. I want to hold onto that feeling.",
    "Therapist: That's a beautiful sentiment. How can we nurture that hope?",
    "Client: I think... maybe by keeping up with these sessions? And trying small steps at home. And reminding myself that I'm not alone in this. My husband, my family, you... I have support. I just need to let myself lean on it sometimes.",
    "Therapist: Excellent insights. What else might help you move forward?",
    "Client: I've been thinking... maybe I could join that support group you mentioned? Hearing other people's stories... it might help me feel less isolated. And maybe I could even help someone else someday. That would mean a lot to me.",
    "Therapist: That's a wonderful idea. How do you feel about taking that step?",
    "Client: Nervous, of course. But also... ready? I think I'm ready to start reconnecting with the world a bit. It's been so long since I've felt that way.",
    "Therapist: Your progress is truly remarkable. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I think... I want to focus on those small steps we talked about. Opening the curtains, joining the support group. And maybe... maybe planning a nice dinner with my husband. Something to look forward to, you know? It's been so long since we've done that.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like excellent goals. How can I support you in this?",
    "Client: Just... keep doing what you're doing, I guess. These sessions, they're hard, but they're helping. And maybe we could practice some more coping strategies for when I feel overwhelmed? I want to be prepared.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll work on that together. Any final thoughts today?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I might actually get there. It's a good feeling.",
    "Therapist: You're very welcome. I'm proud of your hard work. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, definitely. Thank you again. I'm looking forward to it."
