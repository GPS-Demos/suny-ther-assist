    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Carlos?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, Dr. Martinez. It was intense, reliving that moment when I was diagnosed with cancer. My heart's still racing a bit. I can feel the sweat on my palms. It's like I'm right back in that sterile hospital room, you know?",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The overwhelming sense of loneliness. Even though my wife was there, I felt so... isolated. It's like everyone else's world kept spinning, but mine just stopped. I remember thinking, \"Why me? Why now?\" We had just started talking about having kids, and then... this bombshell.",
    "Therapist: How does reflecting on that memory feel now?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. There's still fear, definitely. But also... I don't know, maybe a hint of pride? I survived that. I'm here. It's strange to feel both vulnerable and strong at the same time.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight, Carlos.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess it is. You know, during the exposure, I kept thinking about my parents. How they weren't there when I got the news. It brought up a lot of old feelings about their neglect. I mean, who doesn't show up when their kid has cancer? It's like... it confirmed every fear I had about not being important to them.",
    "Therapist: How do you see that connecting to your current symptoms?",
    "Client: Oh man, it's all tied together, isn't it? My anxiety, always waiting for the other shoe to drop... it's like I'm still that kid, hoping someone will show up, but preparing for disappointment. Even with my wife, sometimes I catch myself thinking, \"What if she leaves too?\" It's exhausting, always being on guard like that.",
    "Therapist: You've made an important connection there.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's hard to face, but... I think it's helping. You know, during the exposure, I had this moment where I realized I'm not that helpless person anymore. I've built a life, a career. I have people who genuinely care about me. It's just... sometimes it's hard to believe it, you know?",
    "Therapist: What do you think might help reinforce that belief?",
    "Client: Hmm... Maybe... actively recognizing the good things? Like, consciously noting when people show up for me. My wife, she's been amazing through all of this therapy stuff. And my team at work, they've been super supportive. I guess I need to let those positive experiences sink in more.",
    "Therapist: That's a great strategy. How else might you apply what you've learned?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I need to be more open with people. Let them in a bit more. It's scary, but... keeping everyone at arm's length isn't really protecting me, is it? It's just... it's keeping me stuck in that lonely hospital room, metaphorically speaking.",
    "Therapist: You're showing real insight, Carlos.",
    "Client: Thanks, Doc. It's not easy, but... I think I'm starting to see a way forward. These exposures, they're tough, but they're like... shining a light on things I've kept in the dark for so long. It's uncomfortable, but also... kind of liberating?",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about continuing with the exposures?",
    "Client: Honestly? Part of me wants to run for the hills. But a bigger part knows this is important. It's like... it's like I'm finally facing the monster under the bed, you know? And realizing that maybe it's not as big and scary as I thought. Don't get me wrong, it's still terrifying, but... I think I can do this. I need to do this.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is commendable. Shall we schedule our next session?",
    "Client: Yeah, let's do it. I'm nervous, but... I'm also kind of looking forward to it. Is that weird? To look forward to something that's going to be difficult?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It shows growth.",
    "Client: Growth... yeah, I like that. It's like I'm finally moving forward instead of being stuck. Thanks, Dr. Martinez. This... this means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work, Carlos. See you next week.",
    "Client: See you then, Doc. And... thanks again."
