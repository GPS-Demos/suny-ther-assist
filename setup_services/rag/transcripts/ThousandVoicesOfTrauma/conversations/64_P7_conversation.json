    "Therapist: Welcome back, John. Are you ready to continue our imaginal exposure work today?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here.",
    "Client: Okay. So, I'm supposed to close my eyes and describe the day my brother died, right?",
    "Therapist: Yes, whenever you're ready.",
    "Client: Alright. I'm closing my eyes now. It was a Tuesday morning. I remember waking up to my phone ringing. It was my mom. Her voice was shaky...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: She told me there had been an accident. My brother... he was driving to work and... a truck hit his car. She said he didn't make it. I couldn't believe it. I felt like I couldn't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling.",
    "Client: It's hard. I remember dropping the phone. My hands were shaking so badly. I felt dizzy, like the room was spinning. I kept thinking it had to be a mistake, you know? He couldn't be gone. We had just talked the night before about plans for the weekend.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. Keep describing what happened.",
    "Client: I somehow managed to get dressed. Everything felt surreal, like I was moving through a fog. I drove to my parents' house. The whole way there, I kept hoping it was all a misunderstanding. But when I saw my mom's face as I pulled up... I knew it was real.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I'm sorry. It's just... remembering her face, it's bringing everything back. The pain, the disbelief. It feels so raw, even now.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Take your time.",
    "Client: I walked into the house, and my dad was just sitting there, staring at nothing. He looked so lost. I'd never seen him like that before. It scared me. My mom hugged me, and we both just broke down crying.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The next few hours were a blur. Family members started arriving. Everyone was crying, hugging. I remember feeling like I should be doing something, but I didn't know what. I just felt... numb.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have felt that way.",
    "Client: Later that night, when everyone had gone home, I went to my old room. I found a picture of my brother and me from when we were kids. And that's when it really hit me. He was gone. I'd never see him again, never hear his laugh... I cried for hours.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job describing this, John.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's... it's hard, but I think it helps to talk about it. Is it okay if we stop here for today?",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've done great work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter?",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. How are you feeling now?",
