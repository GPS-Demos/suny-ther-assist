    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's begin. Close your eyes and recall the bullying incident.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in the schoolyard. It's lunch break, and I see a group of older boys approaching me. My heart starts racing, and I feel my palms getting sweaty. They're smirking, and I know they're up to no good.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10. I'm tense, but it's manageable.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue with the memory.",
    "Client: The leader of the group, a tall boy with spiky hair, pushes me against the wall. He's saying something about my lunch money, but I can barely hear him over the pounding in my ears. I feel so small and helpless. The other boys are laughing and egging him on.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. My chest feels tight, and I'm starting to sweat.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I try to push him away, but he's too strong. Suddenly, he punches me in the stomach. The pain is intense, and I double over, gasping for air. I can hear the others cheering. I feel so humiliated and angry, but I can't do anything. I just want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. I feel like I can't breathe properly. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I see a teacher coming towards us. For a moment, I feel relief. But then I realize it's Mr. Johnson, who always turns a blind eye to bullying. He just walks past us, pretending not to see what's happening. I feel so betrayed and alone. It's like even the adults who are supposed to protect us don't care.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's still at an 8. I feel a knot in my stomach, and my throat is tight.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The bell rings, and the boys finally leave me alone. I'm left there, leaning against the wall, trying to catch my breath. I can feel tears welling up, but I refuse to let them fall. I don't want to give them the satisfaction. As I walk back to class, I feel so angry at everyone - the bullies, the teacher, even myself for being so weak.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's gone down a bit, maybe to a 7. I still feel tense, but the worst of it has passed.",
    "Therapist: That's good. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little proud that I got through it? It's strange to revisit that memory. I haven't thought about it in years, but it still feels so vivid.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You did well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was tough, but I'm glad I did it. I just hope it gets easier with time.",
    "Therapist: It often does. We'll work on it together."
