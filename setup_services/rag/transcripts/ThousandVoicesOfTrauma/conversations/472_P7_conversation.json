    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the scene of your imprisonment?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in a small, dimly lit cell. The walls are concrete, and there's a tiny window high up near the ceiling. I can barely see outside. The air feels heavy and stale. There's a narrow bed with a thin mattress in the corner, and a metal toilet in the other. The door is solid metal with a small slot for food trays. It's so quiet, I can hear my own heartbeat.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: I feel... trapped. Claustrophobic. My chest is tightening, and I'm starting to panic. I keep thinking about how long I might be here, wondering if I'll ever get out. The silence is deafening. I try to distract myself by counting the cracks in the walls, but it doesn't help. I'm scared and alone.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe now. Keep going.",
    "Client: I remember the sound of footsteps echoing down the hallway. My heart races every time I hear them, not knowing if they're coming for me. Sometimes, I hear other prisoners crying or shouting, and it makes me feel even more helpless. I try to sleep, but I'm constantly on edge, afraid of what might happen next.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: The worst part is the uncertainty. I don't know how long I'll be here or what's going to happen to me. I think about my family, wondering if they know where I am. I feel so isolated from the world. The days blur together, and I start to lose track of time. I try to stay strong, but sometimes I break down and cry when I'm sure no one can hear me.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have these feelings. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: There's a moment when I hear a commotion outside. I can hear raised voices and what sounds like a struggle. My heart is pounding so hard I think it might burst out of my chest. I'm terrified that whatever is happening out there might spill into my cell. I curl up on the bed, trying to make myself as small as possible, praying that I'll be overlooked.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a deep breath and continue.",
    "Client: The noise eventually dies down, but the fear lingers. I realize how vulnerable I am in here. I start to imagine worst-case scenarios \u2013 what if I'm forgotten here? What if something happens to me and no one ever knows? I feel a deep, overwhelming sense of despair washing over me. It's like I'm drowning in hopelessness.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an amazing job. Keep going.",
    "Client: As time passes, I try to establish some sort of routine to keep myself sane. I exercise as much as I can in the small space, I try to meditate, and I make up stories in my head. But it's hard to stay positive. The isolation is crushing. I start talking to myself, just to hear a human voice. Sometimes, I wonder if I'm losing my mind.",
    "Therapist: It's okay. You're here now, and you're safe.",
    "Client: One day, unexpectedly, the door opens. My heart nearly stops. A guard tells me I'm being released. I can hardly believe it. As I'm led out, the bright light hurts my eyes. The fresh air feels almost painful to breathe. I'm overwhelmed with emotions \u2013 relief, disbelief, joy, but also fear. The world seems so big and intimidating now. I realize that even though I'm free, a part of me is still trapped in that cell.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I'm shaking a bit. My heart is racing, and I feel a mix of relief and residual fear. It's intense to relive those memories, but I also feel a strange sense of accomplishment for getting through it. Is it normal to feel this way?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Your reactions are completely normal.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to talk about this, but I think it's helping. I've never really described it in such detail before. It's like I can see everything so clearly now, even though I've tried to forget for so long. I'm surprised by how much I remember and how strong the emotions still are.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great courage. Would you like to take a break?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. This session has been intense, but I feel like I've made progress. It's exhausting to go through these memories, but there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe release? Like I'm finally confronting something I've been avoiding for years. I appreciate your guidance through this process.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Let's end here."
