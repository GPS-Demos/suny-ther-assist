    "Therapist: Welcome back. Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm... nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this part. The idea of reliving those experiences with the cult... it's terrifying. I've spent so long trying to forget.",
    "Therapist: Your anxiety is understandable. This process can be challenging, but it's crucial for healing.",
    "Client: I get that, but... what if I can't handle it? What if I completely fall apart? I've worked so hard to build a life outside of that world, and I'm scared this will undo everything.",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. You're in control here. What specific concerns do you have?",
    "Client: I'm worried about the flashbacks. Sometimes, even small things can trigger such vivid memories. The smell of incense, certain phrases... they can transport me right back. I'm afraid that deliberately revisiting those moments will be overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's a valid concern. We'll use grounding techniques to keep you present.",
    "Client: Okay, that helps a bit. Can you tell me more about what exactly we'll be doing? How detailed do I need to be when recounting things?",
    "Therapist: You'll describe a traumatic event in present tense, focusing on sensory details and emotions.",
    "Client: Present tense? That sounds intense. I suppose that's the point, though, right? To make it feel immediate so we can process it properly?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. It helps activate the memory fully, allowing us to reprocess it effectively.",
    "Client: I see. And you mentioned sensory details... that's going to be tough. There are so many sights, sounds, and smells I've tried to forget. But I understand why it's important.",
    "Therapist: Your understanding is spot-on. Remember, you're safe here as we work through this.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot. I know logically that I'm safe now, but emotionally... it's hard to feel that sometimes. Especially when thinking about those experiences. How long will each session last?",
    "Therapist: We'll do 30-45 minutes of exposure, with breaks if needed. Your wellbeing is the priority.",
    "Client: That's longer than I expected, but I appreciate that we can take breaks. I'm curious, what kind of changes might I notice after we start doing this? Will it affect my day-to-day life?",
    "Therapist: You may experience temporary increases in symptoms, but overall, expect decreased PTSD symptoms over time.",
    "Client: I see. That makes sense \u2013 it might get worse before it gets better. I'm willing to go through that if it means I can finally process this trauma. It's affected my relationships, my work... everything, really. I'm ready for a change.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Shall we begin with a relaxation exercise first?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think that would help calm my nerves a bit. I've been practicing some of the breathing techniques we've discussed, but I could use some guidance right now. My heart is racing just thinking about what we're about to do.",
    "Therapist: Let's start with deep breaths. Inhale slowly for 4 counts, hold for 4, exhale for 4.",
    "Client: [Takes a deep breath] Okay... I'm trying. It's hard to focus, but I'm doing my best. [Exhales slowly] That does help a little. It's grounding to have something specific to concentrate on.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Continue breathing. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: A bit calmer, thank you. Still anxious, but I feel more centered. I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be to start this process. Can you walk me through exactly what you need me to do?",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes, picture the event, and describe it as if it's happening now. Start whenever you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... [Takes a deep breath] I can do this. [Pauses] I'm standing outside the compound. The air is thick with the smell of sage and sweat. I can hear chanting from inside...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue focusing on the present moment in your memory."
