    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Can you describe the accident scene?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm driving on the highway. It's late at night, and the road is mostly empty. I'm tired from a long day of work, but I'm trying to stay alert. Suddenly, I see headlights in my rearview mirror. They're coming up fast, way too fast.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: The car behind me is swerving. I grip the steering wheel tighter, my heart starting to race. I'm thinking, \"Please don't hit me, please don't hit me.\" But then... BANG! The impact is so strong. My car spins out of control. I'm screaming, but I can't hear myself over the screeching tires and crunching metal.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Everything's a blur. The car's still spinning. I see trees, then road, then sky. I'm so disoriented. Then there's another impact as my car hits the guardrail. The airbag deploys, hitting me in the face. It hurts, and I can't breathe. I'm panicking, thinking I'm going to suffocate.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Finally, the car stops moving. It's so quiet now, eerily quiet. I'm shaking uncontrollably. I smell gasoline and burning rubber. I'm terrified the car might explode. I try to undo my seatbelt, but my hands are trembling so much. I can't get it to release.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I hear sirens in the distance. I'm crying now, feeling so helpless. My door is jammed, and I can't get out. I'm trapped, and the fear is overwhelming. I keep thinking about my family, wondering if I'll ever see them again. The pain starts to set in - my neck, my back, my head. Everything hurts.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Continue sharing.",
    "Client: The paramedics arrive. They're talking to me, but I can barely understand them. They use some tool to pry open the door. When they pull me out, the pain intensifies. I'm on a stretcher now, being loaded into an ambulance. The lights are so bright, and I'm still in shock. I keep asking about the other driver, but no one answers me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Reliving it is exhausting. My heart is still racing, and I feel a bit shaky. But... I also feel a sense of relief, like I've let something out that I've been holding in for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've shown incredible strength.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard, but I think it's helping. Each time we do this, it gets a little easier to talk about. The fear is still there, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming as it used to.",
    "Therapist: You're making great progress. Shall we continue?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I can. After the ambulance ride, I remember arriving at the hospital. The emergency room is chaotic, people rushing around. I'm still on the stretcher, feeling vulnerable and exposed. They're cutting off my clothes to check for injuries, and I feel so embarrassed and helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The doctors are asking me questions, but I'm having trouble focusing. My head is pounding, and I'm starting to feel nauseous. They're shining lights in my eyes, touching my neck and back. Every movement sends jolts of pain through my body. I keep asking about my family, if anyone has called them.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: They take me for scans - CT, X-rays. I'm scared of what they might find. The machines are loud and claustrophobic. I'm trying to stay still, but I'm in so much pain. When they bring me back to the ER, I overhear them talking about possible internal bleeding. That's when the fear really hits me - I could die from this.",
    "Therapist: You're very courageous. How are you feeling as you share this?",
    "Client: It's... intense. My palms are sweaty, and I can feel my heart racing again. But there's also a part of me that feels stronger, like I'm facing this head-on instead of running from it.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Would you like to continue?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I can. The next few hours in the hospital are a blur of tests, questions, and pain medication. I'm drifting in and out of consciousness. At some point, my sister arrives. Seeing her face, I finally break down completely. All the fear and shock come pouring out. She holds my hand, and for the first time since the accident, I feel a bit safer.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also a bit lighter. It's like I've been carrying this heavy weight for so long, and now I'm finally starting to put it down. It's still hard to talk about, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming as it used to.",
    "Therapist: That's fantastic progress. You should be proud.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It's still difficult, but I feel like I'm regaining some control over these memories.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable resilience. Shall we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. This session has been intense, but I feel like I've made some real progress. Thank you for guiding me through it.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. You've done excellent work today."
