    "Therapist: Hello, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Chen. I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares lately about my time in Afghanistan, and I'm not sure I'm ready to face all that again.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Your feelings are valid.",
    "Client: Thanks for saying that. It's just... the idea of reliving those moments, it's terrifying. I can still hear the explosions, smell the dust and gunpowder. And then there's the guilt... the faces of those we couldn't save. It's all so overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's what imaginal exposure helps with. Shall I explain more?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I want to understand what I'm getting into. Will it make the nightmares worse? I'm already struggling with sleep as it is.",
    "Therapist: It may be difficult initially, but it often improves sleep long-term.",
    "Client: Really? That would be... amazing. I haven't had a good night's sleep in years. But how does it work? I mean, how does talking about it make it better?",
    "Therapist: It helps process memories, reducing their emotional impact over time.",
    "Client: I see. But what if I can't handle it? What if I break down or have a panic attack right here in your office?",
    "Therapist: I'll be here to support you throughout. We can pause anytime.",
    "Client: Okay, that's reassuring. I trust you, Dr. Chen. It's just... hard to imagine facing all of that again. But I'm tired of letting it control my life. My depression has gotten worse lately too. I feel like I'm losing myself.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. This is a step towards reclaiming yourself.",
    "Client: Thank you. I guess I'm ready to try. Can you tell me what exactly we'll be doing? How does this imaginal exposure work in practice?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the traumatic event in detail. I'll guide you through it.",
    "Client: In detail? Oh boy. That's... intimidating. Will I have to close my eyes? I'm not sure I can do that without feeling trapped back there.",
    "Therapist: Eyes open or closed - whatever feels comfortable for you.",
    "Client: Okay, that's good to know. I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still nervous, but I'm also feeling a glimmer of hope. Maybe this can actually help me move forward. How long will the session last?",
    "Therapist: About 45 minutes. We'll take breaks if needed.",
    "Client: That sounds manageable. I'm glad we can take breaks if necessary. Dr. Chen, I want you to know how much I appreciate your patience with me. It's not easy being vulnerable like this, especially given my military background and the expectations that come with it.",
    "Therapist: Your vulnerability shows strength. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, I'm ready. Let's do this. I want my life back, and if this is the way to get it, then I'm all in. Just... please be patient with me if I struggle.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Your pace, your journey. Shall we start?",
    "Client: Yes, let's start. I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Thank you for being here with me, Dr. Chen. It means more than you know."
