    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Patel. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling a bit anxious, to be honest. Ever since we discussed doing this imaginal exposure exercise, I've been on edge. I keep thinking about that terrible day of the airplane crash. It's been years, but it feels so fresh in my mind.",
    "Therapist: Your anxiety is understandable. Shall we discuss the exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I'm really not sure what to expect, and that's making me even more nervous. I mean, I've managed to avoid thinking about the crash for so long. Is it really necessary to bring it all back up?",
    "Therapist: It is. Would you like to know why?",
    "Client: Absolutely. I need to understand why we're doing this. It feels counterintuitive to deliberately think about something I've been trying to forget.",
    "Therapist: Avoidance often prolongs PTSD. This exercise helps process the memory.",
    "Client: I see. But won't reliving it make things worse? I'm worried I might fall apart or have a panic attack. And what if I can't stop thinking about it afterwards?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How about we discuss coping strategies?",
    "Client: That would be helpful. I'm particularly worried about nightmares. Since my husband passed, I've been sleeping poorly, and I'm afraid this might make it worse.",
    "Therapist: We'll work on sleep hygiene too. Ready to hear about the process?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Though I'm still feeling apprehensive. Can you tell me exactly what I'll need to do?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the event in present tense. I'll guide you through.",
    "Client: Present tense? That sounds intense. Will you be there the whole time? What if I get too overwhelmed?",
    "Therapist: I'll be here throughout. We can pause if needed. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It's reassuring to know you'll be here. I'm still scared, but I trust you. You've helped me so much already with my anxiety. I just hope this doesn't set me back.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. This may help reduce your PTSD symptoms.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot. I've been trying to be strong for my family, especially since losing my husband. They rely on me so much. I want to get better for them too.",
    "Therapist: Your resilience is inspiring. Shall we set some goals for today's session?",
    "Client: Yes, that would be good. I think having some concrete objectives might help me feel more in control. What did you have in mind?",
    "Therapist: Let's aim for a 30-minute recounting. How does that feel?",
    "Client: Thirty minutes? That seems like a long time to talk about such a difficult event. But I suppose that's the point, isn't it? To really face it head-on?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. It may be challenging, but it's a crucial step forward.",
    "Client: I understand. I'm willing to try. Can we maybe start with a shorter time and work up to it? Or is it important to do the full 30 minutes right away?",
    "Therapist: We can start shorter if you prefer. What duration feels manageable?",
    "Client: Maybe we could start with 15 minutes? That feels less daunting. And then perhaps we could extend it in future sessions if I feel I can handle it?",
    "Therapist: That's a great suggestion. We'll start with 15 minutes today.",
    "Client: Thank you for being so understanding. I appreciate your flexibility. It helps me feel more in control of the process. Is there anything I should do to prepare myself before we begin?",
    "Therapist: Take some deep breaths. Remember, you're safe here. Ready?",
    "Client: Okay, I'm taking deep breaths. You're right, I am safe here. It's just a memory, it can't hurt me now. I think... I think I'm ready. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Close your eyes when you're comfortable. Let's begin."
