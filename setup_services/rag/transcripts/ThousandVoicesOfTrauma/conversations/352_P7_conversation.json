    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the animal attack?",
    "Client: Okay... I was on patrol in Afghanistan. It was a hot day, and we were walking through a small village. Suddenly, I heard growling. Before I could react, a large dog lunged at me from behind a building.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: The dog's teeth sank into my arm. I felt a sharp pain and panic set in. I tried to shake it off, but it wouldn't let go. My heart was racing, and I could hear my teammates shouting, but it all seemed distant.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The dog's eyes... they were wild and angry. I could smell its breath, a mix of dirt and something rotten. My uniform was torn, and I saw blood starting to seep through.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Right... okay. Um, one of my teammates finally managed to pull the dog off me. I fell to the ground, clutching my arm. The pain was intense, and I felt dizzy. I was so angry and scared at the same time.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What happened next?",
    "Client: Our medic rushed over to me. He started cleaning and bandaging the wound. I remember feeling embarrassed, like I should have been able to handle a dog attack better. But I was also relieved it was over.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to have mixed feelings. Continue.",
    "Client: After that, we had to complete our patrol. I was on edge the whole time, jumping at every sound. I kept replaying the attack in my mind, thinking about what I could have done differently.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling as you recall this?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. My heart is racing, and I feel tense all over. Part of me wants to stop talking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I know, but it feels so real. I can almost feel the pain in my arm again. And the fear... it's like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job staying with the memory.",
    "Client: Thanks. Um, when we got back to base, I had to get more treatment for the bite. The doctor was concerned about infection. I remember lying in the medical tent, feeling vulnerable and angry at myself for not being more alert.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to acknowledge those feelings.",
    "Client: I had nightmares about dogs for weeks after that. Even now, when I hear a dog bark unexpectedly, I tense up. It's frustrating because I used to love dogs before this happened.",
    "Therapist: You've shown a lot of strength sharing this. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. A bit shaken, but also relieved to have talked about it. It's still hard to believe how much this incident affected me.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You've done well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It helps to talk about it, even though it's difficult. I just wish I could get past this fear and move on with my life.",
    "Therapist: That's a common desire. We'll work on that.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. Sometimes I feel silly for being so affected by a dog attack when I've been through worse in combat. But I can't seem to shake it.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Each experience affects us differently.",
    "Client: You're right. I guess I need to be more patient with myself. It's just... sometimes I feel like I'm not the same person I was before all of this happened.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal part of the healing process.",
    "Client: I hope so. I want to get back to feeling like myself again. Do you think that's possible?",
    "Therapist: With time and work, yes. You're already showing progress.",
    "Client: That's encouraging to hear. I'm willing to put in the effort. I just want to feel normal again, you know? To be able to walk down the street without constantly being on alert.",
    "Therapist: That's a good goal. We'll work towards it together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm glad I decided to come to therapy. It's not easy, but I think it's helping. Is there anything else we should cover today?",
    "Therapist: You've done enough for today. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit drained, but also somewhat lighter. Like I've let go of something I've been holding onto for a long time. It's a strange mix of exhaustion and relief.",
    "Therapist: That's common after these sessions. Take care of yourself today.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you for your guidance and support. I'm looking forward to our next session, even though I know it won't be easy.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue this work next time."
