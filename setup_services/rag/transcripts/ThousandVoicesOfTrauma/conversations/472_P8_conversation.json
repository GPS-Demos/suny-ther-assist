    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like my whole body is vibrating. The memory of that accident, being trapped in the car... it's so vivid. I can still smell the gasoline and feel the cold metal pressing against my skin.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. How I thought I was going to die there, alone and scared. It's... it's overwhelming. I'm realizing now how much that moment has affected me, even years later. I've always tried to push it away, but now it's like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: And how does that realization feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's terrifying, but also... I don't know, maybe a little relieving? Like I'm finally acknowledging something I've been running from for so long. But mostly, I just feel vulnerable. Like I'm that scared woman in the car again, waiting for someone to save me.",
    "Therapist: I see. What physical sensations are you experiencing?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I can feel it pounding in my chest. My hands are clammy, and there's this tightness in my throat, like I can't quite catch my breath. It's similar to how I felt during the accident, but... but I know I'm safe here. It's just... it's hard to convince my body of that sometimes.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What else comes up for you?",
    "Client: I... I'm thinking about my kids. How close they came to losing their mother that day. And then, with the depression that followed and my divorce... I feel like I've let them down so many times. It's like that accident was the beginning of everything falling apart.",
    "Therapist: How do you see that connection now?",
    "Client: I guess... I never really dealt with the trauma. I just tried to push through, be strong for everyone else. But inside, I was crumbling. The depression, the divorce... maybe they were all ways of me trying to cope with something I wasn't ready to face. It's... it's a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: And how does that insight make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's complicated. Part of me feels angry at myself for not getting help sooner. But there's also this... this glimmer of hope? Like maybe now that I'm facing this, I can start to heal. Not just from the accident, but from everything that came after.",
    "Therapist: What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I... I think I need a moment. Just to breathe. To remind myself that I'm here, I'm safe. That I survived not just the accident, but everything else too. And maybe... maybe I need to be a little kinder to myself. To acknowledge how hard it's been, but also how far I've come.",
    "Therapist: Take all the time you need. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, but also... lighter? Like I've set down a heavy burden I've been carrying for years. It's scary, but also... freeing. I know there's still a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe I can do this. Maybe I can heal.",
    "Therapist: What's giving you that sense of hope?",
    "Client: I think... it's the fact that I'm here, doing this work. That I'm finally facing these memories instead of running from them. And... and knowing that I'm not alone in this. That you're here, guiding me through it. It makes me feel... stronger, somehow. Like maybe I'm not as broken as I thought I was.",
    "Therapist: How might this new perspective impact your daily life?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure yet. But I think... maybe I'll be able to be more present with my family. To stop living in fear of the next disaster. Maybe I can start to enjoy life again, instead of just surviving it. It's a scary thought, but also... exciting. Like I'm rediscovering parts of myself I thought were lost in that accident.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I want to keep working on this. To keep facing these memories and learning how to live with them, instead of letting them control me. And... and maybe to start rebuilding some of the relationships I've let slip away. Especially with my kids. I want them to know the real me, not just the scared, depressed version they've seen for so long.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that goal?",
    "Client: It's... it's intimidating. But also exciting. For the first time in a long time, I feel like I have something to work towards. Something positive. It's not just about surviving anymore, it's about... about thriving. About becoming the person I want to be, not just the person my trauma made me.",
    "Therapist: That's a beautiful aspiration. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm... I'm feeling drained, but in a good way. Like I've done something important. Thank you for guiding me through this. It means more than I can say.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and we'll continue next session."
