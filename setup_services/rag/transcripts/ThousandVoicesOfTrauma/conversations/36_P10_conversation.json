    "Therapist: Welcome, Fatima. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to be talking about the dog attack, and just thinking about it makes my heart race a little.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm ready. Where should I start?",
    "Therapist: Start from the beginning of the incident. Use present tense, as if it's happening now.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm walking in the park near my house. It's a beautiful spring day, and I can smell the fresh-cut grass. I'm on my lunch break from work, just trying to get some fresh air. I see a man walking his dog up ahead. It's a large breed, maybe a Rottweiler or something similar. I don't think much of it at first...",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: The man seems to be struggling with the dog. It's pulling on the leash, and I can hear it growling. I'm starting to feel uneasy. My palms are getting sweaty, and I'm thinking maybe I should cross to the other side of the path. But before I can... oh God...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Fatima. Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 6. My heart is pounding.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Remember, you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The dog suddenly lunges forward. The leash snaps, and it's running straight at me. I'm frozen in place. I can't move. I can hear the man yelling, but it's like everything is in slow motion. The dog is getting closer and closer. Its teeth are bared, and I can see the saliva flying from its mouth. I try to turn and run, but my legs won't work. I'm so scared...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment, Fatima. What do you feel in your body?",
    "Client: My whole body is tense. I can feel my muscles clenching. My heart is racing so fast I think it might burst out of my chest. I'm trembling all over. I want to scream, but no sound comes out. The dog is right there now, and I can feel its hot breath on my leg. Then... then it bites me.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Fatima. Remember, you survived this. You're here now, safe in my office.",
    "Client: Right... okay. The pain is intense. It feels like fire spreading through my leg. I finally find my voice and I'm screaming. I fall to the ground, and the dog is still there, growling and biting. I can feel its teeth tearing into my flesh. I'm hitting it, trying to push it away, but it's so strong. I can hear people yelling in the distance, but they seem so far away. The pain is overwhelming. I'm crying, begging for help. I think I'm going to die...",
    "Therapist: Take a moment, Fatima. Breathe deeply. You're safe now.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... I'm okay. The man finally reaches us and pulls the dog off me. I'm lying on the ground, sobbing. My leg is covered in blood. I can see the torn flesh, and it makes me feel sick. People are gathering around, someone's calling an ambulance. I'm in shock, I think. Everything feels distant and unreal. The pain is still there, but it's like I'm watching it happen to someone else.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking a little. My leg is throbbing, even though I know it's just a memory. But I'm also feeling... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I'm facing this head-on.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent, Fatima. Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 6 again. Still high, but not as bad as before.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The ambulance arrives. The paramedics are talking to me, but I can barely understand what they're saying. They're putting pressure on my wounds, and it hurts so much. I'm crying again. They lift me onto a stretcher and into the ambulance. The lights are so bright, and the siren is so loud. I keep replaying the attack in my mind. I can still hear the dog's growls, still feel its teeth. I'm terrified it might have given me rabies or some other disease. What if I never walk properly again?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings, Fatima. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I feel so helpless. Like my body has betrayed me. I couldn't run, couldn't fight back effectively. I'm angry at the dog, at its owner, at myself for not being more careful. But mostly, I'm just scared. Scared of dogs now, scared of going outside, scared of what's going to happen to me. The pain in my leg is throbbing with each heartbeat. I can smell the antiseptic the paramedics are using, and it's making me nauseous.",
    "Therapist: You're doing very well. How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still around a 6. It's not getting worse, at least.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're handling this admirably. Please continue.",
    "Client: We arrive at the hospital. Everything is a blur of activity. Doctors and nurses are everywhere. They're cutting away my pants to get to the wounds. I can hear them talking about how severe the bites are. Someone mentions possible nerve damage, and I start panicking again. What if I can't work? What if I can't take care of my family? The pain is getting worse as the shock wears off. They're giving me injections - tetanus, antibiotics, I think. It hurts, but nothing compared to my leg.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you remember this?",
    "Client: Tense. Really tense. My leg is aching, and I feel a little dizzy. But I'm... I'm okay. I can handle this.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. What happens next?",
    "Client: They take me for x-rays and scans. I'm lying there, trying not to move, and all I can think about is the attack. It keeps replaying in my mind. The growling, the pain, the fear. I'm worried about what the scans will show. Will I need surgery? Will there be permanent damage? The doctors come back with the results. They say I'm lucky - no major nerve damage, but I'll need stitches and possibly some physical therapy. I feel relieved, but also exhausted. The adrenaline is wearing off, and I just want to sleep.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Fatima. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm actually feeling a bit better. My SUDS is probably down to a 4 or 5 now. Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also helping, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful progress. Let's continue.",
    "Client: They move me to a room to stitch up the wounds. The local anesthetic helps with the pain, but I can still feel the tugging as they sew me up. It's unsettling. I'm trying not to look, but I catch glimpses of the damage. It looks awful, and I wonder if I'll have scars. Will I ever be able to wear shorts again without feeling self-conscious? The nurse is kind, though. She keeps talking to me, trying to distract me. I appreciate it, but I can't really focus on what she's saying. I'm still in a daze.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to remember the nurse's kindness?",
    "Client: It's... comforting, actually. A little bright spot in all of this. It reminds me that there are good people out there, people who want to help.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive observation. Please go on.",
    "Client: After they finish with the stitches, they give me some pain medication and information about caring for the wounds. They also talk to me about the possibility of PTSD and recommend that I see a therapist. At the time, I brush it off. I don't think I need therapy - I just want to go home and forget this ever happened. But now... well, I guess that's why I'm here, right?",
    "Therapist: Indeed. How do you feel about that decision now?",
    "Client: Grateful, I suppose. I didn't realize how much this was affecting me until I started having nightmares and panic attacks. Coming here... it's helping.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. What happened after you left the hospital?",
    "Client: My husband came to pick me up. He looks so worried, and I feel guilty for putting him through this. The car ride home is quiet. I'm in pain, despite the medication, and every bump in the road makes me wince. I'm dreading going back to that park, dreading seeing dogs again. I know not all dogs are dangerous, but right now, I can't imagine ever feeling safe around one again. When we get home, I'm overwhelmed by a mix of relief and anxiety. I'm safe, but I don't feel safe. I'm home, but everything feels different.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after trauma. How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 3, I think. Talking about it... it's not easy, but it's not as overwhelming as I thought it would be.",
    "Therapist: You're making excellent progress, Fatima. How about we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. I feel... drained, but also a little lighter, if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: It absolutely does. You've done very well today. Let's take a few deep breaths together to ground ourselves before we end the session.",
    "Client: *takes deep breaths* Thank you. This wasn't easy, but I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself, Fatima. We'll continue working through this in our next session. Take care of yourself this week.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again."

They say I'm lucky - no major nerve damage, but I'll need stitches and possibly some physical therapy. I feel relieved, but also exhausted. The adrenaline is wearing off, and I just want to sleep."
