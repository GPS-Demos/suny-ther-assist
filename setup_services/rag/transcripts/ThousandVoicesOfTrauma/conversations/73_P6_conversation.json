    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the workplace incident.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in the office. It's late, most people have gone home. I can smell the stale coffee and hear the hum of the air conditioning. My boss calls me into his office. I feel a knot forming in my stomach as I walk towards his door.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, about a 4 out of 10. I'm tense, but manageable.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue.",
    "Client: I enter his office. He looks angry. He starts yelling about a project I've been working on. Says I've messed it up completely. I feel my face getting hot, my hands are shaking. I try to explain, but he won't let me speak. He's getting louder, standing up now. I feel so small, so worthless.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Maybe a 7 now. My heart's racing.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: He's throwing papers at me now. Telling me I'm incompetent, that I should be fired. I can't breathe properly. I want to run, but I'm frozen. I can feel tears forming, but I'm desperately trying not to cry. I don't want to give him the satisfaction.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. Maybe an 8 or 9. I feel like I'm back there.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... He's still yelling. Saying I'm a disappointment, that he regrets hiring me. I feel so humiliated, so small. I just want to disappear. My whole body is tense, I can feel my nails digging into my palms.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. 9, I think. I feel overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're doing great. Stay with it.",
    "Client: He finally stops yelling. Just glares at me and tells me to get out. I stumble out of his office, feeling dizzy. Colleagues are staring. I can hear whispers. I rush to the bathroom, lock myself in a stall, and break down crying. I feel so alone, so worthless.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down a bit. Maybe a 7? I still feel shaky, but not as intense.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're processing it well.",
    "Client: I stay in the bathroom for what feels like hours. When I finally come out, the office is empty. I gather my things and leave, feeling numb. The drive home is a blur. I remember sitting in my car in the driveway, unable to go inside and face my family.",
    "Therapist: Current SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 5 now. I feel drained, but calmer.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was hard, but... I feel like I faced it.",
    "Therapist: You did. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... lighter somehow. Like I've let something go.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. Well done."
