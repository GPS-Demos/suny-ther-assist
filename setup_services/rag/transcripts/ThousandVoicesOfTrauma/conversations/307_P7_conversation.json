    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the moment you were imprisoned?",
    "Client: (Taking a deep breath) Okay... I remember being led into the cell. It was cold, so cold. The walls were gray and damp. I could hear the heavy metal door clanging shut behind me. I felt... I felt so alone and scared.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The cell was tiny, maybe 6 by 8 feet. There was a small cot in the corner with a thin blanket. A toilet and sink were on the opposite wall. The fluorescent light above flickered, casting eerie shadows. I... I couldn't believe this was happening to me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happened next?",
    "Client: I sat on the cot, my whole body shaking. I kept thinking about my family, my business. Everything I'd worked for... gone. I felt so helpless, so... worthless. (voice breaking) I... I don't know if I can continue...",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take your time.",
    "Client: (Taking deep breaths) Okay... As night fell, the cell got darker. The sounds changed. I could hear other inmates crying, shouting. It was terrifying. I curled up on the cot, trying to make myself as small as possible. I couldn't sleep. Every noise made me jump.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. What were you feeling?",
    "Client: Panic. Pure panic. My heart was racing, I was sweating. I kept thinking, \"This can't be real. This can't be happening.\" But it was. I felt like I couldn't breathe. The walls seemed to be closing in on me.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (Nodding) I know, but it feels so real... The worst part was the uncertainty. I didn't know how long I'd be there, what would happen to me. I felt so... powerless. Like my life wasn't my own anymore.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Can you tell me more?",
    "Client: As the days passed, it got harder. The isolation was crushing. I missed my husband, my home. I worried about my business falling apart. The guilt was overwhelming - I felt like I'd let everyone down. And the neglect... (voice trembling) No one seemed to care if I was okay, if I needed anything. It was like I didn't matter anymore.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those feelings. Keep going.",
    "Client: I tried to keep track of time, but the days blurred together. I'd pace the cell, trying to stay sane. Sometimes, I'd talk to myself just to hear a friendly voice. The food was awful, but I forced myself to eat. I was afraid of getting sick in there. The nights were the worst. I'd lie awake, replaying my mistakes, wondering if I'd ever get out.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: (Wiping tears) It's hard, but... I feel a little lighter. Talking about it... it's like I'm taking some of its power away. I know I'm safe now, but sometimes I still wake up thinking I'm back there.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. You're making progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this. It's still painful, but I'm starting to see that it doesn't define me. I survived it. I'm stronger than I thought.",
    "Therapist: You absolutely are. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: (Taking deep breaths) Okay... I'm here. I'm safe. It's over. (Pausing) You know, I think I'm ready to start working on forgiving myself. It wasn't my fault that I was neglected in there. I did what I had to do to survive.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Well done.",
    "Client: It is, isn't it? I feel... I feel like I can start moving forward now. Not forgetting, but not letting it control me either. Thank you for helping me through this.",
    "Therapist: You did the hard work. I'm proud of your progress.",
    "Client: (Smiling slightly) Thank you. I know we have more work to do, but for the first time in a long time, I feel hopeful. Like I can reclaim my life and my sense of self.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent place to end today's session."
