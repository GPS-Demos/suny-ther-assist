    "Therapist: Understood. Start when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm on the plane. It's a regular flight, nothing unusual. Suddenly, there's a loud bang. The plane shakes violently. People start screaming. I can feel my heart racing...",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Um... probably a 6 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue.",
    "Client: The oxygen masks drop down. I'm fumbling with mine, hands shaking. The plane is nose-diving. I can see the ground getting closer through the window. Oh God, we're going to crash...",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. My palms are sweating, and I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: There's chaos all around. People praying, crying. I'm gripping the armrests so tight my knuckles are white. The ground is coming up so fast. I'm certain I'm about to die. Then... impact. The sound is deafening. Metal tearing, glass shattering. I'm thrown forward, my seatbelt cutting into me...",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm right back there. My chest is so tight...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Breathing deeply) Okay... After the impact, there's this eerie silence for a moment. Then screams. Smoke is filling the cabin. I'm dazed, but I manage to unbuckle my seatbelt. People are pushing, trying to get out. I see... oh god, I see bodies...",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: Still a 9. I feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I stumble out of the plane. The heat from the fire is intense. There's debris everywhere. I hear moans, cries for help. I want to help, but I'm frozen. The smell of fuel and smoke is overwhelming. I can't believe I survived...",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down a bit. Maybe a 7? I feel drained.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Shaky. But... also a little relieved? Like I got through it again.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard, but... I think it's getting easier to talk about.",
    "Therapist: That's the goal. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I need a moment to collect myself.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take your time."
