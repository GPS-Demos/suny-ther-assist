    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Adnan. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit anxious, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about the plane crash again, and it's making me nervous.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'll try to keep that in mind. Where should I start?",
    "Therapist: Begin with boarding the plane.",
    "Client: Okay... I remember walking down the jet bridge. The smell of fuel was strong, and I could hear the engines humming. As I stepped onto the plane, I felt a wave of unease wash over me. I found my seat - it was by the window, which I usually prefer, but that day it felt confining.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: The plane started to taxi, and I gripped the armrests tightly. My heart was racing. I kept telling myself it was just nerves, that flying is safe. But there was this nagging feeling that something wasn't right. As we took off, the plane shuddered more than usual. I tried to distract myself by looking out the window, but the city below seemed to shrink away too quickly.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: It's hard... I remember feeling so helpless. Suddenly, there was a loud bang, and the plane lurched to one side. People started screaming. The oxygen masks dropped down, and I fumbled to put mine on. My hands were shaking so badly. The plane was losing altitude rapidly, and all I could think about was my family, my children. I thought I'd never see them again.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I can still hear the alarms blaring in the cockpit. The flight attendants were trying to keep everyone calm, but their faces showed fear. We were told to brace for impact. I closed my eyes and held onto the seat in front of me. The moments before we hit the ground felt like an eternity. I was praying, crying, my whole body tense with fear.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What happened next?",
    "Client: The impact was violent. I felt like my body was being torn apart. There was a deafening crash, and then everything went dark. When I came to, there was smoke everywhere. People were crying and shouting. I was disoriented, but somehow I managed to unbuckle my seatbelt. I could smell fuel and burning plastic. I was terrified the plane would explode.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're here now.",
    "Client: I... I'm sorry, this is really hard. I can feel my heart racing just talking about it. Can we take a break?",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've done well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still so vivid in my mind. Even though I survived, I can't shake the feeling of terror and helplessness. Sometimes I wake up at night, feeling like I'm back on that plane.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're very brave.",
    "Client: I don't feel brave. I feel broken. Every time I hear a plane overhead, I freeze. I haven't been able to fly since then, and it's affecting my work and my relationships. My husband is so patient, but I can see the worry in his eyes.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. We'll work through this.",
    "Client: I hope so. I want to feel normal again. I want to be able to travel without this overwhelming fear. But right now, it feels impossible.",
    "Therapist: Small steps. You've made progress today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I know it's a long process, but I'm grateful for your support. It helps to talk about it, even though it's painful. I just want to be able to think about that day without feeling like I'm reliving it.",
    "Therapist: That's our goal. You're on the right path.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's hard to see progress sometimes, but I'm trying to stay hopeful. Can we end here for today? I feel emotionally drained.",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've done excellent work.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'll try to practice the coping techniques we discussed before our next session. It's not easy, but I'm committed to getting better.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. Take care, Mrs. Adnan."
