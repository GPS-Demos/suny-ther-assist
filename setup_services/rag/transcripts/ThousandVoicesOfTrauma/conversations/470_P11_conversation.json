    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm not really sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving those moments in the hospital with my dad... it's like I was right back there again. The beeping of the machines, the smell of disinfectant, the way his hand felt in mine... it's all so vivid.",
    "Therapist: What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The silence. There was this... this awful silence after the doctor told us there was nothing more they could do. It felt like the world just... stopped. And I remember thinking, \"This can't be real. This isn't happening.\" But it was, and I couldn't do anything to change it.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... hard. Really hard. My heart was racing, and I felt this tightness in my chest. But... I don't know, maybe it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be? Like, I'm still here, you know? I got through it.",
    "Therapist: You did. What do you make of that?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe I'm stronger than I give myself credit for? It's just, for so long I've been avoiding anything that reminds me of that day. But facing it head-on like this... it's tough, but maybe it's not impossible.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your PTSD symptoms?",
    "Client: Well, I've been having these nightmares about dad's last moments, and I've been avoiding hospitals like the plague. But going through this... I don't know, maybe it's helping me realize that I can face these memories without completely falling apart?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What else?",
    "Client: I think... I think maybe I've been so focused on the pain of losing him that I've been ignoring all the good memories we shared. Like, during the imaginal, I remembered how he squeezed my hand and tried to smile, even when he was in so much pain. That was so... him. Always trying to make others feel better.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization feel?",
    "Client: It's... bittersweet, I guess? It hurts to think about, but it's also kind of comforting. Like, maybe I can start to remember dad without it always being about his illness and death.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant shift. How might this impact your recovery?",
    "Client: I think... maybe it could help me start to engage with life again? I've been so stuck in that horrible moment, but if I can remember the good times too, maybe I can start to move forward without feeling like I'm leaving dad behind.",
    "Therapist: That's an important step. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I want to... I want to try looking at some old photos. I've been avoiding them, but maybe it's time to remember the happy times too. And... maybe I could visit his grave? I haven't been since the funeral, but I think I might be ready now.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like meaningful goals. How do you feel about continuing with the exposures?",
    "Client: It's scary, but... I think I'm ready. I want to get better, to live my life again. Dad wouldn't want me to be stuck like this. So yeah, I'm in. It's not easy, but I'm starting to see that it might be worth it.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Shall we schedule our next session?"
