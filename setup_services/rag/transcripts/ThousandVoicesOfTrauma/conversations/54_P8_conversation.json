    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mrs. Rodriguez?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like my whole body is trembling on the inside. Remembering that day at work, when I got the call about my son's accident... it's bringing back so many emotions I thought I had buried.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: It's a mix of things. Sadness, of course, but also... guilt. I keep thinking about how I was annoyed with him that morning because he didn't clean his room. We had a little argument before he left for school. If I had known... (voice breaks) if I had known it would be the last time I'd see him...",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly painful.",
    "Client: It is. And you know what's strange? I can still smell the coffee from that morning. It's like my senses are heightened when I think about it. I remember the exact moment my phone rang, the coldness of the desk as I gripped it, trying to steady myself. My coworker's face when she saw me collapse... it's all so vivid.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you recall these details?",
    "Client: Tense. Very tense. My shoulders are up to my ears, I think. And there's this heaviness in my chest, like someone's sitting on it. My throat feels tight too, like I can't swallow properly. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"Why him? Why my boy?\" He was only 17, with his whole life ahead of him. And then I feel angry at myself for not being able to protect him. I'm his mother, that's my job, isn't it? But I couldn't save him from a drunk driver. What kind of mother does that make me?",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts affect you?",
    "Client: They... they make me feel helpless. And sometimes, I feel like I don't deserve to be happy anymore. Like I've failed at the most important job in my life. It's been five years, but the pain... it doesn't go away. It just changes shape.",
    "Therapist: What do you mean by that?",
    "Client: Well, at first it was raw, like an open wound. Now it's... it's more like a dull ache that flares up unexpectedly. Sometimes I'll be fine, and then I'll see a young man who looks like him, or hear his favorite song, and it's like I'm right back in that moment, getting that phone call.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope when that happens?",
    "Client: I... I usually try to distract myself. I'll clean the house or call a friend. But sometimes, I just let myself cry. It feels like that's all I can do. My husband, he copes differently. He gets quiet, goes to the garage to work on his car. We don't always know how to comfort each other.",
    "Therapist: What's that like for you?",
    "Client: It's lonely sometimes. We loved our son so much, but our grief... it's created this silence between us. I worry that we're drifting apart, even though we need each other now more than ever. I miss the way we used to be, before... before everything changed.",
    "Therapist: How does talking about this now make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard, but also... I don't know, maybe a little relieving? Like I'm letting out a breath I've been holding for years. I've never really talked about that day in such detail before. It hurts, but... maybe it's a good hurt? If that makes sense?",
    "Therapist: Can you elaborate on that?",
    "Client: I guess... it's like I'm finally acknowledging everything I felt that day, instead of pushing it away. And even though it's painful, it also feels... real. Like I'm honoring my son's memory by facing this head-on. I've spent so long trying to be strong for everyone else, maybe it's okay to just... feel this.",
    "Therapist: What do you think your son would say if he saw you now?",
    "Client: (long pause, then a soft laugh) He'd probably tell me to stop being so hard on myself. He was always like that, so kind and understanding. He'd say, \"Mam\u00e1, it's not your fault. You did your best.\" And you know what? Maybe... maybe he's right. Maybe I did do my best, even if it wasn't enough to save him.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... comforting, in a way. Like a small weight has been lifted. I've carried so much guilt for so long, but maybe... maybe I can start to let some of it go. Not all at once, but... little by little. For him, and for me.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, but... lighter, somehow. Like I've taken a step forward, even if it's a small one. I know there's still a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel... I feel like maybe I can do this. Maybe I can learn to live with this pain without letting it consume me.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant realization. What do you think?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'm ready to try. To really try to work through this, not just push it down. It's scary, and I know it'll be hard, but... I owe it to myself, to my husband, and to my son's memory. I want to be able to think of him and smile again, not just feel this overwhelming sadness.",
    "Therapist: That's a courageous decision. How do you feel about ending our session here?",
    "Client: I think that's good. I feel... exhausted, but in a good way? Like I've done something important. Thank you for listening, for helping me face this. I know we have more work to do, but I feel... I feel a little more hopeful than when I came in.",
    "Therapist: You've shown tremendous strength today. We'll continue next week?",
    "Client: Yes, I'll be here. Thank you again. I... I think I'm ready to go home and maybe talk to my husband about some of this. Maybe it's time we started facing this together.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive step. Take care, Mrs. Rodriguez.",
    "Client: Thank you, doctor. See you next week."
