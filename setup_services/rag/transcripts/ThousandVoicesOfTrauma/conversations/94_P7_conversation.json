    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the accident you witnessed involving police brutality?",
    "Client: Okay... I was walking home from the grocery store last month when I saw a police officer confronting a young man on the street. At first, it seemed like a routine stop, but then... (voice trembles) things escalated quickly. The officer started yelling and pushed the man against a wall.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The young man looked terrified. He kept saying, \"I didn't do anything, please!\" But the officer... (pauses, takes a deep breath) he just got more aggressive. He pulled out his baton and started hitting the man's legs. I could hear the impact, and the man's cries of pain. It was horrible.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that memory. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I wanted to help, but I was frozen in place. My heart was racing, and I felt so helpless. The officer kept yelling, \"Stop resisting!\" But the man wasn't resisting at all. He was just trying to protect himself from the blows. (voice breaks) I can still hear his screams...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel emotional. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Other people started gathering around, some were shouting at the officer to stop. I finally found my voice and yelled, \"Leave him alone!\" The officer glared at me, and for a moment, I thought he might come after me too. I've never felt so scared and angry at the same time.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: Eventually, another police car arrived. I thought they would stop it, but instead, they helped arrest the young man. He was bleeding and could barely stand. They just threw him in the back of the car like he was nothing. (starts crying) I keep thinking about what happened to him after that. Did anyone help him? Is he okay?",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those concerns. You're doing a great job expressing your feelings.",
    "Client: I couldn't sleep for days after that. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that man's face, heard his cries. I feel so guilty for not doing more. I should have recorded it or tried to intervene somehow. But I was just... paralyzed.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're not responsible for the officer's actions.",
    "Client: I know, but it's hard not to feel responsible. I've always believed in justice and thought the police were there to protect us. But now... (sighs heavily) I don't feel safe anymore. I'm constantly on edge when I'm out, always looking over my shoulder. I'm afraid of what might happen if I ever need to call the police. How can I trust them after seeing something like that?",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Keep exploring them.",
    "Client: It's changed how I see the world. I used to think these things only happened on the news, not in my neighborhood. Now, I wonder how often this happens and we just don't know about it. I feel like I've lost my sense of security, my faith in the system. And I feel so angry - at the officer, at myself for not doing more, at the world for allowing this to happen.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage in facing these emotions.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to talk about, but I know I need to. I just want to feel safe again, to not jump every time I see a police car or hear sirens. I want to believe in justice again, but right now, it feels impossible. How do I move past this? How do I reconcile what I saw with my beliefs about how the world should be?",
    "Therapist: These are important questions. We'll work through them together.",
    "Client: I hope so. Because right now, I feel lost. Every day is a struggle. I keep replaying that scene in my mind, wondering what I could have done differently. I know it's not healthy, but I can't seem to stop. It's affecting my sleep, my relationships, everything. I just want to feel like myself again.",
    "Therapist: Your resilience is admirable. We'll continue to work on this together."
