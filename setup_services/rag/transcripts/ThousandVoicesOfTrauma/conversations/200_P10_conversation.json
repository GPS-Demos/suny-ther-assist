    "Therapist: Welcome, Esther. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a part of me that wants to do this, to face these memories, but another part that's terrified. My hands are a bit shaky.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see... I see the inside of the cell. It's small, maybe 8 by 10 feet. The walls are a dull gray, and there's a single window high up, with bars. The light coming through is weak, like it's always overcast outside.",
    "Therapist: Good. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: There's a narrow cot against one wall. The mattress is thin, and the blanket is scratchy. I can feel it under my fingers. The air... it smells musty, with a hint of bleach. It's cold in here, and I can't stop shivering.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 60? My heart's beating faster.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. What's happening now?",
    "Client: I hear footsteps coming down the corridor. They're getting louder, and I know it's him. The guard. He's... he's not a kind man. I can hear the jangling of his keys.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm scared. My stomach is in knots. I want to disappear, to blend into the wall. The footsteps stop outside my door, and I hear the key in the lock. It's so loud in this quiet place.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Esther. Remember, this is a memory. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's higher. Maybe 75?",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. You're doing great. What happens next?",
    "Client: The door opens, and he's there. He's tall, towering over me. His uniform is crisp, but his eyes... they're cold. He's smirking, and I know what's coming. He says, \"Time for your daily reminder, old woman.\"",
    "Therapist: How do you respond?",
    "Client: I... I try to make myself small. I press myself against the wall, but there's nowhere to go. My voice is barely a whisper when I say, \"Please, not today.\"",
    "Therapist: What does he do?",
    "Client: He laughs. It's a harsh sound that echoes in the small cell. He steps closer, and I can smell the cigarettes on his breath. He says, \"You don't make the rules here. You're nothing. Just a useless old hag taking up space.\"",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, Esther?",
    "Client: I... I'm shaking. My chest feels tight. It's hard to breathe.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here in the room with me. Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: *takes a deep breath* Okay... okay. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: He... he grabs my arm. His grip is so tight, I know it'll leave bruises. He pulls me close and hisses, \"You should be grateful we even feed you. What use are you to anyone?\" I... I can feel the tears starting to fall.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Esther. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. Maybe 85?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Remember, you're safe now. What happens next?",
    "Client: He pushes me, and I stumble back onto the cot. My hip hits the metal frame, and I cry out in pain. He just laughs again. \"Pathetic,\" he says. \"This is where you belong, forgotten and alone.\"",
    "Therapist: How do you feel hearing those words?",
    "Client: I... I feel worthless. Like maybe he's right. I'm old, I'm alone... what good am I? But there's also this tiny spark of anger. How dare he treat me this way?",
    "Therapist: Hold onto that feeling. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I look up at him. My voice is shaky, but I manage to say, \"I'm a person. I have rights.\" He looks surprised for a moment, then his face twists with anger.",
    "Therapist: That took courage. How does it feel to stand up to him?",
    "Client: Terrifying. But also... empowering? My heart is racing, but I feel a little stronger.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens after you speak up?",
    "Client: He... he leans in close. His face is red with anger. He growls, \"Rights? You gave up your rights when you came here. You're nothing but a number now.\" Then he... he spits on the floor near my feet.",
    "Therapist: How do you respond to that?",
    "Client: I... I don't say anything else. I'm too scared. But I keep my eyes on him. I won't look away. He seems frustrated by this.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 80? But it feels different somehow.",
    "Therapist: Different how?",
    "Client: Like... like I'm not just a victim. I'm scared, but I'm also angry. I don't deserve this treatment.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What happens next?",
    "Client: He stands there for a moment, glaring at me. Then he turns and walks out, slamming the door behind him. The sound of the lock clicking feels so final.",
    "Therapist: And how do you feel once he's gone?",
    "Client: I... I start shaking. The adrenaline is wearing off, and I feel exhausted. But there's also this tiny feeling of... pride? I stood up to him, even if it was just a little bit.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress, Esther. How are you feeling now, back in the room with me?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. But also kind of amazed. I've never talked about this before, never relived it like this.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you tell me three things you see in the room?",
    "Client: I see... your green plant in the corner. The painting of the ocean on the wall. And the soft, blue cushion I'm sitting on.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Now, two things you can hear?",
    "Client: I hear the ticking of the clock and... a car passing outside.",
    "Therapist: Good. Lastly, one thing you can smell?",
    "Client: I can smell the lavender from that diffuser you have.",
    "Therapist: Perfect. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's lower. Maybe a 50?",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Esther. How do you feel about what we did today?",
    "Client: It was hard. Really hard. But... I feel like I faced something I've been running from for a long time. And maybe... maybe I'm stronger than I thought.",
    "Therapist: You absolutely are. You showed incredible courage today. How do you think this experience might change how you view yourself?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure yet. But I think maybe I'm not as helpless as I thought. Even in that terrible situation, I found a way to stand up for myself, even if it was small.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we end our session?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For helping me through this. I was so scared to face these memories, but I feel... I don't know, lighter somehow?",
    "Therapist: You've done the hard work, Esther. I'm here to support you. How about we end with a brief relaxation exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, please. That sounds good.",
    "Therapist: Alright, let's begin. Close your eyes and take a deep breath..."
