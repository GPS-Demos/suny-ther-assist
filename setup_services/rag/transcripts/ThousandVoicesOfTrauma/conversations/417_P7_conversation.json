    "Client: Okay... I'm at the airport. It's a busy morning, and I'm rushing to catch my flight. I can smell coffee from the nearby cafe and hear the constant chatter of people around me.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going.",
    "Client: I board the plane, find my seat, and settle in. The flight attendants are doing their safety demonstration, but I'm not really paying attention. I'm thinking about my upcoming meeting. Suddenly, there's a loud bang, and the plane starts shaking violently.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: My heart is racing. People are screaming. The oxygen masks drop down, and I fumble to put mine on. I can't breathe properly. The plane is tilting, and I can see the ground through the window. It's getting closer so fast...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I can't do this. It's too much. I feel like I'm back there again.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: Okay... The impact is brutal. My body slams forward, and everything goes dark for a moment. When I come to, there's smoke everywhere. People are crying and yelling for help. I'm trapped in my seat, and my leg is in excruciating pain.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Continue.",
    "Client: I manage to unbuckle my seatbelt, but I can't move my leg. The smoke is getting thicker, and I'm starting to panic. I can hear sirens in the distance, but they seem so far away. I'm terrified I won't make it out alive.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're doing great.",
    "Client: A flight attendant appears through the smoke. She's bleeding from her forehead but still trying to help. She sees I'm stuck and calls for help. Two passengers come over and help pry the seat off my leg. The pain is unbearable, but I know I have to move.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. Keep going.",
    "Client: They half-carry me towards the emergency exit. The slide is deployed, but it's chaos. People are pushing and shoving. When it's our turn, I'm terrified of sliding down with my injured leg, but I know I have no choice.",
    "Therapist: You're very courageous. Continue.",
    "Client: We make it down the slide, and I collapse on the tarmac. The heat from the burning plane is intense. Paramedics rush over, and I'm quickly loaded into an ambulance. As we drive away, I see more emergency vehicles arriving. I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job describing this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. My heart is racing, and I feel nauseous. But I also feel a strange sense of relief, like I've faced something I've been avoiding for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You've shown great strength.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to talk about, but I think it's getting a little easier each time. I never thought I'd be able to describe it in such detail without completely falling apart.",
    "Therapist: You've made significant progress. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: I think I can go on. After the ambulance ride, I remember arriving at the hospital. It was absolute chaos. The emergency room was overflowing with injured passengers. Doctors and nurses were running everywhere.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I was in so much pain, but they couldn't give me strong painkillers right away because they needed to assess my injuries. I remember lying on a gurney in the hallway, feeling so alone and scared. My leg was throbbing, and I could smell the smoke on my clothes.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: A doctor finally came to examine me. He told me my leg was badly broken and I needed surgery. I was terrified of being put under anesthesia. What if I didn't wake up? What if something went wrong?",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory very well. Continue.",
    "Client: The hours before the surgery were a blur of tests, questions, and pain. I kept thinking about the other passengers, wondering if they were okay. I felt guilty for surviving when I knew others hadn't.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those feelings. You're doing great.",
    "Client: When they wheeled me into the operating room, I was shaking uncontrollably. The anesthesiologist tried to calm me down, but all I could think about was the crash. As I started to lose consciousness, I had a moment of panic, thinking I was dying all over again.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. My palms are sweaty, and I feel a bit dizzy. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a bit stronger? Like I'm facing my fears head-on.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Would you like to continue or take a break?",
    "Client: I think I can continue a bit more. After the surgery, I woke up in the recovery room. The pain was still there, but duller. A nurse told me the surgery had gone well, but I'd need months of physical therapy.",
    "Therapist: You're doing very well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The next few days in the hospital were a mix of pain, nightmares, and constant news coverage of the crash. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the plane going down. I couldn't sleep without sedatives.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The worst part was when the investigators came to interview me. Having to recount every detail of the crash made it all feel so fresh again. I broke down several times during the interview.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard, but I feel like I'm starting to process it better. Talking about it like this, it doesn't feel as overwhelming as it used to. It's still painful, but it's like I'm starting to see it from a distance.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It's still difficult, but I feel like I'm regaining some control over these memories.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable strength today. How would you like to proceed?",
    "Client: I think I've reached my limit for today. It's been intense, but I feel like I've made some progress. Can we wrap up for now?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You've done excellent work today. Let's end here and discuss how you're feeling."
