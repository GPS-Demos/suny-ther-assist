    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and take a deep breath.",
    "Client: Okay, I'm closing my eyes. I can feel my heart starting to race already.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I'm back in my apartment. It's late at night, and I hear a low rumbling sound. At first, I think it's just a truck passing by, but then the whole building starts to shake. I jump out of bed, my heart pounding. The rumbling gets louder, and I can hear things falling and breaking in the other rooms.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: The shaking gets more intense. I'm trying to get to the doorway, but I'm stumbling. I can hear my neighbors screaming through the walls. I'm terrified, thinking the building might collapse. I make it to the doorway and grip the frame, my knuckles turning white.",
    "Therapist: Keep going. You're handling this bravely.",
    "Client: The earthquake seems to last forever. I can smell dust in the air, and there's a creaking sound that makes me think the building is about to give way. I'm frozen in place, unable to move. My mind is racing, thinking about all the people who might be hurt or trapped.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: When the shaking finally stops, I'm trembling all over. I can hear car alarms and people shouting outside. I want to check on my neighbors, but I'm afraid to move. What if there's another quake? I feel so helpless and alone.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep describing what happened next.",
    "Client: I finally gather the courage to leave my apartment. The hallway is a mess, with pictures fallen and cracks in the walls. I knock on my neighbor's door, an elderly woman who lives alone. She's okay but very shaken. We decide to go outside together. The street is chaos - people everywhere, some crying, others looking dazed. I see a building down the street that's partially collapsed, and my stomach drops.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. Continue.",
    "Client: We spend the rest of the night in a nearby park with other residents. No one wants to go back inside. I keep thinking about the people who might be trapped or hurt. I feel guilty for being safe when others aren't. As the sun comes up, we start to see the full extent of the damage. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. You're doing well.",
    "Client: In the days that follow, I can't sleep. Every little sound makes me jump. I keep replaying that night in my head, wondering what I could have done differently. I feel on edge all the time, waiting for the next disaster to strike. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel drained, but also a bit relieved. Talking about it is hard, but it feels good to get it out.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great courage today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still difficult to think about, but I feel like I'm making progress. Do you think it'll ever get easier?",
    "Therapist: With time and work, yes. You're on the right path.",
    "Client: I hope so. Sometimes I feel like I'll never be the same person I was before the earthquake. I used to feel so confident and in control, and now I feel vulnerable all the time. It's frustrating.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Change takes time.",
    "Client: You're right. I guess I need to be more patient with myself. It's just hard when the memories feel so fresh, even after all this time. But I'm committed to working through this. I don't want to let this experience control my life anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. You're making progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your support through this process. It's not easy, but I'm starting to see that it's worth it. I'm looking forward to the day when I can think about the earthquake without feeling overwhelmed by fear and anxiety.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of your efforts today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I am proud, actually. It's not something I would have been able to talk about like this even a few months ago. I'm starting to see that while the earthquake was a terrible experience, it doesn't have to define the rest of my life. I'm stronger than I thought.",
    "Therapist: Excellent insight. Shall we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that's a good place to stop. I feel emotionally drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've done something difficult but important. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care of yourself today.",
    "Client: I will. I think I'll go for a walk in the park later, maybe do some deep breathing exercises. It helps me feel grounded after these sessions. Thank you again. I'll see you next week.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. See you then."
