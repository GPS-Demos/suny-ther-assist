    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Can you describe the memory we're focusing on today?",
    "Client: Okay... It's about when I was 12 years old. My stepfather had been drinking heavily that night. He came into my room, furious about something I'd supposedly done wrong. I remember feeling terrified as he grabbed me by the arm and dragged me to the basement. He... he locked me in there. It was dark, cold, and I could hear rats scurrying around. I felt so helpless and alone.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: I was trapped there for hours. I couldn't see anything, and the darkness felt suffocating. I remember huddling in a corner, trying to make myself as small as possible. Every little sound made me jump. I kept thinking about all the horrible things that could happen to me down there. My heart was racing, and I couldn't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: It's hard to talk about this. I can feel my heart starting to race now, just like it did then. I remember crying silently, afraid that if he heard me, he'd come back and do something worse. The smell of the basement was overwhelming - musty and damp. I was so thirsty, but there was nothing down there. I kept hoping my mom would come home and find me, but she didn't.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: As the hours passed, I started to feel numb. The fear was still there, but it was like my body couldn't handle it anymore. I remember feeling so angry at my mom for not being there to protect me. I felt betrayed and abandoned. When I finally heard footsteps upstairs, I didn't know whether to feel relieved or more scared. What if he was coming back to hurt me more?",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: When the door finally opened, it was my mom. She looked shocked and scared. I remember her helping me up the stairs, but I couldn't look at her. I was so angry and hurt. She kept apologizing, saying she didn't know. But how could she not know? How could she leave me with him? After that night, I couldn't trust anyone. I felt like I had to always be on guard, always ready for the worst to happen.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Continue.",
    "Client: The effects of that night lasted for years. I had nightmares about being trapped in dark, small spaces. I couldn't stand being in basements or elevators. I struggled to form close relationships because I was always waiting for people to hurt or abandon me. It's only now, all these years later, that I'm starting to realize how much that experience shaped me. I'm still trying to unlearn all the fear and distrust that grew from that night.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. Talking about it brings back a lot of those old feelings - the fear, the anger, the helplessness. But there's also a part of me that feels a bit lighter, like I'm finally letting some of this out. It's strange, but I also feel a bit proud of myself for being able to talk about it without completely falling apart. I never thought I'd be able to do that.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard, and I know I have a long way to go. But for the first time, I feel like maybe I can work through this. I don't want that night to control me anymore. I want to be able to trust people, to feel safe. I know it won't happen overnight, but I'm starting to believe it's possible. Is that... is that normal? To feel both exhausted and hopeful at the same time?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. It's a common reaction.",
    "Client: That's reassuring to hear. I've spent so long trying to bury this memory, convinced that if I ignored it hard enough, it would go away. But talking about it, as difficult as it is, feels like I'm finally facing it head-on. I'm scared of what other memories might surface as we continue this process, but I'm also curious about what I might learn about myself. Do you think... do you think I'll ever be able to forgive my mom? Or my stepfather?",
    "Therapist: That's a personal journey. Take it one step at a time.",
    "Client: You're right, I shouldn't get ahead of myself. This is already a big step. I'm just realizing how much of my life has been influenced by that night. My relationships, my career choices, even where I choose to live - always on higher floors, never in basement apartments. It's like I've been living my life around this trauma without even realizing it. But talking about it like this, it feels like I'm starting to take some control back. It's exhausting, but also... empowering, in a way. Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a positive sign of progress.",
    "Client: Thank you for saying that. It helps to know that what I'm feeling is normal. I've spent so long feeling like there was something wrong with me, like I was broken in some way that couldn't be fixed. But being here, talking about this, it's starting to feel like maybe I can heal. It won't be easy, I know that. But for the first time in a long time, I feel like there's hope. That's... that's a big deal for me.",
    "Therapist: It is indeed. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've just run a marathon. Emotionally exhausted, but also accomplished. There's still a lingering anxiety, a part of me that wants to run away and never talk about this again. But there's also a stronger part that knows this is important, that wants to keep going. I'm nervous about our next session, but I'm also looking forward to it in a way. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's a common reaction. We'll end here for today.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you for guiding me through this. It wasn't easy, but I'm glad we did it. I feel like I've taken a big step today, even if it's just the beginning of a long journey. I appreciate your patience and support. See you next week?",
    "Therapist: Yes, see you next week. Take care."
