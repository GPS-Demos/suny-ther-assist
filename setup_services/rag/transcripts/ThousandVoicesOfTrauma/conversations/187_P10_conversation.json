    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to be diving into some heavy stuff today, and part of me wants to just run out that door. But I'm here, and I'm trying to remind myself why I'm doing this.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your honesty. Let's start with a SUDS rating. Where are you right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 6. My stomach's in knots.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Okay. Yes, I think so.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes if you're comfortable, and take us to that day.",
    "Client: It's... it's hot. Really hot. The sun's beating down, and I can feel sweat trickling down my back under my uniform. We're on patrol, moving through this small village. Everything's dusty, and there's this constant tension in the air. I'm scanning rooftops, windows, looking for any sign of trouble.",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: Low, mud-brick buildings. Narrow alleyways. There are clothes hanging out to dry, but no people around. It's too quiet. My squadmates are spread out, weapons ready. I can hear our boots crunching on the ground.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My heart's racing. My hands are clammy on my rifle. I'm hyper-aware of every sound, every movement.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) Suddenly, there's a crack of gunfire. Someone shouts \"Contact!\" and all hell breaks loose. I dive for cover behind a low wall, my ears ringing. I can smell the acrid scent of gunpowder.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to an 8. God, it feels so real.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Take a deep breath. Can you describe what's happening around you?",
    "Client: (Breathing heavily) There's chaos. Bullets are flying everywhere, chipping away at the walls around us. I can hear my team returning fire, shouting positions. I peek out to fire a few rounds, and that's when I see him... oh God...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it, Sarah. You're doing great.",
    "Client: It's Jimmy. My friend. He's hit. I see him go down, clutching his chest. There's blood... so much blood. I want to run to him, but I can't move. I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Terror. Guilt. I feel like I can't breathe. My whole body's shaking.",
    "Therapist: Remember to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor. You're here, you're safe.",
    "Client: (Gasping) Okay... okay. I'm here. But Jimmy... he's still there. I can hear him calling for help.",
    "Therapist: Stay with the memory. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I force myself to move. I'm crawling towards him, staying low. The gunfire's still intense. I reach him, and his eyes are wide with fear. There's blood bubbling from his mouth. I'm trying to apply pressure to the wound, calling for a medic, but I know... I know it's too late.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: (Crying) That I failed him. That I should have been faster, should have seen the threat sooner. I'm holding him, and I can feel his life slipping away. I'm telling him to hang on, that help is coming, but I know it's a lie.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well, Sarah. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. Maybe higher. I feel like I'm back there.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. Remember, you're here in my office, safe.",
    "Client: (Deep breaths) Okay... okay. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. Can you continue?",
    "Client: Yeah... The firefight is dying down. I'm still holding Jimmy, but he's gone. His eyes are empty. I can hear someone calling my name, telling me we need to move, but I can't let go. I don't want to leave him there.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are you experiencing?",
    "Client: Grief. Anger. This overwhelming sense of loss. And guilt... so much guilt.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: Someone's pulling me away. I'm resisting at first, but then I just... go numb. We're retreating, carrying our wounded. Jimmy's body is slung over someone's shoulder. Everything's a blur of motion and noise.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel?",
    "Client: Heavy. Like I'm moving through molasses. My ears are still ringing, and I taste dust and copper in my mouth.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Stay with it.",
    "Client: We make it back to base. There's a flurry of activity \u2013 medics rushing around, people shouting orders. I'm just standing there, covered in Jimmy's blood. Someone's talking to me, but I can't process the words. I feel... disconnected. Like I'm watching everything from outside my body.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7?",
    "Therapist: Good. Take a few deep breaths. How does the memory continue?",
    "Client: I'm in the makeshift morgue. They've cleaned Jimmy up, but he looks... wrong. Pale. I keep expecting him to open his eyes, to sit up and laugh like it's all been some sick joke. But he doesn't. I reach out to touch his hand, and it's so cold...",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking at this moment?",
    "Client: That it should have been me. That I let him down. That I'll never be able to face his family.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those thoughts. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I break down. Just start sobbing uncontrollably. Someone's there \u2013 I think it's our sergeant \u2013 putting an arm around me, leading me away. I can hear him saying something about it not being my fault, but I don't believe him.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel now?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Drained. Like I've run a marathon. My chest hurts from crying.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well, Sarah. We're almost done. Can you bring yourself back to the present moment?",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Yeah... yeah, I'm here. God, that was intense.",
    "Therapist: It was. You showed immense courage. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 5, I think. I feel... wrung out.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Tired, but... there's something else. Like a weight has lifted a bit. I've never talked about it in that much detail before.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step, Sarah. You did extremely well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still painful, but... maybe a little less overwhelming?",
    "Therapist: That's often how it feels. We'll end here for today. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you... really.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Sarah. I'm proud of the work you did today. We'll continue next session."
