    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Can you describe the cyberbullying incident?",
    "Client: Okay... I was scrolling through my social media feed when I saw a post about me. It was a photo from a work event, but someone had edited it to make me look... well, ridiculous. The comments were brutal. People I thought were my friends were laughing and adding cruel remarks. I felt my stomach drop and my hands start to shake.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: I couldn't look away from the screen. My heart was racing, and I felt like I couldn't breathe. I wanted to defend myself, but I was afraid it would make things worse. I felt so alone and exposed. It was like everyone was laughing at me, and I couldn't escape it.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: It's hard... I remember feeling so helpless. I kept refreshing the page, hoping someone would stand up for me, but no one did. The comments just kept coming. I started to doubt myself, wondering if maybe they were right about me. I felt worthless and ashamed.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I couldn't sleep that night. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw those comments. I felt paranoid, like everyone was talking about me behind my back. The next day at work was awful. I felt like everyone was staring at me, judging me. I wanted to disappear.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure I can continue. It's bringing back all those feelings of shame and anxiety.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Can you stay with it a bit longer?",
    "Client: I'll try. Um... I remember calling in sick the next day. I couldn't face anyone. I stayed in bed, alternating between crying and feeling numb. I kept checking my phone, even though I knew it would only upset me more. I felt so isolated and scared.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's intense. My heart is racing, and I feel that same sense of panic. But... I also feel a bit stronger, like I'm facing it instead of running away.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Can you tell me more about the aftermath?",
    "Client: The post eventually got taken down, but the damage was done. I felt like I couldn't trust anyone anymore. I withdrew from social events and became hyper-vigilant about my online presence. It took months before I felt comfortable in social situations again.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable resilience. How do you feel now, looking back?",
    "Client: It's still painful, but I can see that I've grown from it. I'm more cautious online, but I've also learned who my true friends are. I feel stronger, knowing I survived something that felt impossible at the time.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Well done for today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was tough, but I feel like I've taken a step forward. Is it normal to feel both drained and somewhat relieved?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Those feelings are common after exposure.",
    "Client: I appreciate your support through this. It makes a big difference having someone guide me through these memories without judgment.",
