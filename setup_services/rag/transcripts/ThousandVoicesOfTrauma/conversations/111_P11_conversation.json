    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Maria?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken up, to be honest. It's never easy to revisit that day, you know? The memory of the airplane crash that took my son... it's still so vivid. I can still hear the sirens, smell the smoke... (voice trembles) It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you this time?",
    "Client: (deep breath) The waiting. I remember sitting in that airport, staring at the arrival board. His flight was delayed, then delayed again. I had this pit in my stomach... like I knew something was wrong. Then the announcement came... (pauses) I've never felt so helpless in my life.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... different. Still painful, but... I noticed I could breathe through it better this time. My heart wasn't racing as much as before. I think... I think I'm starting to process it a little better? Is that possible?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What do you make of that change?",
    "Client: Well, I suppose it means I'm making progress, right? (sighs) But part of me feels guilty for not being as devastated. Like I'm betraying his memory somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. How does it relate to your recovery goals?",
    "Client: I... I guess it shows I'm getting stronger? My goal was to be able to think about him without falling apart. And today, I could picture his smile without immediately breaking down. It's bittersweet.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress, Maria. How does this connect to your daily life?",
    "Client: I've noticed I can look at his photos now. Before, I'd avoid our family album entirely. Now, I can sit with my grandkids and share stories about their uncle. It's still sad, but... there's some joy there too.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful. What strategies have helped you most?",
    "Client: The breathing exercises have been a lifesaver. And... writing to him. I know he can't read them, but it helps me feel connected. Oh, and the self-compassion stuff we've talked about. I'm trying to be kinder to myself.",
    "Therapist: Great insights. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's tough, but... I'm ready. For the first time in years, I feel like I'm honoring his memory by living, not just grieving. I want to keep going. It's what he would have wanted for me.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is admirable. Shall we schedule our next session?",
    "Client: Yes, please. And... thank you. For helping me through this. I never thought I'd be able to talk about it without completely falling apart. It means more than you know.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work, Maria. I'm here to support you.",
    "Client: (nods, wiping a tear) I know. It's just... this pain has been my constant companion for so long. Learning to live without it is... it's scary. But I'm starting to see a future where I can remember him with love, not just sorrow. That's worth fighting for, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How will you take care of yourself this week?",
    "Client: I think I'll visit his favorite park. Maybe bring my granddaughter. Share some stories. And if it gets too much, I'll use those grounding techniques we practiced. One step at a time, right?",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a thoughtful plan. Anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: No, I think... I think I'm okay for now. Just... thank you. For helping me see that there's life after loss. It's not the life I planned, but... it's still worth living.",
    "Therapist: You're very welcome, Maria. I'll see you next week."
