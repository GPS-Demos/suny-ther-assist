    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. The memories of that airplane crash came flooding back so vividly. I can still hear the screeching of metal and feel the violent shaking. My heart is racing, and my palms are sweaty. It's like I'm right back there in that moment of terror.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: Fear. Overwhelming fear. I keep thinking about how close I came to dying that day. The smell of fuel and smoke is so strong in my memory. I remember desperately trying to unbuckle my seatbelt with shaking hands, thinking I might not make it out alive. It's... it's hard to shake that feeling of helplessness.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Can you tell me more about that helplessness?",
    "Client: It's... it's like being trapped in a nightmare you can't wake up from. I remember looking around at the other passengers, seeing the panic in their eyes, and realizing we were all at the mercy of this machine falling from the sky. I felt so small, so insignificant. Even now, I sometimes feel that way in my daily life, like I have no control over what happens to me.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How does that feeling of lack of control affect you now?",
    "Client: It's... it's crippling sometimes. I find myself avoiding situations where I'm not in complete control. I haven't been on a plane since the accident, obviously. But it's more than that. I struggle with elevators, or even letting someone else drive when I'm in the car. It's like I'm constantly on edge, waiting for something to go wrong. I hate feeling this way, but I don't know how to stop it.",
    "Therapist: That sounds challenging. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm angry. Angry at myself for being so weak, for letting this experience control my life. But I'm also scared. Scared that I'll never be the person I was before the crash. I used to love traveling, exploring new places. Now, the thought of it terrifies me. I feel like I've lost a part of myself, and I don't know if I'll ever get it back.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to feel that way. How do these emotions manifest physically?",
    "Client: My body feels tense, especially my shoulders and jaw. There's this knot in my stomach that won't go away. Sometimes I get headaches or feel nauseous when these memories surface. It's like my body is constantly braced for impact, even when I'm safe at home. I'm so tired of feeling this way, but I don't know how to relax anymore.",
    "Therapist: That sounds exhausting. What do you think might help you feel more at ease?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to face my fears, to prove to myself that I can overcome this. But another part is terrified of even trying. I guess... maybe talking about it more, like we're doing now? It's hard, but it also feels like a relief to finally put words to these feelings I've been carrying around for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a great insight. How does sharing these experiences make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of emotions. There's relief, definitely. Like I'm finally letting go of a burden I've been carrying alone. But there's also vulnerability. Talking about it makes it real, and that's scary. Yet, there's a tiny spark of hope too. Maybe by confronting these memories and feelings, I can start to move past them. It's a small step, but it feels important.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What does that spark of hope mean to you?",
    "Client: It means... it means that maybe I'm not broken beyond repair. That there's a chance I can reclaim some of what I've lost. I've spent so long feeling like a victim, defined by this one terrible event. But talking about it, facing it head-on like this, makes me feel like maybe I can be a survivor instead. It's scary, and I know it won't be easy, but for the first time in a long while, I feel like there might be a way forward.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant shift. How do you see that way forward?",
    "Client: I think... I think it starts with small steps. Maybe I can start by talking more about my experiences, not just here in therapy, but with friends and family too. I've isolated myself for so long, and that hasn't helped. And perhaps I can start challenging some of my fears in small ways. Not getting on a plane right away, but maybe taking a short train ride or letting a friend drive me somewhere. It's terrifying to think about, but also exciting in a way I haven't felt in years.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like thoughtful steps. How are you feeling now, compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, I suppose. Still anxious and a bit shaky from reliving the memory, but there's also a sense of accomplishment. Like I've faced something I've been running from for a long time. I'm exhausted, both emotionally and physically, but it's a different kind of tired. Not the bone-deep weariness of constantly being on guard, but more like... like I've done something difficult but worthwhile. I'm nervous about what comes next, but also a little bit hopeful. Is that... is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. It's a natural response. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to explore more about how to manage these intense emotions when they come up outside of our sessions. And maybe we could talk more about those small steps I mentioned? I want to start moving forward, but I'm not sure how to begin. Is that something we could work on?",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll continue this journey together. How would you like to close our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to take a moment to just breathe and ground myself. This session has been intense, but in a good way. I want to sit with this feeling of hope for a bit, to really let it sink in. And maybe... maybe we could end with something positive? Like, despite how hard this was, I'm proud of myself for getting through it. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: That's more than okay. Let's do that. Take a deep breath, and when you're ready, share one thing you're proud of from today's session."
