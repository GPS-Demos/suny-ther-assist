    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving that time when I was so sick, it just brings back so many difficult emotions. I can still feel the fear and helplessness, you know? It's like I'm right back there in that hospital bed, wondering if I'll ever make it out.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The loneliness, I think. I remember lying there, day after day, with no one coming to visit. The nurses were kind, but... it's not the same, you know? I kept thinking about how I'd pushed everyone away over the years with my drinking. And now, when I needed someone the most, there was no one there. It was a wake-up call, but also just so... devastating.",
    "Therapist: Mm. How did it feel to revisit that today?",
    "Client: It was hard. Really hard. But... also different somehow. I mean, I've thought about that time before, but usually I just try to push it away. This time, actually talking through it... I don't know. It still hurts, but it's like I can see it more clearly now. Does that make any sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Can you say more about that clarity?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... I can see now how that experience ties into a lot of the issues I've been dealing with. The isolation, the fear of getting close to people, even some of my anxiety about my health. It's all connected to that time, isn't it? And maybe... maybe understanding that can help me start to move past it?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight, Sarah. How does that realization feel?",
    "Client: It's... a mix of things. Part of me feels hopeful, like maybe there's a way forward. But there's also this sadness, you know? For all the time I've lost, all the relationships I've missed out on. And honestly, a bit of anger too. At myself, at the circumstances... I don't know. It's complicated.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. What do you think this means for your recovery?",
    "Client: I think... I think it means I need to keep pushing forward. As hard as these sessions are, I can see how they're helping me understand myself better. And maybe, if I can face these memories head-on, I can start to build a life that's not controlled by them. It's scary, but... I want that. I really do.",
    "Therapist: That's great, Sarah. How can we support that goal?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe we could work on ways for me to connect with people again? I know that's been a big struggle for me, especially since getting sober. And after reliving that memory of being so alone, I realize how much I don't want that to be my future. It's terrifying to think about putting myself out there, but... I think I need to try.",
    "Therapist: That's a courageous step. Shall we explore that next time?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think that would be good. It's not going to be easy, but... I'm starting to see that nothing worth doing ever is, right? And hey, at least I'm not facing it alone this time. That's... that's something.",
    "Therapist: Indeed it is. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired. Really, really tired. But also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've set down a bit of the weight I've been carrying. It's a strange feeling, but not a bad one. I just hope I can hold onto this... this sense of possibility, I guess.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Sarah. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think I need some time to process all of this. But... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. I know I've got a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I might actually get there.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Sarah. Take care, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thanks, doc. See you then."
