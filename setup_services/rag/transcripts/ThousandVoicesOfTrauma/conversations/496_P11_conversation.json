    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Ahmed?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. Going through that memory of the car accident... it was more intense than I expected.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sound of the screeching tires and shattering glass. It was so vivid, like I was right back there in that moment. I could almost smell the burning rubber and feel the impact. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: Honestly, it was terrifying. I felt so helpless, just like I did during the actual accident. But... I also felt a strange sense of control this time. Like, I knew I was safe here in your office, even though my body was reacting as if I was in danger.",
    "Therapist: That's an important observation. How does this relate to your day-to-day experiences?",
    "Client: I guess... I've been avoiding driving or even being in cars as much as possible. But going through this memory, as scary as it was, made me realize that I can face these feelings without actually being in danger. Maybe... maybe I can start working on getting back behind the wheel.",
    "Therapist: That's a valuable insight. What else did you notice?",
    "Client: I realized how much anger I've been carrying. Not just about the accident, but about how it's affected my life. I had to take a semester off school, I lost my part-time job... it feels like everything got derailed. But I've never really let myself feel angry about it before.",
    "Therapist: How does acknowledging that anger feel?",
    "Client: It's... liberating, in a way. Like a weight I didn't know I was carrying has been lifted. But it's also scary. I'm worried about what might happen if I let myself feel it fully.",
    "Therapist: That's a common concern. How might we address that?",
    "Client: Maybe... we could work on some healthy ways to express anger? I've been bottling it up for so long, I'm not sure I know how to deal with it constructively.",
    "Therapist: That's a great idea. Anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: Yeah, um... I noticed during the exposure that I kept blaming myself for the accident. Even though logically I know it wasn't my fault, there's this voice in my head saying I should have done something differently.",
    "Therapist: How does that self-blame impact you?",
    "Client: It... it makes me hesitant to try new things or take any risks. I'm always second-guessing myself now. And I think it's contributing to my depression. It's like I'm punishing myself constantly.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How might we work on that?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe we could challenge those thoughts somehow? Or work on building my self-confidence back up?",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent suggestions. How are you feeling now?",

    "Client: I think... I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. And that facing these memories, as painful as it is, might be the key to moving forward. I want to keep working on this, even though it's difficult.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: I'm nervous, but committed. I want my life back, you know? And for the first time in a while, I feel like that might actually be possible. It's scary, but... I'm ready to keep going.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Shall we schedule our next session?",
    "Client: Yes, please. And... thank you. For guiding me through this. I know I have a long way to go, but I feel like I'm finally on the right path.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your progress is remarkable. See you next week?",
    "Client: Definitely. I'll be here. Thanks again."
