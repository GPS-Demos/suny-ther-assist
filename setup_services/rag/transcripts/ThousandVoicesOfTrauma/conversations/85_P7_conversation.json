    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and take us back to that moment in the hospital.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm lying on the hospital bed. The room is cold, and I can hear the beeping of machines around me. My husband is sitting next to me, holding my hand. The doctor just left after telling us the news...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: I feel... numb. Like this isn't real. The doctor's words are echoing in my head: \"The cancer has spread.\" My husband's grip on my hand tightens, and I can see tears in his eyes. I want to comfort him, but I can't move. I can't speak.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What's happening in your body?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. It's hard to breathe. I'm trying to process what this means, but my mind is racing. I'm thinking about our children, about work, about all the plans we had... (voice breaks) I'm scared.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel scared. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) The nurse comes in to check my vitals. She's speaking, but I can't understand her words. Everything sounds muffled, like I'm underwater. I'm staring at the ceiling, counting the tiles, trying to distract myself from the reality of what's happening.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: My husband starts asking questions about treatment options, but I can't focus on the conversation. I'm thinking about how I'm going to tell our kids. How will they react? Will they be okay? I feel so helpless, like I've failed them somehow.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here now. You're strong for facing this memory.",
    "Client: (nods) I remember looking at the clock on the wall. It's 3:47 PM. I think about how my life has changed in just a few minutes. How everything we've planned, everything we've worked for, might not happen now. I feel anger rising in me. Why me? Why now?",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel angry. Allow yourself to experience that emotion.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) I want to scream, to throw something, to run away from this room and this diagnosis. But I'm frozen. I can't even cry. I just lie there, feeling the weight of this news crushing me. My husband is saying something about being strong together, but all I can think is that I might not see our children grow up.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: The doctor comes back in with some papers. He's explaining the next steps, but his words are just a blur. I catch phrases like \"aggressive treatment\" and \"survival rates,\" and each one feels like a punch to the gut. I'm trying to listen, to be strong, but inside I'm falling apart.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Reliving that moment is exhausting. But also... I feel a little lighter? Like sharing it has lifted some of the weight off my shoulders.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. You've done excellent work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I didn't think I could talk about it without breaking down completely.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How about we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue working together to process this experience."
