    "Therapist: Mrs. Amiri, today we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm quite nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of reliving that terrible car accident... it makes my heart race just thinking about it. And with everything else going on in my life - the depression, the issues with my children's social media use - I'm not sure I can handle it.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. Can you tell me more about your hesitations?",
    "Client: Well, I worry that revisiting the accident will make me fall apart. I've worked so hard to keep it together for my family. And frankly, I'm embarrassed about how I might react. What if I can't stop crying? Or worse, what if I freeze up and can't say anything at all? It's all so overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Those are common fears. How do you think facing this memory might help?",
    "Client: I suppose... it might help me process what happened. Maybe I'll finally be able to drive again without panicking. And perhaps it could give me some tools to deal with the online harassment my daughter is facing. But it's terrifying to think about opening that door.",
    "Therapist: Understandable. Let's discuss what to expect during the exercise.",
    "Client: Alright. I'm listening, but I'm still apprehensive. Will you guide me through it step by step? I'm not sure I can do this on my own. And what happens if it becomes too much for me? I don't want to disappoint you or waste our session time if I can't go through with it.",
    "Therapist: I'll guide you throughout. We can pause or stop anytime. Your wellbeing is paramount.",
    "Client: That's somewhat reassuring. I appreciate your patience with me. I know I'm not the easiest patient, especially with my age and cultural background. It's not common in my community to discuss these things openly. But I want to get better, for myself and my family. Can you tell me more about what I might experience during the exposure?",
    "Therapist: You may feel intense emotions and physical sensations. This is normal and temporary.",
    "Client: I see. I'm worried about those physical sensations. Since the accident, I've had trouble with my blood pressure, and sometimes I get dizzy spells. What if something like that happens during the exposure? And emotionally, I'm concerned about how this might affect my depression. I've been managing it better lately, but this feels like it could set me back.",
    "Therapist: We'll monitor your physical state closely. Your safety is my priority.",
    "Client: Thank you, that's reassuring. I trust your expertise, even though this is all new and frightening to me. I've never done anything like this before. In my culture, we're often taught to just 'get over' things and move on. But I realize now that hasn't been working for me. How long will the actual exposure last? And what happens afterwards?",
    "Therapist: The exposure typically lasts about 30-45 minutes. Afterwards, we'll process your experience.",
    "Client: That sounds longer than I expected. I'm not sure I can talk about the accident for that long. There's so much I've tried to forget. But I understand why it's necessary. After we're done, will I be okay to drive home? I usually take the bus now, but my husband insisted on driving me today. He's worried about me, even though he doesn't fully understand what I'm going through.",
    "Therapist: We'll ensure you're grounded before leaving. Your husband's support is valuable.",
    "Client: Yes, his support means everything to me. I'm grateful for it, even if he doesn't always know how to help. This whole process has been challenging for our relationship. But I'm doing this for us, for our future. I want to be present for our grandchildren without this constant fear hanging over me. I want to be able to help my daughter navigate her online challenges without my own trauma getting in the way. I'm ready to try, even though I'm scared.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Thank you for your patience and understanding. I know this won't be easy, but I'm willing to face it. Let's start before I lose my nerve. I'm putting my trust in you and this process. Please guide me through it."
