    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a part of me that wants to dive in, but another part that's terrified. It's like my heart is racing already, just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0-100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 60. My palms are sweaty, and I feel a bit shaky.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see the office. It's late, everyone else has gone home. I'm working on a big project, trying to prove myself. The lights are dim, and I can hear the hum of the air conditioning. My boss... he comes in. He's smiling, but it's not a friendly smile. It makes my skin crawl.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he comes closer. Says he's impressed with my dedication. But the way he's looking at me... I feel trapped. He puts his hand on my shoulder, and I freeze. I can't move. I can't breathe. Oh god, I can't do this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Remember, you're safe here. Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's 80. Maybe higher. My heart is pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: You're safe. This is just a memory. What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he starts to... to touch me. His hands are everywhere. I want to scream, but no sound comes out. I'm paralyzed. And then... and then he... (starts crying)",
    "Therapist: It's okay, Sarah. You're here with me. Take a moment. Breathe.",
    "Client: (taking deep breaths) I... I can feel his hands on me. Even now. It's like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Can you tell me what you're feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. My stomach is in knots. I feel... dirty. Ashamed. Like it's my fault somehow.",
    "Therapist: Remember, it wasn't your fault. Stay with those feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he finishes. Tells me I should be grateful for the attention. That no one else would want me. That I'm lucky he sees past my... my skin color. God, I feel sick.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now, Sarah. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. But I'm also angry. So angry. How dare he? How dare he use my race against me like that?",
    "Therapist: That anger is valid. Stay with it. What do you want to say to him now?",
    "Client: I want to scream at him. Tell him he's a monster. That he doesn't get to decide my worth. That being Black doesn't make me less human, less deserving of respect. I want to report him, to make sure he never does this to anyone else.",
    "Therapist: Those are powerful feelings. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 70. I'm still shaking, but I feel... stronger somehow.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's continue. What happened after he left?",
    "Client: I... I sat there for a long time. Couldn't move. When I finally did, I went straight to the bathroom. Scrubbed my skin raw. Threw up. I wanted to disappear. But I also felt this... this rage building. Not just at him, but at the whole system that made him think he could get away with it.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. How does that rage manifest?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a fire in my chest. I want to burn everything down. The unfairness of it all... it's overwhelming. Being a Black woman in a white-dominated field, always having to prove myself, and then this... it's too much.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this incredibly well, Sarah. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. But also... I don't know, maybe a little empowered? Like by talking about it, I'm taking some of the power back.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant insight. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to about 55 now. Still high, but... manageable.",
    "Therapist: You're making great progress. Let's continue. What did you do the next day?",
    "Client: I... I went to work. Put on a brave face. But inside, I was screaming. Every time I saw him, I felt sick. But I couldn't let anyone know. I was afraid they wouldn't believe me, or worse, that they'd blame me.",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly difficult. How did you cope?",
    "Client: I threw myself into my work. Stayed late, came in early. Anything to avoid being alone with him. But it was eating me up inside. I started having nightmares, panic attacks. I felt like I was losing myself.",
    "Therapist: You showed incredible strength. What helped you get through those days?",
    "Client: I... I started journaling. It was the only way I could express what I was feeling without fear of judgment. And I reached out to a support group for Black women in professional settings. I didn't tell them everything, but just being around people who understood some of my struggles... it helped.",
    "Therapist: That was a very brave step. How are you feeling now, recounting all of this?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. But I also feel like I'm seeing it all more clearly. Like I'm not just reliving it, but... I don't know, processing it maybe?",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 45. I feel drained, but... lighter somehow.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Let's focus on the present for a moment. How has this experience affected your life today?",
    "Client: It's... it's changed everything. I left that job, started my own business. I'm more cautious now, but also more determined. I mentor young Black women entering the field, try to prepare them for the challenges they might face. But I still have nightmares sometimes. Still struggle with intimacy.",
    "Therapist: Those are common responses to trauma. You've shown remarkable resilience. How do you feel about yourself now, compared to then?",
    "Client: I feel... stronger. Wiser, maybe. But also more vulnerable. Like I know my own strength, but I'm also more aware of how easily it can be taken away. It's a constant balance.",
    "Therapist: That's a profound insight. As we wrap up this session, what final thoughts or feelings are coming up for you?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm proud of myself. For surviving, for speaking up now. But I'm also sad for that younger version of me, for all the women who've been through similar experiences. And I'm determined to keep fighting, to make things better.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Sarah. You've done incredible work today. What's your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 30 now. I feel exhausted, but... okay. Like I've run a marathon or something.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant reduction. How are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: My body feels heavy, but the shaking has stopped. I feel... grounded, I guess. Like I'm really here in this room with you.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. Let's take a few deep breaths together to close out the session.",
    "Client: (takes deep breaths) Thank you. This was hard, but... I think it was important.",
    "Therapist: You've made remarkable progress today, Sarah. We'll continue to work through this in our future sessions."
