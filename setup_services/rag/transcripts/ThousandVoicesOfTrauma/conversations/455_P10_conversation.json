    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Patel. How are you feeling about our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a part of me that wants to get this over with, but another part that's terrified of reliving those memories. My hands are a bit shaky just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's completely understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I suppose we should. *deep breath*",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I'm in our old house. The one Raj and I shared before... before everything fell apart. It's early morning, and I'm in the kitchen making chai. The smell of cardamom and ginger fills the air. I can hear Raj shuffling in the bedroom, probably getting ready for work.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: He comes into the kitchen. His face... it's twisted with anger. I don't know why. I never knew why. He starts yelling about the chai being too weak. I try to apologize, to explain that I can make another pot, but he won't listen. He... he knocks the cup out of my hand. Hot tea splashes everywhere, burning my arm.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 7. My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *inhales shakily* Okay. I... I start cleaning up the mess. My hands are shaking so much I can barely hold the cloth. Raj is still yelling, but now it's about how useless I am, how I can't do anything right. I want to defend myself, but I'm too scared. I just keep wiping the floor, trying to make myself as small as possible.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in that moment?",
    "Client: I feel... worthless. Terrified. Like I'm walking on eggshells in my own home. I keep thinking, \"What did I do wrong? How can I fix this?\" But there's never an answer. It's just... endless fear.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: Raj grabs my arm, the one that's already stinging from the tea. His grip is so tight, I know it'll leave bruises. He pulls me up, his face inches from mine. I can smell the alcohol on his breath. It's not even 8 AM, and he's already been drinking. He says... he says, \"You're nothing without me. Who else would put up with such a pathetic excuse for a wife?\"",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to an 8. My chest feels tight. I can almost feel his grip on my arm.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here in the present. You're safe. Take a moment to ground yourself if you need to.",
    "Client: *takes a few deep breaths* Okay. I'm... I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: I... I try to pull away, but he's too strong. He pushes me against the counter. The edge digs into my back. I'm crying now, begging him to stop. But it only makes him angrier. He slaps me across the face. The sound echoes in the kitchen. My cheek burns, and I taste blood where my tooth cut the inside of my mouth.",
    "Therapist: You're doing very well. Stay with the memory. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking that I need to get out. That I can't live like this anymore. But then I remember my parents' voices, telling me that a good wife stays with her husband no matter what. I feel so trapped, so hopeless.",
    "Therapist: What happens after he slaps you?",
    "Client: He... he finally lets go of my arm. He stumbles back, looking almost surprised at what he's done. For a moment, I think he might apologize. But instead, he just grabs his keys and leaves. The door slams so hard that the pictures on the wall rattle. And I'm left there, alone, my face stinging, my arm throbbing.",
    "Therapist: And how do you feel in that moment of being alone?",
    "Client: I feel... relief, at first. That it's over. But then this overwhelming sense of shame washes over me. I sink to the floor, my back against the cabinets. I can't stop crying. I feel so alone, so helpless. I keep thinking, \"Is this my life now? Is this all I deserve?\"",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still an 8. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Remember, you're here now, you're safe. What do you do next in the memory?",
    "Client: I... I sit there for a long time. I don't know how long. Eventually, I force myself to get up. I look at myself in the hallway mirror. My cheek is red and swollen. There are already bruises forming on my arm. I barely recognize myself. I start cleaning again, trying to erase any evidence of what happened. I don't want the neighbors to know. I don't want anyone to know.",
    "Therapist: How does that feel, trying to hide what happened?",
    "Client: It feels... suffocating. Like I'm erasing myself along with the evidence. I'm so angry at myself for not standing up to him, for not leaving. But I'm also terrified of what would happen if I did. Where would I go? What would people say?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What do you do for the rest of the day?",
    "Client: I... I go through the motions. I finish cleaning the house. I make lunch, even though I'm not hungry. I sit by the window, watching for Raj's car, dreading his return. Every little noise makes me jump. When the phone rings, I let it go to voicemail. It's my sister, asking if I want to go shopping. I can't bear the thought of putting on a happy face.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 6, I think. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I'm looking at it from the outside now.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Can you tell me about the moment Raj comes home?",
    "Client: *sighs* It's late. Past midnight. I hear his key in the lock and my whole body tenses. He stumbles in, clearly drunk. I'm sitting on the couch, pretending to read a book. He looks at me, and for a second, I think he might apologize. But he just grunts and heads to the bedroom. I stay on the couch all night, too afraid to go to bed.",
    "Therapist: And how do you feel in that moment?",
    "Client: I feel... resigned. Defeated. But there's also this tiny spark of anger. Not just at Raj, but at myself for allowing this to happen. I start thinking about my options, about what life might be like if I left.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 5. I feel exhausted, but also... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful?",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. Really tired. But I also feel like I've faced something I've been running from for a long time. It's painful, but... maybe necessary?",
    "Therapist: That's a very insightful observation. You've shown immense courage today. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay. *takes deep breaths* Thank you... for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Remember, you're not alone in this journey. We'll continue to work through these memories together."
