    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Johnson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit anxious, to be honest. I know we're going to be talking about my time in prison, and it's not easy for me.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We'll take it slow.",
    "Client: Okay. I appreciate that. It's just... being in that cell, it reminded me so much of losing my wife. The loneliness, the emptiness... it was overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Can you tell me more?",
    "Client: Well, I remember the first night. The cell door clanged shut, and it was like my whole world collapsed. I sat on that hard bunk, staring at the gray walls, and all I could think about was Sarah. How she'd never know where I was, how I'd failed her memory.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling.",
    "Client: It's hard. My chest feels tight just thinking about it. I kept picturing her face, you know? The way she looked in the hospital bed before... before she passed. And now here I was, in this tiny cell, feeling like I'd let her down all over again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The nights were the worst. I'd lie awake, listening to the sounds of the prison. Every creak, every shout... it all reminded me that I was alone. Sarah was gone, and I was trapped in this nightmare. I'd close my eyes and try to remember her laugh, her smile, but all I could see was that hospital room.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Sometimes, I'd wake up reaching for her, you know? For a split second, I'd forget where I was, and then reality would hit me like a punch to the gut. I was a prisoner, and Sarah was gone. It felt like I was grieving her all over again, but this time I was completely alone.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: The days blurred together. I'd go through the motions, but inside, I was just... numb. I kept thinking about all the plans we'd made, the future we'd dreamed of. And now, here I was, surrounded by concrete and steel, with nothing but regrets and memories.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're doing fine.",
    "Client: There was this one day... I found out it would have been our anniversary. I sat in my cell, holding the wedding ring they'd let me keep. I could almost hear Sarah's voice, telling me to stay strong, but I felt so weak. I cried that day, for hours. I hadn't cried since her funeral, but in that moment, it all came crashing down.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to express those emotions.",
    "Client: I felt like I was drowning in grief and guilt. How could I have ended up here? What would Sarah think of me now? I kept replaying our last conversation, wishing I'd said something different, done something different. Maybe if I had, I wouldn't have ended up in that cell, feeling like I'd lost her all over again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing very well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. Talking about it brings it all back. The loneliness, the regret, the overwhelming sense of loss. But there's also... I don't know, maybe a bit of relief? Like I'm finally letting some of this out.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. Would you like to continue?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. It's difficult, but I feel like I need to face this. In prison, I felt like I was stuck in this loop of grief and self-blame. Every day was a reminder of what I'd lost - not just Sarah, but my freedom, my dignity. I'd look at the other inmates and wonder if they could see the pain I was carrying.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: There was this one guard who reminded me of Sarah. She had the same kind eyes. Sometimes, when she'd do her rounds, I'd imagine it was Sarah checking on me. It was comforting for a moment, but then the reality would hit, and I'd feel worse than ever. It was like losing her all over again, day after day.",
    "Therapist: That must have been very difficult.",
    "Client: It was. I started to have these vivid dreams about Sarah. Sometimes they were happy memories - our wedding day, vacations we'd taken. But I'd always wake up to the harsh reality of my cell. The contrast was... it was almost unbearable. I felt like I was being tortured by my own mind.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this remarkably well. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of emotions. Talking about it is bringing back a lot of pain, but there's also a strange sense of... I don't know, maybe catharsis? Like I'm finally acknowledging how deeply this affected me. I've tried to bury these feelings for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a natural response. Would you like to continue?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I need to. You know, in prison, I started to feel like I was disappearing. Like the person Sarah had loved was fading away, replaced by this shell of a man in a jumpsuit. I'd look in the mirror and barely recognize myself. I kept thinking, \"What would Sarah think if she could see me now?\"",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're doing well.",
    "Client: It's hard to describe the depth of loneliness I felt. Even surrounded by other inmates, I felt completely isolated. I'd watch as others got visitors, received letters from loved ones. But for me, there was nothing. No one to talk to about Sarah, no one who understood what I'd lost. It was like being trapped in a bubble of grief that no one else could see or touch.",
    "Therapist: You're expressing this very well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling drained, but also like a weight is lifting. Talking about this, really delving into those memories and emotions, it's exhausting but also... freeing, in a way. I've held onto this for so long, it's almost a relief to let it out.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive sign. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. This session has been intense, but I feel like I've taken a step forward. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. We'll continue next time."
