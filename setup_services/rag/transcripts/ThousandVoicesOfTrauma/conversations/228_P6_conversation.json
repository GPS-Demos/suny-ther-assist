    "Therapist: Welcome back, Sarah. Are you ready to continue our imaginal exposure exercise today?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with your SUDS rating. How distressed do you feel right now, 0 to 100?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 40. My stomach feels a bit tight just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Let's begin. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that moment.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Alright. I'm... I'm in the refugee camp. It's crowded, noisy. I can smell sweat and dust. There are so many people around me, but I feel so alone.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that. What happens next?",
    "Client: A man approaches me. He's tall, intimidating. My heart starts racing. I want to run, but there's nowhere to go.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: 65. My palms are sweating now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: He... he grabs my arm. I can feel his fingers digging into my skin. I'm frozen, I can't move. The noise around us seems to fade away.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. I can barely breathe. I feel so helpless, so small.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: 80. It's... it's getting intense.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: He's pulling me towards a secluded area. I want to scream, but no sound comes out. I feel like I'm watching it happen to someone else.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What do you notice?",
    "Client: The rough texture of his hand. The sound of my heartbeat in my ears. A voice in my head screaming to fight back.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: 90. I feel like I'm there again. It's so real.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here with me. You're safe.",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) He... he starts to... Oh god, I can't do this. It's too much.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're in control here. SUDS?",
    "Client: 95. I feel like I'm going to be sick.",
    "Therapist: You're incredibly brave. Can you stay with it a little longer?",
    "Client: I... I'll try. (Pauses, breathing heavily) I can feel his hands on me. I'm so ashamed. Why didn't I fight harder?",
    "Therapist: It wasn't your fault. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Angry. Terrified. Disgusted. But... also a little stronger? Like I'm facing it.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: 85. It's... it's starting to come down a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's good. What do you notice as it decreases?",
    "Client: My breathing is slowing down. The memory feels... less overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing excellent work. How about now?",
    "Client: 75. I'm starting to feel more present in the room with you.",
    "Therapist: Well done. Let's start to bring you back. Open your eyes when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Opens eyes, looks around) That was... intense. But I got through it.",
    "Therapist: You did. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Drained, but... maybe a little proud? I didn't think I could face that memory.",
    "Therapist: You showed incredible strength. SUDS now?",
    "Client: Down to about 50. I'm feeling more grounded.",
    "Therapist: Excellent work today, Sarah. Let's take a few minutes to process what you experienced."
