    "Therapist: Hello, Aisha. How are you feeling today as we prepare for our imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Samantha. To be honest, I'm feeling quite anxious. I've been dreading this session all week. The idea of revisiting my time in prison... it's terrifying. I've spent years trying to forget those experiences.",
    "Therapist: I understand. It's normal to feel anxious. How can I support you?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. Part of me wants to run away from this, but I know I need to face it. Can you explain again why we're doing this? I mean, I know you've told me before, but I think I need to hear it again to convince myself to go through with it.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Imaginal exposure helps process traumatic memories. Ready to discuss further?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I need to understand how reliving these painful memories can possibly be helpful. It feels counterintuitive, you know? Like, shouldn't we be focusing on positive things instead of dredging up the past?",
    "Therapist: I hear your concern. Facing memories reduces their power over time. What worries you most?",
    "Client: I guess I'm afraid of being overwhelmed by the emotions. When I think about my time in prison, I feel this intense mix of fear, anger, and shame. It's like I'm right back there, helpless and alone. I'm worried that if I let myself fully remember, I might not be able to pull myself out of those feelings.",
    "Therapist: That's a valid concern. We'll go at your pace and I'll guide you throughout. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's somewhat reassuring. But what if I panic during the session? Or what if I can't handle it and need to stop? I don't want to disappoint you or feel like I've failed at the therapy.",
    "Therapist: You can stop anytime. There's no failure here. Your safety is priority. Shall we discuss coping strategies?",
    "Client: Yes, that would be helpful. I think having some tools to ground myself would make me feel more in control. And knowing that I can stop if it becomes too much is a relief. Can you tell me more about what to expect during the actual exposure? Will I need to close my eyes? How long will it last?",
    "Therapist: We'll start with relaxation techniques. Then you'll describe the memory while I guide you. It'll last about 30-45 minutes. Questions?",
    "Client: That doesn't sound as scary as I imagined. I think I can handle that. Will you be recording the session? And what about between sessions? Should I be doing anything specific to prepare or to process afterward?",
    "Therapist: Yes, we'll record for review. Between sessions, practice relaxation techniques. Any other concerns?",
    "Client: I think that covers most of my worries. I'm still nervous, but I feel more prepared now. Thank you for being patient with all my questions. I know this is important for my healing, even if it's difficult. I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable, Aisha. Remember, we're in this together. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Thank you for your support, Dr. Samantha. Let's do this."
