    "Therapist: Welcome, Mark. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to dive in, but another part is screaming to run away. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I guess so. As ready as I'll ever be.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see the bars. Cold, metal bars. The cell is so small, barely enough room to stretch out. The smell... it's overwhelming. Sweat, urine, and something I can't quite place. It's making me nauseous.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: Um, probably a 7. My heart's racing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear footsteps. Heavy boots on concrete. They're getting closer, and I... I can't breathe. I know what's coming. God, I don't want to relive this.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Mark. Keep breathing. What do you see?",
    "Client: The guard. He's... he's unlocking the cell. His face is blank, but his eyes... they're cold. He grabs my arm, roughly. I can feel his fingers digging into my skin. He's dragging me out.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe higher. I feel like I'm actually there.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing great. Take a deep breath. What happens next?",
    "Client: We're walking down the corridor. Other inmates are jeering, shouting. I can't make out what they're saying, but it's... it's terrifying. The guard pushes me into a room. It's... it's the isolation cell.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you see in the isolation cell?",
    "Client: It's... it's so dark. I can barely see anything. The walls are closing in on me. I... I can't... I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're safe, Mark. Take a deep breath. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: *audible deep breath* Okay... okay. The cell is tiny. No windows. Just a small slot in the door for food. There's a thin mattress on the floor, stained with... I don't want to know what. The smell is worse in here. It's suffocating.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. My hands are shaking. I feel... I feel so small, so helpless.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. This is... this is too much.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well, Mark. Remember, you're here in the present. You're safe. Can you tell me three things you see in this room right now?",
    "Client: I... I see the painting on the wall. The plant in the corner. Your... your blue tie.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, can you continue? What happens in the isolation cell?",
    "Client: The guard... he shoves me in. I stumble, fall to my knees. The door slams shut behind me, and I'm... I'm alone. Completely alone in the dark. I can hear my own breathing, so loud in the silence. I... I start to panic.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What does the panic feel like?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. My heart is pounding so hard I think it might burst out of my chest. I'm gasping for air, but it feels like there's not enough oxygen. I'm clawing at the walls, screaming for someone to let me out. But no one comes. No one ever comes.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Mark. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still a 9. Maybe even a 10. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here in the present. You're safe. Take another deep breath.",
    "Client: *audible deep breath* Okay... okay. I'm... I'm curled up in the corner now. I've lost track of time. It could be hours, days... I don't know. The darkness is... it's consuming me. I feel like I'm disappearing.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking, \"This is it. This is how I die.\" I'm convinced they've forgotten about me. That I'll waste away in this cell, alone and forgotten. I... I start to hallucinate. I see shadows moving in the darkness, hear whispers that aren't there.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel during this?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking uncontrollably. My muscles ache from being tensed for so long. I'm cold, so cold. The concrete floor is like ice against my skin. I... I wet myself at some point. The shame... it's unbearable.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well, Mark. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8 now. I feel... I feel drained.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Can you tell me what happens next?",
    "Client: I... I lose consciousness at some point. When I wake up, there's a tray of food by the door. It's... it's barely edible. Stale bread, some kind of watery soup. But I'm so hungry, I devour it. Then the waiting starts again. The silence is... it's deafening.",
    "Therapist: How long does this go on?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It feels like an eternity. Days blend together. I try to keep track by counting meals, but... I lose count. I start talking to myself, just to hear a voice. Any voice.",
    "Therapist: What do you say to yourself?",
    "Client: I... I recite poems I learned in school. I sing songs. Anything to fill the silence. But sometimes... sometimes I just scream. Scream until my throat is raw and I taste blood.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. My SUDS is probably around a 7 now. It's... it's draining to relive this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing amazingly well, Mark. Can you continue?",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, I can. Eventually, after what feels like weeks, the door opens. The light... it's blinding. I can't see anything at first. My eyes hurt so much. The guard grabs me, pulls me to my feet. My legs are so weak, I can barely stand.",
    "Therapist: What happens as you leave the cell?",
    "Client: They... they drag me back to the main cell block. The other inmates stare at me. I catch a glimpse of myself in a reflection... I barely recognize myself. I look... I look broken. Defeated.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel ashamed. Humiliated. But also... relieved. So relieved to be out of that darkness. The relief... it's almost overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 6, I think. I'm starting to feel a bit more grounded.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Mark. How do you feel about what you've shared today?",
    "Client: I... I'm surprised I got through it. It was... it was tough. Really tough. But... I feel a bit lighter, somehow. Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today, Mark. I'm proud of the courage you've shown. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves before we end the session. Can you tell me five things you can see in this room?",
    "Client: I see... the plant in the corner. The painting on the wall. Your blue tie. The clock on the desk. And... the sunlight coming through the window.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Now, four things you can touch?",
    "Client: The... the armrest of the chair. My jeans. The fabric of my shirt. And... the coolness of the air on my skin.",
    "Therapist: Good. Three things you can hear?",
    "Client: I hear... the ticking of the clock. The hum of the air conditioner. And... my own breathing, calmer now.",
    "Therapist: Very good. Two things you can smell?",
    "Client: I smell... the faint scent of your cologne. And... the plant in the corner, it has a subtle earthy smell.",
    "Therapist: Last one. One thing you can taste?",
    "Client: I... I can taste the lingering mint from the water you offered earlier.",
    "Therapist: Excellent job, Mark. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling more present. More grounded. My SUDS is probably down to a 3 or 4 now.",
    "Therapist: That's fantastic progress. You've done incredible work today. How do you feel about continuing this process in our next session?",
    "Client: I... I think I can do it. It's hard, but... I think it's helping. I feel... I feel a bit stronger.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. Remember to practice your breathing exercises this week. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we end?",
    "Client: No, I... I think I'm good. Thank you for... for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Mark. I'll see you next week. Take care."
