    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart's still racing, and I feel a bit shaky. That memory of the dog attack... it's like I was right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: It's strange. I can still hear the growling, you know? And I feel this tightness in my chest. I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. I mean, I'm a grown man, but in that moment, I felt like a scared little kid again. It's embarrassing, really.",
    "Therapist: There's no need to feel embarrassed. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I... I can feel my hands getting clammy. And there's this knot in my stomach. I keep replaying the moment when the dog lunged at me. I thought I was going to die. And now, sitting here, I feel this mix of relief that it's over, but also... anger? Yeah, I think I'm angry.",
    "Therapist: Anger is a common response. Can you tell me more about that?",
    "Client: It's like... I'm angry at myself for freezing up. I should have been able to defend myself better. But I'm also angry at the owner of the dog. They should have had it on a leash. It's not fair, you know? I was just out for a walk, and suddenly my whole life changed.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your experiences with bullying?",
    "Client: Oh wow, I hadn't even thought of that. But yeah, it's similar in a way. That same feeling of helplessness, of being singled out and attacked for no reason. It's like... whether it's kids at school or a dog on the street, I still end up feeling powerless.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts are you having about that connection?",
    "Client: It's... it's frustrating. I've worked so hard to move past the bullying, to build myself up. And then this dog attack happens, and suddenly I'm right back in that vulnerable place. It makes me wonder if I'll ever truly feel safe or strong.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How are you feeling physically now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm calming down a bit. The shaking has mostly stopped. But I feel exhausted, like I've run a marathon. And there's still this heaviness in my chest. It's like my body is carrying all this tension from both the attack and the memories of being bullied.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I think... I think I just need to breathe. And maybe... maybe I need to remind myself that I survived. Both the bullying and the dog attack. I'm still here, still fighting. That counts for something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How does acknowledging that make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a bit of a relief, actually. Like, yeah, these things happened to me, and they were awful. But I got through them. I'm resilient. And maybe... maybe that means I can handle whatever comes next too. It doesn't make the fear go away entirely, but it helps.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful perspective. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm noticing that as I talk about it, it becomes a bit easier. The memory is still vivid, but it feels less... overwhelming, I guess? And I'm realizing that while the dog attack brought up a lot of old feelings from the bullying, I'm not that same helpless kid anymore. I have resources now, support systems. It doesn't make it okay, but it makes it... manageable.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... it's comforting, in a way. But also a bit sad. I wish I could go back and tell my younger self that things would get better, you know? That he wouldn't always feel so alone and scared. But I guess... I guess I can still do that, in a way, by taking care of myself now.",
    "Therapist: That's a beautiful insight. How are you feeling now compared to when we started?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, I think. Still a bit shaken up, but not as overwhelmed. It's like... by facing the memory head-on, it's lost some of its power over me. I'm not saying I'm suddenly okay with what happened, but I feel like I can handle it better. And talking about it, making those connections to my past... it helps me understand myself better, if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: It absolutely does. What's one thing you want to remember from this session?",
    "Client: I think... I want to remember that I'm stronger than I sometimes give myself credit for. That even when I feel powerless, I have the ability to survive and grow. And that it's okay to feel scared or angry or sad about what happened. Those feelings don't define me, but they are part of my story.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful takeaway. How would you like to close our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to take a few deep breaths. Just to center myself before I head back out into the world. And maybe... maybe remind myself that I'm safe now. That I've got tools to handle my fears. It's not perfect, but it's progress, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's take those breaths together.",
    "Client: [Takes several deep breaths] Thank you. This wasn't easy, but I think it was important. I feel... I feel like I'm starting to understand myself better. And maybe, just maybe, I'm one step closer to not letting these experiences control me.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. How are you feeling about our next session?",
    "Client: I'm... cautiously optimistic, I think. It's not easy facing these memories, but I can see how it's helping. I'm nervous, but also... kind of looking forward to it? Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a sign of progress. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. Thank you for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone listen and understand. I'll see you next week.",
    "Therapist: Take care, and remember to be kind to yourself. See you next week."
