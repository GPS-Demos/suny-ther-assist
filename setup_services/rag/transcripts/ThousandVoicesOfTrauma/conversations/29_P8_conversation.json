    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Carlos?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. My heart's still racing, and I feel this tightness in my chest. The memories... they felt so real, like I was right back there in the middle of it all.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: It's like I can still hear the explosions, you know? The screams... I keep seeing my buddy's face, covered in blood. I feel... God, I feel so helpless. Like I should've done more, but I was frozen. I couldn't move. I... I let him down.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What emotions are you experiencing?",
    "Client: Guilt. So much guilt. And anger... at myself, at the situation. I'm scared too. It's been years, but I still feel like I'm in danger sometimes. And then there's this... emptiness. Like a part of me died out there with him.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when you first came home?",
    "Client: They're... they're not as intense now. Back then, I couldn't even talk about it without breaking down completely. I'd have these violent outbursts, you know? My wife... she didn't know how to handle it. I didn't know how to handle it. It was tearing us apart.",
    "Therapist: What's different now?",
    "Client: I... I can actually put words to it now. Before, it was just this overwhelming flood of emotions. Now, I can identify them, separate them. It still hurts, but it's... it's more manageable, I guess. I'm starting to understand that it wasn't my fault. That I did what I could in an impossible situation.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's freeing, in a way. But also scary. If it wasn't my fault, then... then I have to accept that sometimes terrible things just happen. That I can't control everything. And that's a hard pill to swallow, you know?",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you noticing?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking a bit. I feel this knot in my stomach, and my throat feels tight. But... but I'm breathing easier now. The tightness in my chest is starting to loosen up a little.",
    "Therapist: How do these sensations relate to your memories?",
    "Client: They're... they're like echoes, I guess. When I was there, in the thick of it, my whole body was tense, ready to react. Now, when I remember, my body still responds, but it's not as intense. It's like... like my body is learning that I'm safe now, even if my mind hasn't quite caught up yet.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... I'm thinking that maybe I can get through this. That maybe I'm stronger than I thought. But there's still this voice in the back of my head saying I don't deserve to move on, you know? Like, how can I be happy when so many others didn't make it back?",
    "Therapist: How does that conflict feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's exhausting. Like I'm constantly at war with myself. Part of me wants to heal, to be there for my family, to enjoy life again. But another part feels like that's a betrayal. Like I'm forgetting them if I'm not miserable all the time.",
    "Therapist: What would you say to a fellow soldier feeling this way?",
    "Client: I... I'd tell them it's okay to heal. That moving forward doesn't mean forgetting. That they honor their fallen comrades by living the life they fought for. But... but it's harder to apply that to myself, you know?",
    "Therapist: How might you start applying it to yourself?",
    "Client: I... I guess I could start by acknowledging that I'm trying. That showing up here, talking about this stuff, it's not easy, but I'm doing it. Maybe... maybe that's a form of honoring them too. Using the chance I got to try and be better, to be there for my family.",
    "Therapist: What does that idea bring up for you?",
    "Client: It's... it's both scary and hopeful. Like, maybe I can find a way to carry their memory without letting it crush me. To use what I've been through to be stronger, to appreciate life more. I don't know if I'm there yet, but... but maybe I'm on the right path.",
    "Therapist: How does this compare to where you were when we started?",
    "Client: It's... it's night and day, really. When we started, I could barely talk about any of this without having a full-blown panic attack. Now, it still hurts, but... but I can face it. I can put it into words. And I'm starting to see that maybe, just maybe, there's a way forward.",
    "Therapist: What's one thing you'd like to focus on before our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I want to work on being more present with my family. To try and let go of the guilt when I'm having a good moment with them. To remind myself that it's okay to smile, to laugh, to enjoy life. It's not betraying anyone. It's... it's living.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a meaningful goal. How do you feel as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but in a good way. Like I've run a marathon or something. There's pain, yeah, but also this sense of... I don't know, accomplishment? Like I've faced something big and come out the other side. I'm... I'm actually looking forward to our next session. Thank you, doc.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Carlos. Take care."
