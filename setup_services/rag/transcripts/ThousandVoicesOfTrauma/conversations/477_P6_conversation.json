    "Therapist: Alright, Sarah. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your baseline SUDS.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and begin describing the car accident.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) I was driving home from work. It was raining, and the roads were slick. I remember gripping the steering wheel tightly. Suddenly, I saw headlights coming straight at me. My heart started racing...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. I can feel my palms getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Continue.",
    "Client: The other car was swerving. I tried to avoid it, but everything happened so fast. There was a loud crash, and I felt a jolt through my body. The airbag deployed, and I couldn't breathe for a moment. I was so disoriented...",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. My chest feels tight, and I'm starting to shake a little.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) I could smell gasoline and burning rubber. People were shouting, but it sounded muffled. I was trapped in the car, and panic set in. I thought, \"This is how I die.\" It reminded me of... of being under attack during my deployment.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: Take a slow, deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Inhales shakily) The worst part was feeling helpless, just like in combat. I couldn't move, couldn't help anyone. I heard sirens in the distance, but they seemed so far away. I was cold, so cold...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: Still a 9. My heart is pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: I... I remember someone talking to me, telling me help was coming. But all I could think about were my fellow soldiers, the ones we couldn't save. The guilt was overwhelming. Why did I survive again when others didn't?",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... actually down to an 8 now. Talking about it... it's hard, but I feel a little less trapped.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Continue.",
    "Client: The firefighters arrived and started cutting me out of the car. The sound of metal grinding was horrible. But as they worked, I started to feel a tiny bit of hope. Maybe I would make it out alive after all.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 7. I'm still shaky, but I can breathe a little easier.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Keep going.",
    "Client: They finally got me out and onto a stretcher. As they loaded me into the ambulance, I remember looking up at the sky. It had stopped raining, and I could see stars. It was so different from the dust and smoke of the battlefield. I felt... grateful, I guess. Guilty for feeling grateful, but still...",

    "Client: Okay. (Opens eyes slowly) That was intense, but... I got through it.",

    "Client: Exhausted, but... okay. My SUDS is back down to about a 4.",
