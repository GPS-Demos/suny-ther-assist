    "Therapist: Good morning, Sarah. Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: Good morning, Dr. Thompson. To be honest, I'm feeling quite nervous. I've been dreading this session all week. The idea of revisiting that terrible cyclone... it makes my stomach churn. I'm not sure I'm ready for this.",
    "Therapist: I understand your apprehension. It's a challenging but crucial step. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried that reliving the experience will be too overwhelming. What if I panic? Or what if it brings back all those awful feelings I've been trying to suppress for years? I've worked so hard to move past it, and I'm scared this might set me back.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How about we discuss the process to ease your worries?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think that would help. I need to know what I'm getting into before we start. It's just... the thought of going back to that day, feeling that fear and helplessness again... it's terrifying.",
    "Therapist: The goal is to process the memory safely. We'll go at your pace. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: I guess my main question is, what exactly will happen during this exposure? Will I have to close my eyes and imagine everything in detail? And how long will it last? I'm worried about getting stuck in that memory and not being able to pull myself out.",
    "Therapist: You'll describe the event aloud while I guide you. We'll start with 20 minutes. You're in control throughout.",
    "Client: Okay, that doesn't sound as scary as I imagined. Twenty minutes seems manageable. But what if I get too emotional or upset during the process? Will you stop it? And how will this help me in the long run? I'm still not entirely convinced this won't make things worse.",
    "Therapist: If it becomes too much, we can pause. This helps by reducing the memory's power over time.",
    "Client: I see. So, it's like facing my fears head-on, right? I suppose that makes sense, even if it's daunting. I've always been one to face challenges, but this feels different. It's so personal, so raw. But if you think it will help, I'm willing to try. I just hope I can get through it without falling apart.",
    "Therapist: Your willingness shows great courage. Remember, you're not alone in this. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Thompson. Your support means a lot. I'm still nervous, but I feel a bit more prepared now. Yes, let's begin. I just need a moment to take a deep breath and center myself. (Pauses and takes a deep breath) Okay, I think I'm ready. Where should I start? Should I begin with the day of the cyclone, or do you want me to go back further?",
    "Therapist: Start with the day of the cyclone. Focus on the most vivid moment. Ready when you are.",
    "Client: Alright. (Takes another deep breath) It was early morning. The sky was an eerie greenish-gray color. I remember the wind picking up, howling around the house. The trees outside my window were bending unnaturally. I was alone, and I felt so small, so powerless against the force of nature..."
