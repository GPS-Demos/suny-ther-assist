    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. My stomach's been in knots all morning thinking about this. But I guess that's normal, right?",
    "Therapist: It's very common. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Let's do this before I change my mind.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day at work. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm at my desk. It's a normal Tuesday morning. The office is buzzing with the usual chatter and keyboard clicks. I can smell someone's coffee... probably Karen's hazelnut brew. My computer screen is open to a spreadsheet I've been working on.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud crash from the break room. At first, I think someone's dropped something, but then I hear shouting. Angry shouting. My heart starts racing immediately.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: Um... probably a 6? Maybe 7?",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Right... so, I stand up to see what's going on. Other people are looking too. Then I see Mark from accounting stumble out of the break room. His... his face is red, and he's yelling incoherently. Oh god, I can see now he's holding a knife from the kitchen.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: I know, I know. It's just... God, it's like I'm right back there. My palms are sweating. Mark's waving the knife around, screaming about how he's been passed over for promotion again. People are backing away, some are ducking under desks. I'm frozen, I can't move.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe 9. My heart's pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Feel your feet on the floor. You're here, in this room, safe.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... okay. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: Mark's getting closer to my section. I can see the veins bulging in his neck, the wild look in his eyes. Someone near me whimpers, and it snaps me out of my frozen state. I duck under my desk, fumbling for my phone. My hands are shaking so badly I can barely dial 911.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: I'm huddled under the desk, whispering into the phone. I can hear Mark getting closer, kicking chairs, still yelling. The 911 operator is asking me questions, but I can barely focus. I'm terrified he'll hear me.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My whole body is tense. I'm shaking. I feel like I can't breathe properly. It's like there's a weight on my chest.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe now.",
    "Client: *takes a shaky breath* Suddenly, there's a scream. It's Lisa from HR. I peek out and see Mark has grabbed her. He's holding the knife to her throat. Oh god, her eyes... they're so wide with fear. I feel utterly helpless.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 10. This is the worst part.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Take another deep breath.",
    "Client: I... I can hear sirens in the distance. Mark hears them too. He starts to panic, pressing the knife closer to Lisa's throat. She's crying, begging him to let her go. I want to do something, anything, but I'm paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: The police burst in. Everything happens so fast. There's shouting, movement. I see Mark jerk, and for a horrible moment, I think he's cut Lisa. But then he crumples to the ground. They've tasered him.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. But also kind of numb? It's weird.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. What happens next?",
    "Client: Lisa collapses, sobbing. People start emerging from their hiding spots. There's a lot of crying, hugging. Someone helps me up from under the desk. My legs feel like jelly. The police are securing Mark, and paramedics are coming in.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What do you notice?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm trembling all over. My mouth is dry. I feel dizzy, like the room is spinning a bit. Someone puts a blanket around my shoulders, but I barely feel it. Everything seems kind of... far away?",
    "Therapist: That's dissociation. It's a common response to trauma. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: Maybe... a 7? The immediate danger is over, but I still feel so shaken.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Continue with what happened.",
    "Client: We're all herded outside. The fresh air hits me, and it's like I can breathe again. But then I see Mark being led out in handcuffs. He looks... defeated. Different from the raging man I saw earlier. It's jarring.",
    "Therapist: How does seeing him like that make you feel?",
    "Client: Confused, I guess? And angry. How could he do this to us? To Lisa? We trusted him, worked with him every day. And now... now everything's changed.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: We're all questioned by the police. I give my statement, but it feels surreal, like I'm talking about something that happened to someone else. They tell us the office will be closed for a few days. As I'm leaving, I see Lisa being comforted by our manager. She looks so small, so vulnerable. It hits me then - this really happened. We could have died today.",
    "Therapist: That's a heavy realization. How does it sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... overwhelming. I feel a mix of relief that we're okay, and terror at how close it was. And guilt... why do I feel guilty?",
    "Therapist: Guilt is common in these situations. Can you explore that feeling?",
    "Client: I guess... I feel guilty that I didn't do anything. That I just hid. Should I have tried to help Lisa? To stop Mark somehow?",
    "Therapist: Remember, you did what you needed to survive. There's no right or wrong in these situations.",
    "Client: I know that logically, but... it's hard. As I'm driving home, everything starts to hit me. I start crying and have to pull over. I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal stress response. How long did it take you to calm down?",
    "Client: It felt like hours, but it was probably about 30 minutes. I called my mom. Hearing her voice helped ground me a bit.",
    "Therapist: That was a good coping strategy. What's your SUDS level now, as we're wrapping up the memory?",
    "Client: I'd say... maybe a 5? I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little proud that I got through telling it?",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You did excellent work today. Let's take a few deep breaths together to close the session.",
    "Client: *takes deep breaths* Thank you. This was hard, but... I think it helped.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later. We'll process this more next time.",
    "Client: Okay. I will. Thanks again.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Sarah. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
