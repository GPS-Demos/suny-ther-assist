    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like my whole body is vibrating. Remembering that moment when Sarah told me she wanted a divorce... it's bringing up so much. My chest feels tight, and there's this knot in my stomach. I can still hear her voice, you know? The way it cracked when she said, \"I can't do this anymore.\" God, it's like I'm right back there in our kitchen.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... maybe I could have done something differently. Maybe if I had been home more, or if I had been more attentive. But then I get angry, you know? I gave her everything I could. I worked so hard to provide for us, and it still wasn't enough. And now I'm alone in that big house we bought together. It's... it's overwhelming. I feel like a failure, like I couldn't even keep my marriage together. What does that say about me?",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts make you feel emotionally?",
    "Client: It's a rollercoaster. One minute I'm sad, feeling this deep, aching loss. Then I'm angry - at Sarah, at myself, at the whole situation. And then there's this... fear. I'm 64, for crying out loud. I never thought I'd be starting over at this age. What if I'm alone forever? What if I can't handle living by myself? It's... it's terrifying. And underneath it all, there's this constant anxiety, like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop. Like something else is going to go wrong.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you experiencing as you talk about this?",
    "Client: My heart's racing. I can feel it pounding in my chest. My palms are sweaty, and I keep clenching my fists without realizing it. There's this tightness in my throat, like I'm trying not to cry. And I feel... heavy. Like there's this weight pressing down on me. It's hard to take a full breath.",
    "Therapist: How does this compare to how you felt during the actual event?",
    "Client: It's... it's surprisingly similar. Maybe not as intense, but the same feelings are there. When Sarah told me, I felt like the floor had dropped out from under me. I couldn't breathe, couldn't think straight. I remember my vision kind of... narrowing? Like I could only see her face, everything else was blurry. And I felt so cold, like all the warmth had been sucked out of me. Now, talking about it, I'm feeling echoes of all that. It's not as overwhelming, but it's definitely there.",
    "Therapist: What's the most challenging part of revisiting this memory?",
    "Client: The most challenging part... I think it's facing the reality that it's over. Every time I go through this, it's like I'm losing her all over again. There's this tiny part of me that still hopes it's all a bad dream, you know? But then I have to confront the fact that it's real, it happened, and my life is never going to be the same. And that... that's incredibly painful. It's like ripping off a bandage and finding the wound hasn't healed at all.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with these feelings when they arise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure I'm coping very well, to be honest. Sometimes I try to distract myself with work. I've been putting in longer hours at the office, taking on extra projects. Other times, I find myself just sitting in our... my living room, staring at nothing. I've started having a drink or two in the evenings, just to quiet my mind enough to sleep. I know that's probably not healthy, but... I don't know what else to do. The anxiety is constant, and I'm having trouble seeing any kind of future for myself.",
    "Therapist: What do you think you need to move forward?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me feels like I need closure, but I don't know what that looks like. I guess I need to find a way to accept that this is my new reality. I need to learn how to be on my own again, how to find meaning in my life without Sarah. But it feels impossible right now. I've been with her for so long, I don't know who I am without her. I think I need... hope. Some kind of hope that things can get better, that I can be okay on my own. But right now, that feels so far out of reach.",
    "Therapist: How has revisiting this memory changed your perspective?",
    "Client: It's... it's strange. On one hand, it's painful to go through it again. But on the other, I think I'm starting to see things a bit more clearly. When it first happened, everything was a blur of emotion. Now, even though it still hurts, I can see that there were problems in our marriage long before Sarah asked for the divorce. I'm not saying it's all my fault, or all her fault, but... maybe it wasn't as sudden as it felt at the time. And maybe... maybe that means it's not a complete failure on my part. It doesn't make it hurt less, but it does make me feel like I'm not crazy for not seeing it coming.",
    "Therapist: What strength do you recognize in yourself from this experience?",
    "Client: Strength? I... I haven't really thought about it in those terms. But I guess... I'm still here, aren't I? I'm still getting up every day, still going to work, still trying to figure things out. There are days when I want to just give up, but I don't. I'm here, talking about it, trying to work through it. Maybe that's a kind of strength. And I've started to reach out to old friends, people I lost touch with during my marriage. That's not easy for me, but I'm doing it. So maybe... maybe I'm stronger than I give myself credit for.",
    "Therapist: How might this strength help you moving forward?",
    "Client: I... I hadn't really considered that. But I suppose if I can get through this, if I can face this pain and keep going, then maybe I can face other challenges too. Maybe I can use this strength to rebuild my life, to figure out who I am now and what I want. It's terrifying to think about starting over at my age, but... if I've got the strength to face this, maybe I've got the strength to create a new life for myself. It won't be easy, and it's not what I wanted, but... maybe it's possible. Maybe I can find a way to be okay, even if it's different from what I had planned.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you could take this week?",
    "Client: One small step... I think... maybe I could try to do something for myself. Something that's just for me, not related to work or the divorce. I used to enjoy photography, but I gave it up years ago because I was so busy with work and family. Maybe I could dig out my old camera, take a walk in the park and just... take some pictures. It's a small thing, but it might help me remember that there are still beautiful things in the world, even if my life feels dark right now. And it might be a way to start figuring out who I am outside of being Sarah's husband.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that idea?",
    "Client: I feel... nervous, honestly. It's been so long since I've done anything just for myself. Part of me feels guilty, like I shouldn't be enjoying anything while I'm grieving my marriage. But there's also a tiny spark of... excitement? Is that the right word? It's faint, but it's there. The idea of reconnecting with something I used to love, of creating something... it feels like a lifeline. Like maybe, just maybe, there's a path forward. It's scary, but... I think I want to try it.",
    "Therapist: What have you learned about yourself today?",
    "Client: I've learned... I've learned that I'm still capable of feeling things deeply, even if right now those feelings are mostly painful. I've learned that I'm stronger than I thought - that I can face this pain and talk about it, even though it's incredibly difficult. I've learned that maybe, just maybe, there's a future for me beyond this divorce. It's not the future I had planned, but it might still be worth exploring. And I've learned that I still have the capacity to hope, even if it's just a tiny glimmer right now. That's... that's actually kind of amazing to realize.",
    "Therapist: How would you like to close our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to sit quietly for a moment, if that's okay. Just to let everything we've talked about settle. And then... then I think I'm going to go home and find that old camera. Even if I don't use it today, just holding it might help me remember that there are parts of myself that exist outside of this pain. That there might be a way forward. It's a small thing, but right now, it feels like a start. And a start is... well, it's more than I had when I walked in here today.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Take care, and I'll see you next week."

I used to enjoy photography, but I gave it up years ago because I was so busy with work and family. Maybe I could dig out my old camera, take a walk in the park and just... take some pictures.

But there's also a tiny spark of... excitement? Is that the right word? It's faint, but it's there. The idea of reconnecting with something I used to love, of creating something... it feels like a lifeline. Like maybe, just maybe, there's a path forward. It's scary, but... I think I want to try it."
