    "Therapist: Hello, Mr. Johnson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Good afternoon, Dr. Smith. I'm... well, I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. I know we've been working towards this imaginal exposure session, but now that it's here, I'm feeling quite apprehensive.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: It's just... I've spent so many years trying to avoid thinking about my childhood illness. The idea of deliberately revisiting those memories is terrifying. I'm worried about how I'll react, and if I'll be able to handle it. Plus, as a professional, I'm used to being in control. This feels like I'm giving up that control.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. How can I support you today?",
    "Client: I appreciate that, doctor. I suppose I need reassurance that this is truly necessary and that you'll be here to guide me through it. Could you explain again why we're doing this and what exactly will happen?",
    "Therapist: Certainly. This exercise helps process traumatic memories. Shall I elaborate?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think I need to hear it again to feel more comfortable. And maybe... could you tell me how this fits into the bigger picture of my treatment? I know we've discussed my anxiety and how it relates to my childhood experiences, but I'm still struggling to see how reliving those moments will help me move forward.",
    "Therapist: The exposure helps reduce anxiety over time. It's a step towards healing.",
    "Client: I see. So, by facing these memories head-on, we're trying to reduce their power over me? That makes sense, but it's still scary. What should I expect during the session? Will you be guiding me through it, or am I supposed to just... start talking about what happened?",
    "Therapist: I'll guide you. We'll go at your pace, and you can pause anytime.",
    "Client: Okay, that's somewhat reassuring. I appreciate your patience with my questions. I guess I'm also worried about how this might affect me afterward. Will I be able to function normally? I have important meetings this week, and I'm concerned this might throw me off balance.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel uneasy. We'll debrief and ensure you're stable before leaving.",
    "Client: Thank you, that helps. I suppose one last thing I'm wondering about is... well, is it normal to feel ashamed about being so affected by something that happened so long ago? I mean, I survived, I've had a successful career, a good marriage. Sometimes I feel like I should just be over it by now.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Trauma impacts us long-term. You're brave for addressing it.",
    "Client: Thank you, doctor. That means a lot to hear. I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Before we start, is there anything else I should know or do to prepare myself?",
    "Therapist: Just breathe and remember you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Alright. I'm nervous, but I trust you. Let's do this. I'm ready to face these memories and hopefully start moving past them. Thank you for your guidance and support."
