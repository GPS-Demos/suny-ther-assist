    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Johnson. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit apprehensive, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about the hurricane, and just thinking about it makes my heart race a little.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Yes, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see the sky. It's so dark, almost green. The wind is picking up, and I can hear the trees creaking outside. Our neighbor's wind chimes are clanging wildly.",
    "Therapist: Good. What are you doing?",
    "Client: I'm in the kitchen, trying to fill up containers with water. My hands are shaking, and I keep spilling. I can hear my husband in the living room, nailing boards over the windows. The sound of the hammer is so loud, like it's echoing through my whole body.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Scared. Really scared. My mouth is dry, and I feel like I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you?",
    "Client: About... about 70.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: The... the power goes out. Suddenly, it's so dark. I fumble for the flashlight, and I can hear my grandchildren crying in the other room. I want to go to them, but I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I feel so helpless. I should be comforting them, but I can't move. I'm terrified we're all going to die.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you survived this. You're here now, safe. Continue.",
    "Client: Right... okay. I hear a crash outside. Something hit the house. My husband is yelling for everyone to get to the bathroom. I... I grab the children, and we're all huddled in there. The noise is deafening. It sounds like a freight train is passing right over us.",
    "Therapist: How's your anxiety now?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. Maybe 85.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Feel your feet on the ground. You're here, in my office. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay. We're in the bathroom. The kids are crying. I'm holding them tight, trying to sing a lullaby, but my voice keeps cracking. The walls are shaking. I can hear things breaking all around us. Glass shattering, wood splintering. I'm praying, begging God to keep us safe.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What do you feel in your body?",
    "Client: My... my heart is pounding. My muscles are so tense it hurts. I feel nauseous.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: It feels like hours pass. The noise never stops. Suddenly, there's a loud crack, and water starts pouring in under the door. My granddaughter screams. I... I think I screamed too. The water is rising so fast. It's up to our ankles, then our knees. I'm lifting the kids onto the counter, but I'm terrified the roof will cave in.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. Take a breath. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I... I feel like I can't breathe. Like I'm back there.",
    "Therapist: Focus on my voice. You're here, in this room. The storm is in the past. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's 90. Maybe higher.",
    "Therapist: Let's take a moment. Breathe with me. In... and out. Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: *breathing steadies* Okay. The water stops rising, but we're trapped. It's pitch black. I can feel my grandchildren shivering against me. My husband is trying to open the door, but it's swollen shut. I... I start to panic. What if we can't get out? What if no one finds us?",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What do you hear? Smell?",
    "Client: I hear the wind howling. It smells musty, like mold and dampness. I can taste the fear in my mouth, metallic and bitter.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going.",
    "Client: We wait. And wait. The storm seems to last forever. Finally, the noise starts to die down. My husband manages to force the door open. When we step out... oh God. Our home is... it's destroyed. Everything we owned, just... gone.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Devastated. Lost. Like... like our whole life was just washed away.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. What do you do next?",
    "Client: We... we make our way outside. The neighborhood is unrecognizable. Trees are down everywhere. Cars overturned. Our neighbor's house is... it's just gone. I see people emerging from their homes, all looking shell-shocked.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I feel... guilty. Guilty that we survived when others didn't. Overwhelmed by the destruction. And... and angry. Why did this happen to us?",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. How's your anxiety now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 80?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Let's continue. What happens in the days after?",
    "Client: It's... it's chaos. No power, no clean water. We're living off canned food. The heat is unbearable. I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I hear the storm. I jump at every loud noise. I can't stop checking on my grandchildren, making sure they're okay.",
    "Therapist: How does this experience change you?",
    "Client: I... I become so anxious. Always watching the weather, panicking at every storm. I feel... I feel like I can't protect my family. Like I failed them.",
    "Therapist: But you did protect them. You all survived.",
    "Client: I... I know. But it doesn't feel like enough.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after trauma. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. Sad. But... also a little relieved? Like... like talking about it has lifted some weight.",
    "Therapist: That's good. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 60 now.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. You've done very well today. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end.",
    "Client: *breathes deeply* Thank you. I... I didn't think I could do this.",
    "Therapist: But you did. And you should be proud of yourself. We'll continue working through this in our next session.",
    "Client: Okay. I... I think I'm ready for that now.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Remember to use the coping techniques we've discussed if you feel anxious this week.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you, doctor.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Mrs. Johnson. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
