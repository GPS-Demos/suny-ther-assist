    "Therapist: Welcome, Amir. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is terrified. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um... probably around a 6 or 7 out of 10. My hands are a bit shaky.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. When you're ready, close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Alright... I'm... I'm eight years old. We're visiting my uncle's farm in the countryside. It's a hot summer day, and I can smell the dry grass and... and animal scents in the air.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue in the present tense.",
    "Client: I'm walking towards the barn. The sun is beating down on my neck, and I can hear the chickens clucking nearby. I'm... I'm excited to see the new litter of puppies my uncle told me about.",
    "Therapist: What do you see as you approach the barn?",
    "Client: The barn door is slightly ajar. It's... it's dark inside, a stark contrast to the bright sunlight. I can hear some rustling and... and low growling. My heart starts to race a little.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I push the door open wider. The hinges creak, and I step inside. It takes a moment for my eyes to adjust. I see... I see the mother dog in the corner. She's... she's not looking friendly. Her teeth are bared, and she's growling louder now.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's going up. Maybe an 8? My palms are sweating, and I can feel my heart pounding.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I try to back away slowly, but I stumble over something. The mother dog... she... she lunges at me. I can see her teeth, hear her snarling. I... I scream and try to protect my face with my arms.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you experiencing in your body?",
    "Client: My... my arms sting where her teeth graze them. I can feel her hot breath, smell her... her doggy breath. I'm crying, screaming for help. My uncle... he... he comes running in.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My heart is racing. It feels so real... like I'm there again.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here in the office, safe.",
    "Client: *takes a shaky breath* Okay... okay. I... I can continue.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens after your uncle arrives?",
    "Client: He... he pulls the dog off me. I'm sobbing, my arms are bleeding. He's yelling something, but I can't make out the words over my own cries. Everything is a blur of pain and fear.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The... the smell of blood. The rough wood of the barn floor beneath me. My clothes are torn, and I can feel dirt and straw sticking to my skin. I'm... I'm shaking uncontrollably.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. Maybe a 9? I feel like I can barely breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Focus on your breathing. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: *breathes slowly* Okay... okay. I'm... I'm still there, but I can feel the chair beneath me too.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: My uncle... he scoops me up in his arms. I can smell his familiar scent - tobacco and aftershave. It... it helps a little. He's carrying me out of the barn, into the sunlight. I'm still crying, but it's quieter now.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as he carries you?",
    "Client: I... I feel small. Vulnerable. My arms are stinging, and I can feel my heart still racing. But... but there's also a sense of relief. Like... like I'm safe now.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: We... we go into the house. My aunt is there, looking worried. She... she helps clean my wounds. It stings, and I start crying again. But her touch is gentle, and she's speaking softly to me.",
    "Therapist: What is she saying?",
    "Client: She's... she's telling me I'm brave. That it's okay to cry. That... that it wasn't my fault. I remember feeling confused by that. How could it be my fault?",
    "Therapist: How does hearing that make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's comforting, but also... I don't know. Sad? Like... like I needed to hear that more often growing up.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe a 7? I still feel shaky, but not as overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Let's continue.",
    "Client: After... after they clean me up, they call my parents. I can hear my mom's voice on the phone, sounding panicked. I start crying again, wanting her there. My uncle... he picks me up and lets me talk to her.",
    "Therapist: What do you say to your mom?",
    "Client: I... I tell her I'm scared. That I want to come home. She... she tells me they're on their way, that everything will be okay. I... I don't really believe her, but her voice helps.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you talk to her?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm still shaking a bit. My throat hurts from crying. But... but hearing her voice, it's like some of the tension leaves my body. I... I feel exhausted.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens after the call?",
    "Client: My aunt... she makes me some hot chocolate. I remember the warmth of the mug in my hands, how it smelled sweet and comforting. I... I don't want to drink it at first, but she encourages me gently.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's nice. Soothing. But I also feel... I don't know, almost guilty? Like I shouldn't be feeling better when something so scary just happened.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down more. Maybe a 5 or 6? I feel drained, but not as panicked.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's continue.",
    "Client: I... I sit on the couch, wrapped in a soft blanket. My uncle and aunt are talking in hushed voices in the kitchen. I... I catch words like \"should have been more careful\" and \"poor boy.\" It makes me feel... I don't know, small? Vulnerable?",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The... the ticking of the clock on the wall. The faint smell of antiseptic from my bandages. My body feels heavy, like I could sleep for days. But... but I'm also on edge, jumping at every little sound.",
    "Therapist: How long does it feel like you're waiting?",
    "Client: It... it feels like forever. But realistically, maybe an hour or two? I remember the sun starting to set, casting long shadows through the windows.",
    "Therapist: What happens when your parents arrive?",
    "Client: I... I hear the car pull up. My heart starts racing again, but... but in a different way. I'm off the couch before they even reach the door. When... when my mom walks in, I just burst into tears again.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you feel?",
    "Client: Relief. Overwhelming relief. But also... also this rush of all the fear and pain I've been holding back. I... I cling to her, sobbing. She... she holds me tight, stroking my hair.",
    "Therapist: What does she say to you?",
    "Client: She... she tells me it's okay now. That she's here. That... that I'm safe. My dad... he's talking to my uncle, his voice angry. But I focus on my mom's heartbeat, her familiar smell.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in that moment?",
    "Client: It's... it's like I can finally relax. My muscles start to unclench. I'm still shaking a bit, but it's... it's different. Like release rather than fear.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's lower. Maybe a 4? I feel drained, but... but safer.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Let's start to bring you back to the present.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I... I can feel the office chair again. Hear the ticking of your clock.",
    "Therapist: Good. Take a few deep breaths. When you're ready, open your eyes.",
    "Client: *opens eyes, blinks* That... that was intense. I didn't expect to remember so much detail.",
    "Therapist: You did excellently. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired. Really tired. But... but also kind of... I don't know, lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. Let's take a few moments to ground yourself before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay. Yeah, that... that sounds good. I... I appreciate your guidance through this. It was tough, but... but I think it was important.",
    "Therapist: You showed great courage today. We'll discuss this further in our next session."
