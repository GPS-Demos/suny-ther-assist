    "Therapist: Welcome, Rahul. Today we'll focus on an imaginal exposure exercise related to your divorce. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so, yes. I'm a bit nervous, but I understand it's part of the process.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember, you're in control. Let's start with your baseline SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10. I'm feeling a bit tense, but manageable.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and describe the memory of telling your parents about the divorce.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) I'm sitting in my childhood home. The air feels heavy. My parents are across from me, looking concerned. I can smell my mother's chai brewing in the kitchen. My hands are shaking as I start to speak...",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: I tell them about the divorce. My father's face falls, and my mother starts to cry silently. I feel a knot forming in my stomach. The disappointment in their eyes is unbearable. I can hear my voice cracking as I try to explain...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 6. My chest feels tight, and I'm starting to sweat.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going with the memory.",
    "Client: My father stands up and walks to the window. He's silent, but I can see the tension in his shoulders. My mother asks, \"What will people say?\" Her words cut through me like a knife. I feel so small, so ashamed...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I feel like I can't breathe properly. The shame is overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's an 8 now. I feel like I'm right back there, disappointing everyone.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Keep breathing. What happens next?",
    "Client: I try to explain that it's for the best, that we tried everything. But my words sound hollow. My father turns and says, \"We didn't raise you for this.\" His disappointment is palpable. I feel like a failure...",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Still an 8. My hands are shaking, and I feel nauseous.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: I... I start to cry. I can't hold it back anymore. My mother comes to hug me, but it feels mechanical. I can sense her own pain and disappointment. The room feels suffocating...",
    "Therapist: And now? How do you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to ease a bit. Maybe a 7? I still feel awful, but the intensity is lessening.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Continue with the memory.",
    "Client: We sit in silence for a while. The ticking of the clock seems deafening. Eventually, my father speaks again. He says, \"We'll get through this.\" But his voice is cold. I feel a mix of relief and deep sadness...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6. I feel drained, but the worst of the panic has passed.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. How does the memory end?",
    "Client: I leave the house, promising to call soon. As I walk to my car, I feel a strange mix of freedom and loss. The weight of their expectations feels lighter, but the pain of disappointing them lingers...",
    "Therapist: And your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's back to about a 4. I feel exhausted, but also... I don't know, maybe a bit relieved to have revisited this?",
    "Therapist: That's common. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Drained, but oddly calm. It wasn't as overwhelming as I feared.",
    "Therapist: You did excellently. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves before we end."
