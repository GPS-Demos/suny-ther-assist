    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. Going through that memory of the bullying again, it brought up so many emotions. I felt like I was right back there in high school, you know? My heart was racing, and I could feel my hands getting clammy. It's strange how vivid it all still is, even after all these years.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: I think... the helplessness. I remembered how isolated I felt, like no one was on my side. The worst part was when they cornered me in the locker room and started taunting me about my appearance. I can still hear their laughter echoing off the walls. It's like... like I'm trapped in that moment, and I can't escape.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was really hard, to be honest. I felt a mix of anger and shame. Anger at them for treating me that way, and shame because... well, part of me still believes what they said about me. But there was also this tiny bit of relief, like maybe by talking about it, I'm finally letting some of it go? I don't know if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: It does. How do you think this connects to your current experiences?",
    "Client: I guess... I'm still carrying a lot of that fear and insecurity with me. It's probably why I have such a hard time trusting people or speaking up for myself, especially in my relationship. I'm always worried about being judged or rejected. And when my boyfriend raises his voice, even if it's not directed at me, I just freeze up. It's like I'm back in that locker room all over again.",
    "Therapist: I see. What did you learn from today's session?",
    "Client: I think I realized that I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. Going through that memory was tough, but I did it. And talking about it now, I can see how it's affected me, but also that I've come a long way. I'm not that helpless girl anymore. I'm here, working on myself, trying to heal. That's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How will you use this insight moving forward?",
    "Client: I want to work on building my self-confidence. Maybe... maybe I can start by challenging some of those negative thoughts when they come up. And I think I need to be more open with my boyfriend about my past and how it affects me. It's scary, but I think it could help our relationship.",
    "Therapist: That's very insightful. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but also a bit lighter? Like I've put down a heavy backpack I've been carrying for years. It's still there, but maybe it's a little easier to manage now. I'm nervous about what's to come, but I'm also kind of... hopeful? Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to delve deeper into how this affects my current relationship. Especially with the domestic violence topic we touched on. I'm starting to see some patterns that worry me, and I want to address them before they become bigger issues.",
    "Therapist: Alright. We'll explore that next session. How will you take care of yourself this week?",
    "Client: I'm going to try that journaling exercise you suggested. And maybe... maybe I'll finally take up that yoga class my friend's been inviting me to. I think some physical activity might help me feel more grounded.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Remember, you're making progress. See you next week, Sarah.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Thompson. I... I really appreciate your help. See you next week."
