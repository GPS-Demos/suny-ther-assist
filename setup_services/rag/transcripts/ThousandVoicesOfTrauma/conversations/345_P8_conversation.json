    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mr. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's like I'm back there again, you know? My heart's still racing a bit. I can feel this tightness in my chest, like someone's sitting on it. The memory of Sarah telling me she wanted a divorce... it's so vivid. I can see her face, hear the tremor in her voice. It's almost like I can smell her perfume again.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... maybe if I'd been a better husband, if I'd paid more attention... God, I was so caught up in my work. I remember feeling so blindsided, like the rug had been pulled out from under me. And then there's this voice in my head saying, \"You should've seen it coming, you idiot.\" It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you recall these thoughts?",
    "Client: My shoulders are so tense, like I'm bracing for impact. There's this knot in my stomach, and my throat feels tight. I... I think I might cry, but I'm trying not to. Men my age shouldn't cry, right? But it hurts so much, even after all these years.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about that urge to cry?",
    "Client: It's... it's strong. Like a pressure building up behind my eyes. I feel weak, vulnerable. Part of me wants to just let it out, but another part is scared. If I start crying, will I be able to stop? It reminds me of when I was a kid, and the bullies would taunt me for being a crybaby. I can almost hear their jeering voices.",
    "Therapist: How does this experience connect to your broader journey?",
    "Client: I... I guess it shows how much I'm still carrying around. The divorce, the bullying... it's all tangled up together. I've spent so long trying to be strong, to not show weakness. But maybe that's part of the problem. I never really dealt with any of it. It's like I've been running from these feelings for decades.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you make that connection?",
    "Client: A sense of... I don't know, maybe relief? Like maybe it's okay to feel this way. But also fear. I'm scared of facing all this stuff I've buried. And there's anger too. I'm angry at Sarah for leaving, angry at those bullies, angry at myself for not being stronger. It's... it's a lot.",
    "Therapist: How do these emotions feel in your body right now?",
    "Client: The anger is like a fire in my chest. The fear is making my hands shake a little. But the relief... it's almost like a warmth spreading through me. It's strange, feeling all these things at once. I'm not used to it. Usually, I just feel... numb, I guess. Or just sad. This is different.",
    "Therapist: What does this difference mean to you?",
    "Client: I... I think it means I'm finally starting to process things. It's scary, but also... hopeful? Like maybe I can actually work through this stuff instead of just pushing it down. I've been so lonely since Sarah left, and even before that, really. Maybe facing this will help me connect with people again. I don't know. It's all so confusing.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to consider that possibility?",
    "Client: It's... exciting, I guess. But also terrifying. I've been stuck in this rut for so long, I'm not sure I know how to climb out. What if I try and fail? What if I open up and get hurt again? But... but I'm tired of feeling this way. Maybe it's worth the risk. I just... I don't know if I'm strong enough.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your strength in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I guess I am being pretty brave right now, aren't I? Talking about all this stuff, feeling these emotions. It's not easy. Maybe I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. I've survived a lot - the bullying, the divorce, the loneliness. I'm still here. Still trying. That's... that's something, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: How does recognizing that bravery feel?",
    "Client: It feels... good. Surprising, but good. Like a little spark of hope. Maybe I can do this. Maybe I can heal. It's not going to be easy, I know that. But for the first time in a long time, I feel like maybe there's a way forward. Like maybe I'm not too old or too broken to change. It's scary, but... but also kind of exciting.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to take away from this session?",
    "Client: I think... I want to remember this feeling. This mix of hope and strength. And maybe try to be a little kinder to myself. I've been so hard on myself for so long. Maybe it's time to start treating myself with the same compassion I'd show a friend. And... and maybe it's okay to let myself feel things, even if it's uncomfortable. I don't have to have it all figured out right away. I can take it one step at a time.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How do you feel as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but in a good way. Like I've done something important. My chest feels a little lighter, even though my eyes are still a bit watery. I'm nervous about what comes next, but also... I don't know, maybe a little excited? It's been a long time since I've felt anything other than sadness or numbness. This feels like... like maybe it's the start of something new.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing so openly. We'll continue next session."
