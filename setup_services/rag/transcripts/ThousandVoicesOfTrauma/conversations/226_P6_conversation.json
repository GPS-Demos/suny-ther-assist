    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I understand why we're doing this.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your current SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10. My heart's beating a little faster than usual.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that moment.",
    "Client: (Taking a deep breath) Alright... I'm sitting at my computer, scrolling through social media. It's late, maybe around 11 PM. I see a notification pop up - it's a message from someone I don't know. I open it, and... oh god, it's horrible. They've photoshopped my face onto explicit images. There are threats, saying they'll send these to everyone I know if I don't comply with their demands. My stomach drops, I feel sick...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's probably a 7. My palms are sweating, and I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm panicking, trying to figure out what to do. Should I respond? Ignore it? Tell someone? I feel so ashamed and scared. What if my family sees these? What if my clients find out? My whole business could be ruined. I'm shaking now, I can barely type...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's an 8. Maybe even a 9. I feel like I'm right back there, helpless and terrified.",
    "Therapist: That's tough. You're very brave. Continue.",
    "Client: I decide to block the account, but then I get more messages from different accounts. It's like they're everywhere. I can't escape. I feel so violated, so exposed. I want to disappear. I'm crying now, I can barely see the screen through my tears...",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: Still at a 9. My chest feels tight, I'm struggling to breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Inhales deeply) Okay... I finally decide to turn off my computer. But I can't sleep. I keep imagining everyone I know seeing those images. I feel dirty, ashamed, even though I know I didn't do anything wrong. The night seems endless...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7 now. Talking about it... it helps, somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Keep going.",
    "Client: The next day, I'm exhausted. I can barely focus on work. Every notification makes me jump. I feel like everyone's staring at me, judging me, even though I know they can't possibly know. I finally break down and tell my partner. They're supportive, but I still feel so alone in this...",
