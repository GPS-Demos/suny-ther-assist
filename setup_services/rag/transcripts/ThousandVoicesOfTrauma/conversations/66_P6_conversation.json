    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Patel. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's begin. Close your eyes and recall the memory of your divorce.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm sitting in our living room. My wife, Priya, is across from me. She's just told me she wants a divorce. I... I can feel my heart racing. My palms are sweaty. I'm in shock.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: It's about a 6. I can feel the tension in my shoulders.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: Priya is talking, but I can barely hear her. My mind keeps flashing back to when we first met, our wedding day... I feel like I'm drowning. My chest is so tight.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I remember thinking, \"This can't be happening.\" I wanted to beg her to stay, but no words came out. I felt so small, so helpless. Just like when I was a child and my father would...",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to an 8. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a slow, deep breath. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: (Breathing audibly) I remember Priya crying. I wanted to comfort her, but I couldn't move. I felt frozen, just like when... when my father would get angry. I felt like a failure, both as a husband and as a man.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My heart is pounding. I feel hot, and my hands are shaking. But... but I also feel a deep sadness. It's like a weight on my chest.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's still at an 8. Maybe even a 9 now.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I remember Priya getting up to leave. I wanted to stop her, but I couldn't. As she walked out, I felt this overwhelming sense of abandonment. It was like losing my mother all over again. I... I broke down and cried.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you notice in your body?",
    "Client: My throat feels tight. I'm fighting back tears even now. I feel so... so alone.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7 now.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this well. Continue.",
    "Client: After Priya left, I just sat there for hours. I couldn't move. I kept replaying everything in my mind, wondering what I could have done differently. I felt... I felt worthless, just like my father always told me I was.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm calmer. The pain is still there, but it's not as sharp. My breathing is steadier.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5, I think.",
    "Therapist: You've done very well. Let's start to bring your attention back to the present.",
    "Client: (Opens eyes slowly) That was... intense. But I feel... I don't know, maybe a little lighter?",
    "Therapist: That's normal. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Drained, but also... relieved, in a way. Like I've let go of something I've been holding onto for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. We'll end here for today. Well done, Mr. Patel."
