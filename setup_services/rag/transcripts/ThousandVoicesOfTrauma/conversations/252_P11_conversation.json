    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving that moment in the hospital after my car accident, it just brought back so many emotions. I felt scared and alone all over again.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out most?",
    "Client: The beeping of the machines. It was constant, you know? And every time I heard it, I thought something was wrong. I kept thinking about how my boyfriend at the time wasn't there. He was supposed to be my support, but he couldn't handle seeing me like that. It made me feel so... abandoned.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really difficult.",
    "Client: Yeah, it was. I mean, I understand now that he was probably scared too, but at the time, I just felt so betrayed. And then when he broke up with me a few weeks after I got out of the hospital... it was like adding insult to injury, you know?",
    "Therapist: How did revisiting that memory feel today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. I noticed my heart racing, just like it did back then. But... I also realized something. Even though I felt alone, there were nurses and doctors taking care of me. I hadn't really thought about that before.",
    "Therapist: That's an interesting observation.",
    "Client: Yeah, it's like... I was so focused on who wasn't there that I didn't see who was. Does that make sense? I mean, don't get me wrong, it still hurts. But maybe I wasn't as alone as I thought.",
    "Therapist: How does this relate to your current experiences?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe I'm still doing that? Like, focusing on the negative and missing the good things around me. It's probably why I've been feeling so down lately. I've been isolating myself, thinking no one cares, but maybe that's not entirely true.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight, Sarah.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's... it's hard, you know? Sometimes I still wake up in a panic, thinking I'm back in that hospital bed. And then I remember I'm alone in my apartment, and that doesn't always feel better.",
    "Therapist: How might you apply today's realization?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe I could try to be more aware of the people who are actually in my life now? Like my classmates or my neighbors. I've been pushing everyone away because I'm afraid of being hurt again, but... maybe that's not the best approach.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good step forward.",
    "Client: Yeah, it's scary though. Opening up again, I mean. But I guess that's part of the process, right? Facing the fear?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's tough, but... I think it's helping. I mean, I never would have made that connection about the nurses and doctors if we hadn't done this exposure. It's like... it's giving me a new perspective on things. I want to keep going, even if it's hard.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. What else came up for you?",
    "Client: I... I realized how much anger I've been holding onto. Not just towards my ex, but towards myself too. Like, why didn't I see the signs that he wasn't committed? Why did I let myself be so vulnerable? But then I think... how could I have known? It wasn't my fault that I got into an accident.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant realization.",
    "Client: Yeah... it's like, I've been blaming myself for things that were out of my control. And that's probably not helping my depression either, right? Always thinking everything's my fault.",
    "Therapist: How might you challenge those thoughts?",
    "Client: I... I guess I could try to be kinder to myself? Maybe when I start having those thoughts, I could try to look at the situation more objectively. Like, would I blame a friend if they were in my position? Probably not.",
    "Therapist: That's a great strategy. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... tired, but also kind of hopeful? Like, maybe there's a way through this that I couldn't see before. It's still scary, and I know I have a long way to go, but... I feel like I understand myself a little better now.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress, Sarah.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I really appreciate your help with this. It's not easy, but I'm glad I'm doing it. I just hope I can keep this perspective when I'm not here in your office.",
    "Therapist: What might help you remember?",
    "Client: Hmm... maybe I could write down some of these insights? Like, keep a journal or something? That way, when I'm feeling low, I can look back and remind myself of what we've talked about.",
    "Therapist: That's a wonderful idea.",
    "Client: Yeah, I think I'll try that. And maybe... maybe I could try reaching out to one person this week? Just a small step, you know? Nothing too overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a good plan. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling pretty drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense? Like I've done some important work today.",
    "Therapist: You have. Take care, Sarah.",
    "Client: Thank you. I will. See you next week."
