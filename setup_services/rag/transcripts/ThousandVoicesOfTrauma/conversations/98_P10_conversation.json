    "Therapist: Welcome back, John. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling a bit on edge, to be honest. But I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. How would you rate your distress from 0 to 100?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 60 right now. My stomach's in knots.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Begin when you're ready.",
    "Client: Alright... (deep breath) I'm at home. It's late afternoon, and I can hear Sarah in the kitchen. The kids are at their grandparents'. I'm... I'm sitting on the couch, scrolling through my phone, trying to distract myself. But I can feel the tension building. Sarah's been quiet all day, and I know she's upset about something.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay in the moment. What do you notice around you?",
    "Client: The TV's on, but muted. There's a half-empty coffee mug on the table. I can smell dinner cooking, but it's not comforting. It's... it's like a ticking clock. I know any minute now, she's going to confront me about something.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear her footsteps. They're... they're getting louder as she comes into the living room. My heart's racing now. I look up, and her face is... God, she looks so angry. Her eyes are blazing, and she's clenching her fists.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. But also angry. Why is she always like this? I want to run, but I'm frozen in place. My mouth goes dry, and I can feel sweat on my palms.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's up to 75. This is... this is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a deep breath. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... (inhales shakily) Sarah starts yelling. She's accusing me of cheating, saying she saw messages on my phone. But it's not true! I try to explain, but my voice comes out weak and shaky. She's not listening. She grabs my phone and throws it against the wall. The sound of it shattering makes me flinch.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What's happening in your body?",
    "Client: My heart's pounding so hard I can hear it. My muscles are tense, ready to... to defend myself or run. I stand up, trying to create some distance between us. But Sarah, she... she gets right in my face. I can smell the coffee on her breath. She's screaming now, calling me names, telling me I'm worthless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I try to walk away, to go to the bedroom. But Sarah grabs my arm, her nails digging into my skin. It hurts, and I can feel myself getting angry. I shout at her to let go, but she doesn't. She slaps me across the face, hard. The sting... it's like fire on my cheek.",
    "Therapist: What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I push her away. Not hard, just enough to get her off me. But she stumbles and hits the coffee table. For a second, everything goes quiet. Then she starts crying, saying I hurt her. I feel... I feel so confused and scared. Did I really hurt her? Am I the abuser here?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's 90. This is really intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're safe here. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: (deep, shaky breath) Okay... Sarah's still on the floor, sobbing. I want to help her up, but I'm afraid to touch her. I start apologizing, over and over. I feel sick to my stomach. The room seems to be spinning. I can hear neighbors shouting outside - they must have heard us.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: There's... there's a knock at the door. It's loud, authoritative. My blood runs cold. I know it's the police. Sarah looks up at me, and for a moment, I see fear in her eyes too. But then her face hardens. She stands up and walks to the door. I'm paralyzed, can't move. I hear her talking to the officers, her voice trembling. She's... she's telling them I hit her. But that's not what happened!",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: I feel... betrayed. Angry. Terrified. The officers come in, and they're looking at me like I'm some kind of monster. I try to explain, but my words come out jumbled. They're not listening. One of them starts putting handcuffs on me. The metal is cold, and it bites into my wrists. I can't believe this is happening.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's 100. I can't... this is too much.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here in the office with me. You're safe.",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) Okay... okay. I'm... I'm being led out of the house. The neighbors are watching. I can see the judgment in their eyes. Sarah's crying in the doorway, playing the victim. As they put me in the police car, all I can think is... how did we get here? How did our love turn into this? I feel... I feel so alone. So helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Let's take a moment. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaken. My heart's still racing. But... but I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You're safe here. Let's do some grounding. Can you name five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: Um... I see the clock on the wall. Your desk. The painting of the ocean. The bookshelf. And... and the plant in the corner.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, take a few deep breaths. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: (breathes deeply) That... that helps. I feel a bit calmer now.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad. You did really well with that exposure. How would you rate your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 70. Still high, but... but better.",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. Can you tell me what was the most challenging part of that memory?",
    "Client: I think... I think it was the moment when Sarah accused me of hitting her. The feeling of being wrongly accused, of not being believed... it's devastating. And the shame of being arrested, of the neighbors seeing... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Those are very difficult feelings to process. How do you feel you handled reliving that memory?",
    "Client: It was tough, but... but I got through it. I didn't think I could, but I did. It's still painful, but maybe... maybe a little less so than before?",
    "Therapist: That's often how it works. Each time we revisit these memories, they can become a bit easier to handle. You showed a lot of strength today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I never really talked about this before. It feels... it feels kind of liberating, in a way. Scary, but liberating.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. Many people find that giving voice to these memories can reduce their power. Is there anything else you'd like to share about what you experienced today?",
    "Client: I guess... I realized how much I've been blaming myself. For not leaving sooner, for letting it get to that point. But reliving it... I can see now that I was trying my best in an impossible situation.",
    "Therapist: That's a very important insight. How does that realization make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of sadness and relief. Sad that I went through all that, but relieved to start letting go of some of the guilt.",
    "Therapist: Those are very valid feelings. We'll continue to work through them in our sessions. For now, let's focus on bringing you back to the present. Can you tell me three things you're looking forward to this week?",
    "Client: Um... I'm having dinner with my brother tomorrow. I'm starting a new project at work. And... and I'm going to try that new hiking trail on the weekend.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like positive things to focus on. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Better. Tired, but... but okay. Like I've done something important.",
    "Therapist: You have. You've taken a significant step in your healing journey. I'm proud of the work you did today. Let's end our session here. Remember to use the coping strategies we've discussed if you feel overwhelmed later. And don't hesitate to call if you need support.",
    "Client: Thank you. I will. This... this helps. It's hard, but it helps.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. Take care, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: See you next week. Thanks again."
