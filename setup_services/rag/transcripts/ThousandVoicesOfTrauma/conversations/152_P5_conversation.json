    "Therapist: Good morning, Mr. Johnson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Morning, Doc. I'm... well, I'm not sure. A bit nervous, I guess. This whole cyber bullying thing with my grandson has me on edge. It's bringing up a lot of memories of when I lost my wife. I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you ready to discuss it?",
    "Client: Imaginal exposure? That sounds... intimidating. What exactly does that mean?",
    "Therapist: It's a technique to process traumatic memories. We'll revisit the event in a safe space.",
    "Client: Revisit? You mean... I have to relive losing Sarah? I don't know if I can handle that. It's been years, but it still hurts so much.",
    "Therapist: Your hesitation is normal. It may be challenging, but it's crucial for healing.",
    "Client: I see. But why now? I mean, I came here to talk about my grandson's situation. How does this relate?",
    "Therapist: Current stresses can trigger past traumas. Addressing both can help overall healing.",
    "Client: I guess that makes sense. But what if I break down? I'm not as young as I used to be, you know.",
    "Therapist: I'll be here to support you. We'll go at your pace. How does that sound?",
    "Client: Well, I trust you, Doc. You've been helpful so far. I'm still scared, but I'll give it a try. What should I expect?",
    "Therapist: You might feel strong emotions. That's normal and okay. We'll work through them together.",
    "Client: Okay. I appreciate your guidance. It's just... Sarah was everything to me. Losing her was like losing a part of myself. And now, seeing my grandson struggle, it's like I'm failing her all over again.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. This process will help you cope better with both losses.",
    "Client: I hope so. I want to be strong for my family. They need me, especially now. So, how do we start this imaginal exposure?",
    "Therapist: We'll start slowly. You'll describe the memory, and I'll guide you through it.",
    "Client: Alright. I'm ready. Well, as ready as I'll ever be. Thank you for being patient with me, Doc. It means a lot.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do this. For Sarah, for my grandson, and for myself. I know it won't be easy, but I'm willing to try."
