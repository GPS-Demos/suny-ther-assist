    "Therapist: Welcome, Margaret. Today we'll continue with our imaginal exposure exercise. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. But I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control. Let's start with your SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 right now. Just thinking about it makes me a bit anxious.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and describe the memory.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) I'm boarding the plane. It's a small aircraft, maybe 50 seats. The smell of jet fuel is strong. I'm in seat 14A, by the window. We're taking off, and... oh god, the turbulence starts. It's getting worse.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What's happening?",
    "Client: The plane is shaking violently. People are screaming. I can hear the engines struggling. My heart is racing. I'm gripping the armrests so tightly my knuckles are white.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 7. Maybe 8. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The oxygen masks drop. I'm fumbling with mine, my hands are shaking so badly. The plane is nosediving. I can see the ground coming up so fast through the window. I'm certain we're going to die.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Terrified. My chest is tight, I'm sweating. It feels so real.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS?",
    "Client: A 9. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) We hit the ground. The impact is deafening. Metal tearing, glass shattering. I'm thrown forward, my seatbelt cutting into me. Then... silence. Just the sound of my own heartbeat in my ears.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I realize I'm alive. Somehow. There's smoke, and people are moaning. I unbuckle my seatbelt with shaking hands and look around. It's chaos, but... we survived.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... dropping. Maybe a 6? I feel drained, but... relieved?",
    "Therapist: That's progress. How are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: My muscles are tense, but I'm starting to relax a bit. My breathing is slowing down.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's take a moment. How are you doing?",
    "Client: I'm... okay. It's still hard, but... I got through it. I didn't think I could.",
    "Therapist: You did very well. Your SUDS now?",
    "Client: Down to a 4, I think. I'm feeling a bit proud, actually.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. We'll end here for today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's tough, but I think it's helping. I feel... lighter, somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's often the case. We'll continue next session."
