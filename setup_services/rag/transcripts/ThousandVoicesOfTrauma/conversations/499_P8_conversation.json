    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. My heart is still racing a bit, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's like I'm right back there, you know? I can still hear the growling, the barking. It's so vivid.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. I mean, I'm usually pretty confident, but in that moment... I just froze. I couldn't move, couldn't think. It's like my brain just shut down. And now, I feel... I don't know, ashamed? Like I should have done something differently.",
    "Therapist: I see. Can you tell me more about that feeling of shame?",
    "Client: It's... it's like I failed myself, you know? I've always prided myself on being strong, independent. But when that dog attacked, I just... I couldn't do anything. I feel weak, and I hate feeling weak. It makes me question everything about myself. Like, if I couldn't handle this, what else can't I handle?",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you're talking about this?",
    "Client: My shoulders are really tense. I can feel this knot in my stomach, and my hands are a bit shaky. It's like my body is still on high alert, even though I know I'm safe here. And there's this... heaviness in my chest. It's hard to take a deep breath.",
    "Therapist: What's the hardest part of this memory for you?",
    "Client: The hardest part... I think it's the loss of control. One minute I was just walking down the street, minding my own business, and the next... chaos. I couldn't predict it, couldn't prevent it. And now, I feel like I can't trust my surroundings anymore. Every time I see a dog, even a small one, I tense up. It's like I'm constantly waiting for something bad to happen.",
    "Therapist: How has this experience changed you?",
    "Client: It's... it's changed everything, really. I used to love going for walks, especially in the park. Now, I avoid them. I'm always looking over my shoulder, always on edge. I feel like I've lost a part of myself, you know? That carefree, relaxed part. And it's affecting my work too. I'm self-employed, and I used to meet clients in cafes or public spaces. Now, I insist on video calls. I'm worried it's going to start impacting my business.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice as you share these changes?",
    "Client: I... I feel angry. Really angry. This wasn't my fault, you know? I didn't do anything to provoke that dog. And yet, I'm the one dealing with the consequences. It's not fair. But then I feel guilty for being angry because I know the dog probably had its own issues. And then I feel frustrated with myself for making excuses for it. It's like this cycle of emotions that I can't break out of.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to right after the attack?",
    "Client: Right after... I was in shock, I think. It didn't really hit me until later. But now, it's like... it's always there, under the surface. Some days are better than others, but it never really goes away. And that scares me. What if I never get past this? What if I'm always going to be this jumpy, anxious person?",
    "Therapist: What helps you feel safer or more in control?",
    "Client: I... I've started taking self-defense classes. It helps a little, makes me feel like I'm doing something proactive. And I've been trying to meditate, though it's hard to quiet my mind sometimes. Talking to my roommate helps too. She's been really supportive, doesn't judge me when I'm having a bad day. But sometimes I worry I'm burdening her, you know?",
    "Therapist: How do you see your future now?",
    "Client: That's... that's a tough one. Some days, I can see myself getting past this, being my old self again. Other days, it feels impossible. I want to believe I can overcome this, that I won't always be defined by this attack. But it's hard. I worry about how it might affect future relationships, my career. Will I ever feel completely safe again? I don't know. But I'm here, trying to work through it. That has to count for something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What's giving you hope right now?",
    "Client: I guess... the fact that I'm here, talking about it. That's something, isn't it? A few weeks ago, I couldn't even think about the attack without having a panic attack. And now, well, it's still hard, but I'm doing it. And these sessions, they're helping. It's slow, but I can feel a difference. Maybe that's what hope feels like - this tiny, fragile thing that says maybe, just maybe, things can get better.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How does recognizing that progress feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of emotions, really. There's relief, definitely. Like, maybe I'm not broken beyond repair. There's a bit of pride too, I guess. I'm facing this head-on, and that takes courage, right? But there's also fear. What if I can't keep making progress? What if I backslide? And underneath it all, there's this... I don't know, determination maybe? Like, now that I've seen I can make progress, I want to keep pushing forward.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to work on strategies for when I'm out in public. Maybe ways to manage my anxiety when I see dogs, or techniques to ground myself if I start feeling panicky. And... is it okay if we talk more about the shame? I feel like that's a big part of what's holding me back, and I'd really like to understand it better, maybe find ways to work through it.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll address those next time. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired, honestly. Emotionally drained. But there's also this sense of... I don't know, maybe relief? Like I've let out some of the pressure that's been building up inside me. It's hard, facing all of this, but I also feel like I've accomplished something today. Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a common experience after sessions like this.",
    "Client: That's... that's good to hear. I guess I'm just looking forward to going home and resting now. Maybe do some of those grounding exercises we talked about before. Thank you for today. It wasn't easy, but I think it was important.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Take care of yourself, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. I will. See you next week."
