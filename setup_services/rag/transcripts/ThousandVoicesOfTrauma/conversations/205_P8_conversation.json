    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also feels foggy at the same time. The memories were so vivid, you know? I could almost smell the dust and hear the gunfire again. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What physical sensations are you noticing right now?",
    "Client: My heart is pounding, and my hands are shaky. I feel tense all over, especially in my shoulders and neck. It's like my body is still on high alert, even though I know I'm safe here. I keep catching myself holding my breath.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking about the faces of the people we couldn't save. The women and children who were trapped in that building. We were supposed to help them, but everything went wrong so quickly. I feel like I failed them. And then I feel guilty for even being here, safe and alive, when they're not.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like a heavy weight on my chest. Sometimes it feels like I can't breathe properly. And there's this knot in my stomach that won't go away. It's always there, reminding me of what happened.",
    "Therapist: What else comes up for you?",
    "Client: I... I'm angry. Angry at the traffickers, angry at the system that let this happen, angry at myself for not doing more. But then I feel helpless too, because what could I have really done differently? It's like this constant battle in my head between rage and despair.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings connect to your daily life now?",
    "Client: They're always there, lurking in the background. I try to focus on my work, my family, but sometimes the smallest things can trigger these memories and emotions. A loud noise, a certain smell, even seeing news about similar situations... it all brings me right back there. I feel like I can't escape it.",
    "Therapist: Mm. What do you notice about how you cope with these triggers?",
    "Client: I... I guess I tend to shut down. I withdraw from my family, throw myself into work. Sometimes I drink more than I should, just to numb everything. But it doesn't really help. If anything, it makes me feel worse afterward. I know it's not healthy, but sometimes it feels like the only way to get through the day.",
    "Therapist: How does sharing this now feel different from before?",
    "Client: It's... it's strange. Part of me feels vulnerable and exposed, like I'm reliving it all over again. But there's also a small sense of relief. Like maybe by talking about it, I'm starting to let some of the weight go. I've carried this alone for so long, it's both terrifying and liberating to put it into words.",
    "Therapist: What do you think this means for your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. I want to believe that talking about it will help, that maybe I can learn to live with these memories without them controlling me. But it's scary too. What if I can't handle it? What if it just makes everything worse? I guess... I guess I'm hopeful, but also terrified of what might come up.",
    "Therapist: That uncertainty is normal. What strengths do you have that can help you?",
    "Client: I... I've always been resilient. I've faced difficult situations before and come out the other side. And I have my family, even though I've been pushing them away. They're still there for me. Maybe... maybe I can learn to lean on them more. And I'm here, aren't I? That takes some courage, I suppose.",
    "Therapist: Indeed. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's daunting, but... I think I need to. I can't keep living like this, always on edge, always haunted by the past. If there's a chance this can help me find some peace, I want to try. It won't be easy, but... I'm willing to do the work. I just... I hope I'm strong enough to see it through.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is admirable. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. This session has been intense, and I feel drained. But also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've taken a small step forward. Thank you for listening and guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't judge.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. How will you take care of yourself for the rest of the day?",
    "Client: I think I'll go for a walk in the park near my house. Being in nature usually helps me feel more grounded. And then maybe I'll call my daughter. I've been avoiding her calls, but... maybe it's time to reconnect a little. Just hearing her voice might help. And I'll make sure to use those breathing exercises we talked about if things start feeling overwhelming again.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. See you then. I... I'm nervous about what's to come, but also... maybe a little hopeful? It's a strange feeling. But I'm glad I'm here, doing this. Thank you again for your support."
