    "Therapist: Welcome back, Mei. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been thinking about it a lot since our last session.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We'll take it step by step.",
    "Client: Alright. I trust you, but I'm still anxious. This whole imaginal exposure thing sounds intense. Can you explain it again?",
    "Therapist: Of course. It's a way to process your trauma safely.",
    "Client: Process it? But I've been trying to forget about witnessing that violence. And now with all this cyberbullying stuff... it's just bringing up old feelings.",
    "Therapist: Avoiding memories often increases distress. This helps reduce that.",
    "Client: I see. But won't reliving it make things worse? I'm scared I'll fall apart.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel scared. We'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: Okay... I appreciate that. What exactly will happen during the session?",
    "Therapist: You'll describe the traumatic event in detail. I'll guide you.",
    "Client: In detail? Oh god. I'm not sure I can do that. What if I panic?",
    "Therapist: We have coping strategies ready. You're in control here.",
    "Client: Right, right. I remember the breathing exercises we practiced. Those help. How long will this take?",
    "Therapist: About 30-45 minutes. We can pause if needed.",
    "Client: That's a long time to think about something so awful. Will it get easier?",
    "Therapist: Yes, with practice. Each session typically becomes less distressing.",
    "Client: I hope so. I'm tired of feeling haunted by this. Do you really think this will help with my depression too?",
    "Therapist: It often does. Trauma and depression are often linked.",
    "Client: That makes sense. I've noticed my mood's worse when memories surface. Okay, I'm nervous but... I want to try.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable, Mei. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: As ready as I'll ever be, I suppose. Let's do this before I change my mind.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Start by closing your eyes and taking deep breaths."
