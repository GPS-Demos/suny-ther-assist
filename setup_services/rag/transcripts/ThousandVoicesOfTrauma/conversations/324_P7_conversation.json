    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the airplane crash scene?",
    "Client: Okay... I was at the airport, waiting for my flight. It was a sunny day, and I remember feeling excited about my upcoming vacation. Suddenly, I heard a loud noise and looked out the window. I saw a plane coming in for landing, but something was wrong. It was descending too quickly, and I could see smoke coming from one of the engines.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you saw.",
    "Client: The plane hit the runway hard, and there was a terrible screeching sound. Then, it veered off the runway and... oh god, it burst into flames. I could hear screaming and see people running everywhere. It was chaos.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that memory. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can. It's too much. The smell of burning fuel and... and... I can't do this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here with me.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I remember feeling frozen in place. People were pushing past me to get away from the windows, but I couldn't move. I just kept watching as the flames grew higher and higher. Emergency vehicles were rushing to the scene, but it felt like they were moving in slow motion.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I could hear the sirens and see the flashing lights. The smoke was so thick now, it was hard to see anything clearly. But I could make out figures moving near the plane. Firefighters, I think. They were trying to get close to the wreckage, but the heat was intense. I remember thinking about the people on the plane, wondering if anyone could have survived.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel emotional. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I started crying. I couldn't help it. A woman next to me was on her phone, calling someone. I could hear her saying, \"There's been a crash. It's bad.\" And that's when it really hit me - this was real. This wasn't a movie or a bad dream. People were dying right in front of me.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I remember feeling so helpless. I wanted to do something, anything to help, but what could I do? I just stood there, watching this horrific scene unfold. The worst part was the waiting. Waiting to see if anyone would emerge from the wreckage. Waiting to hear if there were any survivors. It felt like hours, but it was probably only minutes.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How were you feeling physically?",
    "Client: My heart was racing. I felt sick to my stomach. My hands were shaking so badly I had to clench them into fists. I remember feeling hot and cold at the same time, like I had a fever. And I couldn't stop the tears. They just kept coming.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those reactions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: Eventually, security started ushering us away from the windows. They were trying to clear the area. But I couldn't stop looking back. The image of that burning plane is seared into my memory. I can still see it so clearly, even now. It haunts me.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Talking about it brings it all back so vividly. But... I also feel a little lighter, if that makes sense. Like sharing the burden of this memory has helped somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. You've shown great courage today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It's still hard, but... maybe it's getting a little easier?",
    "Therapist: That's often the case. Shall we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. Thank you for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone listen and understand.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue next session. Take care."
