    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Johnson. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit uneasy, to be honest. My arthritis is acting up, and thinking about revisiting that day... it's making my stomach churn.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I suppose we should. (deep breath)",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes if you're comfortable. Take us to that day.",
    "Client: Alright... It's a warm afternoon in July. I'm walking home from the corner store, carrying a small bag of groceries. The sun is beating down, and I can feel sweat trickling down my back. I'm tired... my knees are aching from the walk.",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: I see the cracked sidewalk, weeds pushing through. There's litter scattered about. I hear children playing in a nearby yard, their laughter carried on the breeze. A car drives by, music blaring from its open windows.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I hear sirens in the distance. They're getting louder. My heart starts to race a little. I've always been nervous around police, even though I've never done anything wrong. The police car rounds the corner, speeding down the street.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling?",
    "Client: About a 40... The sirens are making me anxious.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (inhales deeply) The police car screeches to a halt beside me. Two officers jump out, guns drawn. They're shouting, but I can't understand what they're saying. My ears are ringing. I'm frozen in place, the grocery bag slipping from my fingers.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Terror. Pure terror. My heart feels like it's going to burst out of my chest. I can't breathe. I want to run, but my legs won't move. I'm trembling all over.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here with me, safe in this room.",
    "Client: One officer grabs my arm roughly, twisting it behind my back. I cry out in pain. \"I didn't do anything!\" I shout, but they're not listening. They slam me against the hood of the car. The metal is scorching hot from the sun. I feel my cheek burning.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 70. My heart is pounding just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: (takes several deep breaths) Okay... I can continue. They're handcuffing me now. The cuffs are too tight, digging into my wrists. I'm sobbing, begging them to tell me what I've done. People are gathering on the sidewalk, staring. I feel so humiliated.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: One officer is roughly patting me down. His hands are everywhere. I feel violated, helpless. The other is rifling through my grocery bag, dumping the contents on the ground. My bread is crushed, eggs broken. I watch the yolks spreading on the hot pavement.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My muscles are tense. I'm shaking. I feel nauseous, like I might throw up. My wrists hurt where the handcuffs were.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe now. What happens next?",
    "Client: They're shoving me into the back of the police car. It's stifling hot inside. I can barely breathe. They're talking to each other, but I can't focus on their words. I'm praying, begging God to help me. I'm thinking about my husband, my children. Will I ever see them again?",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 85 now. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: I know it's difficult. You're very brave. Take a deep breath. Feel the chair supporting you.",
    "Client: (inhales shakily) We're driving now. I don't know where they're taking me. Every bump in the road jostles my aching body. I'm sweating profusely, my clothes sticking to me. The fear is overwhelming. I feel like I'm going to pass out.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're doing well.",
    "Client: We arrive at the police station. They roughly pull me out of the car. My legs are weak, and I stumble. One officer yanks me up by my arm. The pain shoots through my shoulder. They march me inside, past staring eyes. I feel so small, so powerless.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Terrified. Angry. Confused. My whole body is trembling. I can't stop crying.",
    "Therapist: Those are all normal reactions. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: They fingerprint me, take my photo. I'm still asking what I've done, but no one will answer me. They put me in a cell. It's cold, stark. The bench is hard. I curl up in the corner, sobbing. I've never felt so alone, so scared in my life.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"This can't be happening. Not to me. I'm a good person. I've never broken the law.\" I'm worried about my husband. He'll be expecting me home. What if they don't let me call him? What if I never see him again?",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 90. My chest feels tight. It's hard to breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Focus on your breathing. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: (breathes deeply several times) Okay... I'm in the cell for what feels like hours. My arthritis is flaring up from sitting on the hard bench. I'm cold, hungry, and desperately need to use the bathroom. But I'm too afraid to ask. I feel... dehumanized.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Finally, an officer comes. He opens the cell door. \"There's been a mistake,\" he says. No apology, no explanation. They release me, give me back my belongings. My groceries are ruined. I'm shaking so hard I can barely sign the release forms.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: Relief... but also anger. Intense anger. And shame. I feel... violated. Like my dignity has been stripped away. I want to scream, to demand justice, but I'm too afraid. I just want to go home.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: I walk out of the station. It's dark now. I realize I have no way to get home. My phone battery is dead. I start walking, even though my whole body aches. Cars pass by, but I'm too afraid to try and flag one down. I just keep walking, crying silently.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's around 75 now. I feel drained, empty.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here with me, safe in this room.",
    "Client: (inhales deeply) I finally make it home. My husband is frantic. He's been calling hospitals, police stations. When he sees me, he rushes to hug me, but I flinch away. I can't bear to be touched. I collapse on the sofa and just... sob. I can't even speak to tell him what happened.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Every muscle aches. My wrists are bruised from the handcuffs. My cheek still burns from the car hood. I feel... broken. Like something fundamental has been taken from me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. We're almost done. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm at about 60. Reliving it is hard, but... I feel a little lighter. Like I'm not carrying it all alone anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (breathes deeply) Okay... I'm here. In your office. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Well done. You showed incredible strength today. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Drained, but... relieved in a way. It's still painful, but talking about it... it helps. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You did all the hard work. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we end?",
    "Client: Just... I hope this helps. I hope sharing this can make a difference somehow. Maybe prevent it from happening to someone else.",
    "Therapist: Your courage in facing this trauma is admirable. We'll end here for today. Take care of yourself."
