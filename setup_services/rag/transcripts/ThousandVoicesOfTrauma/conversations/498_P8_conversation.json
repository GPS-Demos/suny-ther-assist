    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is buzzing, you know? My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. The memories were so vivid this time. I could almost smell the musty odor of that room where... where it happened.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: It's a jumble, really. Part of me feels angry \u2013 angry at him, angry at myself for not fighting harder. But then there's this overwhelming sense of shame. I keep thinking, \"Why didn't I just leave? Why didn't I scream?\" It's like I'm back there, frozen all over again.",
    "Therapist: Those are common reactions. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I feel... exposed. Like everyone can see what happened to me just by looking at me. It's irrational, I know, but it's there. And there's this heaviness in my chest, like I can't quite catch my breath. It's not as bad as when we first started these sessions, but it's still there.",
    "Therapist: How does this compare to previous exposures?",
    "Client: It's... different. The details are clearer now, which is terrifying in its own way. But I also feel like I'm starting to separate myself from the memory a bit. Like, I can see it happening, but I'm not completely lost in it anymore. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that makes sense. What's that like for you?",
    "Client: It's a relief, honestly. But it's also confusing. Part of me feels guilty for not being as affected. Like, shouldn't I be more upset? Does this mean I'm forgetting or minimizing what happened? And then there's this tiny voice in the back of my mind that's saying, \"You're getting stronger. You're healing.\" It's hard to believe that voice sometimes.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that voice?",
    "Client: I want to believe it. God, I want to believe it so badly. But it's scary, you know? If I let myself believe I'm getting better, what if something happens and I fall apart again? It's like I'm standing on the edge of something, and I don't know if I should step back or jump.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to take that step?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe it would mean accepting that what happened wasn't my fault. That I did the best I could with what I had at the time. It might mean letting go of some of this shame I've been carrying around. But it's also terrifying because if it wasn't my fault, then I have to face the fact that sometimes terrible things just happen, and we can't control everything.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea sit with you?",
    "Client: It's uncomfortable. Really uncomfortable. But... maybe also a little freeing? I've spent so long trying to figure out what I could have done differently, how I could have prevented it. If I let that go, what would I do with all that energy? Who would I be without that constant self-blame?",
    "Therapist: What comes up when you think about that person?",
    "Client: I... I see someone stronger than I feel right now. Someone who can look people in the eye without wondering if they can see my shame. Someone who doesn't flinch at unexpected touches or loud noises. But I also see someone unfamiliar, and that's scary. It's like I've been holding onto this trauma as a shield, and without it, I feel naked and vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you describe this?",
    "Client: It's strange. My shoulders feel lighter, like some tension has eased. But my stomach is in knots. It's like my body is fighting itself \u2013 part of it wants to relax and let go, and part of it is still braced for impact. I notice I'm breathing a little easier, though. The heaviness in my chest isn't as pronounced.",
    "Therapist: What do you make of these physical changes?",
    "Client: I guess... I guess it's a sign that things are shifting. That maybe this process is working, even when it feels impossibly hard. It's like my body is starting to believe what my mind is still struggling with \u2013 that I'm safe now, that it's okay to let my guard down a little.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization feel?",
    "Client: Overwhelming. There's a part of me that wants to cry with relief. Another part that's skeptical, waiting for the other shoe to drop. And then there's this tiny spark of hope that I'm almost afraid to acknowledge. It's like... like seeing a glimmer of light after being in the dark for so long. You're not sure if it's real, but you desperately want it to be.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to do with that spark?",
    "Client: I... I think I want to nurture it. To give it a chance to grow. Maybe that means being a little kinder to myself, or allowing myself to believe that healing is possible. It's scary, but... I think I'm ready to try. To take that step, even if I'm not sure where it'll lead me.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a significant insight. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, but... lighter? Like I've set down a heavy backpack I didn't even realize I was carrying. There's still fear and uncertainty, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming. I'm exhausted, but it's a different kind of tired. Like I've done something hard but worthwhile, instead of just struggling against myself.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to take away from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I want to remember this feeling. This sense that change is possible, even when it feels impossible. And maybe to try and listen to that quiet voice a little more \u2013 the one that says I'm getting stronger. It's not easy, but I think it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful intention. We're nearly out of time. How would you like to close?",
    "Client: Could we just sit quietly for a moment? I feel like I need to let all of this settle before I head back out into the world. And... thank you. For creating a space where I can confront these memories and start to see a way forward.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take a few deep breaths together."
