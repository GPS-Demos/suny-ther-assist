    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the natural disaster you experienced?",
    "Client: Okay... It was a cyclone. I was in my village in Fiji when it hit. The wind was so loud, like a constant roar. I remember the sound of trees snapping and things crashing outside.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The roof of our house started to peel off. We huddled in the bathroom, my parents, my little sister, and me. The water was rising so fast. I was terrified we'd drown.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I can still hear my sister crying. She was only six. I tried to comfort her, but I was shaking so badly. The walls were creaking, and I thought the whole house would collapse on us.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Continue.",
    "Client: We spent hours in that bathroom. When the eye of the storm passed, we ran to our neighbor's concrete house. I remember the devastation outside - trees uprooted, houses destroyed. It felt like the end of the world.",
    "Therapist: That must have been overwhelming. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My heart is racing, just like it did then. I feel... I feel so helpless, like I did that day.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: After the cyclone passed, everything was gone. Our home, our belongings, our entire village... We had nothing left. That's when we decided to leave Fiji and come to Australia as refugees.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. Keep going.",
    "Client: The refugee process was another nightmare. We lived in a camp for months. I missed school, my friends... everything familiar was gone. I felt so lost and angry.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to feel that way. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Sometimes I still feel guilty for being angry. We were alive, after all. But I lost my childhood that day. Even now, when I hear strong winds or heavy rain, I panic.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. You've been through a lot.",
    "Client: I dream about it sometimes. In my dreams, I'm back in that bathroom, but this time the water keeps rising, and I can't save my sister. I wake up screaming.",
    "Therapist: These nightmares are common. You're processing the trauma.",
    "Client: I wish I could forget it all. But at the same time, I'm afraid of forgetting. It's part of who I am now. I just want to feel normal again.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. My heart's still racing, but talking about it... it helps. It's like the memory loses some of its power when I say it out loud.",
    "Therapist: That's a great observation. You're doing excellent work.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It's still hard, but... I think I'm getting stronger.",
    "Therapist: You absolutely are. Let's take a deep breath together.",
    "Client: *takes a deep breath* That helps. I feel a bit calmer now. It's strange, but I feel a little lighter after sharing all of this.",
    "Therapist: That's often the case. You've done well today.",
    "Client: I think I understand now why we do this. It's painful, but it's also... freeing, in a way. Like I'm taking back control from the memory.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. You're showing great insight.",
    "Client: I hope one day I can think about the cyclone without feeling this intense fear. Is that possible?",
    "Therapist: It is. You're already making progress.",
    "Client: Thank you for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone listen without judgment.",
    "Therapist: That's what I'm here for. How about we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. I feel drained, but in a positive way, if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: It makes perfect sense. You've done excellent work today."
