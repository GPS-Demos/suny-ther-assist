    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's begin when you're comfortable.",
    "Client: Okay, I'm ready. I'm back at the bank. It's a busy Friday afternoon, and I'm waiting in line to deposit my paycheck. The air conditioning is on full blast, and I can smell the leather from my new purse. Suddenly, there's a loud bang, and everyone freezes. A man in a ski mask is waving a gun, shouting at us to get down on the ground. My heart is racing, and I can feel my palms getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 6. My heart is definitely beating faster just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Please continue.",
    "Client: As I'm lying on the cold tile floor, I can hear muffled sobs from the woman next to me. The gunman is pacing back and forth, his boots squeaking with each step. I'm trying to stay as still as possible, but my whole body is trembling. I keep thinking about my daughter, wondering if I'll ever see her again. The fear is overwhelming, and I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to an 8. I can feel my chest tightening, just like it did that day.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The police arrive, and I can hear sirens outside. The gunman starts shouting demands, and his voice is shaking. He sounds scared too. I'm trying to control my breathing, but it's coming in short gasps. I'm so afraid he'll start shooting. Every time he raises his voice, I flinch. The wait seems endless, and I'm convinced something terrible is about to happen.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a deep breath if you need to.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) Okay. The negotiator starts talking to the gunman. I can't make out what they're saying, but the tone is calmer. Time seems to stretch on forever. My arms are aching from lying in the same position for so long, and I'm fighting the urge to move. Suddenly, there's a commotion, and I hear a thud. When I dare to look up, I see the police have tackled the gunman. It's over, but I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: How about your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... dropping a bit. Maybe a 7? I still feel really tense, but there's also this flood of relief.",
    "Therapist: That's natural. How are you feeling right now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. My heart's still racing a bit, but I know I'm safe here. It's strange how vivid the memory still is, even after all this time.",
    "Therapist: That's common. You did well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was hard, but... I think it helps to talk about it.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves before we end."
