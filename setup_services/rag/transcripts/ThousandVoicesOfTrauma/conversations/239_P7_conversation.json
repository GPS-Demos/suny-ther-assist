    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the memory we've been working on?",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. It was a dark room, I remember that clearly. I was probably around 10 years old. The air felt heavy, and there was this musty smell. I can still hear the creaking of the floorboards as people moved around outside the door.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: I... I was huddled in the corner, trying to make myself as small as possible. My heart was racing so fast, I thought it might burst out of my chest. I could hear muffled voices outside, speaking in a language I didn't understand. I was terrified they'd come in at any moment.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: It's hard... I feel like I can't breathe, just like back then. My hands are shaking, and I feel so cold. I remember wrapping my arms around my knees, rocking back and forth, silently praying for someone to find me, to save me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: Suddenly, the door opened. The light was so bright, it hurt my eyes. A large man stood there, his silhouette blocking most of the light. He said something I couldn't understand, then reached for me. I tried to scream, but no sound came out. I felt so helpless, so small.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: He grabbed my arm and pulled me up roughly. I remember the pain, how his fingers dug into my skin. As he dragged me out of the room, I saw other children. Their eyes were hollow, empty. I wanted to help them, but I couldn't even help myself.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... overwhelmed. My heart is pounding, and I feel nauseous. It's like I'm right back there, helpless and scared. But... I also feel angry. Angry at the people who did this, angry that no one helped us sooner.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are valid. You're safe now.",
    "Client: We were taken to a van. It was crowded, hot, and stuffy. I remember the sound of muffled sobs and whimpers. The drive felt like it lasted forever. I kept thinking about my parents, wondering if I'd ever see them again. The fear and uncertainty were suffocating.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an incredible job. Keep going.",
    "Client: When the van finally stopped, we were in a completely different place. It looked like a warehouse. There were more men there, talking and laughing as if this was just a normal day for them. I felt so... dehumanized. Like we weren't even people to them, just objects.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're here now, and you're safe.",
    "Client: I... I don't think I can continue. It's too much. I feel like I'm going to be sick.",
    "Therapist: That's alright. You've done amazingly well today. Let's take some deep breaths together.",
    "Client: Okay... [deep breath] It's just... it feels so real when I talk about it. Like it's happening all over again.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're very courageous for facing this.",
    "Client: Thank you. I know it's important, but it's so hard. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever truly feel safe again.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. We'll work through this together, at your pace.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It helps to know I'm not alone in this anymore. Even though reliving it is painful, I think... I think it might be helping. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's a positive sign. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I hope so. I want to move past this, to not let it control my life anymore. But it's such a long journey.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. We'll end here for today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I feel drained, but also... maybe a little lighter? Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a common experience after processing trauma.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you for guiding me through this. Same time next week?",
    "Therapist: Yes, I'll see you then. Take care of yourself this week."
