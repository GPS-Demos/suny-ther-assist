    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the scene?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in Afghanistan. It's a hot day, and I'm on patrol with my unit. We're walking through a small village, and everything seems quiet... too quiet. I can feel the sweat trickling down my back, and my grip on my rifle is tight.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud explosion. I'm thrown to the ground, and there's dust and smoke everywhere. I can hear screaming and gunfire. My ears are ringing, and I'm disoriented. I... I see one of my teammates on the ground, not moving.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice shaking) I... I crawl over to him. There's blood everywhere. I'm calling his name, but he's not responding. I can see parts of his... his body are missing. Oh God, I feel sick...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. It's okay to feel this way.",
    "Client: I hear more explosions, and gunfire is getting closer. I'm trying to drag my teammate to safety, but he's so heavy. My hands are slippery with his blood. I can smell the metallic scent of blood mixed with dust and smoke. I'm terrified, but I can't leave him.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I manage to pull him behind a partially collapsed wall. My heart is pounding so hard I can barely hear anything else. I'm frantically trying to apply first aid, but deep down, I know it's too late. I can hear the rest of my unit shouting and returning fire. I should be helping them, but I can't leave my friend.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. It's okay to feel these emotions.",
    "Client: (crying) I... I don't know what to do. I'm frozen. I can see the life draining from my friend's eyes. I feel so helpless, so angry. Why him? Why couldn't I protect him? I was supposed to have his back...",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: The firefight seems to last forever. When it finally stops, I realize I'm covered in blood and dust. My friend is gone. I failed him. The village is in ruins, and there are bodies everywhere \u2013 soldiers and civilians. The smell of death is overwhelming. I feel numb, shocked. How can I go on after this?",
    "Therapist: You're very courageous. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: (taking deep breaths) In the aftermath, I have to help with the body recovery. Every face I see reminds me of my friend. I keep replaying those moments in my head, wondering if I could have done something differently. The guilt is crushing. I don't know how I'll ever sleep again without seeing those images.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: (sighing) I feel drained, but also... lighter somehow. Talking about it is hard, but it's like I'm finally letting some of it out. I've carried this for so long, trying to push it down. But it's always there, just below the surface.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've shown great strength today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I could talk about this without completely falling apart. It still hurts, but maybe... maybe it's a step towards healing? I don't know. I just know I don't want to be controlled by these memories anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive outlook. How about we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. I'm exhausted, but I feel like I've accomplished something. Thank you for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone listen without judgment.",
