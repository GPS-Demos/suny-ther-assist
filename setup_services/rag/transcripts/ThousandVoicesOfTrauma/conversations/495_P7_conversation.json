    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the home invasion, starting from the moment you first realized something was wrong?",
    "Client: Okay... I was in my living room, reading a book. It was late evening, around 9 PM. I heard a strange noise coming from the back door. At first, I thought it might be the wind, but then I heard it again, louder this time. My heart started racing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what happened next.",
    "Client: I put my book down and stood up slowly. My hands were shaking. I walked towards the kitchen, where the back door is. As I got closer, I heard the sound of metal scraping against metal. That's when I knew someone was trying to break in. I felt frozen, like I couldn't move or breathe.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there was a loud crash. The door flew open, and two men rushed in. They were wearing dark clothes and masks. One of them grabbed me by the arm, and I screamed. I tried to pull away, but his grip was so tight. The other man started ransacking the kitchen drawers.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I felt so helpless and terrified. The man holding me pushed me into a chair and told me not to move. His voice was harsh and threatening. I couldn't stop shaking. I kept thinking about my family, wondering if I'd ever see them again. The other man came back with some jewelry and cash he'd found.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: They started arguing about whether to tie me up or not. I felt sick to my stomach, thinking about what they might do to me. The one who had been holding me said they should just leave before anyone noticed. That's when we heard sirens in the distance.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: Everything happened so fast after that. The men panicked and ran out the back door. I was left there, trembling and crying. I couldn't move for what felt like hours. The police arrived, but by then, the men were long gone. I felt so violated, so vulnerable in my own home.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to feel that way. You're safe now.",
    "Client: For weeks after, I couldn't sleep. Every little noise made me jump. I kept replaying that night in my head, wondering what I could have done differently. I felt so angry at myself for not being able to protect myself or my home.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling anxious. My heart is racing, just like it did that night. But I also feel a little relieved to be talking about it. It's hard, but I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Thank you. It's still difficult to think about, but I feel a bit calmer now. I keep reminding myself that I survived, that I'm here now, safe. But sometimes, the fear still creeps in, especially at night.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I guess I am. It's just... sometimes I feel so frustrated with myself for not being able to move past this. I know it's not my fault, but part of me still blames myself for not doing more that night.",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. You did the best you could.",
    "Client: You're right. I know that logically, but emotionally, it's still hard to accept. I'm trying to focus on the present, on feeling safe now. But sometimes, like when we're talking about it like this, it all feels so vivid again.",
    "Therapist: That's part of the process. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your support through this. It's not easy, but I'm determined to work through it. I want to feel safe in my home again, to not jump at every little sound. I want to reclaim my life.",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. Let's continue working towards it.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm ready to keep going. Even though it's difficult, I feel like I'm making progress. Each time we do this, it gets a little easier to talk about. I'm starting to believe that maybe, someday, this won't have such a strong hold on me.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of your progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. I am proud, in a way. It's been a long journey, and I know I still have a way to go, but I'm not giving up. I want to be able to enjoy my home again, to feel at peace there. I'm hopeful that with time and more sessions like this, I'll get there.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is admirable. Shall we continue?",
    "Client: Yes, let's continue. I'm ready to face this head-on. Even though it's challenging, I know it's necessary for my healing. I want to explore more about how this experience has affected my relationships with my family. They've been so supportive, but I sometimes feel like a burden to them.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Let's explore that.",
    "Client: Well, my daughter has been staying with me more often since the incident. She's worried about me being alone. While I appreciate her concern, I sometimes feel like I've lost my independence. I don't want her to put her life on hold because of me. And my son, he installed a new security system, which helps, but it also reminds me of what happened every time I use it.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have mixed feelings about this.",
    "Client: You're right. I am grateful for their support, but I also long for things to go back to normal. I want to be the strong, independent mother they've always known. It's frustrating to feel so vulnerable and dependent. But I'm trying to be patient with myself and accept their help as part of the healing process.",
    "Therapist: That's a healthy perspective. How else has this affected you?",
    "Client: Well, I've noticed changes in my social life too. I used to enjoy having friends over for dinner or book club meetings. Now, the thought of having people in my home makes me anxious. I've been declining invitations and isolating myself more. I miss the connection, but I'm struggling to overcome this fear.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable. We can work on that.",
    "Client: I hope so. I don't want to let this experience define me or limit my life any more than it already has. I want to reclaim my social life, my sense of security, and my joy. It's just... it's a process, and some days are harder than others. But being here, talking about it, I feel like I'm taking steps in the right direction.",
    "Therapist: You are. Your progress is evident.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot to hear. Sometimes it's hard to see the progress myself, but when I think back to where I was right after the incident, I can see how far I've come. I'm sleeping better most nights, and I've started to enjoy reading again, which was something I couldn't do for a while because it reminded me of that night.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, in a way. Talking about it is still difficult, but it doesn't overwhelm me like it used to. I feel more in control of my emotions and my reactions. There's still work to do, but I'm hopeful. I'm starting to believe that I can overcome this and reclaim my life fully.",
    "Therapist: Your resilience is inspiring. Let's wrap up for today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your guidance and support through this process. Even though it's challenging, I feel like each session brings me closer to healing. I'm looking forward to continuing this work and seeing more progress in the future.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Take care."
