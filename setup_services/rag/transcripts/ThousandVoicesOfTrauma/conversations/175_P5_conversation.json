    "Therapist: Welcome, Amir. Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: To be honest, I'm feeling a bit anxious. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of reliving that plane crash... it's terrifying. I've spent so much time trying to forget it, and now you want me to remember it in detail? I'm not sure I can handle that.",
    "Therapist: Your anxiety is understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... every time I think about that day, I feel like I'm right back there. The sounds, the smells, the panic - it all comes rushing back. I'm worried that if I start talking about it in detail, I might lose control. What if I can't stop reliving it? What if it makes my nightmares worse? I've been using substances to numb these memories, and now you're asking me to face them head-on. It feels counterintuitive and honestly, quite scary.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your honesty. How about we discuss the purpose of this exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I mean, I understand that it's part of the treatment, but I'm struggling to see how purposely remembering something so traumatic can be helpful. Isn't the goal to move past this? It feels like we're moving backwards. But I'm willing to listen and try to understand. Maybe if I know more about why we're doing this, it might help me feel a bit more prepared.",
    "Therapist: The goal is to process the memory, reducing its power over you. It may be uncomfortable initially, but it often leads to relief.",
    "Client: I see. So, it's kind of like facing my fears head-on? I guess that makes sense, but it's still scary. I've been avoiding anything related to airplanes or crashes for so long. The thought of deliberately bringing those memories to the surface... it's daunting. But you said it leads to relief - can you tell me more about that? How long does it usually take before people start feeling better? And what exactly do you mean by 'processing' the memory?",
    "Therapist: Processing means understanding and integrating the experience. Relief often begins after a few sessions, but everyone's pace is different.",
    "Client: Okay, I think I'm starting to understand a bit better. It's like... confronting the memory instead of running from it might help me make sense of it? That's a new perspective for me. I've always thought that the best way to deal with it was to push it away, but maybe that's why I've been struggling so much. It's just... the idea of voluntarily bringing up those memories is still really intimidating. What can I expect during the actual exposure? How intense will it be?",
    "Therapist: It can be intense, but we'll go at your pace. You'll describe the event while I guide you. We can pause anytime you need.",
    "Client: That's somewhat reassuring. I appreciate that we can pause if it gets too overwhelming. I'm curious, though - what exactly will you be doing while I'm describing the event? And how do I know if it's working? I mean, I've tried talking about this before with friends and family, and it always just left me feeling worse. How is this different?",
    "Therapist: I'll be here to support you, asking questions to help process the memory. Unlike casual conversations, this is structured to promote healing.",
    "Client: I see. So it's not just about talking about it, but about how we talk about it. That makes sense. I'm still nervous, but I think I'm starting to feel a bit more prepared. You mentioned asking questions - what kind of questions? And what should I do if I start to feel overwhelmed or if I want to stop?",
    "Therapist: Questions will help explore details and emotions. If overwhelmed, we'll use grounding techniques. You can stop anytime \u2013 you're in control.",
    "Client: Okay, that's good to know. I like the idea of being in control. It makes me feel a bit safer about the whole process. I think I'm ready to give this a try. But before we start, is there anything I should do to prepare myself? Any techniques I can use to stay calm during the exposure?",
    "Therapist: Great question. We'll practice some breathing exercises first. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Alright, I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. The breathing exercises sound helpful. I'm still nervous, but I'm also feeling a glimmer of hope. Maybe this will help me finally move past this trauma. I'm putting my trust in you and this process. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Let's start with a deep breath. Remember, we're here to help you heal."
