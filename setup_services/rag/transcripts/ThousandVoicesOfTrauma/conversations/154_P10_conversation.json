    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm feeling a bit apprehensive, to be honest. My stomach's in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to help you process these experiences. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 6 out of 10. My hands are a bit clammy.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. When you're ready, close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Alright... I'm back at the office. It's about two years ago, just after my divorce. I can smell the coffee from the break room. The fluorescent lights are harsh overhead. I'm sitting at my desk, trying to focus on my work, but my mind keeps drifting to the empty house I'll be going home to...",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... hollow. Like there's this gaping void in my chest. My coworker, Jessica, walks by and gives me this look of pity. God, I hate that look. It makes me want to crawl under my desk and disappear.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear laughter from the break room. It's Tom and his cronies. They've been gossiping about my divorce for weeks. I can feel my face getting hot, my jaw clenching. I want to scream at them to mind their own business, but I don't. I just sit there, feeling small and exposed.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's creeping up. Maybe a 7 or 8. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep going. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I try to focus on my computer screen, but the words are blurring. Tom walks by my desk, smirking. He drops a file on my desk and says, \"Here's that report. Hope you can handle it, what with everything going on.\" His tone is dripping with fake concern. I feel my hands shaking as I reach for the file.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: My shoulders are so tense they're practically touching my ears. There's this burning sensation in my stomach, like acid. I can hear my pulse pounding in my ears. I want to run, to hide, but I'm frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I mumble a \"thanks\" to Tom, hating myself for not standing up to him. As he walks away, I hear him mutter something about \"damaged goods\" to his friend. The words hit me like a physical blow. I feel tears pricking at my eyes, but I refuse to let them fall. Not here. Not where they can see.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I can feel my heart racing. My palms are so sweaty.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... I... I decide I can't take it anymore. I stand up, my chair scraping loudly against the floor. Everyone turns to look at me. I can feel their eyes, judging, pitying. I grab my purse and practically run to the bathroom. I lock myself in a stall and finally let the tears come. They're hot and angry, streaming down my face. I'm trying to muffle my sobs, but I know anyone who comes in will hear me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with those emotions. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... I'm thinking that I'm pathetic. That Tom and the others are right. That I'm broken, that no one will ever want me again. That I've failed at the most basic thing \u2013 keeping my marriage together. I'm wondering how I'll face everyone when I leave this stall. The shame is overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Remember, these are memories. You're safe now. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still at a 9. My chest hurts from trying to hold back the sobs.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I hear the bathroom door open. Someone comes in. I hold my breath, trying to be quiet. But then I hear a gentle knock on my stall door. It's Maria, the kind older woman from accounting. She says, \"Sarah? Are you okay in there?\" Her voice is so full of genuine concern that it makes me cry harder.",
    "Therapist: How does Maria's kindness make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of relief and more shame. I'm grateful for her kindness, but I hate that she's seeing me like this. I manage to choke out that I'm fine, but my voice is shaky and unconvincing. Maria doesn't leave. She just stands there and says, \"I know things are hard right now. But you're stronger than you know. We're all here for you.\"",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. How does your body feel now?",
    "Client: My shoulders have dropped a bit. The tightness in my chest is loosening slightly. But I still feel this heavy weight of embarrassment.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing these emotions. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about a 7 now. Maria's kindness has taken the edge off.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Continue with what happens next.",
    "Client: I... I take a few deep breaths. I wipe my eyes and blow my nose. I know I need to leave the stall eventually. With shaky hands, I unlock the door. Maria is standing there, her eyes full of compassion. Without a word, she pulls me into a hug. I stiffen at first, but then I let myself lean into it. It's the first time in weeks someone has shown me physical affection, and it nearly undoes me again.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. How does the hug affect you?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a dam breaking. All the emotions I've been holding back come flooding out. I'm crying on Maria's shoulder, probably ruining her blouse. But she just holds me, rubbing my back and murmuring soothing words. I feel... I feel seen. Like maybe I'm not as alone as I thought.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about a 5 or 6. The comfort is helping, but I'm still acutely aware that I need to go back out there and face everyone.",
    "Therapist: That's natural. What happens after the hug?",
    "Client: Maria helps me clean up my face. She lends me some concealer to hide the redness around my eyes. As we're about to leave the bathroom, she turns to me and says, \"Remember, Sarah, their opinions don't define you. You're going through a tough time, but it won't last forever.\" I nod, trying to believe her words.",
    "Therapist: How do those words make you feel?",
    "Client: They... they give me a small spark of hope. Like maybe there's a light at the end of this tunnel, even if I can't see it yet. I straighten my shoulders, trying to gather my courage.",
    "Therapist: That's great. What happens when you leave the bathroom?",
    "Client: We walk out together. I can feel eyes on me as we pass through the office. Tom and his friends are watching, probably wondering what happened. But Maria walks me right to my desk, her presence like a shield. She squeezes my shoulder before heading back to her own department. I sit down, my hands still shaking slightly, but I feel... I feel a tiny bit stronger.",
    "Therapist: You're doing excellent. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Emotionally drained. But there's also this small sense of... I don't know, maybe pride? That I faced it and didn't completely fall apart. My SUDS level is probably around a 4 now.",
    "Therapist: That's fantastic progress. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay. I'm... I'm back in the room with you.",
    "Therapist: Well done. How do you feel about the session?",
    "Client: It was... intense. Reliving that was hard, but I feel like I understand it better now. I can see how far I've come since then.",
    "Therapist: That's great insight. Let's do some grounding exercises before we end.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Name five things you can see in this room.",
    "Client: Your desk, the bookshelf, the plant in the corner, the clock on the wall, and the painting behind you.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now four things you can touch.",
    "Client: The armrest of this chair, my necklace, the fabric of my shirt, and the floor beneath my feet.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Three things you can hear?",
    "Client: The ticking of the clock, the hum of the air conditioner, and distant traffic outside.",
    "Therapist: Very good. Two things you can smell?",
    "Client: The lavender air freshener and... coffee, I think?",
    "Therapist: Perfect. And finally, one thing you can taste?",
    "Client: The mint from the gum I had earlier.",
    "Therapist: Wonderful job, Sarah. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... more grounded. More present. The memory feels less overwhelming now.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. We'll end our session here. Remember to practice your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you... this was hard, but I think it helped.",
    "Therapist: You did great work today. We'll continue next week. Take care."
