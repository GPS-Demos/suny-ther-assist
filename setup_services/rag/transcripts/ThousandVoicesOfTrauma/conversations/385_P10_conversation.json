    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is screaming to run away. My stomach's in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I guess so. Let's do this before I change my mind.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes, take a deep breath, and describe the scene as vividly as you can. Where are you?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in the living room of our old house. It's dark outside, probably late evening. The TV is on, but the volume is low. I can smell dinner \u2013 mom's lasagna, I think. But something feels off. There's tension in the air.",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: I see our old floral couch, the one with the cigarette burns. Dad's empty beer cans on the coffee table. My little brother's toys scattered on the floor. I'm... I'm sitting in the corner, trying to make myself small.",
    "Therapist: What's happening now?",
    "Client: I hear shouting from the kitchen. It's getting louder. My heart is racing. I... I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Sarah. You're safe here. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. God, it feels so real.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: The kitchen door slams open. Dad stumbles in, he's drunk again. Mom follows, she's crying. He's yelling at her, calling her names. I want to cover my ears, but I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm terrified. My palms are sweaty, and I'm shaking. I want to help mom, but I'm too scared to move.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep describing what's happening.",
    "Client: Dad grabs mom's arm. She tries to pull away, but he's too strong. He... he slaps her across the face. The sound echoes in the room. I flinch, but I still can't move.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I can't... I can't do this.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Sarah. You're safe here. This is just a memory. Can you continue?",
    "Client: I... I'll try. Mom's crying harder now. Her cheek is red where he hit her. Dad's still yelling, but his words are slurred. He... he pushes her, and she falls against the wall. I hear a thud, and she slides down to the floor.",
    "Therapist: What are you doing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm crying silently. I want to help, but I'm paralyzed with fear. I can feel the rough carpet under my fingers as I dig them in.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Keep going.",
    "Client: Dad turns and sees me. His eyes... they're so angry. He starts walking towards me, stumbling. I can smell the alcohol on his breath. I press myself harder against the wall, wishing I could disappear.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he grabs my arm, yanks me up. It hurts. I can feel his fingers digging into my skin. He's yelling at me now, telling me it's all my fault. That if I wasn't such a bad kid, he wouldn't have to drink.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... small. Helpless. Guilty. Like maybe he's right, and it is all my fault.",
    "Therapist: Remember, Sarah, it wasn't your fault. You were a child. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still a 9. My chest feels tight. I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. In through your nose, out through your mouth. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *takes a shaky breath* Okay... okay. I'm... I'm still in the living room. Dad's grip on my arm is getting tighter. I can hear mom crying in the background. She's begging him to let me go.",
    "Therapist: What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I finally find my voice. I start crying loudly, begging him to stop. But that just makes him angrier. He shakes me hard, my teeth rattle. I'm so scared he's going to hit me too.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Sarah. Stay with the memory. What happens next?",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud bang. The front door flies open. It's... it's our neighbor, Mr. Johnson. He must have heard the commotion. Dad lets go of me, and I stumble back.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Relieved... but still terrified. My arm hurts where dad grabbed me. I'm shaking all over. I want to run to mom, but I'm afraid to move.",
    "Therapist: What's happening in the room?",
    "Client: Mr. Johnson is yelling at dad, telling him to back off. Dad's cursing, but he's backing away. Mom's still on the floor, crying. I can see a bruise forming on her cheek. I feel... I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 7. I'm still scared, but I feel a little safer with Mr. Johnson there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: Mr. Johnson is on the phone now. I think he's calling the police. Dad's yelling, threatening him. But Mr. Johnson stands his ground. I... I finally find the courage to move. I run to mom, throw my arms around her.",
    "Therapist: How does that feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of emotions. I'm scared, but I also feel protective. Mom's holding me tight, whispering that it's going to be okay. But I can feel her trembling.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens after that?",
    "Client: Everything becomes a blur. The police arrive. There's a lot of talking, questions. Dad's taken away in handcuffs. He's still yelling, but his voice fades as they put him in the car. Mom and I are just holding each other, crying.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. Scared. But also... a little relieved? It's over, at least for now. But I'm worried about what will happen when dad comes back.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 6 now. I'm still shaky, but the worst of it has passed.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well, Sarah. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *takes a deep breath* Okay... I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. Can you tell me five things you see in this room right now?",
    "Client: I see... the blue walls, the potted plant in the corner, your desk, the clock on the wall, and the painting of the ocean.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Now, how are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. A bit shaken up, but okay. It's strange... reliving it was horrible, but I also feel... I don't know, maybe a bit stronger?",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. You faced a difficult memory and got through it. How would you rate your distress now?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 4. I'm still a bit anxious, but I feel more grounded.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Sarah. You did really well today. How do you feel about the session?",
    "Client: It was tough... really tough. But I'm glad I did it. I didn't think I could face those memories, but I did. It's like... like I'm taking back some control.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent way to look at it. You showed a lot of courage today. Do you have any questions or concerns before we end?",
    "Client: I... I'm a bit worried about how I'll feel later. What if the memories come back stronger?",
    "Therapist: That's a valid concern. Remember the coping strategies we've discussed. If you feel overwhelmed, use your breathing exercises and grounding techniques. And don't hesitate to call if you need support. Shall we review your safety plan?",
    "Client: Yes, please. That would help.",
    "Therapist: Alright, let's go through it together...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Better. More prepared. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Sarah. Remember, you did the hard work here. I'm proud of the progress you've made. We'll continue to work through this in our next session. Take care of yourself this week.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again. See you next week.",
    "Therapist: Take care, Sarah. Goodbye."
