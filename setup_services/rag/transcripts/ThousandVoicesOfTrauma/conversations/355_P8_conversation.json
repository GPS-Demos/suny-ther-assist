    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I was right back there, you know? Watching it all unfold again. I can still hear the shouting, the crashes... it's so vivid.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... a deep sadness. It's like I'm that helpless child again, watching something I shouldn't have to see. I feel this heaviness in my chest, and my hands are a bit shaky. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... why? Why did this have to happen? Why couldn't I do anything to stop it? I know I was just a kid, but part of me still feels guilty, like I should have been able to do something. And then I think about how this has affected me all these years. The nightmares, the anxiety... it's like this dark cloud that's always been there.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts relate to your present life?",
    "Client: Well, I... I guess I've always struggled with feeling powerless in difficult situations. Even now, at work or in my relationships, when conflicts arise, I tend to freeze up. It's like I'm right back there, watching and unable to act. And the guilt... it's not just about that incident anymore. I feel guilty for how my trauma affects my wife, my kids. Like I'm not the husband or father I should be because of this.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your body right now?",
    "Client: My shoulders are really tense. I just realized I've been clenching my jaw this whole time. There's this knot in my stomach, and I feel... cold? It's strange because the room isn't cold, but I feel chilled, especially in my hands and feet. It's like my body is still in that fight-or-flight mode.",
    "Therapist: How does this compare to how you felt during the actual event?",
    "Client: It's... it's very similar, actually. Back then, I remember feeling frozen, like I couldn't move. My heart was pounding so hard I thought it might burst out of my chest. I felt this overwhelming urge to run away, but I couldn't. Now, it's like an echo of that. Not quite as intense, but... definitely there.",
    "Therapist: What's different about how you're handling it now?",
    "Client: Well, I... I'm able to talk about it, for one thing. Back then, I couldn't speak, couldn't even cry out. Now, even though it's difficult, I can put words to what I'm feeling. And I'm... I'm here, in this room, not there. I can remind myself of that. It's hard, but I can do it. I guess that's progress, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: Indeed. How does recognizing that progress make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of emotions, really. There's a bit of pride, I suppose. Like, hey, I've come this far. But there's also frustration. Why is it still so hard? Why do I still react so strongly? And then there's hope. If I've made it this far, maybe I can keep going. Maybe I can heal even more. It's like... a small light in all this darkness.",
    "Therapist: What do you think that light represents?",
    "Client: I think... I think it represents possibility. The possibility that I'm not doomed to always feel this way. That I can learn to manage these feelings, these reactions. Maybe even that I can help others who've been through similar things. It's like... it's like that light is showing me a path forward, even if it's still a bit dim and hard to see sometimes.",
    "Therapist: How might you carry that light with you moving forward?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to remind myself of it more often. When I'm struggling, when the memories hit hard, I need to remember that I've made progress. That I'm not that helpless child anymore. Maybe I could... I don't know, keep a journal? Write down moments when I feel stronger, when I handle things better than I used to. And maybe share more with my wife. She's always been supportive, but I tend to shut down. If I let her in more, maybe that light could grow stronger.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, to be honest. But also... lighter? Like I've set down a heavy load, even if just for a moment. The fear and sadness are still there, but they're not as overwhelming. I feel... I feel like I can breathe a little easier. It's strange, but I feel both drained and somewhat energized at the same time. Like I've run a marathon, but I can see the finish line now.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our remaining time?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to talk more about how to carry this forward. How to use what we've done today in my daily life. Maybe we could discuss some strategies for when the memories hit hard, or when I start to feel overwhelmed? I want to be able to use this experience to keep moving forward, to keep that light growing stronger.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent direction. Let's explore that."
