    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the scene?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in our old house. I'm about 8 years old. My parents are arguing in the kitchen. I can hear their voices getting louder. I'm sitting on the stairs, trying to stay hidden.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: My father's voice is getting angrier. I hear something smash - probably a plate. My mother screams. I'm frozen, my heart is racing. I want to run, but I can't move.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I hear a loud thud and my mother crying. I'm shaking now. I peek around the corner and... oh god, I see my father standing over my mother. She's on the floor, holding her face. There's blood...",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: I can't... it's too much. I feel like I'm there again. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm trying. My father sees me. His eyes are so angry. He yells at me to go to my room. I run upstairs, slam the door, and hide under my blanket. I can still hear my mother crying.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Scared. Helpless. I wish I could've done something to help her. I feel like a coward for running away.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You were just a child.",
    "Client: I know, but... I still feel guilty. I should have called someone, done something. Instead, I just lay there, crying silently, praying it would stop.",
    "Therapist: You did what you needed to survive. That's important.",
    "Client: Maybe... It's just hard to accept. The worst part is, this wasn't even the only time. It happened over and over. Each time, I felt more and more powerless.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength by facing this memory.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's difficult, but I know I need to process this. I've carried this weight for so long. Sometimes I still have nightmares about it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. How do you feel right now?",
    "Client: Drained, but also... a bit relieved? Like I've let out a secret I've been holding onto for decades. It's strange to talk about it out loud after all these years.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're doing well.",
    "Client: I keep thinking about my mother. How scared she must have been. How alone she must have felt. I wonder if she knew I was there, listening. Did she feel as helpless as I did?",
    "Therapist: These are tough questions. It's okay to explore them.",
    "Client: Yes, they are. I've never really allowed myself to think about it from her perspective before. It's painful, but also... enlightening? I feel like I understand her better now, even though she's gone.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. How does it affect you?",
    "Client: It makes me feel closer to her, in a way. But also sadder. I wish I could talk to her about it now, as an adult. Tell her it wasn't her fault. That I don't blame her for not leaving sooner.",
    "Therapist: That's a very compassionate perspective.",
    "Client: I suppose it is. I've spent so long being angry - at my father, at her, at myself. But now, I just feel... I don't know. Sad, but also like I understand better. Is that progress?",
    "Therapist: It can be. How do you feel about today's session?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... good, I think. Like I've taken a step forward. It was hard, but I'm glad we did this. Thank you for guiding me through it.",
    "Therapist: You did the hard work. Well done. Shall we end here?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that's enough for today. I feel drained, but also a bit lighter. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: It's a common experience. You've done well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm looking forward to processing this more. It's difficult, but I think it's helping. Same time next week?",
    "Therapist: Yes, I'll see you then. Take care of yourself."
