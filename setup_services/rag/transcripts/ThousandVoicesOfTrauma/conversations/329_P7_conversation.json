    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe what you're seeing?",
    "Client: I... I see my childhood home. It's evening, and I'm in the living room. My parents are arguing in the kitchen. The TV is on, but I'm not really watching it. I'm trying to listen to what they're saying.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that memory.",
    "Client: The arguing gets louder. I hear something crash - maybe a plate. My mother screams. I'm frozen on the couch, my heart is racing. I want to run and hide, but I can't move.",
    "Therapist: That sounds frightening. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: My father storms out of the kitchen. His face is red, and he's breathing heavily. He sees me on the couch and just glares at me. I can smell alcohol on him. My mother comes out crying, her cheek is red. I... I don't want to remember this.",
    "Therapist: I know it's difficult, but you're doing great. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay... My father starts yelling at me, telling me it's my fault they're fighting. He's so angry. I start crying, and that seems to make him even angrier. He grabs my arm, pulling me off the couch. It hurts so much.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Remember, you're safe now.",
    "Client: My mother tries to stop him, but he pushes her away. He's dragging me towards my room. I'm screaming, begging him to stop. I can feel my arm bruising where he's gripping it. We get to my room, and he throws me onto the bed. I'm sobbing, terrified of what's going to happen next.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: He... he starts to unbuckle his belt. I'm paralyzed with fear. My mother is pounding on the door, screaming at him to stop. But he doesn't. He... he touches me. I feel so helpless, so dirty. I want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: You're incredibly strong for sharing this. Take your time.",
    "Client: I close my eyes tight, wishing it would all go away. I can hear my mother crying outside the door. It feels like it goes on forever. When it's over, he leaves without saying a word. I curl up into a ball, shaking and crying. My mother comes in, holds me, but I can't stop shaking. I feel so betrayed, so alone.",
    "Therapist: You've shown tremendous courage. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Angry. Sad. It's like I'm that little girl again, feeling all those emotions. But... I also feel a bit relieved. Like I've finally let out something I've been holding onto for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. You did very well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was hard, but... I think I needed to face this. I've spent so long trying to forget, but maybe remembering is part of healing?",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. Shall we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. This was intense, but I'm glad we did it. Thank you for guiding me through it.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue working through this together."
