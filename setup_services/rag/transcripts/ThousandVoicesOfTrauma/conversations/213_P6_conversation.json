    "Therapist: Alright, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Can you share your initial SUDS rating before we start?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10. I'm a bit nervous, but not too bad right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay, let's proceed. Close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: (Taking a deep breath) I'm at home... It's late evening. I can hear my parents arguing in the kitchen. The shouting is getting louder. I'm in my room, trying to focus on my textbook, but I can't concentrate. My heart is starting to race...",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. I can feel my palms getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) The shouting is getting worse. I hear something crash \u2013 probably a plate. My mom screams. I want to go help, but I'm frozen. I'm shaking... I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. My chest feels tight. I can barely breathe.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Stay with the memory. What happens next?",
    "Client: (Breathing heavily) I hear my dad yelling terrible things. My mom is crying. I cover my ears, but I can still hear everything. I'm so scared he might hurt her... or come for me next.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm back there. My whole body is tense.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: (Voice breaking) I hear footsteps coming towards my room. I'm terrified. But it's my mom. She's crying, her face is red. She hugs me tight and says we need to leave. I'm relieved but so scared...",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's still at 9. I can feel my heart pounding in my ears.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What happens as you leave?",
    "Client: We quickly pack some clothes. Dad's passed out on the couch. We sneak out to the car. As we drive away, I feel... I don't know, scared but also relieved? Like we're escaping something terrible.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's coming down a bit... maybe a 7? I still feel shaky, but not as panicked.",
    "Therapist: That's good. How does the memory end?",
    "Client: We arrive at my aunt's house. She hugs us both. I feel safer, but I can't stop trembling. I keep thinking about what might happen when Dad wakes up...",
    "Therapist: Final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: (Exhaling slowly) It's down to a 5 now. I feel drained, but... okay, I guess.",
    "Therapist: You did really well. Let's debrief."
