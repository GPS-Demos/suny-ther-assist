    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Take a deep breath and describe the home invasion as vividly as you can.",
    "Client: Okay... I remember it was late at night. I was in bed, reading a book. The house was quiet, and suddenly I heard a loud crash downstairs. My heart started racing immediately.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I froze for a moment, not sure if I had imagined it. Then I heard footsteps, heavy and unfamiliar. I knew someone was in the house. I reached for my phone, but my hands were shaking so badly I could barely hold it.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I remember feeling so helpless. I couldn't think straight. I wanted to call for help, but I was afraid they would hear me. The footsteps were getting closer, coming up the stairs. I could hear them creaking...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: I... I'm sorry, it's hard to talk about this. My throat feels tight.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. Take your time.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I remember trying to control my breathing, but it felt like I couldn't get enough air. The footsteps were in the hallway now. I could see shadows under my door. I felt so trapped, so vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep describing what happened.",
    "Client: The door handle started to turn. I felt like I was going to pass out from fear. When the door opened, I saw two men. They were wearing masks. One of them had a gun. I... I can still see the light glinting off the metal.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: They demanded money and valuables. I couldn't speak at first. My voice was just... gone. When I finally managed to say something, it came out as a whisper. I told them where my wallet was, where we kept some jewelry.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. Continue.",
    "Client: One of them grabbed me roughly, pulled me out of bed. I remember the cold floor under my feet. They made me show them where everything was. I felt so ashamed, so weak. Like I should have been able to protect my home, my family.",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I know, logically. But in that moment, I felt like a failure. They ransacked the house, tearing through drawers, breaking things. I kept thinking about my wife and kids, grateful they weren't home, but also wishing I wasn't alone.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Keep going.",
    "Client: After what felt like hours, but was probably only minutes, they left. I collapsed on the floor, shaking. I couldn't move for a long time. When I finally called the police, I felt numb. Like it had happened to someone else.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great strength. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Talking about it brings back those feelings of fear and helplessness. But also... I feel a little relieved. Like I've been carrying this weight for so long, and now I'm starting to put it down.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You did well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to think about, but I think it's getting easier to talk about. I just... I wish I could forget it all sometimes.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I know it's a process, but I'm glad I'm not doing it alone. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel completely safe in my own home again.",
    "Therapist: That's a common concern. We'll address that.",
    "Client: I hope so. It's affecting my sleep, my relationships. I find myself constantly checking locks, looking over my shoulder. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: We'll work on coping strategies next session.",
    "Client: That would be helpful. I want to feel normal again, you know? To not jump at every little sound or shadow. To be able to relax in my own home.",
    "Therapist: That's a good goal. We'll get there step by step.",
    "Client: Thank you. I know it won't happen overnight, but I'm willing to put in the work. I want to reclaim my life, my sense of security.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is admirable. Let's end here for today.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you for guiding me through this. It was difficult, but I think it was necessary. I'm looking forward to our next session and learning those coping strategies.",
    "Therapist: You've done well. Take care until next time."
