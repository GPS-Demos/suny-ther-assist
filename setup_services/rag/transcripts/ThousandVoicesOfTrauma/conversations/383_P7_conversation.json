    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the incident with the police?",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. It was a warm evening, and I was walking home from work. I saw flashing lights behind me, and suddenly two officers approached. They looked aggressive, and I felt my heart racing. One of them shouted, \"Hey you! Stop right there!\" I froze, not knowing what was happening.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: They came closer, and I could smell alcohol on their breath. One officer grabbed my arm roughly, twisting it behind my back. I cried out in pain, but they ignored me. The other officer started patting me down aggressively, muttering racial slurs under his breath. I felt so helpless and scared.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I can't... It's too much. My chest feels tight, and I'm starting to sweat. I remember feeling like I couldn't breathe, just like now. They kept accusing me of something I didn't do, and no matter what I said, they wouldn't listen. I saw people walking by, but no one stopped to help.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) The officer holding my arm suddenly shoved me against the wall. My face hit the brick, and I tasted blood in my mouth. I wanted to fight back, to defend myself, but I was terrified they'd hurt me more if I did. I felt so powerless, so... small.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: They handcuffed me and threw me into the back of their patrol car. I was shaking uncontrollably, thinking about my family, wondering if I'd ever see them again. The drive to the station felt like an eternity. I kept replaying my day in my head, trying to figure out what I could have done differently to avoid this.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Continue.",
    "Client: At the station, they roughly pushed me into an interrogation room. The lights were so bright, and the room was cold. I sat there for hours, my wrists aching from the tight handcuffs. They kept coming in, asking the same questions over and over, not believing anything I said. I felt so alone and scared.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Reliving this is exhausting. But there's also a part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I'm facing it head-on instead of running from it. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: That's completely normal. You're showing great courage.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard, but I want to keep going. Eventually, after what felt like days, another officer came in. He looked at my ID and realized they had the wrong person. They'd mistaken me for a suspect in a robbery. He apologized, but it felt hollow. When they finally released me, I stumbled out into the early morning light, feeling broken and humiliated.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. How do you feel about that moment?",
    "Client: I feel angry. So, so angry. But also relieved that it's over. I remember walking home in a daze, my body aching, my mind racing. When I got home, my wife was frantic. She'd been calling hospitals and police stations all night. Seeing her face, the worry and relief, I broke down. I couldn't stop crying.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I know, but sometimes it doesn't feel that way. For weeks after, I'd have nightmares about that night. I'd wake up in a cold sweat, feeling those hands on me, hearing those slurs. I became jumpy around police cars, always looking over my shoulder. It changed me, you know? I used to feel safe in my neighborhood, but now... now I'm always on edge.",
    "Therapist: You've shown tremendous strength. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. Tired, but okay. Talking about it like this, it's hard, but it also feels like I'm taking some of its power away. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're making great progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think... I think I'm ready to stop for today. This was intense, but I'm glad we did it. I feel like I've taken a step forward, even if it's a small one.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. We'll end here."
