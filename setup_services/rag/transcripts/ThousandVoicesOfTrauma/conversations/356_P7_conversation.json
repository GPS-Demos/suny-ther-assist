    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the moment you learned about your loved one's passing?",
    "Client: It was a Tuesday morning. I was in the kitchen, making tea. The phone rang, and I answered it. It was my daughter. Her voice was shaky. She said, \"Mom, I have some bad news.\" I felt my heart start to race. She told me that my sister had passed away in her sleep. I... I couldn't believe it. We had just spoken the day before. She was fine. How could this happen?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: I felt like the room was spinning. My hands were shaking so much that I dropped the phone. I tried to pick it up, but I couldn't seem to grasp it. My daughter was still talking, but her words sounded far away. I remember sinking to the floor, my back against the kitchen cabinets. The tea kettle was whistling, but I couldn't move to turn it off. I just sat there, staring at nothing.",
    "Therapist: That's it. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: I don't know how long I sat there. Eventually, my son-in-law came over. He found me still on the kitchen floor. He helped me up and turned off the stove. I remember feeling so cold, even though it was summer. I kept asking him if it was true, if my sister was really gone. Part of me hoped it was all a mistake. But deep down, I knew it wasn't.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. What happened next?",
    "Client: The next few days were a blur. I had to fly back to my home country for the funeral. I remember packing, but I don't know what I put in my suitcase. On the plane, I kept expecting to wake up from this nightmare. When I arrived, seeing my family at the airport made it real. Their grief-stricken faces... I broke down right there in the middle of the terminal.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The funeral was... hard. In our culture, we have a three-day wake. I had to sit there, next to her body, receiving condolences. People kept telling me how strong I was, but inside I felt like I was falling apart. I wanted to scream, to tell them all to leave, but I couldn't. I just sat there, numb, going through the motions.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How did you feel during those moments?",
    "Client: I felt... angry. Angry at her for leaving me. Angry at myself for not visiting her more often. Guilty for every argument we ever had. And so, so sad. It was like a physical pain in my chest. I couldn't eat, couldn't sleep. I just wanted to turn back time, to hear her voice one more time.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are normal. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: After the funeral, I had to go back to her house to help sort through her things. That was... that was the hardest part. Seeing her clothes, her books, her unfinished knitting project. It hit me then that she was really gone. I found a birthday card she had bought for me. It wasn't even addressed yet. I... I'm sorry, I don't think I can continue.",
    "Therapist: It's okay. You've done incredibly well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still so hard to talk about. Even now, years later, the pain feels fresh. I miss her every day. Sometimes I dream about her, and for a moment when I wake up, I forget she's gone. Then reality hits, and it's like losing her all over again.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. Sad. But also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Talking about it hurts, but it also feels like I'm honoring her memory. I just wish the pain would go away completely.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. You've made great progress today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I know this process is supposed to help, but sometimes I wonder if I'll ever truly come to terms with her loss. She was more than just my sister; she was my best friend, my confidante. The world feels emptier without her in it.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's just... there are so many things I wish I had said to her. So many moments I took for granted. I keep thinking about our last conversation, trying to remember every word. I wish I had known it would be the last time we'd speak. I would have told her how much I loved her, how much she meant to me.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have those regrets. You're doing well expressing them.",
    "Client: Sometimes I feel guilty for moving on with my life. Like I'm betraying her memory by having moments of happiness. Is that normal? To feel guilty for smiling or laughing when she's no longer here to share those moments?",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are common. You're not alone in this.",
    "Client: I suppose you're right. It's just hard to shake off. I find myself talking to her sometimes, when I'm alone. Telling her about my day, asking for advice. I know she's not really there, but it makes me feel closer to her somehow. Is that... is that crazy?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. Many people do that. It's a coping mechanism.",
    "Client: That's reassuring to hear. I've never told anyone about that before. I was afraid they'd think I was losing my mind. It's just... sometimes the grief hits me out of nowhere. I'll be fine one moment, and the next, I'm overwhelmed by sadness. Does it ever really get easier?",
    "Therapist: Grief is a process. You're navigating it well.",
    "Client: I hope so. I'm trying to focus on the good memories, the happy times we shared. But it's hard when those memories are tinged with the pain of loss. I keep wishing for one more conversation, one more hug. I know it's impossible, but that doesn't stop the longing.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. You're processing your grief.",
    "Client: Thank you for listening. For not judging me. It helps to talk about her, to keep her memory alive. I just hope that one day, thinking about her will bring more smiles than tears. That's what she would have wanted, I think. She always did hate to see me cry.",
    "Therapist: That's a beautiful sentiment. We'll end here for today.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you again. This was difficult, but I think it was necessary. I feel... I don't know, maybe a little closer to acceptance? It's a long road, I know, but I'm glad I'm not walking it alone."
