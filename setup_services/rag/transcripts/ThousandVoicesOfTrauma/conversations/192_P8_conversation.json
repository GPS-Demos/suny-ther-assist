    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is buzzing, you know? My hands are shaky, and I can feel my heart racing. That memory of the refugee camp, it just... it brought everything back so vividly. The smells, the sounds, the fear...",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: It's a jumble, honestly. I keep thinking about how helpless I felt back then. How I couldn't protect my family, couldn't even provide basic necessities. And then I feel guilty because we made it out, but so many others didn't. It's like... survivor's guilt, I guess?",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. How does that guilt feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like a heavy weight on my chest. Makes it hard to breathe sometimes. And there's this knot in my stomach that just won't go away. I know logically that it's not my fault, but emotionally... it's hard to shake off that feeling, you know?",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I... I keep seeing flashes of faces. People I met in the camp, people I lost. There was this little girl, couldn't have been more than five or six. She reminded me so much of my niece. I gave her my last piece of bread one day, and the look on her face... God, I wonder what happened to her. Did she make it out? Is she okay? It's driving me crazy not knowing.",
    "Therapist: How does thinking about her make you feel?",
    "Client: Sad. Angry. Hopeful, maybe? It's complicated. I feel this deep sadness for all the innocence lost, all the potential cut short. But there's also this anger at the world for letting it happen. And then... I don't know, maybe a tiny bit of hope? Like, if she made it out, maybe she's living a better life now. Maybe something good came out of all that suffering.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to process. What's the strongest emotion you're feeling right now?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's fear. Not just for myself, but for everyone I care about. Going through that experience, it's like... it shattered my sense of safety, you know? Even now, years later, living in a safe country, I can't shake this feeling that everything could be taken away in an instant. It's exhausting, always being on edge like that.",
    "Therapist: How does that fear affect your daily life?",
    "Client: It's... it's everywhere. I have trouble sleeping because I'm always listening for danger. I get anxious in crowded places, always looking for exits. And relationships? God, they're so hard. I want to let people in, but there's always this voice in the back of my head saying, \"Don't get too close. You might lose them.\" It's like I'm still living in survival mode, even though the danger has passed.",
    "Therapist: What do you think might help you feel safer?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe talking about it more? I've kept so much of this bottled up for so long. It's hard to open up, but at the same time, it feels like a relief to finally put it into words. And maybe... maybe connecting with others who've been through similar experiences? I've always felt so alone in this, like no one could really understand. But I know that's not true. There are others out there who've been through this too.",
    "Therapist: That's a great insight. How does it feel to consider reaching out?",
    "Client: It's scary, honestly. Opening up, being vulnerable... it goes against everything I've trained myself to do to survive. But at the same time, there's this tiny spark of... I don't know, hope maybe? Like maybe if I can connect with others, share our stories, it might help ease this burden a little. And maybe... maybe I could even help someone else feel less alone in their struggle. That thought... it makes me feel a little stronger, a little more purposeful.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you could take in that direction?",
    "Client: I... I guess I could look into support groups for refugees in the area. Maybe just attend a meeting, even if I don't say anything at first. Just being around others who've been through similar experiences... it might help me feel less isolated. And who knows, maybe eventually I'll feel comfortable sharing my own story.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive plan. How are you feeling now compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: It's strange... I feel drained, like I've run a marathon. But at the same time, there's this sense of... I don't know, lightness? Like I've put down a heavy backpack I've been carrying for years. I know I still have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this. It's a small thing, but it feels... significant.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful shift. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to explore more about how to manage these intense emotions day-to-day. And maybe... maybe we could talk more about how to start opening up to others? It's scary, but after today, I feel like it might be worth the risk. Is that... is that something we could work on?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll continue this journey together. How are you feeling about ending for today?",
    "Client: I'm okay, I think. A bit raw, but also... hopeful? It's been intense, but I'm glad we did this. Thank you for... for creating a safe space for me to open up. I know it's your job and all, but it means a lot. I'm looking forward to our next session, even if it's a bit scary. Is it weird to say I feel both exhausted and energized at the same time?",
    "Therapist: Not weird at all. It's a common reaction. Take care of yourself this week, and we'll pick up here next time.",
    "Client: Thank you. I will. See you next week."
