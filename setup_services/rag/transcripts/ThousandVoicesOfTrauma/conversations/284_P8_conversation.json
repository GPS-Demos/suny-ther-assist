    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is buzzing, but my mind is foggy. The memory of that night, the home invasion... it's so vivid now. I can still hear the sound of glass breaking downstairs. My heart is racing just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's like I'm right back there, frozen in my bed, listening to those footsteps coming up the stairs. I feel so... helpless. Like a child again, you know? It's ridiculous, I'm a grown man, but in that moment, I felt like that neglected little boy all over again.",
    "Therapist: How does that fear manifest in your body?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, like I can't get enough air. My hands are clammy, and there's this knot in my stomach. It's like my body is preparing to run, but I'm just sitting here. I keep glancing at the door, even though I know we're safe here.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why didn't I do something?\" I should have protected my family. I'm the man of the house, but I just... froze. And then I think about my childhood, how no one ever protected me. It's like I'm failing my family the same way my parents failed me. God, saying that out loud... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts make you feel?",
    "Client: Ashamed. Angry at myself. But also... sad. There's this deep sadness, like I'm mourning for both the child I was and the protector I couldn't be. It's a heavy feeling, right in the center of my chest.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to hide, to curl up and disappear. But another part... I think I need to feel strong again. To remind myself that I survived, that my family is safe now. Maybe I need to forgive that scared little boy inside me, tell him it wasn't his fault.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to acknowledge that need?",
    "Client: It's... strangely comforting. Like a weight is lifting, just a little. I've spent so long being angry at myself, I never considered that maybe I needed compassion instead. It's a foreign feeling, but... I think it's good.",
    "Therapist: What's different now compared to when we started?",
    "Client: I feel... more present. The fear is still there, but it's not consuming me like it was before. I'm aware of the room, of you, of my breath. It's like I'm starting to separate the past from the present. The memory is still vivid, but I'm here now, not there. It's... it's progress, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: Indeed. How do you want to care for yourself after this session?",
    "Client: I think... I want to call my wife. Just hear her voice, remind myself that we're okay. And maybe take a walk, feel the sun on my face. Ground myself in the present. Is that... is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How are you feeling about our progress today?",
    "Client: I'm... cautiously optimistic. It was intense, reliving that memory. But I feel like I understand myself a bit better now. The connection between my past and how I reacted during the invasion... it's becoming clearer. It's not easy, but I think I'm on the right path. Thank you for... for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. We'll continue next week?",
    "Client: Yes, definitely. I'm nervous about what might come up, but I'm also... I'm ready to keep going. To keep healing. Thank you, really. I'll see you next week.",
    "Therapist: Take care, and remember to be gentle with yourself."
