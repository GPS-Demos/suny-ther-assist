    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to do this, but another part is terrified. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0-100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: Um... probably around 60? Yeah, 60.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we're here to help you process this. Are you ready to begin the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I think so. Just... give me a second to breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. When you're ready, close your eyes and describe where you are.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... I'm... I'm in my old bedroom. It's night, and I can hear the crickets outside. The room is dark, but there's a bit of moonlight coming through the window. I'm lying in bed, trying to sleep, but I'm restless.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear... I hear footsteps in the hallway. They're slow, deliberate. My heart starts racing because I know... I know it's him. Oh god, I can't do this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Remember, you're safe here. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 75. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath with me. In through your nose, out through your mouth. Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *shaky breath* The door creaks open. I pretend to be asleep, but I can smell the alcohol on his breath. He... he sits on the edge of my bed. I want to scream, but I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with the memory. What do you see, hear, or feel?",
    "Client: His hand... it's on my leg. I can feel the weight of it. I'm shaking, but I'm trying not to move. Maybe if I stay still, he'll leave. But he doesn't. He... he starts to pull down my pajama bottoms. I want to fight, but I'm so scared.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now, Sarah. This is just a memory. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's 90. I feel sick.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. Ground yourself in the present. Feel your feet on the floor. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *sobbing* He... he touches me. His hands are rough, and they hurt. I can smell beer and cigarettes. I'm crying silently, hoping my mom will hear, but she never does. It feels like it lasts forever.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: Eventually, he... he finishes. He leaves without saying a word. I lie there, feeling dirty and ashamed. I want to wash, but I'm afraid to move. I just cry into my pillow until I fall asleep.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's still high... maybe 85? I feel shaky and nauseous.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you name five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: Um... the blue chair, the plant in the corner, your desk, the clock on the wall, and the tissue box.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, can you continue with the memory? What happened the next morning?",
    "Client: I... I woke up feeling sore and confused. For a moment, I thought it was just a nightmare. But then I saw the bruises on my legs. I felt so ashamed. I put on long pants and a sweater, even though it was summer.",
    "Therapist: How did you cope with those feelings?",
    "Client: I didn't really. I just... shut down. I stopped talking to my friends. I couldn't concentrate in school. I started having nightmares every night. But I never told anyone. I was too scared and ashamed.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Sarah. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 70. I still feel shaky, but not as bad as before.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Let's continue. How did this experience affect your daily life in the following weeks?",
    "Client: I became hypervigilant. I couldn't sleep without checking the locks on my door multiple times. I started sleeping with the lights on. I couldn't stand being touched by anyone, even my mom. I... I started cutting myself to cope with the pain inside.",
    "Therapist: I'm sorry you went through that, Sarah. You're very brave for sharing this. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. But also, kind of relieved? Like a weight is lifting. My SUDS is probably around 60 now.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Processing trauma is hard work. Let's take a few deep breaths together.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... I'm feeling a bit calmer now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Can you tell me about a specific moment when you felt particularly affected by this trauma?",
    "Client: There was this time... about a month after it happened. I was at school, in PE class. We were playing volleyball, and a boy accidentally bumped into me. I completely freaked out. I started screaming and crying. Everyone was staring at me. I ran out of the gym and locked myself in a bathroom stall for hours.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a difficult moment. How did you handle it?",
    "Client: I... I didn't, really. I just shut down again. I stopped going to PE after that. My grades started slipping. I think that's when my mom started to realize something was really wrong, but I still couldn't tell her.",
    "Therapist: You were dealing with a lot on your own. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's around 55. I feel... I don't know, kind of empty?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Empty can be a form of emotional exhaustion. Let's ground ourselves again. Can you tell me three things you can hear right now?",
    "Client: Um... the ticking of the clock, traffic outside, and... my own breathing.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, can you describe how this experience has affected your relationships?",
    "Client: It's... it's made everything harder. I have trouble trusting people, especially men. Intimacy is really difficult for me. Even with my current boyfriend, I sometimes freeze up when we're close. I feel guilty all the time, like I'm broken or damaged goods.",
    "Therapist: Those are common feelings for survivors, Sarah. But remember, what happened wasn't your fault. How does it feel to say that out loud?",
    "Client: It's... hard. Part of me still feels like I should have done something, said something. But... it wasn't my fault. *deep breath* It wasn't my fault.",
    "Therapist: That's right. It wasn't your fault. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 45. I feel... lighter, somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Sarah. Now, can you tell me about a time when you felt strong or resilient despite this trauma?",
    "Client: There was this moment... about a year after it happened. I was at a support group for survivors. It was the first time I'd ever spoken about it out loud. I was terrified, but I did it. And afterwards, this older woman came up to me and hugged me. She said I was brave. For the first time, I felt like maybe I could heal.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful memory. How does it feel to recall that moment?",
    "Client: It feels... good. Hopeful. Like maybe I'm not broken after all.",
    "Therapist: You're not broken, Sarah. You're a survivor. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to 30. I feel... I don't know, kind of proud of myself?",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You've done incredible work today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted, but... I feel like I've taken a step forward. Like maybe I can actually get through this.",
    "Therapist: You absolutely can. You've shown tremendous strength today. Let's end with some deep breathing exercises to help you relax.",
    "Client: Okay. *deep breaths* Thank you... for helping me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Sarah. Remember, healing is a journey, and you're making great progress. We'll continue to work through this together."
