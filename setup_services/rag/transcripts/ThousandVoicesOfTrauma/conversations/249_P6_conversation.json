    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Ali. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the memory.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm back at the cult compound. It's a warm evening, and I can smell incense in the air. The leader is speaking, his voice echoing through the hall. I... I see my daughter sitting next to me, her eyes glazed over, completely entranced by his words.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4. I feel tense, but it's manageable.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue.",
    "Client: The leader is talking about sacrifice, about giving up everything for the cause. I feel a knot forming in my stomach. My daughter reaches for my hand, and I... I want to pull away, but I don't. I'm scared of what might happen if I show any doubt.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 6. My heart is racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: (Voice shaking) The leader is pointing at people now, selecting them for a special \"cleansing\" ritual. I'm terrified he'll choose my daughter. I can feel sweat trickling down my back. The room feels so hot and crowded. I... I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's an 8 now. I feel like I'm back there, helpless and scared.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Remember, this is just a memory.",
    "Client: (Nods) Right, right. Okay... The leader's gaze falls on us. He's walking towards our row. My daughter's grip on my hand tightens. I want to run, to grab her and leave, but I'm frozen in place. He stops in front of us, and I... I can smell his cologne. It makes me nauseous.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) It's... it's a 9. I feel sick. My chest is so tight.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it if you can.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) He... he points at my daughter. Says she's been chosen. I feel like I'm going to pass out. The room is spinning. I can hear my daughter's excited gasp, but all I feel is terror. I... I let go of her hand. I let her go. (Starts crying) I failed her. I should have protected her.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS now?",
    "Client: (Through tears) It's a 10. I can't... I can't bear it.",
    "Therapist: You're incredibly brave. Let's take a moment. Breathe with me.",
    "Client: (Breathing deeply) Okay... okay. It's... it's starting to fade a little.",
    "Therapist: Good. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Drained. Guilty. But... also a bit relieved. Like I've let something out that's been trapped for years.",
