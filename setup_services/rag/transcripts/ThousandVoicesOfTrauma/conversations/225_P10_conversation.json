    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm feeling a bit jittery, to be honest. My hands are a bit clammy.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. How would you rate your distress from 0 to 100?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 60? My stomach's in knots.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we're here together. Take a deep breath, and when you're ready, describe the cyberbullying incident as if it's happening now.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm... I'm sitting at my desk at home. It's late, maybe 11 PM. The room is dark except for the glow of my laptop screen. I'm scrolling through my social media feed, and suddenly I see a notification. Someone's tagged me in a post.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you notice?",
    "Client: My heart starts racing. I... I click on the notification, and it takes me to this horrible photoshopped picture of me. They've put my face on some... some overweight, naked body. The comments are flooding in. People are laughing, calling me disgusting names.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's happening in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. I can't... can't seem to catch my breath. My hands are shaking as I scroll through the comments. I feel so exposed, so violated.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 75. God, this feels so real.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I try to delete the post, but I can't. More and more people are sharing it. I see names of people I know, people I thought were my friends. They're all laughing at me. I feel so alone, so betrayed.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking that I want to disappear. I want to crawl into a hole and never come out. I feel so ashamed, like everyone's seen me naked, vulnerable. I keep refreshing the page, hoping it'll go away, but it just gets worse.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I start getting private messages. Some are from concerned friends, but others... they're so cruel. People I've never even met are sending me horrible messages, telling me I should kill myself, that I'm worthless. I can't stop crying. My whole body is shaking.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I shut my laptop, but I can still hear the notification sounds from my phone. It's like this constant reminder that my life is falling apart. I curl up in my bed, pulling the covers over my head. I feel so small, so powerless.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's at 85. I feel like I can't escape it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Remember, you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see that image. I keep imagining people at work, on the street, looking at me and knowing. I feel so exposed. The night seems to stretch on forever. I keep checking my phone, and it's just getting worse. More shares, more comments. It's like watching my life unravel in real-time.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I'm thinking that I can never show my face in public again. That I'll have to quit my job, move away. I'm wondering how I'll explain this to my parents, my partner. I feel like I've let everyone down, like I'm dirty somehow.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The sun starts to come up, and I haven't slept at all. I feel physically ill, like I might throw up. My head is pounding. I... I consider calling in sick to work, but I know I'll have to face this eventually. I drag myself to the shower, but I can barely look at myself in the mirror. I feel so ashamed of my body, even though I know the picture wasn't real.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still around 85. My stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Keep breathing. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I force myself to get dressed and go to work. The whole time, I feel like everyone's staring at me, judging me. I can barely focus on my tasks. My boss asks if I'm okay, and I nearly break down crying. I spend most of the day hiding in the bathroom, checking my phone. The post is still there, still spreading.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling physically at this point?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. Exhausted. My shoulders are so tense they're aching. I have a knot in my stomach that won't go away. I keep getting hot flashes, like waves of panic washing over me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I finally break down and tell a coworker what's happening. She's sympathetic, but I can see the pity in her eyes. It makes me feel even worse. I leave work early, feeling like a failure. On the way home, I'm paranoid that everyone on the street has seen the picture, that they're all judging me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 70. Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also a relief somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Keep going. What happens when you get home?",
    "Client: I... I collapse on my couch. I feel so drained, so defeated. I finally work up the courage to call my partner. As I'm explaining what happened, I start sobbing uncontrollably. I can barely get the words out. They're supportive, but I can hear the shock in their voice. It makes me feel so ashamed.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking that I've ruined everything. That my partner will never look at me the same way again. That everyone I know will always associate me with this horrible, fake picture. I feel like my whole identity has been stolen from me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I spend the rest of the evening in a daze. I can't eat, can't focus on anything. I keep checking my phone, even though I know it'll only make me feel worse. I feel so isolated, like I'm trapped in this bubble of shame and fear. I don't know how I'll ever face the world again.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 65. Talking about it... it's still painful, but it doesn't feel quite as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How are you feeling right now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling drained, but also a little relieved. It's like... like I've been carrying this weight around, and now I've set it down for a moment. It's still there, but it's not crushing me anymore.",
    "Therapist: You've done an incredible job today, Sarah. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay... *takes deep breaths* Thank you. This was hard, but... but I think it helped.",
    "Therapist: You showed great courage today. We'll continue to work through this together."
