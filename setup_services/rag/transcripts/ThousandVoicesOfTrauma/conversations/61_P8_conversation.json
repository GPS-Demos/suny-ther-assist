    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I'm back there, you know? The smell of incense, the chanting... It's all so vivid. I can feel the weight of those robes we had to wear. It's suffocating.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What emotions are coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: Anger. Definitely anger. And shame. I can't believe I let myself get sucked into that cult. I was so naive, so desperate for belonging after my wife passed. I should've known better.",
    "Therapist: It sounds like you're being quite hard on yourself.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess I am. It's just... I lost so much time, you know? Years of my life, dedicated to their twisted beliefs. And the worst part is, I dragged my kids into it too. God, what kind of father does that? I remember my daughter's face when I told her we were joining. She was so confused, so scared. But I ignored it. I was too caught up in my own pain to see hers.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice in your body as you recall that memory?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. Really tight. And my hands are clammy. I feel this urge to run, to get away. But there's nowhere to go, is there? I can't escape what I've done.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What thoughts are accompanying it?",
    "Client: I... I keep hearing the leader's voice in my head. He'd always say, \"Your family is here now. Forget the outside world.\" And I believed him. I actually believed him. How could I have been so stupid? I let him isolate us, cut us off from everyone we knew. My poor kids... they missed out on so much because of me.",
    "Therapist: How do you think this experience has affected your relationships now?",
    "Client: It's... it's complicated. I'm closer to my kids now, in a way. We've been through so much together. But there's always this undercurrent of... I don't know, mistrust? Like they're waiting for me to make another huge mistake. And with others, I'm always on guard. I find it hard to open up, to let people in. I'm afraid of being manipulated again, I guess.",
    "Therapist: That makes sense, given what you've been through.",
    "Client: Yeah... And you know what's really messed up? Sometimes I miss it. Not the cult itself, but the certainty. Everything was so black and white there. Now, the world feels so... chaotic. Unpredictable. I don't always know how to navigate it.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with that uncertainty?",
    "Client: I... I try to focus on what I can control. My job, my home. I've been reading a lot, trying to educate myself on critical thinking. And therapy, of course. But sometimes it feels like I'm just pretending to be normal, you know? Like I'm an impostor in my own life.",
    "Therapist: That sounds challenging. What helps you feel more grounded?",
    "Client: My kids, honestly. Watching them grow, seeing them thrive now that we're out... it reminds me why I fought so hard to leave. And my work. I throw myself into it. It's something I'm good at, something that's mine. No one can take that away from me.",
    "Therapist: It sounds like you've found some powerful anchors.",
    "Client: I guess I have. It's just... sometimes the guilt overwhelms everything else. I look at my coworkers, my neighbors, and I think, \"If they knew what I'd done, what I'd been part of...\" It's like I'm carrying this secret shame all the time.",
    "Therapist: How does carrying that shame affect your daily life?",
    "Client: It's exhausting. I'm always on edge, always worried someone will find out. I avoid social situations when I can. When I do go out, I'm hyper-aware of everything I say and do. I'm terrified of slipping up, of saying something that might reveal my past. It's like I can never fully relax.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly draining.",
    "Client: It is. And the worst part is, I know it's holding me back. There are opportunities I don't take, relationships I don't pursue, because I'm so afraid of being exposed. But then I think, don't I deserve this? After what I put my family through, maybe this is my punishment.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to forgive yourself?",
    "Client: Forgive myself? I... I don't know if I can. Or if I should. It feels like if I forgive myself, I'm saying what I did was okay. And it wasn't. It was so far from okay.",
    "Therapist: Forgiveness doesn't mean condoning. What else might it mean?",
    "Client: I... I guess it could mean accepting that I made a terrible mistake, but that I'm not that person anymore. That I've learned and grown. But it's hard. It's so hard to let go of the guilt. It's been my companion for so long.",
    "Therapist: What small step could you take towards self-compassion?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I could try to talk to myself the way I talk to my kids when they make mistakes. I'm always telling them it's okay to mess up, that what matters is how we learn from it. But it's so much harder to apply that to myself.",
    "Therapist: That's a great insight. How does that idea sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... uncomfortable. But also kind of relieving? Like maybe there's a way forward that doesn't involve beating myself up forever. I don't know if I'm ready for it yet, but... maybe someday.",
    "Therapist: That openness is a big step. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. Really drained. But also... lighter, somehow? Like I've put down a heavy load, even if it's just for a moment. Thank you for listening, for not judging. It means more than you know.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll end here for today. Take care of yourself."
