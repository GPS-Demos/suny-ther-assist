    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. Going through that memory again, it's like I was right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sounds, I think. The constant hum of traffic outside, mixed with the muffled voices from the other rooms. It's like... it's like they're etched into my brain. And the smell of cigarette smoke. God, I can still smell it now. It makes me feel sick.",
    "Therapist: How did reliving those sensations affect you?",
    "Client: It made me feel helpless all over again. Like I was that scared kid, trapped and alone. I kept thinking, \"Why didn't I try harder to escape?\" But then I remember how big they were, how threatening. I... I just froze.",
    "Therapist: It's common to freeze in traumatic situations. How do you feel about that reaction now?",
    "Client: I guess... I guess it makes sense. I was just a kid, and they were adults. But part of me still feels guilty, you know? Like maybe if I'd been braver or smarter, things would've been different.",
    "Therapist: That's a heavy burden to carry. How does it relate to your current struggles?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's why I have such a hard time trusting people now. Especially authority figures. And why I'm always on edge, always expecting the worst. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: You're making important connections. How might addressing these feelings impact your life?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I could start to relax a little? Stop always looking over my shoulder? I don't know, it's hard to imagine feeling safe, but I want to. I really want to.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful goal. What's one small step you could take towards it?",
    "Client: Um... maybe trying to open up more to my girlfriend? She's always saying I keep her at arm's length. It's just... it's scary to be vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: That's a brave step. How do you feel about trying that?",
    "Client: Nervous, definitely. But also... kind of hopeful? Like maybe things can actually get better. Is that... is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Hope is a crucial part of healing. What else came up for you during the exposure?",
    "Client: I noticed... I noticed I was angry. Really angry. At the traffickers, obviously, but also at the world in general. For letting this happen. For not protecting kids like me.",
    "Therapist: Anger is a natural response. How does it manifest in your daily life?",
    "Client: I guess I can be pretty irritable sometimes. Snap at people for no reason. And I've been avoiding looking for work because the idea of having a boss... it just makes me so mad.",
    "Therapist: How might addressing this anger help you move forward?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I could start to let go of some of this resentment? It's not doing me any good, I know that. And if I could manage my anger better, maybe I'd feel more ready to rejoin the workforce.",
    "Therapist: That's insightful. What support do you need to work on this?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to learn some better coping strategies. Ways to calm down when I'm feeling triggered. And maybe... maybe I need to start talking about this stuff more. Not just here, but with my family too.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent ideas. How do you feel about today's session overall?",
    "Client: It was tough, really tough. But... I don't know, I feel like I understand myself a bit better now? Like I can see how my past is affecting my present. It's painful, but it's also... clarifying, I guess?",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to work more on that anger. And maybe start exploring ways to feel safer in my relationships. Is that... is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're steering your healing journey. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired. Really, really tired. But also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've put down a bit of the weight I've been carrying. It's a weird feeling.",
    "Therapist: It's a positive step. How will you take care of yourself for the rest of the day?",
    "Client: I think I'll take a long shower when I get home. Maybe watch a comfort movie. And I might... I might try to talk to my girlfriend a little. Nothing big, just... just let her in a bit. Is that good?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a wonderful plan. You've done great work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe I can do this. Maybe I can actually heal.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. We'll continue this journey together.",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, okay. I'm... I'm actually looking forward to our next session. Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It shows your commitment to healing. Anything else before we wrap up?",
    "Client: No, I think... I think I'm good. Just... thank you. For listening, for helping me make sense of all this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
