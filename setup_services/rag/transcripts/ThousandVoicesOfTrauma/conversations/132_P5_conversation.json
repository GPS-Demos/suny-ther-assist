    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do. I've been having more nightmares lately about that incident with the police. It's been hard to shake off.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you ready to discuss it?",
    "Client: I think so. What exactly does that mean, though? It sounds a bit intimidating.",
    "Therapist: It involves recounting the traumatic event in detail. How does that sound to you?",
    "Client: Oh... that's... that's going to be tough. I've been trying so hard not to think about it. The idea of purposely bringing it up makes my heart race. Is this really necessary?",
    "Therapist: It can be challenging, but it's a crucial step in healing. What concerns you most?",
    "Client: I'm worried I'll fall apart or have a panic attack. What if I can't handle it? And... I'm scared of reliving those feelings of helplessness and fear. It was such a horrible experience.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace and I'll support you throughout.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I trust you, but it's still scary. How exactly will this help me? I mean, I've been trying to forget, not remember more vividly.",
    "Therapist: By facing the memory, we can process it and reduce its power over you. Does that make sense?",
    "Client: I suppose so. It's like facing a fear head-on instead of avoiding it? That's hard to wrap my head around, but I'm willing to try if you think it'll help.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. Your courage is admirable. Shall we set some guidelines for the session?",
    "Client: Yes, please. That would make me feel more in control. What did you have in mind?",
    "Therapist: We'll use a signal if you need a break. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's good. Maybe I could just raise my hand if I need to stop? And... is it okay if I cry? I'm worried I might not be able to hold it together.",
    "Therapist: Raising your hand works perfectly. And yes, any emotion is welcome here.",
    "Client: Okay, that helps. I'm still nervous, but I feel a bit more prepared now. How long will this take? And will we do this every session from now on?",
    "Therapist: We'll spend about 30-45 minutes on it today. We'll continue in future sessions as needed.",
    "Client: That's longer than I expected, but I guess it needs to be thorough. Will you guide me through it or do I just... start talking?",
    "Therapist: I'll guide you with questions. Remember, you're in control throughout.",
    "Client: Alright. I appreciate your support. I'm scared, but also... maybe a little hopeful? If this can help me move past what happened and stop the nightmares, it'll be worth it. I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: Your willingness to engage is a big step. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do this. I know it won't be easy, but I'm committed to getting better. Where should I start? The day it happened, or...?",
    "Therapist: Start with the moment just before the incident. Describe what you see and feel."
