    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. I can still hear the explosions, you know? It's like they're echoing in my head. And my heart... it's beating so fast. I feel... I feel scared, but also angry. Why did this have to happen to me?",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Anger. Definitely anger. It's like this burning sensation in my chest. I'm angry at the situation, angry at the people who caused this, angry at myself for not being able to do more. And... and I'm angry that I can't seem to let it go. It's been years, but it still feels so fresh, you know?",
    "Therapist: How does that anger manifest in your body?",
    "Client: My jaw is clenched, my fists are tight. I feel this tension in my shoulders, like I'm ready to fight. But there's nothing to fight here. It's... it's exhausting. And then there's this knot in my stomach. It's like a mix of anger and fear. I keep thinking about what happened, and I wonder if I could have done something differently.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep replaying that moment when the IED went off. The sound, the dust, the screams... It's all so vivid. And then I think about my buddies who didn't make it. I feel guilty for surviving. Why me? Why did I get to come home when they didn't? And then... then I think about how I can't seem to move on. I'm back home, but I'm not really living, you know? I'm just... existing.",
    "Therapist: How do these memories impact your daily life?",
    "Client: They're always there, lurking in the background. Sometimes, I'll be doing something normal, like grocery shopping, and suddenly I'll hear a loud noise and I'm right back there. My heart starts racing, I start sweating. It's embarrassing. And then there's the nightmares. I'm afraid to go to sleep sometimes because I know I'll wake up in a cold sweat, feeling like I'm back in that moment.",
    "Therapist: What helps you feel grounded when these memories surface?",
    "Client: I... I try to focus on my breathing. In and out, slow and steady. Sometimes I'll touch something nearby, like a wall or a table, just to remind myself where I am. And... and I try to think about the present. Like, what I need to do that day, or what's happening around me. It doesn't always work, but it helps sometimes.",
    "Therapist: How do you see these experiences shaping your future?",
    "Client: I don't know... Sometimes I feel like I'll never be normal again. Like I'll always be this broken version of myself. But then... then I think about how I've survived this far. Maybe... maybe I can use this somehow. To help others, or to make a difference. I just... I want to feel like myself again, you know? I want to be able to live without constantly looking over my shoulder.",
    "Therapist: What would feeling like yourself again look like?",
    "Client: I guess... being able to enjoy things again. To laugh without feeling guilty. To sleep through the night without nightmares. To be able to form relationships without pushing people away. And... and to feel like I have a purpose. Something more than just surviving day to day. I want to feel hopeful about the future, you know?",
    "Therapist: How has sharing these feelings impacted you?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. Talking about it brings everything back. But... but it also feels like a weight is lifting, you know? Like maybe I'm not alone in this. And maybe... maybe there's hope. It's scary, but also... I don't know, maybe a little freeing? Like I'm finally acknowledging everything instead of trying to push it down.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you could take towards that vision of yourself?",
    "Client: I... I guess maybe I could try to reconnect with some of my old friends. The ones who knew me before all this. Maybe... maybe that could help me remember who I used to be. And... and maybe I could look into some volunteer work. Something that makes me feel useful, you know? It's scary to think about, but... but maybe it's a start.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that idea?",
    "Client: It's... it's terrifying, honestly. But also... maybe a little exciting? Like, for the first time in a long time, I feel like there might be a way forward. It's not going to be easy, I know that. But... but maybe it's possible. Maybe I'm not as stuck as I thought I was. I don't know... it's a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: What support do you need to take those steps?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need someone to hold me accountable. Someone who understands what I'm going through. Maybe... maybe a support group? And... and I think I need to keep coming here, to therapy. It's hard, but it's helping. And... and maybe I need to be honest with my family about what I'm going through. They want to help, I know they do. I've just been pushing them away.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to identify these needs?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. But also... kind of empowering? Like, for the first time, I feel like I have some control. Like maybe I'm not just a victim of my circumstances. It's scary to think about actually doing these things, but... but it also feels like the right direction. Like maybe... maybe there's a path forward.",
    "Therapist: What's your takeaway from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'm realizing that healing isn't linear. It's not going to be easy, and there will be setbacks. But... but maybe that's okay. Maybe I don't have to be perfect. Maybe it's enough to just keep trying, to keep moving forward, even if it's just a little bit at a time. And... and I'm not alone in this. There are people who want to help. I just... I need to let them in.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. Emotionally drained. But... but also, I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like maybe there's a glimmer of hope. It's small, but it's there. And that... that feels good. Scary, but good. Thank you for listening, for helping me work through this. I know we have a long way to go, but... but I think I'm ready to keep trying.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. We'll continue next session."
