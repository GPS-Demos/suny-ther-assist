    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Thompson. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Oh, hello Dr. Carter. I'm... well, I'm a bit apprehensive, to be honest. My arthritis is acting up today, and I'm not sure how well I'll manage with the memories we'll be discussing.",
    "Therapist: I understand. We'll take it slowly. Are you ready to begin the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I suppose so. It's just... thinking about that day brings back so many difficult emotions. But I know it's important for my progress.",
    "Therapist: That's right. Remember, you're safe here. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 5 out of 10 right now. My hands are a bit shaky.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and take us back to that day of the earthquake. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I'm in my kitchen. The sun is streaming through the window, and I'm preparing lunch for my husband. Suddenly, the ground starts to shake. At first, it's gentle, but then... oh God, it gets so much stronger. The dishes in the cupboard start rattling, and I can hear things falling off shelves in other rooms.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm terrified. My heart is racing, and I can't seem to catch my breath. I... I try to move towards the doorway like they always tell you to do, but my legs feel like jelly. The shaking is so violent now. I can hear the house creaking and groaning around me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: The power goes out, and I'm plunged into darkness. I can hear glass shattering somewhere, and there's this awful rumbling sound. I'm frozen in place, gripping the kitchen counter. I'm calling out for my husband, but my voice sounds so small against the noise of the earthquake.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to a 7, I think. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here with me, and you're safe. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay. The shaking seems to go on forever. I can smell dust in the air, and there's a creaking sound above me that makes me think the roof might cave in. I'm... I'm so scared I might die here, alone in my kitchen. I keep thinking about my children, my grandchildren... will I ever see them again?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What do you notice in your body?",
    "Client: My... my hands are clenched so tightly they hurt. My whole body is tense, and I feel like I can't breathe properly. There's this crushing weight on my chest.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: Finally, the shaking starts to subside. But I'm too afraid to move. What if there's an aftershock? I can hear car alarms going off outside, and people shouting. The air is thick with dust, and I can taste it in my mouth. I'm coughing, trying to clear my lungs.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I need to find my husband. But I'm scared to move. What if the house isn't stable? What if he's hurt? I feel so helpless, so vulnerable. I've never felt so old and frail in my life.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's still at a 7. My hands are shaking just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I finally gather the courage to move. I'm calling out for John, my voice hoarse and shaky. As I make my way through the house, I see the destruction. Picture frames have fallen, there's broken glass everywhere. Our beautiful home... it's in shambles. And then I hear John calling back to me from outside. The relief... it's overwhelming. I start crying as I carefully make my way to the front door.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens when you get outside?",
    "Client: The street... it's chaos. Some of the houses have partially collapsed. There are people everywhere, looking shell-shocked. I see my neighbors, the Wilsons, huddled together on their lawn. Their youngest, little Emily, is crying. And then I see John, and I just... I break down. We hold each other, and for a moment, nothing else matters. We're alive.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of emotions. Relief, fear, gratitude... My SUDS is maybe down to a 6 now. But I still feel shaky.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're doing great. What happens next?",
    "Client: We spend the next few hours in a daze. There are sirens everywhere, and we can hear helicopters overhead. We try to help our neighbors where we can. The Johnsons next door, their son is trapped under a fallen bookcase. John and I help get him out. He's okay, thank goodness. But others... others aren't so lucky.",
    "Therapist: How does helping others make you feel?",
    "Client: It... it gives me a sense of purpose. Like I'm not completely helpless. But at the same time, I feel guilty. Why were we spared when others weren't? It doesn't seem fair.",
    "Therapist: Those are common feelings after a disaster. Continue with what you remember.",
    "Client: As night falls, it becomes clear we can't stay in the house. It might not be structurally sound. We gather what we can - some clothes, water, our emergency kit. We end up sleeping in our car that night, along with half the neighborhood. I remember looking up at the stars, feeling so small and insignificant. The world had changed in just a few minutes.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 5, I think. Talking about it... it's hard, but it also feels like I'm letting something go.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing the memory. Keep going.",
    "Client: The days that follow are a blur. We're staying at a shelter set up in the high school gym. The community comes together in amazing ways. People are sharing food, clothes, whatever they have. But there's also this underlying tension. Everyone's on edge, waiting for the next aftershock. I remember jumping at every little sound.",
    "Therapist: How does being in the shelter affect you?",
    "Client: It's... it's humbling. And frustrating. I'm used to being independent, taking care of myself and John. But now we're relying on others for basic necessities. It makes me feel vulnerable, and I hate that feeling. But I'm also grateful for the help.",
    "Therapist: That's a complex mix of emotions. How are you coping?",
    "Client: I try to keep busy. I volunteer where I can, helping distribute supplies or comforting children. It helps distract me from my own fears. But at night, when everything's quiet... that's when the memories come flooding back. I have nightmares about being trapped, about the ground opening up and swallowing me whole.",
    "Therapist: How do you handle those nightmares?",
    "Client: I... I often wake up in a cold sweat. John's always there, holding me, reminding me we're safe. But it takes a while to calm down. Sometimes I can't go back to sleep. I just lie there, listening to the sounds around me, half-expecting another quake.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's hovering around a 4. Talking about the nightmares... it brings back some of that fear.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Take a deep breath. Remember you're safe here.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Thank you. It's... it's strange. Even now, years later, I still feel the effects. Loud noises startle me more than they used to. I'm always aware of where the exits are in a building. And sometimes, when the house settles and makes a creaking noise, my heart starts racing.",
    "Therapist: Those are common reactions to trauma. How do you cope with these feelings now?",
    "Client: I try to use some of the techniques we've discussed. Deep breathing, grounding exercises. Sometimes I call my children or play with my grandkids. Their laughter... it helps remind me that life goes on, that there's still joy in the world.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent coping strategies. How do you feel now, after sharing this memory?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, somehow. It's still painful to think about, but it doesn't have the same grip on me that it used to. My SUDS is down to a 3 now. I'm tired, but... I think this helped.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today, Mrs. Thompson. How about we end the exposure here and do some debriefing?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. Thank you, Dr. Carter. This wasn't easy, but I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: You showed great courage. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves before we wrap up."
