    "Therapist: Welcome, John. Today we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm not sure, to be honest. I've been dreading this part of therapy. The idea of reliving those moments... it's terrifying. I've spent years trying to forget, you know? And now you're asking me to remember it all in detail. I'm afraid I might lose control or... I don't know, break down completely.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. Can you tell me more about your fears?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... when I think about those times, I can feel my heart racing already. I start sweating, and sometimes I feel like I can't breathe. What if I panic during the session? And what if talking about it makes everything worse instead of better? I've been managing okay lately, sort of... I mean, I still have nightmares and I drink more than I should, but at least I can function. What if this pushes me over the edge?",
    "Therapist: I understand. How about we discuss the purpose and process?",
    "Client: Yeah, okay. I guess that might help. It's just... it's hard to imagine how forcing myself to remember the worst parts of my life could possibly be good for me. But I trust you, doc. You've helped me a lot so far. So, what exactly are we going to do, and how is it supposed to help?",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit memories gradually, in a safe environment. It helps reduce their power over you.",
    "Client: Reduce their power? That sounds... well, it sounds good, but also kind of impossible. These memories have controlled my life for so long. They're the reason I couldn't keep my marriage together, why I'm back in school at 43 instead of having a career. They're why I can't sleep without drinking first. How can just talking about them change any of that?",
    "Therapist: By facing them, you can process and integrate these experiences. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: I guess... how long will each session last? And what exactly will I have to do? Do I just start talking about what happened, or do you guide me through it? And what happens if I can't handle it and need to stop? I'm worried I might... I don't know, have a breakdown or something.",
    "Therapist: Sessions last about an hour. I'll guide you, and we can pause anytime. Your safety is priority.",
    "Client: An hour? That's... that's a long time to be talking about this stuff. But I appreciate that we can stop if needed. I'm still nervous, but knowing you'll be there to guide me helps. I just hope I can do this. I want to get better, I really do. I'm tired of letting my past control my present.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. This work is challenging but can lead to significant healing.",
    "Client: Thanks, doc. That means a lot. I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Can you tell me a bit more about what to expect during the session? Like, what kind of reactions might I have, and how do I handle them if they come up?",
    "Therapist: You may experience strong emotions or physical reactions. We'll work through them together.",
    "Client: Okay, that makes sense. I'm still scared, but I'm trying to focus on the potential benefits. You really think this can help me move past the trauma and start living a more normal life? I mean, I've been stuck for so long, it's hard to imagine things being different.",
    "Therapist: Yes, many find relief through this process. Your commitment is a crucial first step.",
    "Client: Alright. I'm going to try my best. It's not going to be easy, but I'm willing to do the work. I just hope... I hope it's worth it in the end. I want to be able to trust people again, to sleep without nightmares, to feel like I have a future. If this can help with that, then I'm in, no matter how hard it gets.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is inspiring. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, let's do it. I'm nervous as hell, but I'm ready. Just... promise you'll be there to help me through it, okay? I don't think I could face this alone.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'm here to support you every step of the way."
