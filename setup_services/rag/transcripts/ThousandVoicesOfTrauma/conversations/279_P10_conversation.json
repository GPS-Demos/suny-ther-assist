    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. Work's been crazy, and my back's been acting up again. But I'm here, ready to face this.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your commitment. Let's begin. Close your eyes and take us back to the car accident.",
    "Client: Okay... *deep breath* I'm driving home from work. It's a Friday evening, and I'm excited to see my family. The road is busy, but moving. I can smell the leather of my car seats and hear the radio playing softly.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Uh, maybe a 3? I'm a little tense, but okay.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: The traffic light ahead turns yellow. I'm slowing down, but the truck behind me... it's not stopping. I can see it in my rearview mirror, getting closer and closer. My heart starts racing. I... I grip the steering wheel tighter.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My shoulders are tight. I can feel my pulse in my throat. There's this... this knot in my stomach. I want to move, to get out of the way, but I can't.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: The impact. It's... it's so loud. Like an explosion. My head snaps forward, then back. Everything's spinning. I can taste blood in my mouth. The airbag... it smells weird. Chemical.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to a 7. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here. Can you continue?",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, I can. Um, I'm trying to focus. My ears are ringing. I can hear people shouting outside. Someone's asking if I'm okay, but their voice sounds far away. I'm... I'm scared to move. What if my back is broken?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about my wife and kids. Will I see them again? Will I be able to play with my children? Everything hurts. I feel so helpless, just sitting there, waiting for help.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Carlos. Keep going.",
    "Client: The paramedics arrive. I can hear sirens, see flashing lights through my cracked windshield. They're talking to me, asking questions. I try to answer, but my voice is shaky. They're putting a neck brace on me. It's uncomfortable, makes me feel even more trapped.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still at a 7. My heart's pounding.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here. What happens as they help you?",
    "Client: They're carefully getting me out of the car. I can smell gasoline, hear the crunch of glass under their feet. As they lift me onto the stretcher, pain shoots through my back. I... I cry out. I'm embarrassed, but I can't help it.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to express pain. How do you feel in that moment?",
    "Client: Vulnerable. Scared. I'm on the stretcher now, looking up at the sky. It's getting dark. I can see people watching, and I feel exposed. I want to ask about the other driver, but I can't form the words.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you experience.",
    "Client: They're loading me into the ambulance. The inside is bright, sterile. I can hear beeping machines. An EMT is talking to me, trying to keep me calm, but I'm starting to panic. What if I never walk again? What about work? Our mortgage?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those thoughts. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to an 8 now. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. Remember, you survived this. You're here now.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... okay. We're moving now. I can feel every bump in the road, and each one sends pain through my body. I'm trying to stay still, but it's hard. I keep thinking about my family, wondering if anyone's told them yet.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Carlos. Keep going.",
    "Client: We arrive at the hospital. Everything's a blur of bright lights and rushed voices. They're moving me onto another bed. More questions, more tests. X-rays, CT scans. I'm scared of what they'll find.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling physically and emotionally at this point?",
    "Client: Physically, I'm in pain. My back, my neck, my head - everything hurts. Emotionally, I'm... I'm overwhelmed. Scared. Angry at the other driver. Worried about the future. It's all mixed up.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What happens next?",
    "Client: The doctor comes in. He's talking about sprains, whiplash, concussion. No broken bones. I should be relieved, but I'm not. I know this pain isn't going away anytime soon. I'm thinking about work, about providing for my family.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 6. I'm still anxious, but not as intensely as before.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're processing this well. Continue.",
    "Client: My wife arrives. She looks so worried. I want to comfort her, but I can barely move. She's trying to be strong, but I can see the fear in her eyes. It makes me feel guilty, like I've let her down somehow.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel seeing her reaction?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of relief and shame. Relief that she's here, that I'm not alone. But shame that I've caused her this worry. That I might be a burden now.",
    "Therapist: Those are complex emotions. It's okay to feel them. What happens as you prepare to leave the hospital?",
    "Client: They're discharging me with a list of instructions, prescriptions, follow-up appointments. It all feels overwhelming. I'm in a wheelchair - they won't let me walk out. It feels... humiliating. Like everyone's staring at me.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind as you leave?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm scared. Scared of the pain, of not recovering fully. Worried about work, about being able to support my family. And there's this... this anger bubbling up. At the other driver, at the unfairness of it all.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those feelings. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's back up to a 7. Thinking about all the implications... it's hard.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you've come through this. You're here now, working through it.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Yeah... yeah, you're right. It's just... it's still so vivid, you know? The fear, the pain, the uncertainty. It changed everything.",
    "Therapist: I understand. You've done incredibly well today, Carlos. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. But also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've let some of it out.",
    "Therapist: That's good. It's part of the healing process. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you tell me three things you see in this room?",
    "Client: Uh, sure. I see... the plant in the corner, your desk lamp, and the clock on the wall.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Now, two things you can hear?",
    "Client: I hear the air conditioning and... traffic outside the window.",
    "Therapist: Great. Lastly, one thing you can feel?",
    "Client: I can feel the softness of this chair cushion.",
    "Therapist: Very good. You've done amazing work today, Carlos. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... tired, but okay. My SUDS is down to about a 4 now. It's... it's intense, reliving it all, but I think it helps.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. Remember, healing takes time. We'll continue to work through this together. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we end today's session?",
    "Client: No, I think... I think I'm good for now. It's a lot to process, but I feel like I've made some progress.",
    "Therapist: You absolutely have. Take care of yourself this week, and we'll pick up here next time. Well done, Carlos."
