    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about the earthquake, and just thinking about it makes my heart race a little.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 6 out of 10 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath, and when you're ready, describe the day of the earthquake.",
    "Client: Alright... It was a Tuesday morning. I was in my dorm room, studying for a midterm. The sun was just coming up, and I remember thinking how peaceful it was. Then... then everything started to shake.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue in the present tense.",
    "Client: Right, sorry. Um, the room is shaking. Books are falling off my desk. I can hear people screaming in the hallway. I'm... I'm frozen. I can't move.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My heart is pounding. I feel dizzy, like the room won't stop moving even though the shaking has stopped. I'm sweating, and my hands are clammy.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I stumble to the doorway. That's what they always tell you to do, right? Stand in a doorway? But the door is jammed. I can't open it. I'm trapped.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe an 8?",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here with me, safe in my office.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm breathing. The room is still shaking. I can hear glass breaking somewhere. I'm thinking about my family, wondering if they're okay. I can't reach my phone \u2013 it's fallen somewhere.",
    "Therapist: What do you see around you?",
    "Client: Everything is a mess. My textbooks are all over the floor. There's a crack running up the wall. I can see dust in the air, catching the morning sunlight. It's... it's almost beautiful in a terrifying way.",
    "Therapist: Good description. What happens next?",
    "Client: The shaking is slowing down. But now there's a new sound \u2013 a low rumbling. I... I think it's the building next door collapsing. Oh God, I hope everyone got out.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm terrified. I feel so alone. I want my mom. I... I can't stop shaking. Even though the earthquake has stopped, I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Keep going.",
    "Client: I manage to open the door. The hallway is chaos. People are running, crying. Someone bumps into me, and I nearly fall. I can smell smoke. Is there a fire? I don't know where to go.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Maria. Remember, you survived this. You're safe now.",
    "Client: Right. I'm safe. Okay... I'm making my way down the stairs. They're crowded. Someone is hurt \u2013 I can hear them crying out. I want to help, but I'm too scared. I just keep moving.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I finally make it outside. The air is thick with dust. People are everywhere, looking shocked. I see a girl I know from class, and we just... we just hug each other and cry.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm overwhelmed. There's relief at being out of the building, but also this crushing fear. What if there's another quake? What about aftershocks?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens in the next few moments?",
    "Client: We're all huddled in the quad. Someone has a radio, and we're listening for news. My phone still isn't working \u2013 I can't call my parents. I'm shivering, even though it's not cold.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... this can't be real. It feels like a movie. But the ground keeps trembling with aftershocks, and I know it's all too real. I'm... I'm so scared.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember you're here with me.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm breathing. In the quad, people are starting to organize. Someone is taking names, trying to account for everyone. I give them my name, my dorm number. I'm still shaking.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: We start hearing sirens. Lots of sirens. Ambulances, fire trucks. They're coming from every direction. I see smoke rising from downtown. It's... it's surreal.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Scared. Helpless. I want to do something, but I don't know what. I feel guilty for being okay when others might be hurt.",
    "Therapist: Those are normal feelings. Continue with what you see and experience.",
    "Client: Hours pass. We're still in the quad. Some people have blankets now. Someone hands me a bottle of water, but my hands are shaking so much I can barely drink. I keep trying my phone, but nothing.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind at this point?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm worried sick about my family. Are they okay? Do they know I'm okay? I'm thinking about my friends from other parts of the city. I'm... I'm feeling so isolated, even surrounded by all these people.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7 now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going with what happens next.",
    "Client: As the day goes on, things start to get more organized. They're setting up tents, bringing in food and water. I volunteer to help distribute supplies. It... it helps to have something to do.",
    "Therapist: How does helping others make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's grounding, I guess. For a while, I can focus on something other than my own fear. But then I'll hear a loud noise, and I'll jump, thinking it's another quake.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. What happens as evening approaches?",
    "Client: They tell us we can't go back to our dorms. They're not sure if the buildings are safe. I realize I might have lost everything \u2013 my laptop, my clothes, my photos. I start crying again.",
    "Therapist: Allow yourself to feel those emotions. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I find a quiet corner and just sob. A counselor comes over and sits with me. She doesn't say much, just... just lets me cry. It helps, somehow.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 6. I'm exhausted.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Maria. Let's continue.",
    "Client: As it gets dark, they start setting up sleeping areas in the gym. It's crowded, noisy. I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I feel the ground shaking again.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with that?",
    "Client: I... I try to focus on my breathing, like you've taught me. In and out. In and out. It helps a little. I must have dozed off eventually because I remember waking up to sunlight.",
    "Therapist: What happens the next morning?",
    "Client: It's... it's chaos again, but more organized. They're trying to reunite people with their families. I finally get through to my parents on someone's phone. They're okay. I... I break down crying again, but this time it's relief.",
    "Therapist: That must have been a powerful moment. How did you feel?",
    "Client: It was like... like a weight lifted. But also, I felt guilty. So many people around me still didn't know if their families were safe.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 5, I think.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's start to wrap up the narrative. How do the next few days unfold?",
    "Client: It's a blur of helping out, waiting for news, and trying to process what happened. I have nightmares every night. During the day, I jump at every loud noise. But slowly, things start to get back to some kind of normal.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel now, thinking back on that experience?",
    "Client: It's... it's still hard. I feel anxious, but also... I don't know, stronger maybe? Like I survived something huge.",
    "Therapist: That's a great observation, Maria. You did survive something huge. Let's take a final SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say... maybe a 4 now?",
    "Therapist: Excellent work today. You've shown incredible strength in revisiting this experience. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained, but also kind of proud? It was hard, but I did it.",
    "Therapist: You absolutely did. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves before we end the session."
