    "Therapist: Alright, let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your current SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10. My stomach feels a bit tight.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that night of the home invasion. Describe what you see and feel.",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in my bedroom. It's dark, maybe around 2 AM. I hear a noise downstairs, like glass breaking. My heart starts racing immediately. I... I sit up in bed, straining to listen.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: My palms are sweaty. I'm gripping the sheets tightly. I can hear footsteps now, definitely someone in the house. I'm frozen, I can't move. I'm terrified they'll come upstairs.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 7. My chest feels really tight.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Continue describing what happens next.",
    "Client: I hear them moving around downstairs. Drawers opening, things being knocked over. I'm trying to breathe quietly, but it feels like my heart is so loud they must be able to hear it. Then... then I hear footsteps on the stairs.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm panicking. I'm thinking, \"This is it. They're going to find me.\" I want to run, but I'm paralyzed with fear. The footsteps are getting closer. I can hear heavy breathing in the hallway.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I can't breathe. My whole body is shaking.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Keep going when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) The door handle turns slowly. I'm holding my breath. The door creaks open, and I see a silhouette. A man. He's big, much bigger than me. I can smell alcohol and cigarettes. He steps into the room.",
    "Therapist: What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I try to scream, but nothing comes out. He lunges towards the bed. I finally find my voice and yell, but his hand clamps over my mouth. His other hand... (voice breaks) his other hand starts touching me.",
    "Therapist: I know this is difficult. What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's a 10. I feel sick. I can almost feel his hands on me right now.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for facing this. Remember, you're safe now. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: (Breathing heavily) I... I can do this. I need to keep going.",
    "Therapist: Okay. What happens next?",
    "Client: He's... he's groping me, tearing at my clothes. I'm trying to fight back, but he's so strong. I manage to bite his hand and scream. He hits me, hard. Everything goes fuzzy for a moment.",
    "Therapist: Stay with me. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel helpless. Angry. Disgusted. My SUDS is still at 10. My stomach is churning.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You're doing great. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I hear sirens in the distance. He freezes for a moment, then scrambles off me. He runs out of the room. I hear him thundering down the stairs, then the sound of breaking glass again. Then... silence.",
    "Therapist: And now? What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about an 8. I feel drained, but also relieved that he's gone.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You've done really well. Let's start bringing you back to the present.",
    "Client: (Opens eyes, looks around) I... I made it through. It was hard, but I did it.",
    "Therapist: Yes, you did. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Shaky. But also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? My SUDS is down to about a 5 now.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've shown incredible courage today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I could face that memory so directly.",
    "Therapist: You've made significant progress. Let's take a few minutes to decompress before we end the session."
