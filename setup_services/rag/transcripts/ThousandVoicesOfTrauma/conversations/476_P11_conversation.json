    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. Going through that memory of the cyberbullying incident after my deployment... it's bringing up a lot of emotions I thought I'd buried.",
    "Therapist: What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The feeling of helplessness, I guess. Like, I could handle physical threats in combat, you know? But this online attack, it felt like I couldn't defend myself. It was everywhere, and I couldn't escape it.",
    "Therapist: How does that connect to your day-to-day life now?",
    "Client: (sighs) I think... I think it's why I struggle with social media. Even harmless posts from friends make me anxious. I'm always waiting for the next attack, even though logically I know it's unlikely.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. How else has this affected you?",
    "Client: Well, I've become really isolated. I mean, I'm 25 and still living with my parents. I should be out there, dating, building a career. But I'm stuck. Every time I try to put myself out there, I remember those comments, those threats, and I just... freeze.",
    "Therapist: What did you learn about yourself during this exposure?",
    "Client: (pause) I... I realized I'm stronger than I thought. Reliving it was hard, but I did it. And talking about it now, I can see how it's affected me, but I'm also here, fighting to get better. That counts for something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's scary, but... I want to. I want my life back. I don't want to let those faceless bullies win, you know? I served my country, I survived combat. I should be able to handle this too.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful motivation. What's one small step you can take this week?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I could try posting something small on social media. Just a photo or something. Baby steps, right?",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a good plan. How can you prepare for that?",
    "Client: I could... maybe write out some positive affirmations? Remind myself that I'm safe now, that I have support. And maybe have a friend on standby in case I get anxious after posting.",
    "Therapist: Great ideas. How do you feel about our session today?",
    "Client: It was tough, but... good, I think. I feel like I understand myself a bit better. And talking about it... it makes it feel less overwhelming, you know? Like, it's just a part of my story, not my whole identity.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... maybe we could dive deeper into why the cyberbullying hit me so hard after combat? Like, why did words hurt more than actual danger? I want to understand that better.",
    "Therapist: We can certainly explore that. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I guess. For listening, for pushing me. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm finally moving forward. It's... it's a good feeling."
