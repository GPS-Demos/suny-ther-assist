    "Therapist: Welcome, Jake. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about that incident with the police, and it's making my stomach churn a little.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm walking down Main Street. It's a sunny afternoon, but I feel tense. There's a protest happening nearby about police brutality. I can hear chanting in the distance.",
    "Therapist: Good. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The air feels thick, like something's about to happen. I see people rushing past me, some looking scared. I... I spot a group of police officers in riot gear at the end of the street.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Um, maybe a 40? It's uncomfortable, but I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: The officers start moving towards the crowd. I freeze, not sure what to do. Suddenly, there's shouting, and I see them pushing people. My heart's racing now.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I'm scared. I keep thinking, \"This isn't right. They're supposed to protect us.\" I want to run, but my feet won't move.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's up to 60, I think.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I see a young woman fall. An officer is raising his baton, and I... I can't just stand there. I rush forward, yelling, \"Stop!\" But as I get closer, another officer grabs me.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he twists my arm behind my back. It hurts so bad. I'm shouting, \"I didn't do anything wrong!\" But they're not listening. I can't breathe... I...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Jake. You're safe here. Can you continue?",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah. They're forcing me to the ground now. My face is pressed against the pavement. It's rough, and I can taste blood in my mouth.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: Helpless. Angry. Scared. It's like being bullied all over again, but worse because these are people who should be protecting me.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 80 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Jake. Remember, you're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: They're putting handcuffs on me. They're too tight, cutting into my wrists. I'm begging them to loosen them, but they ignore me. I can hear more shouting, sirens... it's chaos.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"This can't be happening. I didn't do anything wrong.\" I'm... I'm remembering all those news stories about police brutality, and I'm terrified they might really hurt me.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's at 90. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well, Jake. Take a deep breath. Can you continue?",
    "Client: Yeah... They're pulling me up now, roughly. My shoulder hurts from how they grabbed me. They're dragging me towards a police van. I see other protesters being arrested too. Some are crying, others are still shouting.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling as this happens?",
    "Client: I feel... powerless. Angry. Scared. It's like all those times I was bullied in school, but a hundred times worse. I can't believe this is happening in my own city, by people who are supposed to protect us.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: They shove me into the van. It's dark, cramped. There are others in here too, all looking as scared and angry as I feel. The doors slam shut, and I... I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. How are you feeling right now, in this memory?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm panicking. My heart's racing, I'm sweating. I keep thinking about my parents, wondering if they'll know where I am. I'm worried about what's going to happen to me.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's at 95 now. This is really intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well, Jake. Remember, you're safe here. Can you continue?",
    "Client: Yeah... The van starts moving. We're all silent now, just the sound of heavy breathing and occasional sobs. I'm trying to stay calm, but my mind is racing. What if they charge me with something? What if this goes on my record? Will it affect my studies?",
    "Therapist: What else are you experiencing in this moment?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel so small. Insignificant. Like my rights don't matter. It's bringing back all those feelings from when I was bullied, but it's worse because these are adults, people in authority.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: We arrive at the police station. They lead us out one by one. I'm trying to stay brave, but I'm shaking. Inside, they take our details, fingerprints. It's all a blur. I keep asking to call my parents, but they ignore me.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Frustrated. Scared. Angry. I feel like I'm being treated like a criminal when all I did was try to help someone.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's still at 95. My heart's pounding just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Jake. Take a deep breath. Can you continue?",
    "Client: Yeah... They put me in a holding cell. It's cold, sterile. I can hear others in nearby cells, some crying, some angry. I sit on the bench, my head in my hands. I feel so alone, so helpless.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind at this point?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how unfair this all is. How I was just trying to do the right thing. I'm worried about what my parents will think, what this might do to my future. And I'm angry... so angry at the police for abusing their power like this.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: Hours pass. Finally, an officer comes to release me. No charges, they say, but the experience... it's scarred me. As I walk out of the station, I feel different. Changed. Like I've lost something I can never get back.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, as you remember leaving the station?",
    "Client: I feel... numb. Relieved to be free, but also deeply shaken. It's like the world isn't as safe as I thought it was. I'm angry, scared, and... and determined. Determined to do something about this, to not let this happen to others.",
    "Therapist: Your final SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to 85 now. Still high, but I feel like I've processed some of it.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well, Jake. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you name five things you see in this room right now?",
    "Client: Um... I see the blue chair, the plant in the corner, your desk lamp, the bookshelf, and the clock on the wall.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling a bit drained, but also like a weight has been lifted. Talking through it... it was hard, but I think it helped.",
    "Therapist: You showed great courage today, Jake. How do you feel about what we've accomplished?",
    "Client: I feel... proud, I guess. It was tough, but I made it through. And I feel like I understand my reactions better now.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's end here for today. Remember to practice your breathing exercises this week.",
    "Client: I will. Thanks... this really helped.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Jake. I'll see you next week."
