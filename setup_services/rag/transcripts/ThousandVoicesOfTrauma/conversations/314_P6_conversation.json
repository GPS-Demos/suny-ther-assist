    "Therapist: Okay, Maryam, let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the incident.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Alright... I'm walking home from the library. It's late, maybe around 10 PM. The streets are quiet, just a few people around. I can hear my footsteps echoing on the pavement. Suddenly, I hear shouting from across the street. I see two men arguing, their voices getting louder. One of them pushes the other, and I freeze, not knowing what to do.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Um, about a 4 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue.",
    "Client: The man who got pushed stumbles back, then lunges forward. He throws a punch, and I hear a sickening crack. The other man falls to the ground. My heart is racing now, and I feel like I can't move. I want to help, but I'm terrified.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My palms are sweaty, and my chest feels tight. The memory feels so vivid.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Keep going.",
    "Client: The man on the ground isn't moving. The other guy starts kicking him, over and over. I can hear the thud of each kick, and... and I think I see blood. I'm shaking now, and I feel like I might throw up. I want to scream for help, but no sound comes out. I'm rooted to the spot, watching this horrible scene unfold.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. SUDS?",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) It's an 8 now. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: I know. You're brave. Keep going if you can.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) Suddenly, the attacker looks up and sees me. Our eyes meet, and I feel this cold dread wash over me. He starts walking towards me, and I can see the anger in his eyes. I finally find my voice and scream. I turn and run as fast as I can, not looking back. I can hear footsteps behind me, and I'm certain he's chasing me.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: (Breathing heavily) It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Inhales deeply) I run until my lungs burn. I don't stop until I reach my apartment building. I fumble with my keys, constantly looking over my shoulder. Once inside, I collapse on the floor, sobbing. I can still hear the man's groans, see the blood... I feel so helpless, so scared.",
    "Therapist: SUDS now?",
    "Client: Still a 9. My heart is pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's stay with it a bit longer.",
    "Client: I spend the whole night awake, jumping at every little sound. I keep replaying the scene in my head, wondering if I should have done something, called for help. I feel guilty for running away, but also relieved that I wasn't hurt. The next day, I see a news report about the incident. The man who was beaten is in critical condition. I break down crying again, feeling overwhelmed with fear and guilt.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm shaking a little, and my stomach feels queasy. But... I think I'm starting to calm down a bit.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's gone down to a 7.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Let's wrap up the exercise.",
    "Client: (Opens eyes, looks around) Wow, that was intense. I didn't realize how much that memory still affected me.",
    "Therapist: You did really well, Maryam. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved? Like I've let something out that I've been holding in for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. Final SUDS?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 5 now.",
    "Therapist: Great job today. Let's talk about what you experienced..."
