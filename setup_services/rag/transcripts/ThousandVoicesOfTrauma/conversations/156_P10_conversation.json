    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to dive into some tough memories, and I'm not sure I'm ready. But I suppose that's normal, right?",
    "Therapist: It's completely normal. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) I think so. Yes, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I'm at the base in Afghanistan. It's early morning, the sun's just coming up. The air is dry, and there's this constant hum of generators in the background. I can smell diesel fuel and... and something else. Breakfast maybe? Powdered eggs and coffee.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: We're gearing up for a routine patrol. I'm checking my equipment, making sure everything's secure. My hands are sweating inside my gloves. I... I remember thinking about home, about John and the kids. Wondering if I'd see them again.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 4? I'm tense, but okay.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Continue.",
    "Client: We're in the Humvee now, rolling out of the base. The roads are rough, and we're all jostling around. I'm on high alert, scanning the roadside for any signs of IEDs. My heart's pounding in my chest.",
    "Therapist: What do you hear?",
    "Client: The rumble of the engine, radio chatter... and then... (voice quavers) Oh God, there's an explosion up ahead!",
    "Therapist: Stay with it, Sarah. You're safe here. What's happening?",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) The Humvee in front of us... it's gone up in flames. There's smoke everywhere, and I can hear screaming. We're all yelling, trying to figure out what's going on. I'm... I'm frozen. I can't move.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe higher. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're here in the office with me. Can you feel the chair beneath you?",
    "Client: (nods) Yes... yes, I can.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going when you're ready.",
    "Client: We're getting out of the vehicle now. I can feel the heat from the explosion. The air is thick with dust and smoke. I'm coughing, trying to see through it all. There are bodies... oh God, there are bodies on the ground.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you doing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm running towards the wreckage. Training kicks in. I'm yelling for a medic, trying to assess who's alive. My hands are shaking as I check for pulses. There's so much blood...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Take a moment to ground yourself.",
    "Client: (takes several deep breaths) Okay... okay. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I'm... I'm trying to help a soldier. His leg is... it's gone. I'm applying a tourniquet, my hands slippery with blood. He's screaming in pain, and I'm telling him it's going to be okay, but I don't know if it will be. I can hear gunfire in the distance. We're under attack.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: Terror. Absolute terror. But also... determination. I have to keep this soldier alive. I have to do my job.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. What happens next?",
    "Client: More explosions. The air is filled with the sound of gunfire and shouting. I'm dragging the wounded soldier behind our Humvee for cover. My arms are burning with the effort. I can smell... I can smell burning flesh. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. How's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still at a 9. My heart's racing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember to breathe.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) Okay. We're... we're pinned down now. I can hear bullets pinging off the Humvee. I'm trying to keep pressure on the soldier's wound, but there's so much blood. I'm... I'm terrified we're all going to die here.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about my family. About how I might never see them again. I'm angry... angry that this is happening, that these young soldiers are dying. And I feel... I feel helpless. Like no matter what I do, it won't be enough.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. How long does this firefight last?",
    "Client: It feels like hours, but... but I think it was only about 30 minutes. Eventually, we hear the sound of helicopters. Reinforcements are coming. The gunfire starts to die down.",
    "Therapist: What happens as things calm down?",
    "Client: We... we start assessing the damage. There are bodies everywhere. Some of them are people I knew, people I had breakfast with that morning. The soldier I was helping... he didn't make it. I'm... I'm covered in his blood.",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly difficult. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. I can feel the weight of it all.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The next few hours are a blur. We're evacuating the wounded, identifying the dead. I'm moving on autopilot, doing what needs to be done. But inside... inside I feel hollow. Empty. Like a part of me died out there too.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with these feelings in the moment?",
    "Client: I... I don't. I can't. I just keep working. Keep moving. If I stop, if I think about it, I'll fall apart. And I can't fall apart. Not here. Not now.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. What happens as the day ends?",
    "Client: We... we finally get back to base. I'm exhausted, physically and emotionally. I go through debrief in a daze. And then... then I'm alone in my bunk. That's when it hits me. The full weight of what happened. I... I break down. I cry until I have no tears left.",
    "Therapist: Allow yourself to feel those emotions. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's back up to a 9. I can feel the pain, the grief, the guilt...",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well, Sarah. Take a moment to ground yourself.",
    "Client: (takes several deep breaths) Okay... I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Good. Can you tell me about the days following the attack?",
    "Client: They're... they're a blur. We have to keep going, keep doing our jobs. But everything feels different. The base is quieter. Everyone's on edge. I... I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see their faces. The ones we lost.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with these intrusive thoughts?",
    "Client: I... I try to stay busy. I volunteer for extra shifts, extra duties. Anything to keep my mind occupied. But it doesn't really work. The memories are always there, just below the surface.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 7. Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also... I don't know, maybe a little relieving?",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing these memories. How do you feel now, looking back on that day?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel a mix of things. Sadness, for sure. Guilt, that I couldn't save everyone. Anger, at the senselessness of it all. But also... also a kind of pride. We did our best in an impossible situation. We saved who we could.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. You've done incredibly well today, Sarah.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's... it's still hard to talk about. But I think... I think it's getting a little easier each time.",
    "Therapist: That's the goal. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. Drained. But also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've set down a bit of the weight I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. What's your final SUDS level?",
    "Client: I'd say... maybe a 5? I'm still feeling it, but it's not overwhelming anymore.",
    "Therapist: You've done amazing work today, Sarah. Let's take a few moments to decompress before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you... for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but... but I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Remember, healing takes time. We'll continue to work through this together."
