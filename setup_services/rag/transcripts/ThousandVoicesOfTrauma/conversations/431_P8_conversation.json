    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I'm back there, you know? I can still hear the growling, the snarling. It's so vivid.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... guilt? I keep thinking about how I just froze. I should have done something, anything. But I just stood there, watching it happen.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. Can you tell me more about that guilt?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. I mean, I know logically that there wasn't much I could've done. But emotionally? I feel like a coward. Like I failed. I keep replaying it in my mind, thinking of all the things I could've done differently. Maybe if I'd yelled louder, or if I'd tried to distract the animal somehow... I don't know. It's just... it's eating me up inside.",
    "Therapist: Where do you feel that guilt in your body?",
    "Client: Oh, um... I guess it's like a heaviness in my chest. And my stomach feels kind of twisted. It's like this constant knot that won't go away. And my shoulders... they're so tense. I didn't even realize until you asked, but they're practically up to my ears.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep hearing that poor dog's yelps. And seeing the blood... there was so much blood. I can't shake the image of its owner's face when she realized what was happening. The shock, the horror... I feel like I let them both down. And then I think about my own dogs at home, and I just... I can't help but wonder what if it had been them? What if I freeze up again when they need me? I don't know if I could live with myself.",
    "Therapist: How does recalling this memory affect your daily life?",
    "Client: It's... it's everywhere. I used to love going to the park, but now? I can't even walk down the street without scanning for potential threats. Every dog I see, no matter how small or friendly, makes my heart race. I've stopped taking my own dogs for walks. My husband has to do it now. I feel like I'm letting them down too. And the nightmares... they're almost every night now. I wake up in a cold sweat, hearing those growls. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your breathing right now?",
    "Client: Oh... I didn't realize, but it's quite shallow. Quick, short breaths. Like I can't quite catch my breath. It's how I felt that day, actually. Like the air was too thick to breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Try taking a deep breath. How does that feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's better. Grounding, I guess? It reminds me that I'm here, not back there. The knot in my stomach loosens a bit. But there's still this underlying tension, like my body's waiting for something bad to happen.",
    "Therapist: What do you think that tension is about?",
    "Client: I suppose... it's fear. Fear that it could happen again. That I'll be put in another situation where I'm helpless, where I can't protect myself or others. It's like I'm constantly on high alert now. Every sound, every movement... it's exhausting, but I can't seem to turn it off.",
    "Therapist: How does this experience compare to previous exposures?",
    "Client: It's... it's getting easier, I think. The first few times we did this, I could barely get through it without having a full-blown panic attack. Now, it's still intense, but... I feel like I can breathe through it a bit better. The emotions are still there, but they're not completely overwhelming me like before. Is that... is that progress?",
    "Therapist: What do you think?",
    "Client: I... I guess it is progress. It doesn't feel like it most days, but looking back... yeah, I can see a difference. I'm able to talk about it without completely falling apart now. And the nightmares, they're still there, but they're not every single night anymore. It's just... it's so slow. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel normal again.",
    "Therapist: What would \"normal\" look like to you?",
    "Client: Normal... I suppose it would be being able to go to the park again without constantly looking over my shoulder. Taking my dogs for a walk and actually enjoying it, rather than being terrified. Sleeping through the night without waking up in a cold sweat. Just... living without this constant fear and guilt hanging over me. Being able to hear a dog bark without my heart racing. That's what I want to get back to.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about your progress so far?",
    "Client: I... I'm proud, I think. It's been hard, really hard. There have been times when I wanted to give up, when it felt like it wasn't worth it. But I'm still here, still trying. And I can see small changes. I went to the corner store the other day - it's not far, but it's the first time I've gone out alone in months. It was terrifying, but I did it. So yeah, I'm proud. Scared still, but proud.",
    "Therapist: What's helped you persist through the difficult moments?",
    "Client: My family, definitely. My husband has been so patient and supportive. And my kids... they don't fully understand, but they're trying. They make me want to get better, to be the mum they deserve. And... these sessions, actually. As hard as they are, they give me hope. Hope that I can work through this, that I won't always feel this way. It's a lifeline when things get really dark.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel now compared to when we started?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, I think. Still shaky, but not as overwhelmed. Talking about it, really digging into those feelings... it's hard, but it's like letting out a breath I didn't know I was holding. The memory is still there, still vivid, but it feels a bit less... consuming? Like I can step back from it a little. I'm exhausted, but there's a sense of... I don't know, accomplishment maybe? Like I've faced something difficult and come out the other side.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to work on strategies for managing the anxiety when I'm out in public. The exposure exercises are helping, but I still struggle with the day-to-day stuff. Maybe we could talk about techniques for staying grounded when I start to feel overwhelmed? And... I think I'd like to set a goal. Something small, like taking my dogs for a short walk. I miss that connection with them, and I think it could be a good step forward.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great plan. We'll pick up there next time.",
    "Client: Thank you. I know I've got a long way to go, but... I'm starting to believe I can do this. It's scary, but I'm ready to keep working at it.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength today. Take care, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. See you then."
