    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Johnson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. It's been a tough week. I keep thinking about my wife and that horrible night. Sometimes I feel like I'm right back there, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Imaginal exposure? I'm not sure what that means. It sounds a bit intimidating. Can you explain it to me?",
    "Therapist: Of course. It's a way to process traumatic memories safely. We'll revisit the event in your mind.",
    "Client: Revisit it? I... I don't know if I can do that. Just thinking about it makes my heart race. What if I can't handle it?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace. How does that sound?",
    "Client: I guess that's okay. But what exactly will we be doing? And how will this help me?",
    "Therapist: We'll have you recount the event in detail. It helps reduce the power of those memories over time.",
    "Client: In detail? That sounds... intense. Will you be there to help me if it gets too overwhelming?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'll guide you through it. We can pause anytime you need.",
    "Client: Okay, that's somewhat reassuring. But I'm still nervous. What if I start panicking or can't continue?",
    "Therapist: That's normal to feel nervous. We have techniques to help you stay grounded. Your safety is priority.",
    "Client: Alright. I trust you, but I'm still scared. How long will this take? And will it really help me move forward?",
    "Therapist: Sessions typically last about an hour. Many find it helpful for healing and moving forward.",
    "Client: An hour? That seems like a long time to relive that nightmare. But if it helps... I guess I'm willing to try.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Remember, you're in control. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay. I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Let's do this. Just... please be patient with me if I struggle.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Your wellbeing is my priority. Let's start slowly..."
