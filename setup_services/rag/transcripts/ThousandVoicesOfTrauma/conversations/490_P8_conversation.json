    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like I'm still there, you know? My heart's racing, and I can feel sweat on my palms. The memory feels so vivid, like it just happened yesterday instead of years ago. I can still hear the explosions, smell the smoke...",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's like this cold grip around my chest. I keep thinking about how close we came to... to not making it out. And there's this guilt too, you know? Why did I survive when others didn't?",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. Can you tell me more about that guilt?",
    "Client: It's... it's crushing. I see their faces, the ones we lost. I wonder about their families, their dreams. Sometimes I think maybe I could have done more, been faster, smarter. Maybe if I had, they'd still be here. It's irrational, I know, but... it's there.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you're talking about this?",
    "Client: Tense. Really tense. My shoulders are tight, and there's this knot in my stomach. I feel like I can't catch my breath properly. It's like my body's preparing for another attack, even though I know I'm safe here.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep replaying the scene, wondering if I missed something. What if I had turned left instead of right? What if we had left five minutes earlier? It's an endless loop of 'what ifs'. And then there's this voice saying, \"You don't deserve to be here. You don't deserve this life.\"",
    "Therapist: How do those thoughts make you feel?",
    "Client: Overwhelmed. Sad. Angry, too. I'm angry at the situation, at the war, at myself. Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning in these emotions, and I don't know how to swim to the surface.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I need to feel grounded. To remember that I'm here, now, not back there. I need to believe that it's okay to be alive, that I have a right to be here. And I need... I need to find a way to honor their memory without letting it consume me.",
    "Therapist: How can we work towards that?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe by talking about it more? By facing these memories instead of trying to push them away? It's hard, but I think it might help. And maybe finding ways to give back, to make their sacrifices mean something.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful approach. How do you feel about that idea?",
    "Client: It's scary, but... hopeful too? Like maybe there's a way through this. A way to carry their memory without being crushed by it. I want to find peace, for them and for me. It's just... it's going to be a long journey, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: What gives you strength on this journey?",
    "Client: My family, definitely. They've been so patient and supportive. And... and the guys I served with who made it back. We understand each other in a way no one else can. Sometimes, just knowing they're out there helps. And... I guess, my own resilience? I've made it this far, right?",
    "Therapist: How does recognizing that resilience feel?",
    "Client: It's... empowering, I guess? Like, yeah, this is hard, but I'm still here. I'm still fighting. It doesn't take away the pain or the memories, but it reminds me that I can face them. That maybe, just maybe, I can find a way to live with this and still have a good life.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you can take towards that goal?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I could start a journal? Write down some of these thoughts and feelings. It might help me process things, and maybe see patterns or progress over time. And... maybe I could look into volunteer opportunities at the local veterans' center. Give back a little, you know?",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to consider these steps?",
    "Client: It's a mix of emotions. There's some anxiety, wondering if I can really do it. But there's also a spark of... I don't know, hope? Like maybe this is the start of something. A way to move forward without forgetting. It's scary, but... I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: What support do you need to take these steps?",
    "Client: I think... I might need some help getting started with the journaling. Maybe some prompts or guidelines? And for the volunteering, I'd appreciate it if we could talk through what to expect. I'm worried about triggers, you know? But I also know I can't let that fear control me forever.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like reasonable requests. Shall we discuss them further?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think having a plan, even a small one, would help. It gives me something to focus on, you know? A direction to move in. And knowing I have support... it makes it feel more possible. Like maybe I can do this after all.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, I think? Still shaky from the exposure exercise, but there's this sense of... I don't know, possibility? Like maybe there's a path forward. The memories are still there, still painful, but they don't feel quite as overwhelming. It's like... like I can see beyond them a little bit now.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant shift. What do you think contributed to that?",
    "Client: Talking about it, definitely. Putting words to these feelings... it's hard, but it helps. And you asking questions, helping me dig deeper... it makes me feel less alone in this. Like maybe I can face these memories and come out okay on the other side. It's not easy, but... I think it's worth it.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... maybe we could start working on those journaling prompts? And perhaps talk more about strategies for managing flashbacks. They still catch me off guard sometimes, and I'd like to feel more prepared. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll start there next time. How are you feeling about ending for today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. A bit drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense? Like I've done some hard work. I'm nervous about what comes next, but also... kind of looking forward to it? Thank you for today. It means a lot to have someone who really listens.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
