    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back at the compound. It's late evening, and I can hear chanting in the distance. The air feels heavy, almost suffocating. I see people gathered in a circle, their faces illuminated by flickering torchlight. My heart is starting to race...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10. It's uncomfortable, but manageable.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue.",
    "Client: The leader steps into the center of the circle. His eyes are wild, almost glowing in the firelight. He's shouting something about sacrifice and loyalty. I can feel my palms getting sweaty, and there's this knot forming in my stomach. Someone next to me is sobbing quietly...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. My chest feels tight, and I'm having trouble catching my breath.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The leader is pointing at someone in the crowd. Oh god, it's a young woman. She looks terrified. Two men are dragging her forward. I want to help her, but I'm frozen in place. My legs feel like lead. The crowd's chanting is getting louder, more frenzied. I can taste bile in the back of my throat...",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's an 8 now. I feel like I'm right back there. My heart's pounding so hard it hurts.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep breathing. What happens next?",
    "Client: The leader pulls out a knife. The blade gleams in the firelight. The woman is screaming, begging for help. I can't... I can't watch this. But I can't look away either. I feel so helpless, so guilty. Why didn't I do something? My whole body is shaking...",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm going to be sick.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here with me, safe in my office.",
    "Client: The leader raises the knife. There's a collective gasp from the crowd. I squeeze my eyes shut, but I can still hear everything. The woman's screams, the sickening sound of... of... Oh god, I can't do this. I can't...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's a 10. I feel overwhelmed. My head is spinning, and I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Open your eyes. Look around. You're here with me.",
    "Client: (gasping) I... I'm sorry. It felt so real. I could smell the smoke, hear the screams...",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You did well. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: A bit shaky. My SUDS is probably down to a 7 now. I still feel nauseous and my heart's racing, but I know I'm here, not there.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's take a few deep breaths together.",
    "Client: (inhales deeply) Okay... that helps a bit. I'm sorry I couldn't finish.",
    "Therapist: No need to apologize. You did great. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Better, I think. My SUDS is maybe a 5 now. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I faced something I've been avoiding for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. We'll end here for today."
