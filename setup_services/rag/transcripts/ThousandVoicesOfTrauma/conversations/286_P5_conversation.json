    "Therapist: Welcome, John. Today we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this all week. The idea of revisiting those memories... it's making my stomach churn. I mean, I understand why we're doing this, but it doesn't make it any easier. What if I can't handle it? What if I break down completely?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. Can you tell me more about your fears?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... those memories of being imprisoned, they're so intense. I've spent years trying to push them away, you know? The thought of deliberately bringing them up, it feels like I'm inviting all that pain back in. And what if I can't control my reactions? I'm worried I might have a panic attack or something. Plus, I'm not sure how this will affect me afterwards. Will I be able to function normally after the session?",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's discuss how we'll manage this together.",
    "Client: Okay, that sounds good. I appreciate your patience with me. It's just... this is all so new and scary. I've never really talked about this stuff in detail before. Even with my wife, I've only shared bits and pieces. The idea of diving deep into it... it's intimidating. But I trust you, and I know you wouldn't suggest this if you didn't think it would help. Can you walk me through what exactly we'll be doing?",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll revisit the memory gradually, and I'll guide you through it.",
    "Client: Alright, that doesn't sound too bad. When you say 'gradually', what do you mean exactly? Will we start with just a small part of the memory? And how long will we spend on this? I'm worried about getting overwhelmed if we spend too much time on it all at once. Also, what should I do if I start feeling too anxious or panicky during the process?",
    "Therapist: We'll start small and build up. You can pause anytime. What coping strategies help you?",
    "Client: Well, deep breathing usually helps when I'm feeling anxious. Sometimes I also use a grounding technique where I focus on my surroundings - you know, naming things I can see, hear, and touch. And occasionally, when things get really tough, I have this stress ball that I squeeze. Would it be okay to bring that in? I'm just trying to prepare myself as best I can for this.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Those are excellent strategies. Bring whatever helps you feel safe.",
    "Client: Thank you, that's a relief. I'm still nervous, but knowing I can use these tools makes me feel a bit more in control. I guess what I'm most worried about is how I'll feel afterwards. Will I be okay to drive home? Should I plan to take the rest of the day off work? And how often will we be doing these exposure sessions? I want to be prepared, both mentally and practically.",
    "Therapist: Great questions. Let's plan for aftercare and future sessions now.",
    "Client: That sounds good. I appreciate you taking the time to address all my concerns. It's helping me feel more prepared for this. I know it won't be easy, but I'm starting to see how it could be beneficial. I've been carrying this weight for so long, maybe facing it head-on is what I need to do to finally start healing. I just hope I'm strong enough to get through it.",
    "Therapist: You're showing immense courage. Remember, we're in this together.",
    "Client: Thank you, that means a lot to me. I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Just knowing that you'll be here guiding me through it helps. And you're right, it does take courage. I've spent so long running from these memories, it feels strange to be willingly facing them now. But I'm tired of letting them control my life. If this can help me move forward, then it's worth trying. Okay, let's do this. What's the first step?",
    "Therapist: We'll start slow. Close your eyes when you're ready. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: Okay, I can do that. *takes a deep breath* My eyes are closed now. My heart's racing a bit, but I'm trying to stay calm. I can feel the chair beneath me, the air on my skin. I'm here, in this room, and I'm safe. Alright, I think I'm ready for the next step. What should I focus on first?"
