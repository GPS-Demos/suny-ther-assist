    "Therapist: Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. To be honest, I'm feeling a bit anxious. The idea of revisiting that hostage situation... it's daunting. I've spent so much time trying to forget it all.",
    "Therapist: Your anxiety is understandable. Can you tell me more?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... I've worked hard to build a life after that incident. I have a good job, a supportive partner. I'm worried that diving back into those memories might undo all the progress I've made. What if I can't handle it?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How do you think this might help?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe it could help me process what happened? I still have nightmares sometimes, and certain situations make me feel panicky. If this could reduce those symptoms, it might be worth trying. But I'm still scared.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: How exactly does this work? Will I have to relive everything in detail? And what happens if I get overwhelmed during the process?",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. You can stop anytime. What else?",
    "Client: I guess I'm wondering about the long-term effects. Will this really help me move past the trauma, or will it just bring everything back to the surface?",
    "Therapist: It may be challenging initially, but it often leads to improvement. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm still nervous, but I trust you. And I want to get better, not just for myself but for my partner too. They've been so supportive through all of this. Okay, let's do it. Where do we start?",
    "Therapist: We'll start slowly. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Alright. I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Let's give it a try. Just... please be patient with me if I struggle. This isn't easy for me.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Your bravery is admirable. Let's start gently..."
