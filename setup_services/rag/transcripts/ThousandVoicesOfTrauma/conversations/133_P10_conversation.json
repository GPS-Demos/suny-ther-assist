    "Therapist: Welcome, Fatima. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a part of me that wants to get this over with, but another part that's terrified of reliving it all. My hands are a bit shaky just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's completely normal. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm ready. Where should I start?",
    "Therapist: Start by closing your eyes and taking us to the moment just before the incident.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm... I'm standing on the sidewalk outside my favorite coffee shop. It's a warm day, and I can smell the fresh bread from the bakery next door. I'm waiting for my friend Amira to meet me for lunch. I check my watch - it's 12:45.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear shouting from down the street. At first, I think it's just some rowdy teenagers, but then I see a crowd forming. There's a man... he's on the ground, and there are two police officers standing over him. My heart starts racing.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 40? It's uncomfortable, but I can manage.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: The man on the ground is yelling, \"I didn't do anything!\" He's... he's trying to get up, but one of the officers pushes him back down. Hard. I can hear the thud as his head hits the pavement. My mouth goes dry, and I feel like I can't move.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's happening in your body?",
    "Client: My... my chest feels tight. I'm breathing faster. I want to look away, but I can't. The other officer pulls out his baton, and I... I know what's coming. Oh God, I can't... I can't watch this again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Fatima. Remember, you're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *takes a shaky breath* Okay... The officer raises the baton, and I hear myself shouting, \"Stop!\" But it's like I'm underwater - everything seems muffled and slow. The baton comes down, and the man screams. I've never heard a sound like that before.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 70. My hands are clenched so tight they hurt.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I start fumbling for my phone. My fingers feel numb, but I manage to start recording. The officers see me, and one of them starts walking towards me. He's saying something, but I can't hear him over the blood rushing in my ears.",
    "Therapist: Stay in the moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Terror. Pure terror. I want to run, but my legs won't move. The officer is getting closer, and his face is... it's twisted with anger. I think, \"This is it. They're going to hurt me too.\"",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Fatima. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *breathes deeply* The officer reaches for my phone, but suddenly Amira is there. She grabs my arm and pulls me away. We're running down the street, and I can hear heavy footsteps behind us. My lungs are burning, and I'm crying, but I don't stop running.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 85 now. My heart is pounding so hard I can feel it in my throat.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: We turn a corner and duck into a small alley. Amira is holding me, and I'm shaking uncontrollably. I can still hear the man's screams echoing in my head. I feel... I feel so helpless, so angry. Why didn't I do more? Why couldn't I stop it?",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault, Fatima. You did what you could in a dangerous situation.",
    "Client: I know, but... *voice breaks* I can't stop thinking about what happened to that man after we left. Did they arrest him? Did they hurt him more? I... I have nightmares about it. Sometimes I'm the one on the ground, and no one helps me.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are valid. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. My whole body feels heavy. The fear is still there, but it's... duller now. Maybe a 60?",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: Okay... *takes a deep breath* I can feel the chair beneath me. I can hear the ticking of the clock on your wall. I'm... I'm here, in your office. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Can you tell me one thing you've learned from this experience?",
    "Client: I... I think I've realized how quickly things can escalate. And how important it is to speak up, even when it's scary. But also... how helpless one can feel in the face of authority.",
    "Therapist: Those are powerful insights, Fatima. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained, but also... lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time. My distress is down to maybe a 40 now.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's end the exposure here and debrief.",
    "Client: Okay... *opens eyes* Wow, that was... intense. But I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: You showed incredible strength today. How do you feel about what we've accomplished?",
    "Client: I feel... proud, I guess? And a little surprised at how vivid the memories still are. But also... hopeful? Like maybe I can learn to live with this without it controlling me.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent perspective. What was the most challenging part for you?",
    "Client: Definitely reliving the moment when the officer started coming towards me. That fear... it felt so real, even here in your office.",
    "Therapist: And how did you manage to push through that fear?",
    "Client: I... I reminded myself that I was safe here, like you said. And I focused on my breathing, tried to stay present in the memory without getting lost in it.",
    "Therapist: Those are great coping strategies. What do you think you'll take away from this session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I've realized that I'm stronger than I thought. And that even though the memory is painful, I can face it without falling apart. It's... it's empowering, in a way.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you think this might impact your daily life?",
    "Client: I... I think I might feel less anxious about going out. Maybe I won't avoid that coffee shop anymore. And... maybe I'll feel more confident about speaking up when I see injustice.",
    "Therapist: Those are all positive changes. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I just... I want to thank you. This wasn't easy, but I feel like I've made real progress today. I'm... I'm looking forward to our next session, even if it's challenging.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today, Fatima. We'll continue to build on this progress. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed between sessions.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
