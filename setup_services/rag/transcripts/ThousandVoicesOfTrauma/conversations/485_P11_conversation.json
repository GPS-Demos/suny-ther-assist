    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. Reliving the moment I found out about my brother's death... it's still so raw, you know? I felt my heart racing, just like it did that day. And then, thinking about all the cruel comments online afterward... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The guilt, I think. I keep wondering if I could've done something to prevent it. And then the anger at those strangers who said such horrible things about him online. It's like they were attacking him all over again, and I couldn't protect him.",
    "Therapist: How did that make you feel physically?",
    "Client: My chest felt tight, like I couldn't breathe properly. My hands were shaking, and I felt this knot in my stomach. It's... it's exhausting, reliving it all.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does this connect to your day-to-day experiences?",
    "Client: Well, I... I guess I've been avoiding social media a lot. I'm always worried I'll see something that reminds me of those comments. And I've been having trouble sleeping, replaying that moment when I got the call about my brother. It's affecting my work, my relationships... everything, really.",
    "Therapist: What insights did you gain from today's session?",
    "Client: I... I realized that I'm still carrying so much anger and pain. But also, I noticed that I could get through the memory without completely falling apart. That's... that's progress, right? It still hurts, but maybe it's getting a tiny bit easier to face.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's scary, but... I think it's helping. I want to be able to remember my brother without all this pain and anger. And I want to stop letting those bullies control how I feel. So, yeah, I'm willing to keep going.",
    "Therapist: That's great. What strategies might help you cope between sessions?",
    "Client: I've been trying that breathing exercise you taught me. It helps sometimes when I feel overwhelmed. And... I'm thinking maybe I could start a journal about my brother, focus on the good memories instead of just the loss. Would that be helpful?",
    "Therapist: Excellent idea. How else can we support your progress?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe we could work on ways to handle social media better? And... and perhaps some strategies for when the guilt gets really bad? I know logically it's not my fault, but sometimes the feeling is just so strong.",
    "Therapist: We can definitely address those. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... okay, I think. A bit lighter, maybe? It's like... like I've put down a heavy bag I've been carrying. Not completely, but... it's a start, right?",
    "Therapist: It certainly is. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: Could we... could we maybe talk more about the cyber bullying? I think that's a big part of why I'm still so angry. I want to learn how to deal with that better.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Any final thoughts before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I guess. This isn't easy, but I feel like I'm finally starting to move forward. It's slow, and it hurts, but... I think I'm on the right path. I'm grateful for your help.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work, Sarah. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, I'll be here. Thanks again."
