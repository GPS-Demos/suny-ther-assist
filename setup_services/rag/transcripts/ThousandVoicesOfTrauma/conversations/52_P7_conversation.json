    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you take me back to that moment in the cult?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm there. It's dark, and I can smell incense. We're all gathered in a circle, waiting for the leader to arrive. I'm feeling nervous, my hands are sweaty.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The leader enters. He's wearing his usual white robe. Everyone bows, but I hesitate. I don't want to, but I know what happens if I don't... My heart is racing now.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: He notices my delay. He's walking towards me now, his face twisted in anger. I'm terrified, but I can't move. He reaches out and grabs my arm, twisting it hard. The pain... it's so intense. I can feel tears in my eyes.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: He's shouting at me, calling me a traitor, a non-believer. Everyone is watching, but no one helps. I feel so alone, so ashamed. My arm hurts so much, but I'm more scared of what's coming next.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: He throws me to the ground. I can taste blood in my mouth. He's kicking me now, over and over. I'm curling up, trying to protect myself, but it hurts everywhere. I want to scream, but I can't make a sound.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Remember, you're here now, safe.",
    "Client: The kicking stops, but now he's ordering others to join in. I hear footsteps approaching. More hands grabbing me, more fists hitting me. I'm overwhelmed by pain and fear. I... I can't... This is too much...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing incredibly well.",
    "Client: I... okay. They're all hitting me now. I can hear some of them crying as they do it. They don't want to, but they're scared too. I'm losing consciousness. Everything is fading to black. I'm so relieved it's ending, but I'm terrified of what will happen when I wake up.",
    "Therapist: You've done an amazing job. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Scared. But also... I don't know. Maybe a little stronger? Like I faced it and survived again.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You showed great courage.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to talk about, but it feels a little less overwhelming each time. I just wish... I wish I could have done something different back then.",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. You survived a terrible situation.",
    "Client: I know that logically, but sometimes I still blame myself. I keep thinking about the others who were there. I wonder if they ever got out.",
    "Therapist: Those thoughts are common. We'll work through them.",
    "Client: I hope so. It's been so many years, but sometimes it feels like yesterday. Especially at night, when I'm alone in my house. The memories come flooding back.",
    "Therapist: We'll develop strategies to help with that. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. This process is difficult, but I'm starting to see small changes. I actually slept through the night last week, which hasn't happened in years.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm trying to focus on these small victories. It's just... sometimes the weight of it all feels so heavy. The lost years, the relationships that suffered because of my trauma. It's a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: It is. But you're facing it courageously.",
    "Client: I suppose I am. It's strange to think of myself as courageous. For so long, I've felt weak and powerless. But maybe facing this head-on is a kind of strength?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're showing tremendous strength.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think I need a moment to just breathe and collect myself. This session has been intense, but I feel like we've made some progress today.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. You've done excellent work today."
