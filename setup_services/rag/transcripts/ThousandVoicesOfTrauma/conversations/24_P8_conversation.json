    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like I'm back there again, you know? My heart's racing, and I can feel the sweat on my palms. It's strange because I'm sitting here in this room, but part of me is still in that hostage situation.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... anger? Yeah, there's a lot of anger too. I'm angry that I was put in that situation, angry at the captors, angry at myself for feeling so helpless.",
    "Therapist: Can you tell me more about that helplessness?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. During the situation, I felt completely powerless. I'm a professional, you know? I'm used to being in control, making decisions. But there, I couldn't do anything. I couldn't protect myself or the others. It's like... like being stripped of everything that makes you who you are.",
    "Therapist: How does that memory affect you now?",
    "Client: It... it haunts me. Sometimes I'll be at work, in a meeting, and suddenly I'll feel that same helplessness. My throat tightens, and I can't focus. It's like I'm right back there, waiting for something terrible to happen.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts come up when you have these moments?",
    "Client: I think... I think, \"What if I can't protect my family?\" or \"What if something like that happens again?\" It's irrational, I know, but I can't shake the feeling that I'm always in danger now.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts impact your daily life?",
    "Client: They... they change everything. I'm constantly on edge. I check the locks multiple times before bed. I'm overprotective of my wife and kids. I've even thought about quitting my job and finding something that doesn't require travel. It's... it's exhausting, living like this.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice in your body when you recall the memory?",
    "Client: My muscles tense up, especially in my shoulders and jaw. My breathing gets shallow, and sometimes I feel a bit dizzy. It's like my body is preparing for a fight, even though the danger is long past.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with these physical sensations?",
    "Client: I... I try to breathe deeply. Sometimes I'll count things in the room to ground myself. But often, I just try to push it all away. I know that's not healthy, but it's hard to face it head-on.",
    "Therapist: What's the hardest part about facing these memories?",
    "Client: The guilt, I think. I survived when others didn't. I keep wondering if I could have done more, said something different. Rationally, I know there wasn't anything else I could've done, but emotionally... it's a different story.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt manifest in your life now?",
    "Client: It... it makes me second-guess everything. Every decision feels like it could be life or death. I'm constantly trying to make up for what happened, even in situations that have nothing to do with it. It's like I'm trying to prove to myself that I'm still capable, still worthy.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to you to let go of some of that guilt?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me feels like I don't deserve to let it go. But another part... another part is so tired. I want to be present for my family, to enjoy life again. Maybe letting go would mean I could start living again, instead of just surviving.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea of \"living again\" feel to you?",
    "Client: It's... it's both exciting and terrifying. I want it so badly, but I'm scared. What if I let my guard down and something happens? What if I forget the lessons I learned from that experience? But God, I miss feeling joy, feeling peace. I miss being able to relax without feeling guilty about it.",
    "Therapist: What small step could you take towards that goal?",
    "Client: I... I could try to be more present with my family. Maybe... maybe I could plan a day out with them without constantly scanning for threats. It sounds simple, but it feels monumental.",
    "Therapist: How does thinking about that step make you feel?",
    "Client: Nervous, definitely. But also... hopeful? Yeah, there's a glimmer of hope there. Like maybe, just maybe, I can start to reclaim some of what I've lost. It won't be easy, but... I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: What support do you need to take that step?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to talk to my wife about it. She's been so patient, but I've shut her out a lot. And... and I think I need to keep coming here, keep working through this. It's hard, but it helps to have a safe place to face these memories.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about our session today?",
    "Client: It's been intense. Draining, really. But also... I don't know, maybe cathartic? I feel like I've unpacked some things that have been weighing on me for a long time. It's painful, but there's also a sense of... of progress, I guess. Like I'm finally moving forward instead of just treading water.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant insight. We'll pick up here next time.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's not easy, but... I'm grateful for the help. I think I'm starting to see a way forward, even if it's still a bit foggy. I'm looking forward to our next session."
