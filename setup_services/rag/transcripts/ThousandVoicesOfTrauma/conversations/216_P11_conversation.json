    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Chen?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's not easy revisiting those memories of my brother's passing. The details are so vivid, even after all these years. I can still smell the antiseptic in the hospital room, hear the beeping of the machines... It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What stood out most to you this time?",
    "Client: Um... I think it was the moment when I realized he was really gone. I remember looking at his face and... and it just didn't look like him anymore. That hit me hard today. I felt this crushing weight on my chest, just like I did back then.",
    "Therapist: How does that feeling compare to your day-to-day experiences now?",
    "Client: Well, it's... it's similar to the anxiety I feel sometimes, especially when I'm alone at night. That same tightness in my chest, the feeling of... of loss and helplessness. I guess I never really made that connection before.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. How might this awareness help you moving forward?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe when I feel that anxiety creeping in, I can remind myself that it's not just about the present moment. It's tied to my past experiences, to losing my brother. Perhaps understanding that could help me... I don't know, manage it better? It's still difficult though.",
    "Therapist: It is difficult. What strategies have you found helpful so far?",
    "Client: Well, the breathing exercises we've practiced have been... somewhat helpful. And I've been trying to talk to my roommate more when I'm feeling overwhelmed. It's not easy for me to open up, but... it does provide some relief.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How else has this process been affecting you?",
    "Client: It's strange, but I find myself thinking about happier times with my brother more often now. It's bittersweet, you know? There's pain, but also... a kind of comfort in remembering the good times. I hadn't allowed myself to do that for years.",
    "Therapist: How does that shift feel for you?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually quite nice. Scary sometimes, because I worry about getting too emotional, but... overall, it feels like I'm reclaiming a part of myself that I'd locked away. I just wish... I wish I had started this process earlier in life.",
    "Therapist: It's never too late. What's your takeaway from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I'm realizing that facing these memories head-on, as painful as it is, is helping me understand myself better. My anxiety, my fears... they're all connected to this loss I experienced. And maybe, just maybe, by working through this, I can start to feel more... more at peace with myself and my past.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm nervous, but I think I'm ready. It's not easy at my age to confront these things, but I want to keep going. I want to understand myself better and... and maybe find a way to honor my brother's memory without being consumed by the pain of losing him.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is commendable. Shall we schedule our next session?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I... I appreciate your guidance through this, Dr. Lim. It means a lot to have someone who understands and can help me navigate these complex emotions. Same time next week?",
    "Therapist: Same time next week. Take care, Mr. Chen."
