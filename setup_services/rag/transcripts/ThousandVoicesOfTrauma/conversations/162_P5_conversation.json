    "Therapist: Welcome back. Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of reliving my childhood trauma and the loss of my loved one... it's overwhelming. Can you tell me more about what to expect?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Imaginal exposure helps process traumatic memories. It may be challenging, but I'll support you throughout.",
    "Client: I understand the concept, but I'm worried about losing control of my emotions. Sometimes when I think about my past, I feel like I'm right back there, and it's terrifying. How do we make sure I don't get stuck in that feeling?",
    "Therapist: That's a valid concern. We'll go at your pace, and you can pause anytime. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay, that's reassuring. I've been working hard on my sobriety, and I'm worried this might trigger a relapse. How can we make sure that doesn't happen?",
    "Therapist: Your sobriety is important. We'll monitor your urges and have coping strategies ready. Your strength is admirable.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate that. It's been a long journey, and I don't want to jeopardize my progress. Can you walk me through exactly what we'll be doing in this session?",
    "Therapist: Certainly. You'll recount the traumatic event in detail. I'll guide you with questions, and we'll process your emotions together.",
    "Client: That sounds intense. Will I have to close my eyes? I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that. Being South East Asian, there's also a cultural aspect to processing grief and trauma that I'm not sure how to navigate in this context.",
    "Therapist: Eyes open is fine. We'll respect your cultural background and incorporate it into our approach.",
    "Client: That's a relief. I'm also wondering how this will affect my relationship with my partner. They've been so supportive, but I worry about bringing all this stuff home with me.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to have concerns. We can discuss strategies for communicating with your partner and managing emotions at home.",
    "Client: That would be helpful. I've always struggled with expressing my emotions, especially around my trauma. Growing up, we were taught to keep things to ourselves. How do I start opening up now?",
    "Therapist: Your willingness to try is courageous. We'll take small steps, focusing on creating a safe space for expression.",
    "Client: I appreciate your understanding. I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Can you tell me once more why this is important for my recovery?",
    "Therapist: This process helps reduce PTSD symptoms by allowing you to process and integrate traumatic memories. Your bravery is commendable.",
    "Client: Thank you. That helps put things in perspective. I'm still nervous, but I trust you and the process. I'm ready to take this step towards healing, even if it's difficult.",
    "Therapist: Your readiness is a significant step. Let's begin when you're comfortable. Remember, we're in this together."
