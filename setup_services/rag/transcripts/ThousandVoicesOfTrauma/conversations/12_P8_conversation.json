    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also kind of numb at the same time. You know? I can still see those comments on my screen, all those hateful messages. It's like they're burned into my brain.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I think. No, maybe more like... shame? Yeah, shame. It's this heavy feeling in my chest, like I'm being crushed. I keep thinking about what my brother would say if he could see those messages. He always protected me from bullies when we were kids, but now he's gone, and I feel so... exposed.",
    "Therapist: How does that shame manifest physically?",
    "Client: My shoulders feel tense, like I'm trying to make myself smaller. And my stomach is in knots. I feel hot, especially my face. It's like I can feel the blood rushing to my cheeks, you know? Like everyone can see how pathetic I am.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are accompanying these physical sensations?",
    "Client: I keep hearing this voice in my head saying, \"They're right about you. You're worthless.\" It's so loud, and I can't seem to shut it off. I know logically that it's not true, but emotionally... it feels so real. And then I think about my brother, and how he'd be so disappointed in me for letting these strangers affect me like this.",
    "Therapist: How does thinking about your brother impact your current emotions?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. On one hand, thinking about him makes me feel safer, like he's still watching over me. But then I remember he's gone, and it's like losing him all over again. The grief hits me in waves, you know? And it mixes with this shame from the cyber bullying, creating this... this overwhelming sense of loneliness and vulnerability.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about the intensity of these feelings?",
    "Client: They're... they're pretty intense right now. But, um, I guess they're not as bad as when it first happened. Like, I can breathe through it now. Before, it felt like I was drowning. Now it's more like... I don't know, treading water maybe? It's still exhausting, but I'm keeping my head above water.",
    "Therapist: How does this compare to previous exposures?",
    "Client: It's... it's getting easier, I think. The first few times we did this, I felt like I was right back in that moment, you know? Like I couldn't separate myself from the memory at all. Now, there's a little bit of distance. I can observe the memory without getting completely sucked in. It still hurts, but... I don't feel as powerless.",
    "Therapist: What's helping you maintain that distance?",
    "Client: I've been trying to use those grounding techniques we talked about. Like, focusing on my breath or the feeling of my feet on the floor. And I keep reminding myself that I'm here, in this room, not back in that moment. It's hard, but it helps. And... I don't know if this makes sense, but I've been trying to imagine my brother here with me, supporting me. It's bittersweet, but it gives me strength.",
    "Therapist: How does that image of your brother affect your feelings about the cyber bullying?",
    "Client: It... it helps me put things in perspective, I guess. Like, when I think about my brother and how much he loved me, it makes those hateful comments seem less important. They're still hurtful, but they don't define me. My brother saw the best in me, and I'm trying to hold onto that. It's like... his memory is a shield against the negativity.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your resilience in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I guess I'm stronger than I thought. A few months ago, I couldn't even think about those messages without having a panic attack. Now, it still hurts, but I can talk about it. I can feel the pain without being completely overwhelmed by it. That's progress, right?",
    "Therapist: Indeed. How does recognizing that progress make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of emotions, honestly. There's relief, definitely. And a bit of pride, I guess? But also some guilt. Like, should I be feeling better about this? Am I forgetting my brother by moving forward? And there's still fear. What if I backslide? What if I'm not as strong as I think I am?",
    "Therapist: How might your brother respond to your progress?",
    "Client: He'd... he'd be proud, I think. Yeah, he would. He always encouraged me to stand up for myself. I can almost hear him saying, \"That's my little bro, kicking ass and taking names.\" (chuckles softly) He'd probably tell me to stop second-guessing myself and just keep moving forward.",
    "Therapist: What does moving forward look like for you?",
    "Client: I'm not entirely sure, to be honest. I guess... not letting the fear control me anymore? Being able to use social media without constantly looking over my virtual shoulder. And maybe... maybe using my experience to help others who are going through similar things. My brother always said that helping others was the best way to heal yourself.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea of helping others sit with you?",
    "Client: It feels... right. Like, maybe there's a purpose to all this pain, you know? If I can use what I've been through to make someone else's journey a little easier, then maybe it wasn't all for nothing. It's scary to think about putting myself out there again, but also... kind of exciting? Like I'm reclaiming some of the power I lost.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you could take in that direction?",
    "Client: I... I've been thinking about joining an online support group for cyber bullying survivors. I haven't posted anything yet, just lurked. But maybe... maybe I could share a bit of my story. Not everything, just... a little. Let others know they're not alone. That's something my brother would do.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that potential step?",
    "Client: Nervous, definitely. There's still that voice in the back of my head saying I'll just embarrass myself. But there's also... hope? Yeah, hope. Like maybe I can turn this painful experience into something positive. It's scary, but also kind of empowering. Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. What would you tell that nervous part of yourself?",
    "Client: I'd tell it... it's okay to be scared, but don't let that stop you. You've already survived the worst of it. Sharing your story can't hurt you as much as staying silent. And who knows? Maybe your words will be exactly what someone else needs to hear. That's what my brother would say, anyway. (takes a deep breath) Yeah, I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, I guess? Like some of the weight has been lifted off my shoulders. The memories are still there, and they still hurt, but they don't feel as overwhelming. And there's this... I don't know, spark of something. Hope, maybe? Or determination? It's like I can see a path forward now, even if it's still a bit hazy.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to work on actually writing out my story. Maybe we could go through it together? I'm still nervous about sharing it, but I think it could be a good next step. And maybe we could talk more about how to balance moving forward with honoring my brother's memory. I want to make sure I'm not forgetting him as I heal.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful plan. We'll explore that next time. How are you feeling about ending our session today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... okay, actually. Better than I expected. There's still a lot to work through, but I feel like I've made some real progress today. Thank you for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone to talk to about all of this.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Take care, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. See you then."
