    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Honestly, I'm a bit on edge. We're going to talk about the dog attack, right? I've been thinking about it all week, and it's bringing up a lot of stuff.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We'll take it step by step. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I guess so. Yeah, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm walking through the park near my apartment. It's early evening, and the sun is starting to set. The air feels cool on my skin. I can hear kids playing in the distance, and there's a faint smell of barbecue.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm approaching the bend in the path, you know, where it curves around those big oak trees. And that's when I hear it - this low, rumbling growl. My heart starts racing immediately.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: Uh, probably a 6 or 7. My palms are getting sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Alright. So, I turn to look, and there it is - this massive Rottweiler. Its teeth are bared, and it's staring right at me. God, those eyes... they were so... so cold. I freeze. I can't move. I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay in the moment.",
    "Client: The dog lunges forward, and I stumble backward. I trip over my own feet and fall. The ground is hard, and I feel a sharp pain in my elbow. But I barely notice because the dog is coming at me so fast.",
    "Therapist: What's happening in your body right now?",
    "Client: My heart is pounding. I feel like I can't catch my breath. My muscles are so tense, especially in my legs and arms.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember, you're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: The dog... it's on me in seconds. I throw my arm up to protect my face, and that's when I feel its teeth sink into my forearm. The pain is... it's indescribable. Hot and sharp and overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. Maybe higher. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Carlos. Take another deep breath. Remember, you survived this.",
    "Client: *shaky breath* Okay. I'm... I'm screaming. I can hear myself, but it sounds far away, like it's not even me. The dog is shaking its head, tearing at my arm. I'm hitting it with my free hand, but it's not letting go.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm going to die. I'm terrified. I keep thinking, \"This is it. This is how it ends.\" And I feel so... so helpless.",
    "Therapist: That must have been terrifying. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear shouting. Someone's yelling, \"Hey! Get off him!\" It's a man's voice. Suddenly, the dog releases my arm. I see this guy - he's got a stick or something - and he's chasing the dog away.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel as this is happening?",
    "Client: Relief... but also confusion. It's like my brain can't catch up with what just happened. My arm is throbbing, and I can see blood. A lot of blood.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to maybe a 7. The immediate danger is gone, but I'm still... I'm still scared.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing it. What happens after the man chases the dog away?",
    "Client: He comes back to me. He's asking if I'm okay, but I can barely speak. I'm shaking all over. He helps me sit up, and I can see other people gathering around. Someone's on the phone - I think they're calling an ambulance.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling physically at this point?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in shock, I think. My arm hurts so bad, but it's like I'm disconnected from it. I feel dizzy and nauseous. And cold. I remember feeling so cold, even though it was a warm evening.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response to trauma. What happens next?",
    "Client: The ambulance arrives. The paramedics are talking to me, but I can barely focus on what they're saying. They're wrapping my arm, and it stings. I keep looking around, afraid the dog might come back.",
    "Therapist: That fear is understandable. What's your SUDS level as you're in the ambulance?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to maybe a 5 or 6. I'm still scared, but I feel safer with the paramedics.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're doing really well, Carlos. Can you tell me about arriving at the hospital?",
    "Client: It's all a blur. Bright lights, lots of voices. They take me to a room, and a doctor examines my arm. I remember him saying something about stitches and possible nerve damage. That's when it really hits me - how bad this is.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling emotionally at this point?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm overwhelmed. Scared about the extent of the injury. Angry that this happened to me. And... and ashamed. I keep thinking I should have done something differently, that I should have been able to protect myself better.",
    "Therapist: Those are all normal reactions. Remember, this wasn't your fault. What happens after the doctor examines you?",
    "Client: They clean the wounds. It hurts so much, even with the local anesthetic. I can see the damage clearly now - these deep gashes in my arm. It makes me feel sick. They start stitching me up, and I have to look away.",
    "Therapist: That must have been difficult to see. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how this will affect my life. Will I be able to use my arm normally? What about scars? And... and I keep seeing the dog's face. Those eyes. I can't shake it.",
    "Therapist: It's natural for those images to stay with you. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around a 6. Talking about it is hard, but it's not as intense as reliving the attack itself.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Carlos. Let's continue. What happens after they finish treating your arm?",
    "Client: They keep me for observation. I'm lying in the hospital bed, and it's quiet. Too quiet. Every time I close my eyes, I see the dog. I can't sleep. I keep replaying the attack in my mind, thinking about what I could have done differently.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. How long do they keep you in the hospital?",
    "Client: They release me the next day. A friend comes to pick me up. I'm... I'm exhausted. Physically and emotionally drained. My arm is bandaged and in a sling, and it hurts to move it.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel as you're leaving the hospital?",
    "Client: Vulnerable. Like the world isn't safe anymore. I'm anxious about going outside, worried about seeing dogs. And I feel... I feel different. Like something fundamental has changed in me.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction to trauma. What's your SUDS level as we finish talking about this experience?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about a 4 now. Talking about it is hard, but it also feels... I don't know, maybe a little cathartic?",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Carlos. You've done really well today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm tired, but... but I feel like I've accomplished something. It's still scary to think about, but maybe a little less overwhelming than before.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. Remember, healing takes time. We'll continue working through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I appreciate your help with this. It's not easy, but I think it's important.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Carlos. Your courage is commendable. We'll end here for today. Remember to practice your breathing exercises if you feel anxious later.",
    "Client: I will. Thanks again.",
    "Therapist: Take care, Carlos. I'll see you next week."
