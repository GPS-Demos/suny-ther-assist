    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Johnson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. I know we're going to be talking about my experiences in the military, and that's always difficult for me.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'll try to keep that in mind. Where should I start?",
    "Therapist: Let's begin with the memory we discussed last time.",
    "Client: Okay... It was a hot day in Afghanistan. I was on patrol with my unit. The air was thick with dust, and the sun was beating down on us. We were all on edge, knowing that anything could happen at any moment.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there was a loud explosion. It came from a building to our right. I remember the ringing in my ears and the chaos that erupted. People were shouting, but it all sounded muffled.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you recall?",
    "Client: I... I saw one of my teammates go down. There was blood... so much blood. I wanted to run to him, but we were trained to secure the area first. I felt so helpless, watching him lie there.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) I can still smell the gunpowder and the dust. The air was filled with smoke. I remember thinking, \"This is it. We might not make it out of here.\"",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: We took cover behind some rubble. I could hear bullets whizzing past us. My heart was pounding so hard I thought it might burst out of my chest. I was trying to stay focused, but all I could think about was my fallen teammate and whether he was still alive.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. How were you feeling in that moment?",
    "Client: Terrified. Angry. Confused. It all happened so fast, but at the same time, it felt like it was in slow motion. I remember looking at the faces of my unit members. We were all scared, but we had a job to do.",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly difficult.",
    "Client: It was. We managed to call for backup and started returning fire. The next few minutes were a blur of gunshots, shouting, and movement. I kept checking on my fallen teammate whenever I could. He wasn't moving.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Take a deep breath if you need to.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Thank you. It's hard to talk about this. I feel like I'm right back there sometimes.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Eventually, the firing stopped. We secured the area and I finally got to my teammate. He... he didn't make it. I remember feeling this overwhelming sense of guilt and failure. Why him and not me?",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have felt that way.",
    "Client: I know logically that it wasn't my fault, but emotionally... it's still hard. We lost two more that day. I can still see their faces, hear their voices. It haunts me.",
    "Therapist: You're incredibly brave for sharing this.",
    "Client: Sometimes I wonder if I could have done something differently. If I had been faster, or more alert. Maybe they'd still be alive.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those thoughts.",
    "Client: The hardest part was writing the letters to their families. How do you tell someone that their loved one isn't coming home? That they died under your command?",
    "Therapist: That must have been an enormous responsibility.",
    "Client: It was. I felt like I had failed them all - my team, their families. The guilt was... is... overwhelming at times.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well processing this.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard, but talking about it... it helps. Sometimes I feel like I'll never be free of these memories.",
    "Therapist: It's a process. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I hope so. I want to honor their memory by living well, but some days it's so hard to shake off the heaviness of it all.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's comforting to know I'm not alone in this journey. Sometimes I worry that I'll never be the same person I was before all this happened.",
    "Therapist: Change is part of healing. You're strong.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm trying to believe that. It's just... some days are harder than others. The nightmares, the flashbacks, they can be so intense.",
    "Therapist: We'll address those symptoms too.",
    "Client: I hope so. I want to be able to sleep through the night again, to not jump at every loud noise. To be able to talk about my experiences without feeling like I'm right back there in the middle of it all.",
    "Therapist: That's a good goal. We'll work towards it.",
    "Client: Thank you. I know it's a long road ahead, but I'm committed to this process. I want to get better, for myself and for my family. They've been so patient and supportive through all of this.",
    "Therapist: Their support is valuable. You're doing well.",
    "Client: It really is. I don't know where I'd be without them. Sometimes I feel guilty for putting them through this, for not being the spouse or parent I used to be.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have those feelings.",
    "Client: I know. I'm trying to be kinder to myself, to remember that healing takes time. It's just hard when the memories feel so fresh, even after all these years.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. Be patient with yourself.",
    "Client: I will try. Thank you for listening and guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't judge.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Our time is almost up.",
