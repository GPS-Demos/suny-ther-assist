    "Therapist: Welcome, Rahul. Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Are you ready to revisit the bullying incident?",
    "Client: I think so, Dr. Thompson. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm back in high school, walking down the hallway. I can see the lockers, smell the musty air. Suddenly, I hear laughter behind me. It's them again. My heart starts racing, and I feel my palms getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with that memory.",
    "Client: They're getting closer. I can hear their footsteps. One of them shoves me from behind, and I stumble forward. \"Hey, curry boy!\" they shout. I feel so small, so helpless. I want to run, but I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: They surround me, laughing and mocking my accent. I can't breathe. I'm trying to hold back tears, but they're welling up. One of them grabs my backpack and dumps its contents on the floor. My books, my lunch, everything scattered. I feel so humiliated.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I bend down to pick up my things, and they kick them away. \"Go back to your country!\" one of them yells. I feel a surge of anger, but also intense fear. I want to fight back, but I'm outnumbered. I feel so alone.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those feelings. You're doing great.",
    "Client: A teacher walks by, but she doesn't stop. She just glances at us and keeps walking. I feel betrayed, like no one cares. The bullies high-five each other and walk away, laughing. I'm left there, kneeling on the floor, surrounded by my scattered belongings. I feel utterly defeated.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. I can feel my heart racing even now. But talking about it... it feels different this time. Like I'm observing it from a distance. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's a common experience. You're doing well.",
    "Client: I remember gathering my things, my hands shaking. I was late for class, but I couldn't bring myself to go. I hid in the bathroom instead, crying silently in one of the stalls. I felt so ashamed, so angry at myself for not standing up to them.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to acknowledge those feelings. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I stayed there until the bell rang. When I finally left, my eyes were red and puffy. I told everyone I had allergies. I didn't want anyone to know how weak I felt. That night, I couldn't sleep. I kept reliving it over and over in my head.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory very well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's strange, Dr. Thompson. Talking about it is still painful, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming as it used to. Like the memory is losing some of its power over me. Is that part of the process?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's often part of the healing process. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I think... I think I'm starting to understand that it wasn't my fault. I was just a kid, and they were the ones in the wrong. But it still hurts to remember how helpless I felt.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. You're doing great work.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Thompson. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without breaking down completely. It's still hard, but it feels... manageable now. Like I'm regaining some control over the memory.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How are you feeling about ending our session?",
    "Client: I think I'm ready to stop for today. It's been intense, but I feel... lighter somehow. Like I've let go of a little bit of the weight I've been carrying. Is it okay if we continue this in our next session?",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've done very well today. We'll pick up here next time.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Thompson. I appreciate your guidance and support through this. It means a lot to me.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Rahul. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
