    "Therapist: Alright, Mrs. Lee, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I understand why we're doing this.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your current SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10. My hands are a little clammy.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and describe the memory.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) I'm back in Afghanistan. The air is hot and dusty. I can smell diesel fuel and hear the hum of generators. We're on patrol, walking through a small village. Everything seems quiet, but there's tension in the air. I'm scanning the windows and rooftops, my rifle at the ready.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud explosion to our right. I'm knocked off my feet, my ears ringing. There's screaming and gunfire. I can taste dirt and blood in my mouth. My heart is racing, and I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 7. My chest feels tight, and my hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Keep going. You're doing well.",
    "Client: I scramble to my feet, trying to find cover. I see one of my squad members down, not moving. I want to help him, but bullets are flying everywhere. I'm frozen, torn between duty and self-preservation. The guilt... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's happening in your body?",
    "Client: My stomach is in knots. I feel nauseous and light-headed. It's like I'm there again, reliving it all.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) It's... it's a 9. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: (Taking shaky breaths) I finally move, dragging my wounded teammate behind a crumbling wall. His blood is on my hands, warm and sticky. I'm trying to apply pressure to his wound, but there's so much blood. I'm terrified he's going to die right there in my arms.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I can almost smell the blood. My hands are tingling, like they're covered in it again. It's... it's too much.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Current SUDS?",
    "Client: (Breathing deeply) It's still high... maybe an 8. But I'm... I'm okay. I can continue.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The firefight seems to last forever. I'm alternating between returning fire and trying to keep my friend alive. I can hear choppers approaching for evacuation. Relief washes over me, but then I look down at my hands, covered in blood, and the reality of what just happened hits me hard.",
    "Therapist: And now? How are you feeling?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to fade a bit. My heart isn't racing as much. SUDS is maybe a 6 now.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing it well.",
    "Client: As the choppers land, kicking up dust everywhere, I help load my wounded teammate. The guilt and fear are still there, but there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe pride? That we made it through, that I didn't freeze completely.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5 now. I'm feeling more present in the room with you.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's start winding down.",
    "Client: (Sighs) Okay. As we lift off, I'm watching the village shrink below us. I'm exhausted, covered in dirt and blood, but alive. There's a mix of relief and dread, knowing we'll have to go out again tomorrow.",
    "Therapist: And how do you feel now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. SUDS is about a 3. I feel drained, but also... lighter? Like I've let something go.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You did very well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was tough, but... I think it helped. I didn't think I could face those memories, but I did.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. Let's debrief..."
