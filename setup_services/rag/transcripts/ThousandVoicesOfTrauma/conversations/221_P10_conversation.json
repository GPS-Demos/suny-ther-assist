    "Therapist: Welcome back. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. My heart's already racing just thinking about revisiting that day. But I know it's important, so I'm trying to stay focused.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. Let's do this before I lose my nerve.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm on my way home from the grocery store. It's a warm evening, and the sun is just starting to set. I can smell the exhaust from the cars and hear the distant sound of sirens. I'm walking quickly, eager to get home and start dinner.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: As I turn the corner onto my street, I see flashing lights. There's a commotion up ahead. I can hear shouting, and my heart starts to race. I... I see a group of police officers surrounding someone on the ground. They're... they're hitting him with batons. Oh god, there's so much blood...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 7. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I freeze. I can't move. I want to help, but I'm terrified. The man on the ground is crying out in pain. He's begging them to stop. I can see his face now... he looks so much like my brother. I feel sick.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: One of the officers notices me. He yells at me to keep moving. But I can't. My feet won't work. I'm shaking all over. The officer starts walking towards me, his hand on his gun. I... I think I'm going to faint.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... okay. I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: The officer reaches me. He grabs my arm roughly and starts pushing me away from the scene. I can smell the sweat and leather from his uniform. My groceries fall to the ground, and I hear the eggs crack. I'm crying now, silently. I can't stop staring at the man on the ground. He's not moving anymore.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Helpless. So incredibly helpless and angry. I want to scream, but no sound comes out.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here. Continue.",
    "Client: The officer shoves me around the corner, out of sight of the scene. He tells me to go home and forget what I saw. His voice is cold, threatening. I stumble away, leaving my groceries behind. I can't stop shaking. I... I run the rest of the way home.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's still high... maybe an 8. My hands are sweating.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great. What happens when you get home?",
    "Client: I... I lock the door behind me and slide down to the floor. I can't stop crying. I feel so powerless, so angry. I want to call someone, anyone, but I'm afraid. What if they come after me? What if they hurt me too? I... I end up sitting there for hours, just staring at the wall.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I keep seeing that man's face. I wonder if he's alive. I feel guilty for not doing more, for running away. I'm angry at the police, at myself, at the whole system. I feel like I can't trust anyone anymore.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe a 6 now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's continue. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I finally manage to get up. My legs are stiff from sitting so long. I turn on the TV, hoping for a distraction, but there's nothing about the incident on the news. It's like it never happened. That makes me feel even worse, like I'm going crazy.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Isolated. Like I'm carrying this huge secret and I can't tell anyone. I'm scared and angry and... and I feel so alone.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. You're not alone now. Keep going.",
    "Client: I can't sleep that night. Every time I close my eyes, I see that man's face, hear his screams. I keep replaying the scene, wondering what I could have done differently. By morning, I'm exhausted and jumpy.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 5. I'm feeling drained.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. What happens the next day?",
    "Client: I... I call in sick to work. I can't face anyone. I spend the day inside, checking news sites obsessively for any mention of what happened. But there's nothing. I feel like I'm losing my mind. Every time I hear a siren, I jump. I keep expecting the police to show up at my door.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with these feelings?",
    "Client: I... I don't, really. I just try to distract myself. I clean the apartment, I reorganize my closet, anything to keep my hands busy. But my mind keeps going back to that night. I feel like I'm trapped in a nightmare I can't wake up from.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's around a 4 now. Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also a relief.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's continue. How does this experience affect you in the following days?",
    "Client: I... I become paranoid. I start taking different routes home, avoiding that street entirely. I flinch every time I see a police car. I have nightmares almost every night. Sometimes I'm the one on the ground, being beaten. Other times I'm watching, unable to move or speak.",
    "Therapist: How does this impact your daily life?",
    "Client: It... it changes everything. I start isolating myself. I cancel plans with friends, make excuses not to go out. I'm constantly on edge, expecting danger around every corner. My work suffers because I can't concentrate. I feel like I'm living in a fog of fear and anger.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 3. Talking about it... it's helping, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're making progress. What do you wish you could have done differently?",
    "Client: I... I wish I had been braver. I wish I had spoken up, or tried to help somehow. But then I think... what if they had hurt me too? What if I had made things worse? I don't know. I just... I wish I could have done something.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those thoughts. Remember, you were in a dangerous situation.",
    "Client: I know, but... it's hard not to feel guilty. I keep wondering about that man. Did he survive? Is he okay? I'll never know, and that haunts me.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. But also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also like letting out a breath I've been holding for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a good sign. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 2 now. I feel drained, but... okay.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well today. How do you feel about ending the session here?",
    "Client: I think... I think that's good. It's a lot to process, but I'm glad we did this.",
    "Therapist: I'm proud of the work you've done today. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later. We'll talk more next session.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think this is helping. It's hard, but... I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: That's great to hear. Take care of yourself, and I'll see you next time."
