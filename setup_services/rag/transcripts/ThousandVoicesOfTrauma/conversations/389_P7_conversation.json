    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you start by describing the natural disaster you experienced?",
    "Client: Okay... It was a severe hurricane. I was in my dorm room when it hit. The wind was so loud, like a freight train. I remember feeling the building shake and hearing windows shattering. I was terrified.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you saw and felt.",
    "Client: The power went out, and it was pitch black. I could hear people screaming in the hallways. I huddled in the corner of my room, clutching my phone. The battery was dying, and I couldn't reach my parents. I felt so alone and helpless.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe now.",
    "Client: My heart was racing, and I couldn't breathe properly. I kept thinking about my family, wondering if they were okay. The storm seemed to go on forever. Water started seeping under my door, and I panicked, thinking the whole building might flood.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory bravely. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure I can...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. Take a deep breath. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Okay... As the water rose, I climbed onto my desk. I was shaking uncontrollably. The noise was deafening - wind howling, things crashing outside. I felt so small and insignificant against the power of nature. It brought back memories of... of the abuse. That same feeling of helplessness and fear.",
    "Therapist: You're very courageous. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I closed my eyes and tried to imagine being somewhere else, anywhere else. But the sounds and the fear kept pulling me back. I started crying, thinking I might die there, alone in the dark. The storm raged on for hours, and all I could do was wait and hope.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an amazing job. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard to talk about. My heart is racing just thinking about it. But I also feel a bit relieved, like I'm finally acknowledging how scared I was.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're processing the experience.",
    "Client: When the storm finally passed, I was exhausted and numb. The hallways were flooded, and there was debris everywhere. It looked like a war zone. I remember stumbling out of the building, seeing the devastation, and feeling guilty for surviving when others might not have.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have mixed feelings. You're safe now.",
    "Client: In the days that followed, I couldn't sleep. Every loud noise made me jump. I felt on edge all the time, like another disaster could happen at any moment. It was similar to how I felt after the abuse - always waiting for the next bad thing to happen.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. How do you feel about sharing this?",
    "Client: It's difficult, but also... I don't know, maybe a bit empowering? Like I'm finally facing it instead of trying to push it away. But it's bringing up a lot of emotions I've been trying to avoid.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. You're confronting these memories.",
    "Client: I guess so. It's just... the hurricane brought back so many feelings from the abuse. The helplessness, the fear, the sense of being out of control. It's like it reopened old wounds I thought had healed.",
    "Therapist: It's common for trauma to resurface. You're handling it well.",
    "Client: Thank you. It helps to talk about it, even though it's painful. I've been carrying this weight for so long, trying to act like everything's fine. But in reality, I've been struggling with nightmares, anxiety, and depression ever since.",
    "Therapist: Acknowledging these feelings is important. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I hope so. I want to move past this, to not let these experiences define me. But it's hard when they feel so overwhelming sometimes.",
    "Therapist: That's a natural part of healing. You're on the right path.",
    "Client: I think I need a break. This has been intense, but... I feel like I've taken a step forward today.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You've done excellent work. Let's end here for today."
