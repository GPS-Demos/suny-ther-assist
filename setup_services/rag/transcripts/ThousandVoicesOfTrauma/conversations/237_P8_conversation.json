    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling pretty shaken up, to be honest. My heart's still racing, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's like I'm right back there, you know? I can smell the sweat and hear the shouting. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. How angry I am that this happened. Not just to me, but to so many others. It's like... I'm reliving the fear, but also feeling this intense rage. Why did they have to be so violent? We weren't doing anything wrong. We were just peacefully protesting.",
    "Therapist: I hear the anger and fear in your voice. Can you tell me more about that?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a storm inside me. The fear is this cold, sinking feeling in my gut. But the anger, it's hot. It's in my fists, my jaw. I want to scream, to fight back. But then I remember how powerless I was, and it just turns into this... this despair. I feel so... small. Like nothing I do matters.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly challenging. How does this connect to your past experiences?",
    "Client: God, it... it brings me right back to when I was a kid. The abuse, you know? That same feeling of being trapped, of not being able to escape or fight back. It's like history repeating itself, but on a larger scale. And it makes me wonder... will I ever truly be safe?",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. What sensations are you noticing in your body right now?",
    "Client: My muscles are so tense. Especially in my shoulders and neck. I realize I'm clenching my jaw too. And there's this... this hollow feeling in my stomach. Like I'm about to be sick. It's hard to take a full breath. Everything feels... constricted.",
    "Therapist: I see. And as you sit with these sensations, what comes up for you?",
    "Client: I... I feel vulnerable. Exposed. Like at any moment, something bad could happen. But there's also this... this tiny spark of something else. Maybe... resilience? I survived before. I'm surviving now. It's hard, but... I'm still here, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does acknowledging that resilience feel?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. Part of me feels a bit stronger, like maybe I can face this. But another part feels... almost guilty? Like, why did I survive when others didn't? And then I feel angry again, because no one should have to \"survive\" police brutality. It shouldn't happen in the first place.",
    "Therapist: Those are very valid feelings. How do you think this experience has changed you?",
    "Client: I think it's made me more aware. More... vigilant, I guess. But also more determined. I want to speak out, to make changes. But I'm scared too. What if it happens again? What if next time, I'm not so lucky? It's like I'm constantly torn between wanting to fight and wanting to hide.",
    "Therapist: That's a challenging balance. What helps you feel safer or more grounded?",
    "Client: Talking about it helps, actually. As hard as it is. And... being with my family. My wife, she's been my rock through all this. When I'm home, with her and our kids, I feel... not exactly safe, but... protected, I guess. Like I have a buffer between me and the world.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful that you have that support. How else has this affected your relationships?",
    "Client: It's... it's been tough. I find myself getting irritated easily, especially with my kids. I hate that. I don't want to snap at them, but sometimes the tension just... boils over. With my wife, I've been more distant. It's hard to be intimate when I feel so... raw. But she's been patient. Understanding. I'm trying to open up more, to let her in.",
    "Therapist: It sounds like you're working hard to process this. What's giving you hope right now?",
    "Client: Hope? That's... that's a big word. But I guess... seeing people come together. The protests, the conversations that are happening. It feels like maybe, just maybe, things could change. And therapy, too. As hard as this is, I feel like I'm starting to understand myself better. To see how my past and present connect. It's painful, but... maybe it's the first step to healing.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How do you want to use this understanding moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I want to find a way to use my voice. To share my story, maybe help others who've been through similar experiences. But I also want to focus on healing myself. Finding ways to feel safer in my own skin, to be more present with my family. It's a long road, but... I think I'm ready to walk it.",
    "Therapist: That's incredibly brave. How are you feeling now, compared to when we started?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, honestly. But also... lighter, somehow? Like I've set down a heavy load, even if just for a moment. There's still so much to process, but I feel... I don't know, maybe a bit more hopeful? Like maybe I can face this, one step at a time.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing so openly. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to explore more about how to manage these intense emotions day-to-day. And maybe... maybe start talking about how to channel this experience into something positive. Is that... is that something we can work on?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll start there next time. How would you like to close our session today?",
    "Client: Could we... could we just sit in silence for a minute? I need to... to ground myself before I leave. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take that minute now."
