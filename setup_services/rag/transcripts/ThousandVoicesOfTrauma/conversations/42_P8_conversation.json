    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart is still racing, and I feel kind of shaky. The memory of that cyber bullying incident was so vivid, it's like I was right back there, reading those horrible messages all over again.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: (inhales deeply) It's just... I feel so exposed and vulnerable. Like everyone can see all my flaws and weaknesses. Those messages they sent, they were so cruel. I keep hearing their words in my head, telling me I'm worthless, that I don't deserve success or happiness. And even though I know it's not true, part of me still believes it.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What physical sensations are you experiencing?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, like there's a weight pressing down on it. My hands are clammy, and there's this knot in my stomach. It's like my body is preparing for another attack, even though I know I'm safe here.",
    "Therapist: How do these sensations compare to when the bullying was happening?",
    "Client: They're... they're similar, but not as intense. Back then, I felt like I couldn't breathe. I'd wake up every morning dreading to check my phone or computer. Now, it's more of an echo of those feelings. It's still uncomfortable, but I can manage it better.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I'm thinking about how unfair it all was. I didn't do anything to deserve that treatment. And I'm angry - at them for being so cruel, but also at myself for letting it affect me so much. I keep wondering if I could have done something differently, if I could have stood up for myself more. But then I remember how paralyzed with fear I was, how isolated I felt.",
    "Therapist: How does reflecting on this memory now differ from before we started therapy?",
    "Client: It's... it's different. Before, I couldn't even think about it without having a full-blown panic attack. Now, it's painful, but I can talk about it. I can acknowledge what happened without feeling like I'm right back in that moment. And I think... I think I'm starting to see that their words don't define me. It's still hard, but I'm beginning to separate my worth from their cruelty.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant shift. What do you think has contributed to this change?",
    "Client: I guess... talking about it here, in a safe space. Learning coping strategies has helped too. And maybe just time? It's like, the more I face it, the less power it has over me. Don't get me wrong, it still hurts, but it's not consuming me like it used to.",
    "Therapist: How does this progress make you feel about your recovery journey?",
    "Client: It's... encouraging, I suppose. There are days when I feel like I'm not making any progress at all, but then I have moments like this where I can see how far I've come. It gives me hope that maybe, one day, this won't have such a strong hold on me. That I can fully reclaim my life and my confidence.",
    "Therapist: What would that look like for you?",
    "Client: Hmm... I think it would mean being able to put myself out there again, professionally and personally, without constantly fearing judgment or attack. To be able to share my thoughts and ideas without that voice in my head telling me I'm not good enough. To wake up in the morning and not have that moment of dread. To feel... free, I guess. Free from the shadow of what happened.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful vision. How does imagining that future self feel?",
    "Client: It feels... almost unreal, to be honest. Like it's something that could happen to someone else, but not to me. But at the same time, there's a part of me that's starting to believe it's possible. It's scary, but also exciting. I want to be that person, to feel that freedom. I'm just... I'm not sure how to get there from here.",
    "Therapist: What small step could you take towards that vision?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe I could try sharing something small online? Like a photo or a comment on a friend's post. Something that puts me out there a little bit, but not too much. Just to start rebuilding that confidence. It's terrifying to think about, but I also know I can't hide forever if I want to move forward.",
    "Therapist: How does the idea of taking that step make you feel?",
    "Client: It's a mix of emotions. There's fear, definitely. My heart rate picks up just thinking about it. But there's also a tiny spark of excitement. Like, maybe this could be the start of reclaiming my life. And there's pride too, I think. Pride that I'm even considering it, when a few months ago I couldn't even look at social media without having a panic attack.",
    "Therapist: That's a complex set of emotions. What do you need to feel safe taking that step?",
    "Client: I think... I need to remember that I have support. That if something does go wrong, I have tools to cope with it now. And maybe I need to start really small - like, sharing something in a private group first, before putting anything out publicly. And I think I need to keep reminding myself that other people's opinions don't define my worth. That's still hard for me to believe sometimes, but I'm working on it.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like thoughtful strategies. How do you feel about our session today?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but in a good way? Like I've done some hard work. It's still difficult to face these memories, but I feel like each time I do, I gain a little more strength. And talking through it all helps me see things more clearly. I'm grateful for this safe space to process everything.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for your openness. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I don't think so. I just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't judge. I know I have a long way to go, but I feel like I'm on the right path.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue this work in our next session. Take care."
