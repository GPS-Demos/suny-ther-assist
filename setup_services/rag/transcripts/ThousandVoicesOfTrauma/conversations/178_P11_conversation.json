    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Singh?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure, Dr. Patel. It's a mix of emotions, really. Going through that memory of being bullied as a child, it brought up a lot of old feelings. But then, connecting it to the recent news about police brutality... it's overwhelming. I feel angry, scared, and somehow... small again.",
    "Therapist: Understandable. What stood out most?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. Both as a child being bullied and now, seeing these incidents of police brutality. It's like... no matter how much I've grown, how successful I've become in my career, there's still this part of me that feels powerless. And it's frustrating because I want to protect my family, my community, but sometimes it feels like we're still just... targets.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your daily life?",
    "Client: Well, it's... it's always there, you know? This underlying anxiety. I find myself being overly cautious in public spaces, especially around authority figures. I'm constantly on edge, watching for any sign of threat. It's exhausting. And I think it's affecting my relationship with my wife and kids too. I'm not as present as I should be, always distracted by these worries.",
    "Therapist: What insights have you gained today?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm starting to see how deeply rooted this fear is. It's not just about the bullying or the current events. It's this... this cumulative effect of feeling marginalized and threatened. But also, I realized during the exposure that I'm not that helpless child anymore. I have resources, a voice. Maybe I need to find ways to use that, to contribute to change somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How might you act on it?",
    "Client: I've been thinking... maybe I could get involved in community organizations working on these issues. Or even start discussions at work about diversity and inclusion. It's scary to think about being so... visible, I guess. But staying silent isn't helping either. And maybe, by doing something, I'll feel less helpless.",
    "Therapist: Excellent insight. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: A bit drained, honestly. But also... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful? It's like I've opened a door I've been avoiding for a long time. It's scary, but maybe necessary. I just... I want to feel safe, you know? And I want my children to feel safe in a way I never did.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful motivator. What's your takeaway?",
    "Client: I think... I need to face these fears head-on. Not just in our sessions, but in my daily life too. Maybe if I start speaking up more, taking action in small ways, it'll help me feel more in control. And perhaps it'll help me be more present with my family instead of always being on guard. It's not going to be easy, but... I think it's necessary for my recovery.",
    "Therapist: Excellent progress. How will you care for yourself today?",
    "Client: I think I'll take a walk in the park with my wife this evening. Just... try to be present in the moment, enjoy the fresh air. And maybe I'll share a bit of what we discussed today with her. She's been so supportive, and I think opening up might help. Is that... is that a good idea?",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a thoughtful plan. How else can I support you?",
    "Client: I... I think I might need some guidance on how to start these conversations outside of our sessions. Both with my family and potentially in my community. I want to make changes, but I'm not sure how to begin without feeling overwhelmed. Could we maybe discuss some strategies in our next session?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll address that next time. Anything else?",
    "Client: No, I think that's all for now. Thank you, Dr. Patel. This session was difficult, but I feel like I've made some important realizations. I'm nervous about what comes next, but also... maybe a little excited? Is that strange?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a sign of progress. Well done today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'll see you next week then. And I'll try to journal about my thoughts and feelings after our walk this evening. That might help me process things further. Have a good day, Dr. Patel.",
    "Therapist: You too, Mr. Singh. Take care."
