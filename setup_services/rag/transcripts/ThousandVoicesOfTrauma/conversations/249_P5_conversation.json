    "Therapist: Mr. Karim, today we'll begin imaginal exposure. Are you ready to discuss this?",
    "Client: I suppose so, doctor. I'm not entirely sure what that means, though. It sounds a bit intimidating, to be honest. Is this about reliving my experiences in the cult?",
    "Therapist: Essentially, yes. It's a way to process those memories safely. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: I'm... nervous. I've spent years trying to forget those times. The thought of purposely remembering them makes my stomach churn. But if you think it will help, I'm willing to try. I just don't want to feel like I'm back there again.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Well, what exactly will I be doing? And how long will this take? I'm not as young as I used to be, and my energy isn't what it once was. I worry about getting too tired or overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: You'll recount your experiences aloud. We'll start small, 15-20 minutes. Your comfort is priority.",
    "Client: I see. That doesn't sound too bad, I suppose. But what if I start to panic? Sometimes when I think about those days, I feel like I can't breathe. And with my depression... well, I worry this might make things worse.",
    "Therapist: If you feel overwhelmed, we'll pause. I'll guide you through grounding techniques. Your safety is paramount.",
    "Client: That's reassuring, thank you. I appreciate your patience with me. It's not easy being my age and dealing with all this. Sometimes I wonder if it's too late for me to heal from all of this.",
    "Therapist: It's never too late for healing, Mr. Karim. Your courage is admirable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: I... yes, I think I'm ready. But could you tell me a bit more about what to expect? Will I feel different after this? I'm hoping this might help me sleep better at night. The nightmares have been getting worse lately.",
    "Therapist: You may feel emotional during and after. It's normal. Many find relief with time. Nightmares often improve.",
    "Client: I understand. It's a bit like cleaning out an old wound, isn't it? Painful at first, but necessary for healing. I just hope I can get through this without breaking down completely. I've always prided myself on being strong, you know.",
    "Therapist: Strength isn't about not breaking down. It's about facing fears. You're demonstrating that now.",
    "Client: Thank you, doctor. That means a lot to me. I suppose I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Where should I start? Should I begin with how I first got involved with the cult, or jump right into the more difficult memories?",
    "Therapist: Let's start with your first memory of the cult. Take a deep breath, and when you're ready, describe it.",
    "Client: Alright. Here goes... It was a warm summer evening. I remember the smell of jasmine in the air..."
