    "Therapist: Welcome, Amina. How are you feeling today as we begin our session?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about my experiences as a refugee, and it's not easy to revisit those memories.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate that. It's just... thinking about those times brings back so many difficult emotions. I remember the day we had to leave our home. It was early morning, and we could hear gunfire in the distance. My heart was racing, and I felt so helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: We grabbed what we could carry and left everything else behind. The streets were chaotic, people running, screaming. I held onto my little sister's hand so tightly, afraid I might lose her in the crowd. The smell of smoke was everywhere, and I could see buildings burning in the distance. It felt like the world was ending.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that memory. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) It's hard to stay there. I remember feeling so scared and confused. We walked for hours, my feet aching, my throat dry from the dust. We didn't know where we were going, just that we had to get away. I kept looking back, hoping to see our neighborhood one last time, but it was lost in the haze of smoke and distance.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Amina. Keep going.",
    "Client: We reached a makeshift camp as night fell. There were so many people, all looking as lost and frightened as we felt. We had to sleep on the ground, huddled together for warmth. I remember lying awake, listening to the sounds of people crying, children whimpering. I felt so alone, even surrounded by all those people.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) The hardest part was not knowing what would happen next. Would we ever go home? Would we find a safe place? The uncertainty was overwhelming. I felt responsible for my younger siblings, trying to be strong for them, but inside I was terrified.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: In the following days, we moved from camp to camp. The conditions were terrible - not enough food, no clean water, and the constant fear of violence. I remember one night when there was a commotion in the camp. People were shouting, and we heard gunshots nearby. We had to run again, in the dark, not knowing where we were going or if we'd be safe.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: (taking deep breaths) It's intense. I can feel my heart racing, just like it did back then. My hands are shaking a bit. But... I also feel a strange sense of relief, being able to talk about it.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're processing it well.",
    "Client: Thank you. It helps to know that. I remember the day we finally crossed the border. There was a moment of relief, but also deep sadness. I knew we were leaving our country, possibly forever. I felt like I was leaving a part of myself behind. The refugee camp on the other side was supposed to be safer, but it didn't feel that way. We were crammed into tents, surrounded by strangers, all of us carrying our own traumas and fears.",
    "Therapist: You're very resilient. Keep going.",
    "Client: The days in the camp blurred together. We had to stand in long lines for food and water. The heat was unbearable during the day, and at night it was so cold. I tried to stay strong for my family, but there were moments when I felt like I couldn't go on. The feeling of helplessness, of having no control over our lives, was overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to acknowledge those feelings. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (nods) Yes, I am safe now. But sometimes, especially when I'm stressed, those memories come flooding back. I can almost smell the camp, feel the grit of sand between my teeth. It's like a part of me is still there, still that scared young woman who didn't know if she'd ever have a normal life again.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also a bit lighter. Talking about it, really allowing myself to remember, it's hard but also... I don't know, maybe healing in a way? I've spent so long trying to forget, to push these memories away. But they're a part of me, aren't they?",
    "Therapist: They are. You're handling this admirably.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think what stays with me most is the sense of loss. Not just of our home and possessions, but of our sense of security, our identity. Coming to a new country, trying to build a life, it's been a long journey. And sometimes, I still feel like that lost, scared refugee, even though I know I've come so far.",
    "Therapist: You have come far. You should be proud.",
    "Client: (smiles slightly) I'm trying to be. It's a process, isn't it? Learning to live with these experiences, to not let them define me entirely. But talking about it like this, it helps me see how much I've overcome. I'm not just a victim of my circumstances. I'm a survivor.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. You've shown remarkable resilience.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think that's enough for today. It's been intense, but I'm glad we did this. It's helping me understand myself better, to see my experiences in a different light. I know we have more work to do, but I feel like I'm making progress.",
    "Therapist: You are. We'll end here for today. Well done, Amina."
