    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart is still racing, and I feel a bit shaky. That memory of the airplane crash... it's so vivid. I can still hear the screeching of metal and smell the smoke.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's like I'm right back there, in that moment of sheer panic. I keep thinking about how close I came to dying. And... and the guilt. Why did I survive when others didn't?",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt manifest for you?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a heavy weight on my chest. I see the faces of the people who didn't make it, especially this young mother who was sitting across the aisle from me. She had a baby. I... I keep wondering if I could have done more to help them.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind as you reflect on this?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking, \"Why me? Why did I survive?\" And then I feel terrible for even thinking that because I should be grateful. But then I think about all the pain and anxiety I've experienced since the crash, and I wonder if it would have been easier if I hadn't survived. It's... it's such a confusing mix of emotions.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts affect you physically?",
    "Client: My stomach is in knots. I feel nauseous, and my hands are clammy. It's like my body is preparing for something terrible to happen again. I can feel tension in my shoulders and neck, and I'm having trouble taking deep breaths.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling very vulnerable right now. Like I could break at any moment. But there's also this strange sense of... I don't know, maybe relief? Like talking about it is somehow letting some of the pressure out. It's scary, but also... necessary, I think.",
    "Therapist: How does this compare to when you first started therapy?",
    "Client: Oh, it's... it's different. Before, I couldn't even think about the crash without having a full-blown panic attack. Now, it's still incredibly difficult, but I feel like I can at least talk about it without completely falling apart. It's progress, I suppose, but it still feels so overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you recognize that progress?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of emotions. Part of me feels proud that I've come this far. But another part feels frustrated that I'm not \"over it\" yet. And then there's this fear... fear that I'll never fully recover. That I'll always be haunted by this. It's exhausting, really.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with those fears?",
    "Client: I... I try to remind myself of how far I've come. I use those breathing exercises we've practiced. Sometimes I call my sister - she's been really supportive through all of this. And... and I try to focus on the present moment, on the fact that I'm safe right now. It doesn't always work, but it helps sometimes.",
    "Therapist: What else helps you feel grounded?",
    "Client: I've started gardening. There's something about having my hands in the soil that feels... I don't know, connecting? It reminds me that life goes on, that things grow and change. And the routine of caring for the plants gives me something to focus on outside of my own thoughts.",
    "Therapist: How does that relate to your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I... I hadn't really thought about it that way before. But I suppose it is similar. Recovery is a slow process, isn't it? Like nurturing a plant. Some days you don't see any progress, but you keep tending to it anyway. And then one day, you realize how much growth has occurred.",
    "Therapist: What feelings come up as you make that connection?",
    "Client: Hope, I think. And a bit of pride. It makes me feel like maybe I'm doing better than I give myself credit for. But there's also this sadness... for all the time I've lost, for the person I used to be before the crash. It's like I'm grieving for my old self while trying to grow into someone new.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel now compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a bit more relaxed. My breathing has slowed down, and the knot in my stomach isn't as tight. I still feel shaky, but it's not as intense. It's like... like I've let go of some of the tension I was holding onto.",
    "Therapist: What do you make of that shift?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me is relieved, but there's also this guilt about feeling better. Like I shouldn't be okay after talking about something so terrible. But... but maybe that's part of the healing process? Learning that it's okay to feel okay sometimes?",
    "Therapist: How might you carry this experience forward?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to be kinder to myself. To recognize that healing isn't linear, and that it's okay to have good moments even when dealing with something so difficult. Maybe I can try to focus more on those small victories, like being able to talk about the crash without completely falling apart. And... and maybe I can use that gardening analogy to remind myself that growth takes time and patience.",
    "Therapist: What's one thing you'd like to remember from today's session?",
    "Client: That... that I'm making progress, even when it doesn't feel like it. And that it's okay to have mixed emotions about my recovery. I don't have to have it all figured out right now. Just like my garden, I'm growing at my own pace.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired, but in a good way, I think. Like I've done some important work today. There's still fear and sadness, but also a glimmer of hope. And... and gratitude. For this space to process everything. It's not easy, but I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for your openness today. We'll continue next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I appreciate your guidance through this. It's hard, but I think it's worth it. I'll try to carry some of these insights with me this week."
