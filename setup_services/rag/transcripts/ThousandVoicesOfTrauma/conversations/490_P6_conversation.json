    "Therapist: Alright, Sarah. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your baseline SUDS.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and begin recounting the combat experience.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) I'm in the Humvee. The air is thick with dust, and I can feel the vibration of the engine. We're on patrol near Kandahar. It's hot, so hot. My uniform is sticking to my skin. I can hear the radio chatter, but it's muffled. Suddenly, there's a loud bang, and everything goes sideways...",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to a 6 now. My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: The Humvee is on its side. There's smoke everywhere, and I can taste blood in my mouth. I hear screaming, but it sounds far away. I'm trying to move, but my leg is pinned. The smell of burning rubber is overwhelming. I'm panicking, thinking we're under attack...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: (Voice shaking) It's an 8. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Inhales deeply) Okay... I... I manage to free my leg. It hurts so much. I'm crawling out of the Humvee. I see Johnson on the ground, not moving. There's blood everywhere. I hear more explosions in the distance. I'm terrified, thinking we're all going to die here...",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: (Tearfully) It's a 9. I feel like I'm back there. My chest is so tight.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Remember, you're here with me.",
    "Client: (Nodding) I... I drag myself to Johnson. I'm checking for a pulse, praying he's alive. My hands are shaking so much. I can't find it. I start CPR, but deep down, I know it's too late. I feel so helpless, so angry...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's still a 9. I feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: (Wiping tears) The backup arrives. They're yelling orders, securing the area. I'm still by Johnson's body. I can't leave him. Someone pulls me away, and I start screaming. I don't want to leave him there. The guilt... it's overwhelming. I failed him...",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: (Sobbing) It's a 10. I can't... I can't do this anymore.",
    "Therapist: You can. You're incredibly strong, Sarah.",
    "Client: (Taking shaky breaths) They load us into another vehicle. I'm in shock. Everything seems unreal. The ride back to base is a blur. I keep seeing Johnson's face. I keep thinking about his family. How am I going to face them? How can I live with this?",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to an 8. I feel drained.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're processing a lot.",
    "Client: (Sighing) We arrive at the base. There's so much activity, but I feel disconnected from it all. I'm taken to medical. They're treating my injuries, but I barely feel anything. All I can think about is Johnson and the others we lost. The guilt and pain are crushing me...",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's a 7 now. I feel... numb.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Sarah. Let's start winding down.",
    "Client: (Nodding) Okay. I'm in the hospital bed now. It's quiet. The adrenaline is wearing off, and the pain is setting in. But more than the physical pain, it's the emotional pain that's unbearable. I keep replaying everything in my mind, wondering if I could have done something differently...",
    "Therapist: And your final SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5. I feel exhausted, but... somehow lighter.",
