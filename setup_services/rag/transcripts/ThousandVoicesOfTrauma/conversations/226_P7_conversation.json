    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the cyber bullying incident?",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. It started when I posted a photo of my new business venture on social media. At first, everything seemed fine, but then...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there was this flood of negative comments. People I didn't even know were calling me a fraud, saying my business was a scam. It felt like a mob attack. My heart started racing, and I couldn't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: It's hard... I remember frantically scrolling through the comments, each one feeling like a punch to the gut. Some people even started sharing personal information about me. I felt so exposed, so vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I started shaking. I couldn't stop reading the comments, even though each one hurt more than the last. I felt like I was watching my reputation, my dreams, everything I'd worked for, crumble in real-time. I wanted to defend myself, but I was paralyzed.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I remember closing my laptop and just sitting there in shock. The room felt so quiet compared to the chaos online, but my mind was racing. I felt so alone, so judged. I started doubting everything about myself, my abilities, my worth...",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: It's hard to breathe... I feel like I'm back there again. The fear, the shame, it's all coming back. I couldn't sleep that night. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw those comments. I felt like I was being watched, judged by everyone.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The next day, I couldn't bring myself to check my phone or laptop. I was terrified of what I might find. I felt disconnected from everything and everyone. It was like the whole world had turned against me overnight. I started questioning every interaction I'd ever had online, wondering if people had always seen me this way.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. You're handling this courageously.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can continue. It's too much...",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take your time.",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. The worst part was feeling so powerless. I couldn't control what people were saying or thinking about me. I felt like my identity had been stolen and twisted into something I didn't recognize. The anxiety was constant, like a weight on my chest that wouldn't lift.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: I started withdrawing from everyone. I was too ashamed to face my friends or family. I felt like a failure, like I had somehow invited this attack. The isolation made everything worse. I couldn't eat, couldn't sleep. It felt like my whole world had shrunk to just me and those horrible comments.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. Keep going.",
    "Client: Days went by, and I still couldn't bring myself to go back online. But avoiding it didn't help. I kept imagining new comments, new attacks. It was like the bullying was continuing in my head, even without me seeing it. I felt trapped, with no way to escape or fight back.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this remarkably well. Continue.",
    "Client: The impact on my business was devastating. I lost clients, partnerships fell through. It felt like everything I had worked for was slipping away. But more than that, I lost my confidence, my sense of self. I felt like a shell of who I used to be.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel this way. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I started having nightmares about being chased by faceless people, always feeling exposed and vulnerable. Even when I was awake, I felt on edge, like at any moment someone could attack me again. The cyber world, which had once felt like a place of opportunity, now felt like a minefield.",
    "Therapist: You're very courageous. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: Thank you... It's hard to talk about this. The aftermath was almost worse than the initial attack. I developed this constant fear of judgment. Every time I considered posting anything online, even just a simple message to a friend, I'd be paralyzed with anxiety. It was like I had lost my voice, my ability to express myself freely.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... shaky. Talking about it brings back a lot of those feelings of fear and shame. But there's also a small part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe a bit stronger? Like I'm facing it head-on for the first time.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. You should be proud.",
    "Client: I guess so... It's just, even now, I struggle with trusting people online. I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop, for someone to turn on me. It's exhausting, living with that constant vigilance. But I'm trying to rebuild, to find my place in the digital world again. It's a slow process.",
    "Therapist: You're showing remarkable resilience. How do you feel about ending here for today?",
    "Client: I think that might be good. It's been intense, but... helpful, I think. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. We'll continue next session."
