    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart is still racing, and I feel this tightness in my chest. The memory of being in that hostage situation, it's so vivid now. I can still hear the shouting, the sound of glass breaking... (pauses, takes a deep breath) It's like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: Fear. Intense fear. I remember feeling so helpless, like I had no control over what was happening. My hands are shaking just thinking about it. I keep seeing the faces of the other hostages, their terrified expressions. And the smell... the smell of gunpowder and sweat. It's all so real.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Can you tell me more about those physical sensations?",
    "Client: My whole body feels tense, like I'm ready to run at any moment. There's this knot in my stomach, and I feel slightly nauseous. My mouth is dry, and I'm having trouble swallowing. It's like my body is frozen, but inside, everything is churning.",
    "Therapist: How are these sensations different from when it first happened?",
    "Client: They're... they're not as intense now. Back then, I thought I was going to die. The fear was paralyzing. Now, it's still scary, but I know I'm safe here. It's more like an echo of that terror, if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: That makes perfect sense. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why me? Why did this have to happen to me?\" And then I feel guilty for thinking that because others had it worse. I wonder if I could have done something differently, maybe helped someone else. But mostly, I'm just angry. Angry that these people took away my sense of safety, my peace of mind.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like a fire in my chest. My jaw is clenched, and I want to scream or hit something. But at the same time, I feel so tired. It's exhausting carrying all this around.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about how you're coping now compared to before?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm doing better. Before, I couldn't even talk about it without having a full-blown panic attack. Now, it's still hard, but I can get through it. I'm starting to see that I'm stronger than I thought. But sometimes, I worry that I'll never fully recover.",
    "Therapist: What gives you hope in your recovery journey?",
    "Client: (long pause) The fact that I'm here, I guess. That I'm facing this instead of running away. And... (voice breaks) the support of my family. They've been so patient with me. I want to get better for them, and for myself. I want to reclaim my life.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about the progress you've made so far?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of emotions. Part of me feels proud that I've come this far. I mean, a few months ago, I could barely leave my house. Now I'm here, talking about it. But another part of me is frustrated that I'm not \"over it\" yet. I know that's not realistic, but sometimes I just want to be normal again.",
    "Therapist: What does \"normal\" mean to you now?",
    "Client: (sighs) I'm not sure anymore. I guess... being able to go about my day without constantly looking over my shoulder. To enjoy simple things again without this cloud of fear hanging over me. To sleep through the night without nightmares. Just... to feel like myself again.",
    "Therapist: How has your view of yourself changed since the incident?",
    "Client: That's a tough one. In some ways, I feel weaker, more vulnerable. But in others, I've surprised myself with my resilience. I never thought I could survive something like this, but here I am. I'm trying to focus on that strength, but it's not always easy.",
    "Therapist: What helps you connect with that strength?",
    "Client: Talking about it, like we're doing now. It reminds me that I'm facing my fears head-on. And little victories, like going to the grocery store alone or attending a family gathering. Each time I do something I was afraid to do, I feel a bit stronger.",
    "Therapist: How do these sessions impact your daily life?",
    "Client: They're... challenging. Often, I leave here feeling drained. But I also feel a sense of... I don't know, maybe accomplishment? Like I'm actively working on my healing. It gives me hope that things can get better. And I find myself using some of the techniques we've practiced when I'm feeling anxious at home.",
    "Therapist: What's been most helpful for you in our sessions?",
    "Client: The safe space to talk about everything without judgment. And the way you help me break down my thoughts and feelings. It's making me more aware of my reactions, and that awareness helps me feel more in control. Also, learning that my responses are normal for what I've been through... that's been really validating.",
    "Therapist: As we wrap up, how are you feeling now compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, I think. Still a bit shaky, but more grounded. Talking through it all has helped release some of the tension. I'm tired, but it's a good kind of tired, if that makes sense. Like I've done something important for myself today.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for your openness today. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we end?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I might actually be able to get there.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. We'll continue next week."
