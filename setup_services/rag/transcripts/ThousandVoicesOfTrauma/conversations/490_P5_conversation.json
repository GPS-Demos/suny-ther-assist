    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Johnson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been thinking about this session all week. The idea of revisiting those memories from my time in the military... it's daunting.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. Are you ready to discuss it?",
    "Client: I suppose so. But I'm not entirely sure what to expect. Can you explain a bit more about what we'll be doing?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Imaginal exposure involves revisiting your traumatic memories in a safe environment. It helps process them.",
    "Client: That sounds... intense. I'm worried about getting overwhelmed. What if I can't handle it?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace, and I'll be here to support you throughout.",
    "Client: Okay, that's reassuring. But why do we need to do this? Isn't it better to just try and forget?",
    "Therapist: Avoidance can actually maintain PTSD symptoms. Facing memories helps reduce their power over you.",
    "Client: I see. It's just... I've spent so long trying not to think about it. The idea of purposely remembering is scary.",
    "Therapist: Your bravery in facing this is commendable. How are you feeling about starting?",
    "Client: Anxious, definitely. But also... maybe a little hopeful? If this can help me move past what happened, it might be worth it. I'm tired of feeling stuck.",
    "Therapist: That's a great perspective. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do this. Can you walk me through what exactly we'll be doing?",
    "Therapist: We'll start with a relaxation exercise, then you'll describe your experience in detail. I'll guide you through it.",
    "Client: Okay. And you'll be here the whole time? I'm worried about getting lost in the memory.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'll be right here, ensuring you stay grounded. Your safety is my priority.",
    "Client: Thank you. That helps a lot. I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Let's get started.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's begin with some deep breaths. Close your eyes when you're comfortable."
