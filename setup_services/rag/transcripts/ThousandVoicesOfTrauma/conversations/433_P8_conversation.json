    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's like my body is buzzing, you know? My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel... I don't know, kind of hollow inside. It's strange, reliving that moment when we had to flee our village. I can still hear the sounds of chaos, people shouting, children crying. It's like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's not as intense as it was during the exercise, but it's still there, like a shadow at the edge of my mind. I keep thinking about how vulnerable we were, how uncertain everything was. And there's this... this guilt, I guess. I made it out, but so many others didn't.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt manifest for you?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a weight in my chest. Sometimes it makes it hard to breathe, you know? I find myself wondering why I deserved to escape when others didn't. And then I feel guilty for even having a life here, for trying to move on. It's like I'm betraying those we left behind.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts come up when you feel that guilt?",
    "Client: I think... I think about how I should be doing more to help those still suffering. I wonder if I could have done something differently, maybe helped more people escape. And then there's this voice in my head saying I don't deserve the safety and opportunities I have now. It's... it's exhausting, really.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you express these thoughts?",
    "Client: My shoulders feel tense, like I'm carrying a heavy burden. There's a tightness in my throat, and my stomach feels knotted. It's like my body is trying to curl in on itself, to protect me somehow. But at the same time, there's this restlessness in my legs, like I should be running, you know?",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to feel grounded. To remind myself that I'm here, now, and that I'm safe. Maybe... maybe I need to give myself permission to feel okay, to not carry all of this pain and guilt all the time. It's just... it's hard to let go of it, you know?",
    "Therapist: How might giving yourself that permission change things for you?",
    "Client: I suppose... it might help me breathe a little easier. Maybe I could focus more on the present, on building a life here without constantly looking over my shoulder. But it's scary too, you know? Like if I let go of the guilt and fear, I might forget where I came from, what others are still going through.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to remember without being burdened?",
    "Client: That's... that's a tough one. I guess it would mean honoring my past and the struggles of my people, but not letting it define every moment of my life. Maybe I could use my experiences to help others in some way, to make something positive out of all this pain. But it feels like such a delicate balance.",
    "Therapist: How does thinking about that balance make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's both terrifying and a little bit hopeful, I think. Like I'm standing on the edge of something, and I'm not sure if I'll fall or fly. There's a part of me that wants to embrace this idea, to find a way to carry my experiences without being crushed by them. But another part is so used to the weight of it all, I'm not sure who I'd be without it.",
    "Therapist: What small step could you take towards that balance?",
    "Client: Hmm... Maybe I could start by acknowledging one good thing each day, something I'm grateful for in my current life. And maybe... maybe I could look into volunteer opportunities with refugee organizations here. That way, I could honor my past and help others while also building a life for myself. It's scary, but... maybe it's a start?",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that idea?",
    "Client: I feel... cautiously optimistic, I think. There's still fear and uncertainty, but there's also a tiny spark of excitement. Like maybe, just maybe, I can find a way to live with my past without being consumed by it. It won't be easy, and I know there will be setbacks, but... for the first time in a while, I feel like there might be a path forward.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you consider this path?",
    "Client: It's a mix of emotions, really. There's hope, definitely, but also anxiety. I'm worried about failing, about not being able to handle it if I start to open up more. And there's still that nagging guilt, telling me I don't deserve to move forward. But beneath all that, there's... I don't know, a sense of possibility? Like maybe I can reclaim some part of myself that I thought was lost.",
    "Therapist: How might we work with those mixed emotions?",
    "Client: I think... I think we need to take it slow. Maybe we could explore each of these feelings one by one in our sessions? And perhaps find some coping strategies for when the guilt or anxiety gets overwhelming. I also think I might need help setting realistic goals for myself, so I don't try to do too much too fast and end up retreating back into old patterns.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful approach. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense? Like I've run a marathon emotionally. There's still a lot of heaviness, but also a glimmer of light. I'm exhausted, but I also feel like I've taken a small step forward. It's... it's a strange mix, but not entirely unpleasant.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to explore more about how to balance remembering and honoring my past with building a future. Maybe we could talk more about specific ways I can start giving back or connecting with my community here? And... I think I need to work more on managing the guilt. It still feels like it's holding me back.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How would you like to close today?",
    "Client: Could we... could we maybe do a quick grounding exercise? I'm feeling a bit raw after all this, and I think I need help centering myself before I leave. Just something to help me feel present and safe in the here and now.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take a few deep breaths together..."
