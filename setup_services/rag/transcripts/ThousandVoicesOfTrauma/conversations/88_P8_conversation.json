    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like my whole body is vibrating. The memory of that day, when I found out about the human trafficking ring... it's just so vivid now. I can still hear the whispers, see the fear in those girls' eyes. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Guilt. Overwhelming guilt. I keep thinking, \"Why didn't I notice sooner? Why didn't I do more?\" It's crushing me. I was so focused on my own problems with bullying at work that I missed all the signs. Those girls were suffering right under my nose, and I did nothing.",
    "Therapist: And how does that guilt feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a heavy weight on my chest. I can barely breathe. My stomach is in knots, and I feel nauseous. It's like my body is trying to physically reject these memories, but I can't escape them.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep hearing their voices... the way they'd whisper to each other in the break room. I thought they were just shy, you know? But now I realize they were terrified. I should have known. I should have done something. I'm a terrible person for not helping them sooner.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts relate to your experiences with bullying?",
    "Client: I... I never thought about that connection before. But I guess... when I was being bullied, I always wished someone would notice and help me. And now, I've become the person who didn't notice, who didn't help. It's like I've betrayed my younger self, you know? I've become what I hated most.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What else comes up for you?",
    "Client: Anger. I'm so angry at myself, but also at the traffickers. How could they do this? And I'm angry at society for creating a world where this can happen. It's all just so... unfair. And then I feel guilty for being angry when those girls suffered so much more than I ever did.",
    "Therapist: How does this anger manifest?",
    "Client: My fists are clenched so tight right now. I want to punch something, to scream. But at the same time, I feel paralyzed. It's like this anger is eating me from the inside out, but I can't express it. I'm afraid if I start, I'll never stop.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I need to forgive myself, I think. But I don't know how. How can I forgive myself when those girls suffered so much? It feels impossible. But carrying this guilt and anger... it's destroying me. I can't sleep, I can't focus at work. I'm pushing my partner away. I need... I need peace, but I don't know if I deserve it.",
    "Therapist: How might finding peace help you moving forward?",
    "Client: I... I never thought about it that way. Maybe if I could find some peace, I could actually do something to help. Right now, I'm so paralyzed by guilt and anger that I'm not helping anyone. If I could forgive myself, maybe I could volunteer, or donate, or... I don't know, do something meaningful to fight against human trafficking.",
    "Therapist: What's a small step you could take towards that?",
    "Client: I... I could research organizations that help trafficking survivors. Maybe even reach out to one. It's scary to think about, but... it feels like the right thing to do. Like maybe I could turn this awful experience into something positive.",
    "Therapist: How does thinking about that make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of emotions. There's still guilt there, and fear. But there's also a tiny spark of hope. Like maybe I'm not completely powerless. Maybe I can make a difference, even if it's small. It doesn't erase what happened, but... it feels like a way forward.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much this has affected every part of my life. My depression has gotten so much worse since finding out about the trafficking. I've been isolating myself, pushing everyone away. But talking about it now... it's hard, but it also feels like I'm finally letting some of this poison out. Like I can breathe a little easier.",
    "Therapist: How does this realization impact you?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a bit liberating. I've been carrying this burden alone for so long, thinking I didn't deserve help or support. But maybe... maybe it's okay to lean on others. Maybe I don't have to do this alone. It's scary to be vulnerable, especially after being bullied, but... I think I need to try.",
    "Therapist: What support might be helpful?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to open up to my partner. They've been so patient with me, even when I've been distant. And maybe... maybe I should consider group therapy? Talking about this here has been hard but helpful. Being around others who understand trauma might be good for me.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about these ideas?",
    "Client: Nervous, definitely. The thought of being that vulnerable is terrifying. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, possibility? Like maybe things don't have to be this hard forever. It's a small feeling, but it's there. And that's... that's something to hold onto, I think.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What else is coming up for you?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much I've been living in the past, reliving that moment over and over. But thinking about taking action, about getting support... it's like I'm finally looking towards the future. It's scary, but it also feels... necessary. Like I can't keep going the way I have been.",
    "Therapist: How does this shift feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's strange. The heaviness in my chest is still there, but it feels a bit lighter. My shoulders aren't as tense. And I notice I'm sitting up straighter, not curled in on myself like I usually am. It's like my body is ready for something new, even if my mind is still catching up.",
    "Therapist: What do you want to remember from today's session?",
    "Client: I want to remember this feeling of possibility. That even though what happened was terrible, I'm not powerless. I can take small steps towards healing and maybe even helping others. And... and that it's okay to ask for help. I don't have to carry this alone anymore.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. How would you like to close our session today?",
    "Client: I... I think I'd like to take a few deep breaths. To sit with this new feeling for a moment. And maybe... maybe set an intention to research those organizations we talked about. It's a small step, but it feels like an important one.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a wonderful way to end. Let's take those breaths together."
