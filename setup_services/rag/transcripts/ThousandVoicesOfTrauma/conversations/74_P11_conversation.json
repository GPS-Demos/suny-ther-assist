    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Patel?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's always hard to go back there, you know? To that place, that time... (takes a deep breath) I can still smell the dust and smoke in the air.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you this time?",
    "Client: The sounds. They were so vivid today. The explosions, the shouting, the... the screams. (voice trembles) I could hear my squad mate calling for help. I couldn't get to him in time. (pauses, sniffles) I've never felt so helpless.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. How are you coping with those feelings now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. My heart's still racing a bit. I keep telling myself I'm safe now, but my body doesn't seem to believe it. (sighs) I'm trying to use those grounding techniques we talked about. Focusing on the chair I'm sitting in, the sound of the clock ticking. It helps a little.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're doing well. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I feel... angry. Angry at the situation, at myself for not being able to save everyone. (voice rises) We were supposed to protect people, but we couldn't even protect ourselves! (pauses, takes a deep breath) I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shout.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to express those feelings. How does the anger relate to your day-to-day life?",
    "Client: I... I think it's why I struggle with my temper sometimes. Especially when I feel like I can't control a situation. (sighs) My family... they don't understand why I get so upset over small things. But it's like... every little frustration brings me back there, you know?",
    "Therapist: I see. How has this affected your relationships?",
    "Client: It's been tough. (voice softens) My late husband, he was so patient with me, but I know it wore him down. Now, with my kids and grandkids... I want to be present for them, but sometimes I just need to be alone. I'm afraid of lashing out, of them seeing that side of me.",
    "Therapist: What do you think could help with that?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe being more open with them about what I'm going through? (pauses) It's hard to talk about, but keeping it all inside isn't working either.",
    "Therapist: That's a good insight. How do you feel about trying that?",
    "Client: Nervous, but... maybe it's time. (sighs) They deserve to understand. And maybe... maybe it'll help me feel less alone in this.",
    "Therapist: It takes courage. What else came up for you during the exposure?",
    "Client: I... I realized something. (pauses) When I was there, in that moment, I did everything I could. I couldn't have done more. (voice breaks) It doesn't make it okay, but... maybe I don't need to keep blaming myself.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it feel to acknowledge that?",
    "Client: It's... freeing, in a way. (sniffles) But also sad. Like I'm finally allowing myself to grieve, not just for my squad mates, but for the person I was before all this.",
    "Therapist: That's an important part of healing. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I want to keep working on this. (voice becomes more determined) I want to be able to remember without feeling like I'm right back there. I want to honor their memory without letting it control my life. It's hard, but... I think I'm starting to see a way forward.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How can we build on this for next time?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe we could work more on those grounding techniques? And... (hesitates) I think I might try talking to my daughter about some of this. Not everything, but... a start.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a good plan. Anything else you want to address?",
    "Client: No, I... I think that's enough for today. (exhales slowly) Thank you. This isn't easy, but... I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work. We'll continue next session."
