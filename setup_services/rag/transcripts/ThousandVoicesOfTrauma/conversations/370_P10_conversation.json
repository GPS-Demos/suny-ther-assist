    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Lee. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, doctor. My hands are a bit shaky. I've been thinking about this all week, and I'm not certain I'm ready to face these memories again.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's take a deep breath together. Are you willing to try?",
    "Client: Yes, I suppose so. It's just... it's been so long, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. We'll go at your pace. Can you close your eyes and describe where you are in your memory?",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Alright... I'm... I'm in the refugee camp. It's hot, so hot. The air feels thick, like you could cut it with a knife. There are tents everywhere, makeshift shelters really. The smell... it's overwhelming. Sweat, unwashed bodies, and something else... fear, I think.",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: I see... I see people. So many people. Children with hollow eyes, women carrying babies. There's a long line for water. I'm... I'm standing in that line. My throat is so dry it hurts to swallow.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe a 40? It's uncomfortable, but I can manage.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear shouting. It's coming from the edge of the camp. People start to move, to run. I don't know what's happening, but I feel this... this dread in the pit of my stomach. I want to run too, but my feet won't move.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you feel in your body?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I can feel it pounding in my chest. My mouth has gone dry. I... I think I'm trembling. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: It's completely normal. You're safe here. Keep breathing. What do you see happening?",
    "Client: I see... oh god. I see men with guns. They're pushing people, shouting. A woman falls... her child is screaming. I want to help, but I'm frozen. I can't... I can't move.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here in the room with me. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's higher. Maybe 60 or 65? I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Take another deep breath. What happens next?",
    "Client: There's chaos everywhere. People are running, pushing. I finally manage to move, but I'm caught in the crowd. I can hardly breathe. Someone elbows me in the ribs, and I stumble. I'm terrified I'll fall and be trampled.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm going to die. I keep thinking about my family, wondering if they're safe. I feel so alone, so scared. Why is this happening to us? We've done nothing wrong!",
    "Therapist: Those are powerful emotions. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. Maybe 75? My hands are sweating.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Remember, you're safe here. Can you tell me more about what you're seeing?",
    "Client: I... I see a man fall. He's older, reminds me of my father. People are stepping over him, no one's helping. I want to go back, but the crowd is pushing me forward. I can't... I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe with me. In... and out. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) Thank you. It's... it's hard.",
    "Therapist: I know. You're very brave. Can you continue?",
    "Client: Yes... I think so. I manage to break free from the crowd. I'm at the edge of the camp now. I turn back and... oh god. I see smoke. They're burning the tents. People are screaming. I can smell the burning plastic, the... the fear.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Guilt. Overwhelming guilt. I should go back, help others. But I'm... I'm too scared. I just stand there, watching. I feel like a coward.",
    "Therapist: It's a natural response to danger. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's high. Maybe 85? I feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Remember, you're here with me. Can you feel the chair you're sitting on?",
    "Client: Yes... yes, I can. It helps a little.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next in your memory?",
    "Client: I... I start walking away from the camp. My legs feel like lead. I keep looking back, seeing the smoke rise. I can still hear the screams, but they're getting fainter. I feel... I feel numb. Like this isn't real.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction to trauma. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a bit better. Maybe 70? I feel drained.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Can you tell me more about what you're experiencing?",
    "Client: I walk for what feels like hours. My feet are blistered, my mouth is so dry. I keep thinking about the people I left behind. Did they make it out? Are they okay? I feel so alone, so... lost.",
    "Therapist: Those are difficult feelings. You're very brave for facing them.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's... it's hard to talk about this.",
    "Therapist: I understand. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. So tired. Both in the memory and... and here, now. My distress is maybe 60? I just feel... drained.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've done really well today. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Can you slowly open your eyes?",
    "Client: (Opens eyes slowly) Yes... I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. Take a few deep breaths. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... I don't know. Sad, I guess. But also... maybe a little lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. You've shown great courage today. How would you rate your distress now?",
    "Client: It's lower. Maybe 40? I feel... I feel okay.",
    "Therapist: That's good to hear. We'll end our session here. Remember to use the coping strategies we've discussed if you feel overwhelmed later. You've done excellent work today, Mr. Lee.",
    "Client: Thank you, doctor. It was hard, but... I think it helped. I feel like I can breathe a little easier now.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. We'll continue this work in our next session. Take care of yourself this week.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again."
