    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Can you describe the event as if it's happening now?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm at the funeral home. It's my wife's service. I see the flowers, smell the lilies. The room is full of people, but I feel so alone. My son is next to me, but I can barely look at him. He reminds me so much of her...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I approach the casket. My legs feel heavy. I see her lying there, so peaceful. But all I can think is how wrong this is. She shouldn't be there. We were supposed to grow old together. I reach out to touch her hand, and it's so cold...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice breaking) It's too much. I can't... I can't bear to look at her like this. I turn away, and I see all these faces. Some I recognize, some I don't. But they're all looking at me with pity. I hate it. I just want to run away.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. You're handling this bravely.",
    "Client: I... I see my neighbor, Mrs. Johnson. She's crying. It hits me then - my wife meant so much to so many people. And now she's gone. I feel this crushing weight on my chest. I can't breathe. I stumble to a chair and sit down.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I'm sitting there, and I hear the minister start speaking. But I can't focus on the words. All I can think about is how I'm going to go home to an empty house. How I'm going to wake up alone every morning. How I'll never hear her laugh again...",
    "Therapist: You're facing these difficult memories. That takes courage.",
    "Client: (wiping tears) I look up and see our wedding photo on display. We were so young, so full of hope. And now... now it's all gone. I feel this anger bubbling up inside me. Why her? Why us? It's not fair...",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel angry. Allow yourself to experience that emotion.",
    "Client: I... I stand up when it's time to speak. I had a speech prepared, but I can't remember a word of it. I just stand there, staring at all these faces. I open my mouth, but nothing comes out. I feel like I'm drowning...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I manage to say a few words about how kind she was, how much she loved life. But it feels hollow. Words can't capture who she was. As I finish, I look at my son. He's crying silently. I want to comfort him, but I don't know how. I feel like I've failed him too...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory with strength. Continue.",
    "Client: The service ends, and people start leaving. They come up to me, offering condolences. But their words just wash over me. I nod mechanically, shake hands. But inside, I'm screaming. I just want everyone to go away. I want to be alone with my grief...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. You're safe here.",
    "Client: As the last person leaves, I turn back to the casket. It's just me and her now. I touch her cheek one last time. It's the hardest thing I've ever done - saying goodbye. I whisper, \"I love you,\" and then... then I have to walk away. Leave her there. It feels like I'm abandoning her...",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: (taking a deep breath) It's... it's hard. Remembering all that. But... I guess it feels a little less overwhelming now. Like I can look at it without falling apart completely. Is that... is that normal?",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. You've shown great resilience.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I need a moment. Can we take a short break?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's pause here and take some deep breaths together."
