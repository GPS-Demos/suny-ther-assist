    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10 right now. Just thinking about it makes me uneasy.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and describe the memory.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) It was a sunny afternoon. I was walking home from the grocery store. I saw two police officers approaching a young man...",
    "Therapist: Continue. What happened next?",
    "Client: They started yelling at him, demanding he put his hands up. He looked so confused and scared. I wanted to help, but I froze...",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My heart's racing. I feel... helpless. Like I'm right back there again.",

    "Therapist: Your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's an 8 now. I feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: (Voice shaking) They kept hitting him, even though he wasn't resisting. I wanted to scream, to make them stop, but I was too afraid...",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: That I should've done something. That I'm a coward for just standing there.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Still an 8. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: (Nodding) I know. It's just... the memory feels so real. I can still hear his cries for help.",

    "Therapist: Your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's dropped to a 7. I'm starting to feel more numb than panicked.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Continue.",
    "Client: After they left, I just stood there, staring at the blood on the ground. People were whispering, but no one did anything. We all just... let it happen.",
    "Therapist: What's that like for you?",
    "Client: It's crushing. The guilt, the shame... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Back up to an 8. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",

    "Client: Tense. Like I'm wound up tight, ready to snap.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's a 7 now. The intensity is fading a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Let's continue.",
    "Client: (Sighs) I never reported it. I was too scared. But I've always wondered what happened to that young man...",
    "Therapist: What emotions come up now?",
    "Client: Regret. Sadness. A deep, aching sorrow for what happened.",
