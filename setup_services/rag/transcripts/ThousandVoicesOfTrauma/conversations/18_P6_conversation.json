    "Therapist: Welcome back. Are you ready to continue our imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with your current SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10. My stomach feels a bit tight, but I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Let's begin. Close your eyes and revisit that memory.",
    "Client: (Taking a deep breath) Okay... I'm back in our living room. It's late evening, and I can hear the TV in the background. My partner is pacing, their footsteps heavy on the hardwood floor. I can feel the tension in the air, it's thick, suffocating. My heart is starting to race...",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe a 6? My palms are getting sweaty, and I can feel my chest tightening.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: They're yelling now, their voice getting louder. I can't make out the words, but the tone... it's so angry. I'm frozen in place, my body won't move. I want to leave, but I can't. The fear is overwhelming, it's like I'm drowning in it. My vision is starting to blur...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) It's an 8 now. God, it feels so real. My whole body is shaking, and I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: That's tough. You're very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: They're getting closer now. I can smell the alcohol on their breath. Their face is contorted with rage, and I'm bracing myself for what's coming. I feel so small, so helpless. The first blow lands, and I... I...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: (Breathing heavily) It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm right back there. My cheek stings where they hit me, and I can taste blood in my mouth. The room is spinning, and I'm struggling to stay upright.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: I'm curled up on the floor now, trying to protect myself. The blows keep coming, and I can hear myself begging them to stop. But they don't. It feels endless. I'm so scared, so alone. I can't believe this is happening to me again...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: (Sobbing) It's... it's a 10. I can't... I can't do this anymore. It's too much. I feel like I'm going to break apart.",
    "Therapist: You're incredibly strong. Let's pause here.",

    "Client: It's coming down. Maybe a 6? I still feel shaky, but the intense fear is fading.",

    "Client: Yes, please. I think I need some time to process all of this. Thank you for guiding me through it.",
