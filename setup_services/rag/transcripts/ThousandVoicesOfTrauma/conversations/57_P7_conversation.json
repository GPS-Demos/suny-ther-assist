    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Can you describe the accident you witnessed?",
    "Client: Okay... It was a sunny afternoon, and I was driving home from work. The traffic was heavy, and I remember feeling frustrated. Suddenly, I heard a loud crash up ahead. When I looked up, I saw two cars colliding at the intersection. One of them, a red sedan, spun out of control and hit a pedestrian on the sidewalk. It was... it was terrible.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you saw.",
    "Client: The pedestrian, a young woman, was thrown several feet. She landed on the pavement and wasn't moving. I pulled over immediately and got out of my car. The smell of burnt rubber and gasoline filled the air. People were screaming, and car horns were blaring. I ran towards the woman, my heart pounding in my chest.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What were you feeling?",
    "Client: I felt... terrified. My hands were shaking, and I couldn't think straight. I kept telling myself, \"Stay calm, stay calm,\" but it was so hard. When I reached the woman, I saw blood... so much blood. Her leg was bent at an unnatural angle, and her eyes were closed. I... I thought she might be dead.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I knelt beside her, not knowing what to do. I was afraid to touch her, worried I might make things worse. Other people started gathering around, and someone shouted to call an ambulance. I felt so helpless, just kneeling there, watching her shallow breathing. The driver of the red car stumbled out, looking dazed and bleeding from his forehead. He kept mumbling, \"I didn't see them, I didn't see them.\" It was chaos all around.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What happened next?",
    "Client: The wait for the ambulance felt like an eternity. I stayed with the woman, talking to her even though she was unconscious. I kept saying, \"Help is coming, you'll be okay.\" But I wasn't sure if I believed it myself. When the sirens finally approached, I felt a mix of relief and dread. The paramedics rushed in, pushing us bystanders aside. They worked quickly, stabilizing her neck and assessing her injuries. I remember the sound of the scissors as they cut away her clothes to treat her. It was... it was so invasive, but necessary.",
    "Therapist: You're handling these difficult memories well. Continue.",
    "Client: As they loaded her into the ambulance, I caught a glimpse of her face. She looked so young, maybe in her twenties. I couldn't help but think about her family, how their lives were about to change forever. The police arrived and started questioning witnesses. I gave my statement, but I felt detached, like I was watching everything from outside my body. After it was all over, I got back in my car to drive home. But I just sat there, unable to move. My hands were still shaking, and I felt... I felt...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I felt guilty. Guilty that I couldn't do more to help, guilty that I was relieved it wasn't me or someone I loved. And scared. Scared of how fragile life is, how everything can change in an instant. I drove home eventually, but I couldn't shake the images from my mind. The sound of the crash, the sight of the woman on the pavement, the smell of blood and gasoline... it haunted me for weeks. I had trouble sleeping, and when I did sleep, I had nightmares about the accident. Even now, years later, whenever I approach that intersection, my heart starts racing, and I grip the steering wheel tighter. It's like... like I'm right back there again.",
    "Therapist: You've done an excellent job recalling this difficult memory. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Talking about it brings everything back so vividly. My chest feels tight, and I'm a bit shaky. But... I also feel a strange sense of relief. Like I've been carrying this weight for so long, and sharing it has lightened the load a bit. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: That's completely normal. You've shown great courage today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never realized how much this incident affected me until now. I've always tried to push it away, to forget about it. But going through it in detail like this... it's hard, but I think it might be helping. I just hope that woman survived and recovered. Not knowing what happened to her has always been difficult for me.",
    "Therapist: Your concern shows your empathy. Let's take a few deep breaths together.",
    "Client: [Takes deep breaths] That helps, thank you. I'm realizing now how much I've avoided thinking about this. Even driving past that intersection, I always take a different route if I can. It's affected my life more than I thought. But talking about it... it's tough, but it feels like the right thing to do. I want to be able to drive without fear, to pass by that spot without my heart racing. Do you think that's possible?",
    "Therapist: With continued work, yes. You're making great progress.",
    "Client: That gives me hope. I've carried this for so long, it's become a part of me. But I don't want it to control me anymore. I want to be able to think about that day without feeling overwhelmed. And maybe... maybe even use what I learned from it to help others. I've been thinking about taking a first aid course, so if I ever encounter something like this again, I'll know how to help. Does that sound like a good idea?",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent way to regain control. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your guidance through this. It's not easy, but I'm starting to see that facing these memories might be the key to moving past them. I know we have more sessions ahead, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous about delving deeper. But I'm also... cautiously optimistic. For the first time in years, I feel like I might be able to put this behind me and move forward. Is it okay if we end here for today? I think I need some time to process everything we've discussed.",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've made significant progress today. We'll continue next session."
