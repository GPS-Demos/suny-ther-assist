    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: (sighs deeply) It's... it's tough, you know? Reliving that moment when I saw the police brutality unfold... it brings back all those intense emotions. My heart's still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: I see. What stood out to you this time?",
    "Client: The sounds. I hadn't realized how vivid they were in my memory. The shouting, the sirens, the... (pauses) the impact of the batons. It was like I was right there again, helpless, watching it all happen.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: Honestly? Terrifying. But also... I don't know, maybe a little different this time? Like, I could feel the fear and anger, but I also felt more... present? Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. Can you elaborate on that?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... I was there, in the memory, but I also knew I was here, in this room. Safe. It's the first time I've felt that dual awareness, I guess. Still scary as hell, but... maybe a tiny bit more manageable?",
    "Therapist: That's an important observation. How does this relate to your day-to-day experiences?",
    "Client: (thoughtful pause) You know, I think it might be connected to how I've been handling my anxiety lately. Like, when I'm out and I see a police officer, I still get that initial panic, but I've been trying to remind myself that I'm okay in that moment. It's hard, but... maybe it's starting to sink in?",
    "Therapist: That's a significant insight. How does this progress make you feel?",
    "Client: (chuckles softly) Surprised, honestly. And... hopeful? I mean, don't get me wrong, it's still incredibly difficult. But the fact that I can see even a small change... it's encouraging. Makes me think that maybe, just maybe, I can get through this.",
    "Therapist: What do you think has contributed to this change?",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) I think... well, these sessions for sure. Facing the memory head-on, as terrifying as it is. But also, the breathing exercises we've practiced. And... (hesitates) I've been talking to my partner more about it. That support helps, you know?",
    "Therapist: It sounds like you're utilizing multiple strategies. How can we build on this?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I need to be more intentional about using these techniques in my daily life? Like, actively practicing that dual awareness when I'm out and about. And maybe... (sighs) maybe I need to push myself a bit more to engage in some of the activities I've been avoiding.",
    "Therapist: That's a thoughtful plan. How do you feel about continuing with the exposures?",
    "Client: (nervous laugh) Scared. But... determined? I mean, if I'm seeing even a little progress, then it's worth it, right? It's not easy, but I want to keep going. I want my life back, you know?",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is commendable. What else would you like to address?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to work more on my anxiety. It's still there, always humming in the background. And sometimes, it spikes up and intertwines with the trauma memories, making everything feel so much worse. Is that... is that normal?",
    "Therapist: It's a common experience. How would you like to approach this?",
    "Client: Maybe we could... I don't know, explore some more specific coping strategies for those moments? And perhaps dig into how my anxiety and the trauma are connected? I feel like understanding that better might help me manage both more effectively.",
    "Therapist: That's a good direction. Anything else on your mind?",
    "Client: (long pause) Yeah, actually. I've been thinking... about maybe getting involved in some community work. You know, related to police reform or supporting victims of police brutality. Part of me feels like it could be healing, but another part is terrified it might be too triggering. What do you think?",
    "Therapist: It's a complex decision. How would you like to explore that idea?",
    "Client: Could we maybe... talk through the pros and cons? And perhaps come up with a gradual plan if I decide to pursue it? I don't want to jump in too fast and set myself back, but I also don't want fear to hold me back from something that could be really meaningful, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a balanced approach. Shall we start on that next session?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think that would be good. (sighs, then chuckles) Man, this is hard work. But... I'm glad I'm doing it. Thanks for... you know, guiding me through this mess.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired. Emotionally drained. But also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've put down a tiny piece of the burden I've been carrying. It's a weird mix of exhaustion and... hope, I guess.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Any final thoughts before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. And... I'm going to keep pushing forward. One step at a time, right?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. Take care, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thanks, doc. See you then."
