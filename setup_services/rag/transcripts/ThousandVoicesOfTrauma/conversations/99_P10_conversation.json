    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Uh, to be honest, doc, I'm feeling a bit on edge. You know, talking about this stuff... it's not easy.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Right, the scale thing. I'd say... maybe a 6? My stomach's kind of in knots.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Let's begin when you're ready. Take us to that day.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Alright. I'm... I'm walking down Maple Street. It's hot, really hot. The sun's beating down, and I can feel sweat trickling down my back. I'm on my way to the corner store to grab some milk for my kid's cereal. Just a normal day, you know?",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: There's not many people out. It's too hot, I guess. I see a couple of teenagers on bikes, an old lady watering her lawn. The concrete's so bright it hurts my eyes a little. I'm almost at the store when I hear sirens in the distance.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: It... it makes me tense up a little. My heart starts beating faster. I tell myself it's nothing, probably just an ambulance or something. But then I see the cop car turn onto the street, lights flashing.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: The car screeches to a stop right in front of me. Two officers jump out, guns drawn. They're yelling at me to get on the ground. I... I don't understand what's happening. My mind's racing. Did I do something wrong? Is this a mistake?",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to an 8, I think. My hands are shaking just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Okay. So, I slowly start to kneel down, my hands up. I'm trying to show them I'm not a threat. But then one of the officers rushes at me, tackles me to the ground. My face hits the pavement hard. I can taste blood in my mouth.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What do you feel?",
    "Client: Pain. Shock. The rough concrete scraping my skin. The officer's knee digging into my back. I can barely breathe. I'm trying to tell them I didn't do anything, but they keep yelling at me to shut up.",
    "Therapist: And what are you thinking?",
    "Client: I... I'm terrified. I keep thinking about my family, my kid. What if I don't make it home? What if they shoot me? I've seen the news, I know how these things can end. I'm angry too, but mostly scared.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's a solid 9 now. My heart's pounding just talking about it.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're doing well.",
    "Client: *takes a shaky breath* They're handcuffing me now. The metal's cold against my wrists, too tight. They're still yelling, asking me where the drugs are. I keep telling them I don't have any drugs, I was just going to the store. But they don't listen.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: They start searching me, rough and invasive. I feel so... so violated. People are starting to come out of their houses, watching. I see the old lady who was watering her lawn. She looks scared. I want to yell for help, but I'm afraid of what the officers might do if I make a sound.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to be watched like that?",
    "Client: Humiliating. Degrading. I'm a grown man, lying on the ground, being treated like a criminal in front of my neighbors. I feel... less than human. Like I don't matter.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What else?",
    "Client: I... I start to cry. I can't help it. The tears are mixing with the blood on my face. One of the officers notices and laughs. He calls me a baby. That just makes me feel worse, more ashamed.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 10. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. Remember, you're here, you're safe.",
    "Client: *takes several deep breaths* Okay. I'm... I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: They finally finish searching me. Of course, they don't find anything. But instead of apologizing, they just get angrier. One of them grabs me by the hair, lifts my head up. He's in my face, yelling about how they know I'm hiding something, that they'll find it eventually.",
    "Therapist: How do you respond?",
    "Client: I don't. I can't. I'm too scared to say anything. I just keep my eyes down, praying it'll be over soon. That's when I hear another car pull up. It's their sergeant.",
    "Therapist: What happens when the sergeant arrives?",
    "Client: He gets out, looks at the scene. I can see him frown. He calls the officers over, and they talk in hushed voices. I can't hear what they're saying, but the officers look annoyed. Finally, the sergeant comes over to me.",
    "Therapist: And then?",
    "Client: He... he helps me up. Tells me there's been a misunderstanding. That I match the description of a suspect they're looking for. He uncuffs me, but he doesn't apologize. Just tells me I'm free to go.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel at that moment?",
    "Client: Relieved, but also... angry. Confused. Shaken. My face is still bleeding, my wrists are sore from the cuffs. I want to yell at them, demand an apology, but I'm afraid of what might happen if I do. So I just... I just walk away.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind as you walk away?",
    "Client: I... I feel like less of a man. Like I should have stood up for myself. But I also know that could have gotten me killed. I'm thinking about my son, how I need to get home to him. How am I going to explain this to him? How do I tell him to trust the police after this?",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about a 7. Talking about it... it helps, I guess. But it also brings it all back.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: *takes a deep breath* Okay. I'm... I'm here. In your office. It's over.",
    "Therapist: Good. Can you tell me five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: Uh, your desk. The bookshelf. The plant in the corner. The clock on the wall. And... the photo of your family.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Now, how do you feel?",
    "Client: A bit calmer. Still shaky, but... better. It's like... talking about it makes it less scary, somehow. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: It absolutely does. You've done great work today, Carlos.",
    "Client: Thanks, doc. It's... it's not easy, but I think it's helping. I just... I want to feel normal again, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's what we're working towards. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I hope so. It's just... sometimes it feels like it'll never get better.",
    "Therapist: It will. These things take time. How about we end with another SUDS rating?",
    "Client: I'd say... maybe a 5 now? I'm tired, but not as anxious.",
    "Therapist: That's improvement. Well done today, Carlos. We'll pick this up next session.",
    "Client: Alright, doc. Thanks for... you know, listening and all that.",
    "Therapist: That's what I'm here for. Take care, Carlos."
