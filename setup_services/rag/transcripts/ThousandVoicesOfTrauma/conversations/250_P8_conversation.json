    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart is still racing, and I feel kind of shaky. The memory of being in the hospital, it just... it brought everything back so vividly.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: I can still smell the disinfectant, you know? It's like I'm right back there in that sterile room, feeling so small and helpless. I remember the beeping of the machines, the hushed voices of the doctors. God, I was so scared.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. And how does your body feel as you recall this?",
    "Client: Tense. Really tense. My shoulders are all bunched up, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's like... like I can't get enough air. And my hands are clammy. I keep wanting to curl up into a ball and hide.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"Why me?\" You know? I was only 25 when I got sick. I should have been out living my life, not fighting for it in a hospital bed. And then there's this voice in my head saying, \"You're weak. You should be over this by now.\" It's... it's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts make you feel?",
    "Client: Angry. Frustrated. But also... really sad. Like, there's this deep ache in my chest. I feel like I lost so much time, so many opportunities. And I'm scared too. Scared it could happen again, that I could end up back there.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about these emotions?",
    "Client: They're... they're really intense. It's like they're all fighting for attention at once. The anger makes me want to lash out, but the sadness just makes me want to cry. And the fear... it's always there, lurking in the background.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when you were actually in the hospital?",
    "Client: I... I think they're actually stronger now. Back then, I was just focused on surviving, you know? I didn't have time to process everything. But now... now it's like all those emotions I couldn't feel then are hitting me at once.",
    "Therapist: What does this tell you about your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I guess... I guess it shows I'm actually dealing with it now? Like, I'm finally facing all these feelings I've been pushing down. It's hard, really hard. But maybe it's necessary? I don't know. Part of me wishes I could just forget it all.",
    "Therapist: How might confronting these emotions be beneficial?",
    "Client: Well, when you put it that way... Maybe it's like lancing a wound? It hurts, but it's the only way to really heal. I've been carrying this weight for so long, maybe facing it head-on will help me finally put it down.",
    "Therapist: What strengths have you discovered through this process?",
    "Client: Strengths? I... I guess I'm tougher than I thought. To be able to face these memories, to talk about them... it takes a lot. And I'm still here, still fighting. Maybe that's a strength in itself?",
    "Therapist: How might you use these strengths moving forward?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe I could be more open about my experiences? Not hide them away like something shameful. And maybe I could use what I've been through to help others somehow. I don't know exactly how, but... yeah, maybe there's something there.",
    "Therapist: What's one thing you've learned about yourself today?",
    "Client: I think... I think I've learned that I'm not as fragile as I thought. These memories are painful, yeah, but I can face them. I can talk about them. And maybe, just maybe, I can grow from them. It's scary, but... it's also kind of empowering, you know?",
    "Therapist: How do you feel now compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, honestly. But also lighter somehow? Like I've set down a heavy backpack I've been carrying for years. I'm exhausted, but there's this tiny spark of hope too. Like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this and come out stronger on the other side.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to explore more about how this illness has affected my relationships. Especially with my family. They were there through it all, but we've never really talked about how it impacted them, you know? I think that might be important.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a valuable area to explore. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I guess. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm finally making progress. It's scary, but also... kind of exciting? Like I'm rediscovering parts of myself I thought were lost.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. How will you take care of yourself for the rest of the day?",
    "Client: I think I'll go for a walk in the park near my place. Being in nature always helps ground me. And then maybe I'll call a friend, just to chat about normal stuff. Oh, and definitely a hot bath later. I need to relax and process everything we've talked about.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like great self-care strategies. I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thanks, doc. See you then."
