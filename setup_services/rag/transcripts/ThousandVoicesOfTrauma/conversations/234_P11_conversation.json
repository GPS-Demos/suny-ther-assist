    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Going back to those moments in the cult, it's like I'm right there again. The way the leader would manipulate us, how he'd make us feel special one moment and worthless the next. It's bringing up a lot of emotions I thought I'd buried.",
    "Therapist: What stood out to you most about revisiting that experience?",
    "Client: The fear. It was so palpable. I could feel it in my chest, you know? Like this constant tightness. But also... the shame. I keep thinking about how I let myself be controlled like that. How I believed all those lies. It's hard not to judge myself harshly for it.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really difficult. How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. At first, I felt like I couldn't breathe. My hands were shaking, and I wanted to run away. But as I kept going, something shifted. It's like... I could see it all more clearly. I started to feel angry instead of just scared. Angry at him, not at myself. That's new for me.",
    "Therapist: Mm. What do you make of that shift?",
    "Client: I think... maybe it means I'm starting to see things differently? Like, before, I always blamed myself for everything. But now, I'm beginning to understand that I was a victim. He was the one who did something wrong, not me. It's a strange feeling, but kind of... freeing?",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight, Sarah. How does this connect to your recovery goals?",
    "Client: Well, I've always wanted to stop feeling so... controlled by my past. To stop letting it dictate my life, you know? This anger, as uncomfortable as it is, feels like a step towards that. It's like I'm finally standing up for myself, even if it's just in my own mind. And the substance use... I think I've been using it to numb these feelings. But facing them head-on, it's scary, but it feels more... real. More like I'm actually dealing with things.",
    "Therapist: You're showing a lot of courage. What's helping you stay engaged in this process?",
    "Client: I guess... the hope that things can be different. That I don't have to be defined by what happened to me. And, um, the support I feel here. It's not easy, but knowing I have a safe space to process all this... it makes a big difference. Sometimes I want to give up, but then I remind myself how far I've come already.",
    "Therapist: That's great self-awareness, Sarah. What's one thing you've learned today?",
    "Client: I think... that my emotions aren't my enemy. They're actually trying to tell me something important. Even the painful ones. And that facing them doesn't destroy me. It's hard, yeah, but I'm stronger than I thought.",
    "Therapist: Excellent observation. How will you apply this moving forward?",
    "Client: I want to... try to sit with my feelings more, instead of running from them or numbing them. Maybe start journaling about them? And remind myself that it's okay to be angry at what happened. It doesn't make me a bad person. It makes me human.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a solid plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... okay. Better than I expected, actually. There's this weird sense of relief, like I've put down a heavy weight I didn't even know I was carrying. It's not all better, but... I feel like I can breathe a little easier.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Sarah. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... maybe we could explore more about setting boundaries? I still struggle with that a lot, especially in relationships. I'm always afraid of upsetting people or being abandoned. I think it's connected to my experiences in the cult.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll work on that next session. Anything else?",
    "Client: No, I think that's it for now. Thank you for... for creating a space where I can talk about all this. It means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Sarah. Take care until next time."
