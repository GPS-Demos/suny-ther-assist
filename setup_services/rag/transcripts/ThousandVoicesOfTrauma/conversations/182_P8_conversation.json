    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling shaky. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I'm back there, you know? In that hospital room, with the machines beeping and that guy... that guy waving the gun around. I can still smell the antiseptic and hear the panic in people's voices.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... anger? Yeah, I'm angry. Why did this have to happen to me? I was just there for a routine check-up, and suddenly everything went to hell. It's not fair.",
    "Therapist: I hear that. Can you tell me more about the anger?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a hot ball in my chest. I'm angry at that man for putting us all through that terror. I'm angry at the hospital for not having better security. And I'm angry at myself for feeling so helpless. I keep thinking I should have done something, anything. But I just sat there, frozen.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind as you reflect on feeling helpless?",
    "Client: I... I feel like a coward. Like I should have been braver. But then I remind myself that I was just a patient, not a superhero. It's confusing. Part of me knows I couldn't have done anything, but another part still feels guilty. And then I feel stupid for feeling guilty. It's a mess in my head.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to process. How does your body feel right now?",
    "Client: Tense. Really tense. My shoulders are up to my ears, and my jaw is clenched. I notice I'm holding my breath a lot. And my stomach feels like it's tied in knots. It's like my body is still on high alert, even though I know I'm safe here.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What do you notice as you do that?",
    "Client: I... wow. I didn't realize how shallow my breathing was. Taking that deep breath, I feel some of the tension release. It's like... like I'm coming back to the present a bit. The knot in my stomach loosens slightly. But there's still this underlying anxiety, you know?",
    "Therapist: Can you describe that anxiety?",
    "Client: It's like... like waiting for the other shoe to drop. Like any moment, something terrible could happen again. I find myself constantly scanning my surroundings, looking for potential threats. Even here, in your office, where I know I'm safe. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: How has this anxiety affected your daily life?",
    "Client: Oh, in so many ways. I avoid hospitals like the plague now, which is problematic because I have regular check-ups for my heart condition. I've missed a few appointments already. I'm jumpy all the time, especially in crowded places. And... and it's affecting my relationship with my spouse. They're trying to be supportive, but I can see the strain it's putting on them.",
    "Therapist: That sounds challenging. What's been most difficult?",
    "Client: The most difficult part is... feeling like I've lost control of my life. Before this, I was always the one in charge, you know? At work, at home. Now I feel like I'm at the mercy of my fears and anxieties. It's like I'm not myself anymore, and I don't know how to get back to who I was.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to share that?",
    "Client: It's... it's both scary and relieving. Scary because saying it out loud makes it real. But relieving because... I guess I've been holding this in for so long. It feels good to let it out, to have someone really listen and understand. I've been trying to be strong for everyone else, but the truth is, I'm struggling.",
    "Therapist: You're showing a lot of courage. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I... I think I need hope. Hope that I can get through this, that I can feel safe again. And maybe... maybe some tools to help me deal with these intense emotions and memories when they come up. I'm tired of feeling like a victim. I want to feel like a survivor.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful shift. How can we work towards that?",
    "Client: I'm not entirely sure, but I think... maybe we could work on some coping strategies? And perhaps... perhaps find ways for me to regain some sense of control in my life. Maybe even... eventually... face my fear of hospitals. But that last one terrifies me just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: We'll take it step by step. How are you feeling now compared to when we started?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also a bit lighter. Like I've put down a heavy backpack I've been carrying. There's still fear and anxiety, but there's also a tiny spark of... I don't know, maybe hope? Like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this and come out stronger on the other side.",
    "Therapist: That's a great place to end today. Next session, we'll...",
    "Client: Thank you. Really. I know we have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like there might be a light at the end of this tunnel. It's small and far away, but it's there. And that... that means more than I can express."
