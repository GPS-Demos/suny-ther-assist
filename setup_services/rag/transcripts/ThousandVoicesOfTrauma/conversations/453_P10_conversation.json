    "Therapist: Good morning, Mr. Chen. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: Honestly, I'm... I'm a bit on edge. Last night, I hardly slept thinking about this. It's not easy to revisit those memories, you know?",
    "Therapist: I understand. Your feelings are valid. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Let's... let's get this over with.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes, take a deep breath, and describe the scene as vividly as you can.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm... I'm back in Vietnam. It's 1968, and I'm stationed near the DMZ. The air is thick with humidity, and there's this constant buzzing of insects. I can smell the damp earth and... and a faint scent of diesel from the nearby vehicles. My uniform is sticking to my skin. I'm on patrol with my unit, moving through dense jungle. The leaves are so green, almost unnaturally bright. Every rustle makes me flinch.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: We're... we're moving cautiously. Suddenly, there's a crack of gunfire. I drop to the ground, my heart pounding so hard I can barely hear anything else. I'm... I'm terrified. My hands are shaking as I grip my rifle. I can hear shouting, but it's all jumbled. I... I can't make out the words.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My... my chest is tight. It's hard to breathe. My muscles are so tense, they're aching. I feel... I feel like I'm going to be sick. The fear is... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about an 80. It's really intense.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... The gunfire is getting closer. I can see muzzle flashes through the trees. The air is filled with the smell of gunpowder and... and something metallic. Blood, I think. I hear someone scream - it's Johnson, my buddy. He's been hit. I want to help him, but I'm... I'm frozen. I can't move. I'm so ashamed.",
    "Therapist: It's okay. You're doing great. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I finally force myself to move. I'm crawling towards Johnson. The ground is wet, muddy. I can feel the grit under my fingernails. His face is... God, there's so much blood. He's looking at me, his eyes wide with fear. I'm trying to put pressure on the wound, but... but it's not helping. He's gurgling, trying to speak. I can't understand him. I feel so... so helpless.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking, \"This can't be happening. This isn't real.\" But it is. I can smell the blood, feel its warmth on my hands. I'm... I'm angry. Furious at the enemy, at the war, at myself for not being able to do more. Johnson's grip on my arm is getting weaker. I'm watching the life drain out of him, and I can't do anything to stop it.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 90. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Remember, you're here in the present, safe in my office.",
    "Client: Right... right. I'm here. It's just... it feels so real.",
    "Therapist: I know. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... Johnson's gone. His hand falls away from my arm. I feel... empty. Numb. The gunfire is still going on around me, but it sounds distant, like I'm underwater. I should be moving, finding cover, but I can't leave Johnson. I'm just kneeling there, in the mud, next to his body. I can hear someone shouting my name, but I can't respond.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body now?",
    "Client: I feel... heavy. Like there's a weight on my chest. My throat is tight, and I'm... I'm fighting back tears. My hands are shaking uncontrollably.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I know. It's just... it's overwhelming. I can still see Johnson's face, you know? The way he looked at me, pleading for help. I... I failed him.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you did everything you could in that situation.",
    "Client: Maybe... Finally, someone grabs me. It's Sergeant Martinez. He's yelling at me to move, dragging me away from Johnson's body. I'm... I'm stumbling, barely able to stay on my feet. We're running through the jungle. Branches are whipping at my face. I can hear bullets whizzing past us. My lungs are burning. I want to stop, to catch my breath, but Martinez keeps pushing me forward.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still around 90. My heart's racing just talking about it.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm... I'm here. It's just... it's so vivid.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: We... we finally reach our fallback position. I collapse behind a fallen tree, gasping for air. My ears are ringing from the gunfire. I can taste blood in my mouth - I must have bit my cheek while running. Martinez is shouting orders, but I can barely focus. I'm... I'm looking at my hands. They're covered in Johnson's blood. I can't stop staring at them.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that image. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking that I'll never be clean again. That this blood, this guilt, will stay with me forever. I'm angry at myself for freezing, for not being able to save Johnson. I'm... I'm scared that I'll never be the same after this.",
    "Therapist: These are common thoughts after such a traumatic experience.",
    "Client: I guess... The fighting continues for what feels like hours. Eventually, reinforcements arrive, and we push the enemy back. When it's finally over, I'm... I'm numb. I can't feel anything. I'm just going through the motions, following orders. We go back to retrieve the bodies. Seeing Johnson again... it's like reliving it all over. His eyes are still open, staring blankly at the sky. I... I have to close them. My hands are shaking so badly, I can barely do it.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. There's this hollow feeling in my chest. I feel... I feel guilty for surviving when Johnson didn't.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe around 75 now.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing these emotions. Continue.",
    "Client: After... after we bring the bodies back, there's a debriefing. I can barely focus on what's being said. Everything feels surreal, like I'm watching it happen to someone else. I keep seeing Johnson's face, hearing his last attempts to speak. I... I volunteer for the next patrol. I don't want to be alone with my thoughts. I'm afraid of what will happen if I stop moving, stop doing something.",
    "Therapist: How do you think that decision affected you?",
    "Client: I... I think it was the start of me pushing everything down. Not dealing with it. I couldn't face what had happened, so I just... kept going. Kept volunteering for patrols, for dangerous missions. Part of me hoped that maybe... maybe I wouldn't come back either.",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly difficult to carry.",
    "Client: It was. It still is. I... I never really dealt with it. Even after I came home, I just tried to forget. But I couldn't. The nightmares, the flashbacks... they never really went away.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, after sharing this memory?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. Drained. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe relief? Like I've finally let some of this out after carrying it for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after processing trauma. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 60, I think. Still there, but not as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. How do you feel about what we've done today?",
    "Client: It was tough. Really tough. But... but I think it was necessary. I've been carrying this for so long, trying to forget. Maybe... maybe facing it is the first step to really dealing with it.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent insight. You've shown tremendous courage today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I never thought I'd be able to talk about this. It's always been too painful.",
    "Therapist: You've taken an important step. How are you feeling physically now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. My body feels heavy, but also... maybe a bit lighter? Like I've put down a weight I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. You've done great work today.",
    "Client: I... I appreciate that. It's still hard, you know? I still feel guilty about Johnson, about not being able to save him.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We'll continue to work on processing those feelings.",
    "Client: Okay. I... I think I'm ready to stop for today. This has been... intense.",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've made significant progress. How are you feeling about our next session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm nervous, but also... maybe a little hopeful? I didn't think I could talk about this at all, but I did.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed between sessions.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you... for listening, for helping me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care of yourself, and I'll see you next time."
