    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is buzzing, you know? My hands are shaky, and I can feel my heart racing. That memory of the refugee camp... it's so vivid. I can still smell the damp canvas of the tents, hear the constant murmur of voices in different languages. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. We were stuck there, waiting for someone to decide our fate. I remember looking at my wife and children, seeing the fear in their eyes, and feeling like I had failed them. I was supposed to protect them, you know? But there we were, at the mercy of others. It's... it's hard to shake that feeling of powerlessness.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How does that feeling of powerlessness affect you now?",
    "Client: It's like a shadow that follows me. Even now, in my comfortable life here, I sometimes wake up in a cold sweat, thinking we're back there. It affects my work too. I find myself hesitating to make decisions, always second-guessing myself. And the pain... my chronic pain seems to flare up when these memories surface. It's as if my body is reliving the stress and discomfort of those days.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much anger I've been carrying. Anger at the situation, at the people who caused us to flee, even at myself for not being able to do more. But there's also... I don't know... a sort of guilt? We made it out, we're safe now, but so many others weren't as fortunate. I see their faces sometimes, the people we left behind. It's a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: How does sharing this make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a bit of a relief. I've kept so much of this bottled up inside. My wife, she's been through it all with me, but I try to stay strong for her and the kids. Talking about it like this, it's like letting out a breath I've been holding for years. But it's also scary, you know? Like I'm opening a door I'm not sure I can close again.",
    "Therapist: What do you think that fear is about?",
    "Client: I suppose... I'm afraid of being overwhelmed by these memories and emotions. What if I can't control them? What if they start interfering with my life more than they already do? I've worked so hard to build a new life here, to provide for my family. The thought of losing that stability terrifies me. And yet, keeping it all inside isn't working either. It's like I'm caught between two impossible choices.",
    "Therapist: How do you see this affecting your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm starting to see that facing these memories might be the only way forward. It's painful, and it's scary, but maybe it's necessary. I want to be free of this weight I've been carrying. I want to be fully present for my family, not constantly battling these inner demons. Maybe by confronting these experiences, I can start to reclaim some of that power I felt I lost. It's a long road ahead, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: What gives you hope in this process?",
    "Client: That's a good question. I think... I think it's the resilience I've seen in my family. We've been through so much together, and we're still here, still fighting. And there's a part of me that believes if we could survive that, we can survive anything. Plus, being here, talking about it... it feels like a step in the right direction. It's terrifying, but also... liberating in a way. Maybe there's hope in that.",
    "Therapist: How would you like to close our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to take a moment to just breathe. To acknowledge how far we've come, both in this session and in life. And maybe... maybe to remind myself that it's okay to feel all of these things. That feeling them doesn't make me weak, it makes me human. Is that alright?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's do that together."
