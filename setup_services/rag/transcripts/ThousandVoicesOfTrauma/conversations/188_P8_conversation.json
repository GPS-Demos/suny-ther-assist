    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like I'm back there again, you know? I can still hear the shouting, the sound of glass breaking. My heart's racing a bit. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of things. I feel angry, scared, and... guilty, I guess. I keep thinking about my neighbor, Sarah. She was so small, so helpless. I should've done more to help her.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. Can you tell me more about that guilt?",
    "Client: Well, I... I was just a kid myself, maybe 12 or 13. But I knew what was happening next door. I could hear it all. The screaming, the crying. I'd see Sarah at school with bruises she tried to hide. I wanted to do something, but I was... I was scared. What if her dad came after me or my family? So I just... stayed quiet. And now, all these years later, I can't help but wonder what happened to her.",
    "Therapist: That's a heavy burden to carry. How does it affect you now?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a weight on my chest. Sometimes I have trouble sleeping, thinking about it. I find myself getting anxious when I hear loud noises or arguments. And I... I struggle with trusting people, especially men. I know it's not rational, but part of me is always on guard, waiting for something bad to happen.",
    "Therapist: I see. What physical sensations are you noticing as you talk about this?",
    "Client: My hands are... they're kind of clammy. My stomach feels tight, like there's a knot in it. And my jaw... I just realized I've been clenching it this whole time. It's like my body's still bracing for something bad to happen, even though I know I'm safe here.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. How do these memories impact your daily life?",
    "Client: It's... it's complicated. I find myself being overly protective of kids I see, even strangers. I volunteer at a youth center, trying to make up for what I couldn't do back then. But sometimes, I worry I'm too intense, that I'm seeing danger where there isn't any. And relationships... they're hard. I have trouble letting people get close. It's like I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop.",
    "Therapist: Mm. What thoughts come to mind when you reflect on your younger self in that situation?",
    "Client: I... I feel sorry for that kid. He was so scared, so confused. Part of me wants to be angry at him for not doing more, but... but I know he was just trying to survive too. It's strange, you know? I'm an old man now, but sometimes I still feel like that helpless boy, watching the world fall apart and not knowing how to fix it.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to have that compassion for your younger self?",
    "Client: It's... it's new. And a bit uncomfortable, to be honest. I've spent so long being angry at myself, it's strange to feel... understanding? But it's also... it's kind of a relief. Like maybe I don't have to carry all this guilt anymore. Maybe I can forgive that scared kid and move forward.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What do you think this means for your healing journey?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. But it feels like a step forward. Maybe if I can be kinder to myself, I can start to let go of some of this pain. Maybe I can learn to trust again, to connect with people without always waiting for the worst. It's scary, but... but I think I want to try.",
    "Therapist: That's a courageous perspective. How are you feeling now compared to when we started?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, I guess. Still a bit shaky, but not as overwhelmed. It's like... like I've set down a heavy bag I've been carrying for years. I know I'll probably pick it up again, but now I know I can put it down too. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to explore more about trust. How to build it, how to maintain it. And maybe... maybe look at ways to use my experiences to help others without letting it consume me. Is that something we could work on?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll start there next time. How are you feeling about ending for today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. A bit drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like after a long workout. Thank you for... for helping me see things differently. I think I'll sleep better tonight.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. Take care, and we'll continue this next week."
