    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure. Close your eyes and take us back to that day with the animal attack.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm at the park near my old house. It's a sunny day, and I'm walking my daughter's dog, Max. He's a small terrier. We're on the usual path, and everything seems normal...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: Suddenly, I hear growling. I turn and see this huge dog, maybe a Rottweiler, charging towards us. My heart starts racing. I try to pick up Max, but before I can...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: The big dog is on us. It's teeth are bared, and it's snarling. I'm screaming, trying to pull Max away, but the big dog has him in its jaws. There's so much noise - barking, growling, yelping. I can't... I can't...",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm hitting the big dog with my cane, yelling for help. But it won't let go of Max. There's blood everywhere. I can smell it. I feel so helpless, so weak. Why can't I protect him?",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: People are running over now. Someone pulls the big dog off, but Max is... he's just lying there, not moving. I'm on the ground next to him, my hands covered in his blood. I'm sobbing, telling him to wake up. But he doesn't. He's gone, and it's my fault. I should have been stronger, faster...",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're not there now. You're here, and you're safe.",
    "Client: I know, but it feels so real. I can still hear the growling, smell the blood. My daughter was devastated. She blamed me for not protecting Max. I've never felt so useless, so guilty.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The aftermath was terrible. I couldn't sleep for weeks. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that dog attacking. I stopped going to the park. I couldn't even look at dogs without panicking. My daughter... she didn't speak to me for months. It tore our family apart.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Continue.",
    "Client: I started isolating myself. I felt like I couldn't be trusted to keep anyone safe. My depression got worse. I thought about... ending things. The guilt was overwhelming. I kept thinking, if only I had been stronger, if only I had reacted faster...",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those thoughts. You're doing well facing them.",
    "Client: But I know now that it wasn't really my fault. I did everything I could. I was just an old woman against a vicious dog. I couldn't have known it would happen. It's taken me years to accept that, but the guilt still lingers sometimes.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Drained, but... lighter, somehow. Talking about it, really reliving it... it's hard, but I think it helps. The memory doesn't seem to have as much power over me when I face it head-on like this.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable courage today. Let's end here.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without breaking down completely. It's still painful, but I feel like I'm finally starting to heal.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of your progress. We'll continue next session."
