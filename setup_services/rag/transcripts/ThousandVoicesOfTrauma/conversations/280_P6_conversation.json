    "Therapist: Alright, Mr. Singh, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day in combat...",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm there. It's hot, unbearably hot. The sun is beating down on us. I can feel sweat trickling down my back. The air is thick with dust and... and the smell of gunpowder. We're moving through a small village, and everything is too quiet. My heart is racing...",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Um... I'd say about a 40 right now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud explosion to our right. My ears are ringing. I can't hear anything clearly. People are shouting, but it's all muffled. I see one of my squad mates fall... there's blood... so much blood. I'm frozen. I can't move. I should help him, but I can't...",
    "Therapist: And now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe 60? My hands are shaking. I can feel my heart pounding in my chest.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I finally manage to move. I'm running towards him, but it feels like I'm moving through molasses. Everything is in slow motion. I reach him, and his eyes are... they're blank. He's not moving. I'm shouting for a medic, but my voice sounds strange, distant. I can smell the metallic scent of blood mixed with dirt and smoke. It's overwhelming...",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) It's... it's up to 75 now. I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Inhales shakily) I... I can still see his face. He was so young. I should have been faster, should have done something more. The guilt... it's crushing me. I can hear more gunfire in the distance, but I can't focus on anything else. My hands are covered in his blood...",
    "Therapist: And now?",
    "Client: It's... it's at 85. My chest feels tight. I'm... I'm struggling here.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here with me. You're safe.",
    "Client: (Nods, breathing heavily) The shooting is getting closer. I have to leave him. I have to move. But I can't... I can't just leave him there. I'm torn between my duty and... and wanting to protect him, even though he's already gone. I feel so helpless, so useless...",

I'm moving on autopilot, my training kicking in, but inside I'm screaming. The guilt, the fear, the anger - it's all swirling inside me. I feel like I'm going to be sick...",
    "Therapist: And now?",

    "Client: (Nods, taking deep breaths) Okay... The sounds are fading. The images are becoming less vivid. I'm... I'm starting to feel more present here in the room with you.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Final SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to about 50 now. I'm... I'm okay. That was intense, but... I got through it.",
    "Therapist: You did wonderfully. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves..."
