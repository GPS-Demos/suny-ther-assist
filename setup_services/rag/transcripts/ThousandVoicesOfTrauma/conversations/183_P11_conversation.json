    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. Going back to that moment in the prison cell, it felt so real again. The cold concrete, the darkness, the isolation... It's like I was right back there, you know? My heart is still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The silence. It was deafening. In that tiny cell, all I could hear was my own breathing and occasional footsteps outside. It reminded me of how alone I felt as a child, locked in that closet for hours. The same feeling of abandonment, of being forgotten by the world.",
    "Therapist: How did reliving that memory feel different from when you usually think about it?",
    "Client: It was... clearer, I guess. Usually, when these memories come up, I try to push them away. But this time, I had to face it head-on. I noticed things I hadn't before, like the smell of damp concrete and how my body felt tense and small. It was scary, but also... I don't know, maybe a little empowering?",
    "Therapist: Empowering? Can you elaborate on that?",
    "Client: Well, I survived it, didn't I? Both as a child and in that prison. I made it through. And now, here I am, talking about it. That's something I never thought I'd be able to do. It's still painful, but I feel... stronger, somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does this connect to your recovery goals?",
    "Client: I think... it shows me that I can face these memories without falling apart. Maybe if I can do this, I can start to feel safer in my daily life too. Like, if I can handle reliving the worst moments, surely I can handle a crowded street or a dark room, right?",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful connection. What else?",
    "Client: It's also making me realize how much these experiences have affected my relationships. The feeling of isolation in that cell, it's not so different from how I sometimes feel around people now. Maybe that's why I've been keeping others at arm's length.",
    "Therapist: How might you use this awareness moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I can try to open up more to my roommates. Just small steps, you know? And when I start feeling that isolation creeping in, I can remind myself that I'm not in that cell or that closet anymore. I have choices now.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great plan. How are you feeling about continuing with the exposures?",
    "Client: Honestly? It's terrifying. But... I also feel a glimmer of hope. Like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this and come out stronger on the other side. It's hard, but I think it's worth it.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. What support do you need?",
    "Client: I think... just knowing you're here, listening without judgment, helps a lot. And maybe some more grounding techniques for when the memories feel too overwhelming? I want to keep going, but I also want to feel safe doing it.",
    "Therapist: We can definitely work on that. Anything else?",
    "Client: No, I think that's it for now. I'm exhausted, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've done something important, even if it was really hard.",
    "Therapist: It absolutely makes sense. How would you like to end today's session?",
    "Client: Can we just sit quietly for a moment? I need to catch my breath and let all of this sink in. And maybe... could you remind me of why we're doing this? Sometimes I lose sight of the end goal when things get tough.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take a moment..."
