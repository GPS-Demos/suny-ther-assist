    "Therapist: How are you feeling after today's imaginal exposure, Mr. Khalil?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's a mix of emotions, really. Going through that memory of my time in the cult... it's intense. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a bit lighter? It's hard to explain.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sense of isolation, I think. Remembering how cut off I felt from the outside world, from my family... It's overwhelming. I could almost feel the walls of that compound closing in on me again. And the constant fear of disappointing the leader... it's like a weight on my chest.",
    "Therapist: How does that compare to your everyday life now?",
    "Client: Well, I... I guess I still struggle with feeling isolated sometimes. Even though I'm living with my family now, there are moments when I feel like no one really understands what I've been through. And that fear of disappointing others? It's still there, just... different. Less intense, but it affects my work, my relationships.",
    "Therapist: I see. How did it feel to share that memory today?",
    "Client: Terrifying at first. My heart was racing, and I thought I might have a panic attack. But as I kept going, it... it got a bit easier. By the end, I felt like I could breathe a little better. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's a common experience. What do you make of that?",
    "Client: I suppose it's... progress? Maybe facing these memories head-on is helping me process them better. It's still difficult, but I'm starting to see that I can get through it without falling apart completely.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. How might this relate to your recovery goals?",
    "Client: I think... maybe it's showing me that I'm stronger than I thought. My goal has been to feel more in control of my life, to not let the past dictate my present. And today, even though it was hard, I felt like I had some control over the memory, instead of it controlling me.",
    "Therapist: Excellent observation. What strategies helped you today?",
    "Client: The breathing exercises we practiced definitely helped. And reminding myself that I'm safe now, that it's just a memory... that was crucial. Oh, and focusing on sensory details \u2013 it kept me grounded somehow.",
    "Therapist: Those are valuable tools. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's... scary, honestly. But I also feel a glimmer of hope. Like maybe, just maybe, I can work through this and come out stronger on the other side. I want to keep going, even though it's tough.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is admirable. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: I... I just want to thank you. For guiding me through this, for being patient. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't judge. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in years, I feel like there might be light at the end of this very dark tunnel.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work, Mr. Khalil. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, definitely. Thank you again. I'll be here."
