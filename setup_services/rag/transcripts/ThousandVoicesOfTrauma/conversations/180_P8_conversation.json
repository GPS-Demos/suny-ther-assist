    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mr. Singh?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving that moment when I found out about my wife's diagnosis... it's bringing up a lot of emotions I thought I had buried.",
    "Therapist: Can you tell me more about those emotions?",
    "Client: Well, there's this heaviness in my chest, like a weight pressing down. I feel... lost, I suppose. Scared. When I close my eyes, I can still see the doctor's face as he told us the news. It's like I'm right back there in that sterile office, and I can smell the antiseptic...",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... I should have known something was wrong sooner. Maybe if we'd caught it earlier... But then I feel guilty for even having that thought. It's not her fault, you know? And then I feel angry at myself for not being stronger for her. She needed me, and I... I felt so helpless.",
    "Therapist: It sounds like you're experiencing a complex mix of emotions.",
    "Client: Yes, it's... it's like a storm inside me. One moment I'm sad, then angry, then guilty. And through it all, there's this... this profound sense of loss. Not just for my wife, but for the future we had planned together. Our golden years, you know? We were supposed to travel, to spend time with our grandchildren. Now... now I don't know what the future holds.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you're talking about this?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking a bit. And my throat feels tight, like I'm trying to hold back tears. There's a knot in my stomach too. It's... it's hard to breathe sometimes when I think about it all.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: I... I miss her. Even though she's still here, I miss the way things were. The way she used to laugh, the plans we'd make. Now everything revolves around doctor's appointments and medication schedules. I feel... I feel like I'm losing her bit by bit, and I don't know how to stop it.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. How are you coping with these feelings?",
    "Client: Not well, I'm afraid. Some days I can barely get out of bed. The house feels so empty, even when she's there. I find myself avoiding our friends because I can't bear to see the pity in their eyes. And... and sometimes I feel so angry at the world. Why us? Why her? She's always been so kind, so giving. It's not fair.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to feel that way. What do you do when these feelings become overwhelming?",
    "Client: I... I try to keep busy. I've been spending a lot of time in the garden. It was always her passion, you know? Now I'm out there every day, tending to her flowers. It makes me feel close to her somehow. And sometimes, when the memories become too much, I look at our old photo albums. It hurts, but it also reminds me of all the good times we've had.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a meaningful way to connect with her. How does it make you feel?",
    "Client: It's bittersweet. Sometimes it brings me comfort, other times it just amplifies the pain. There are moments when I look at those photos and I can almost hear her laugh, smell her perfume. And then the reality of our situation comes crashing back, and it's... it's devastating all over again.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength in facing these emotions.",
    "Client: I don't feel strong. Most days I feel like I'm barely holding it together. I worry about what will happen when... when she's gone. How will I go on? We've been together for nearly 50 years. I don't know who I am without her.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those concerns. What helps you get through each day?",
    "Client: I... I try to focus on the present. On making her comfortable, on cherishing the moments we still have. Sometimes we sit in the garden together, not saying anything, just... being. Those moments, they're precious. And our children, they've been so supportive. Seeing her face light up when our grandchildren visit, it... it gives me strength.",
    "Therapist: That's beautiful. How do these positive moments impact your overall experience?",
    "Client: They're like... like rays of sunlight breaking through storm clouds. They remind me that even in the midst of all this pain and uncertainty, there's still love and joy to be found. It doesn't take away the fear or the sadness, but it... it makes it bearable, I suppose.",
    "Therapist: You're showing remarkable resilience. How do you feel now, after sharing all this?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also somewhat lighter. It's strange, talking about it all. Part of me wants to run away from these feelings, but another part... it's almost a relief to let it out. I've been trying to be strong for so long, for her, for our family. But the truth is, I'm scared. I'm hurting. And I... I don't know how to say goodbye.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. Your feelings are valid.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I needed to hear that. Sometimes I feel guilty for focusing on my own pain when she's the one who's ill. But it helps to know that... that it's okay to struggle with this. That I'm not alone in feeling overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: You're not alone. How can we support you moving forward?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. I think just having a space to talk about these feelings helps. And maybe... maybe some strategies for managing the anxiety and depression? I want to be present for her, to make the most of our time together. But some days it's so hard to see past the grief and fear.",
    "Therapist: We can definitely work on that. Is there anything else you'd like to share?",
    "Client: I... I think that's all for now. This has been... intense. But thank you for listening. For the first time in a while, I feel like maybe... maybe I can face this. It won't be easy, but knowing I have support, it makes a difference.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible courage today. We'll continue to work through this together."
