    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling pretty shaken up. My heart's still racing, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's like I'm right back there, you know? The sound of the engines, the sudden drop... God, it was terrifying.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of things. There's fear, definitely. But also this overwhelming sense of helplessness. I keep thinking about how I had no control over what was happening. And then there's this guilt... I... I survived when others didn't.",
    "Therapist: I see. Can you tell me more about that guilt?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard to explain. I mean, logically, I know it's not my fault. But there's this voice in my head saying, \"Why you? Why did you get to walk away?\" And it's not just about the crash. It... it brings up feelings from... from the abuse too. Like, why did I survive all of that? Sometimes I wonder if I deserved it all.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really challenging. How does your body feel as you're sharing this?",
    "Client: My shoulders are so tense. I can feel this knot in my stomach, and my hands are... they're shaking a little. It's like my body's on high alert, you know? Like it's waiting for something bad to happen again.",
    "Therapist: I understand. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep replaying the moment when the oxygen masks dropped. There was this surreal moment where I thought, \"This can't be happening.\" And then... then I remember thinking about my mom. I was so scared I'd never see her again. And now, sitting here, I'm thinking about how close I came to... to not being here. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly intense. How are you coping with these feelings?",
    "Client: I'm trying to breathe deeply, like we practiced. But it's hard. Part of me wants to just... run away from these feelings. But I know that's not helpful. I'm trying to remind myself that I'm safe now, that I survived. But it's... it's a struggle.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I... I keep having this flashback to the moment after we landed. The relief was... indescribable. But then I saw people who were injured, and I felt so... guilty for feeling relieved. And now, I'm realizing how much this connects to my past trauma. That same cycle of relief and then guilt. It's like... like I'm not allowed to feel okay.",
    "Therapist: Mm. How does recognizing that connection impact you?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a bit empowering, in a weird way. Like, I can see the pattern now. And maybe... maybe that means I can start to change it? I don't know. It's still overwhelming, but it feels like... like maybe there's hope?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What else are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... tired. Really tired. But also kind of... proud? I mean, talking about this is hard, but I'm doing it. And that's something, right? It's like... for the first time, I'm facing these memories instead of running from them. It's terrifying, but also... I don't know, maybe healing?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How would you describe your current state?",
    "Client: It's like... like I'm standing on the edge of something. Part of me is terrified to take the next step, but another part knows I need to. I feel vulnerable, but also... stronger? Like maybe I can handle more than I thought. It's confusing, but... but I think it's good. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I think... I think I just need a moment. To breathe. To remind myself that I'm here, I'm safe. And maybe... maybe to acknowledge that what I've been through was real, and it was hard, but I survived. I'm still here. And that... that means something.",
    "Therapist: Take all the time you need. You've done incredible work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I appreciate that. It's not easy, but... but I'm glad I'm doing this. I think... I think it's helping. Even if it doesn't feel like it in the moment, I can see that facing these memories is... is important. It's like... like I'm reclaiming parts of myself that I thought were lost.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but also... lighter? Like I've set down a heavy weight I've been carrying. There's still so much to process, but for the first time in a long time, I feel like maybe... maybe I can do this. Maybe I can heal.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to explore more about how my past trauma connects to my experience with the plane crash. And maybe... maybe start talking about ways to manage the guilt. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll pick up there next session. How would you like to close today?",
    "Client: Can we... can we just sit in silence for a moment? I think I need to just... be still. To let everything we've talked about settle.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take that moment now."
