    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Can you describe the airplane crash scene?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm on the plane, it's a small commercial flight. We're about an hour into the journey when suddenly there's a loud bang. The plane starts shaking violently. I can hear people screaming...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The oxygen masks drop down. I'm fumbling to put mine on, my hands are shaking so badly. The plane is losing altitude fast. I can see the ocean getting closer through the window. My heart is pounding, I can barely breathe...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can do this. It's too much.",
    "Therapist: You're stronger than you think. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: Okay... The plane hits the water with a massive impact. Water starts rushing in immediately. People are panicking, trying to get out of their seats. I'm frozen, I can't move...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: Someone grabs my arm, pulling me towards the emergency exit. The water is rising fast. I'm terrified of drowning. We manage to get the door open, but the rush of water is overwhelming...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Remember, you're here now, safe.",
    "Client: I'm pushed out into the ocean. The water is freezing. I can see pieces of the plane sinking around me. People are screaming for help. I'm trying to stay afloat, but the waves keep crashing over me...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're doing excellent work.",
    "Client: I spot a life raft nearby. I'm swimming towards it, but my clothes feel so heavy. I'm exhausted. For a moment, I think I'm not going to make it...",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: Finally, I reach the raft and pull myself in. There are a few others already there. We're all in shock, shivering. I look around and can't see any land. Just endless ocean. The realization hits me that we might not be found...",
    "Therapist: You're processing this well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... overwhelmed. My heart is racing, and I feel like I'm back there again. It's hard to remind myself that I'm here, safe, in your office.",
    "Therapist: That's completely normal. You're doing incredible work.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's just... the fear, the helplessness. It all feels so real again. We were out there for hours before rescue came. Every minute felt like an eternity.",
    "Therapist: You survived. You're resilient.",
    "Client: I know, but sometimes I wonder why I survived when others didn't. The guilt is overwhelming at times.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. We'll work through it.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's just... the memories. They're so vivid. The sounds of people crying, the cold of the water, the uncertainty of rescue. It's all etched into my mind.",
    "Therapist: You're processing trauma. It takes time.",
    "Client: You're right. I know it's a process. It's just hard to face these memories head-on like this. But I want to get better. I want to be able to fly again without panic attacks.",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. You're making progress.",
