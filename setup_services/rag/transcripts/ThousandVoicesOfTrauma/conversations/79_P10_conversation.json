    "Therapist: Welcome, Margaret. How are you feeling about our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: Oh, well... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is... hesitant, I suppose. It's not easy to revisit these memories.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. How would you rate your distress from 0 to 100?",
    "Client: I'd say... maybe a 40? My stomach's a bit knotted, but I'm not panicking or anything.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Close your eyes when you're ready, and describe the scene.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Alright... I'm in our old kitchen. It's evening, probably around 7 PM. I can smell dinner burning on the stove. I'd lost track of time again, trying to tidy up before Jack got home. The linoleum floor feels cold under my bare feet as I rush to salvage the pot roast.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: The kitchen is dimly lit, just the light over the stove is on. I can see steam rising from the pot, and... oh God, I hear the front door slam. My heart starts racing. I know Jack's going to be furious about dinner.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Margaret. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I hear his heavy footsteps coming down the hall. My hands are shaking as I try to transfer the food to a serving dish. I drop the spoon, and it clatters loudly on the floor. Jack's voice booms from behind me, \"What the hell is going on in here?\"",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My... my chest feels tight. I can barely breathe. My legs feel weak, like they might give out. I want to run, but I'm frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Margaret. You're safe here. Can you tell me your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 65 now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, you're in control. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Shaky breath) I turn around, and Jack's standing in the doorway. His face is red, and I can smell the alcohol on him from across the room. He starts yelling about how I can't do anything right, how useless I am. I try to apologize, but my voice comes out as a whisper.",
    "Therapist: What do you want to do in that moment?",
    "Client: I... I want to defend myself, to tell him it was an accident. But I know that'll only make things worse. So I just stand there, my eyes fixed on the floor, waiting for it to be over.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Margaret. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: He stomps over to me, grabs my arm so hard it hurts. I can feel his fingers digging into my skin. He's screaming in my face now, calling me worthless, saying he should've left years ago. I... I can feel tears running down my cheeks, but I don't dare wipe them away.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking this is all my fault. If I'd just been more careful, if I'd been a better wife, this wouldn't be happening. I feel so small, so... insignificant.",
    "Therapist: Remember, Margaret, those thoughts aren't true. Can you give me another SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 80 now. My heart's pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a deep breath. What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he lets go of my arm and shoves me. I stumble back, hitting the counter hard. The pain shoots through my lower back, but I don't make a sound. I'm afraid any noise will set him off again. He's pacing now, muttering under his breath about how he deserves better.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: I feel... helpless. Trapped. Like I'm suffocating. I want to disappear, to become invisible. The room feels like it's spinning.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Margaret. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: I... I can't breathe. My chest hurts. I... I think I'm having a panic attack.",
    "Therapist: Open your eyes, Margaret. Look around the room. Can you name five things you see?",
    "Client: I... I see the bookshelf, the window, your desk, the clock, and... and the plant in the corner.",
    "Therapist: Good. Take a deep breath. How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 70. I'm still shaky, but I can breathe again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. When you're ready, close your eyes and return to the memory.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Okay... Jack's still in the kitchen. He's grabbed the pot of burned food and thrown it in the sink. The crash makes me flinch. He turns back to me, his eyes cold and angry. \"Clean this mess up,\" he snarls. \"And don't expect me to eat this slop.\"",
    "Therapist: What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I nod silently and move towards the sink. My hands are trembling so badly I can barely turn on the water. I start scrubbing the pot, trying to be quick and quiet. I can hear Jack in the living room, turning on the TV, the volume too loud.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... numb. Like I'm not really there. My body's going through the motions, but my mind is... somewhere else. I'm thinking about how I'll have to wear long sleeves tomorrow to hide the bruises.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling, Margaret. What happens next?",
    "Client: I finish cleaning up the kitchen. It takes forever because I'm moving so slowly, trying not to make any noise. When I'm done, I peek into the living room. Jack's passed out on the couch, empty beer cans on the coffee table. I... I feel a mix of relief and dread. Relief that it's over for now, but dread knowing it's only a matter of time before it happens again.",
    "Therapist: What do you do then?",
    "Client: I... I go to our bedroom. I change into my nightgown, wincing as I see the red marks on my arm. I curl up on my side of the bed, as far from Jack's side as possible. I lie there, staring at the wall, listening to the muffled sound of the TV from the living room.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking as you lie there?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm wondering how I ended up here. How the man I married became this... this monster. I'm thinking about leaving, but I'm scared. Where would I go? What would I do? I feel so... trapped.",
    "Therapist: Those are heavy thoughts, Margaret. How's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 75. My chest still feels tight.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I must have fallen asleep at some point. I wake up in the middle of the night. The house is quiet. Jack's snoring next to me. I slip out of bed and go to the bathroom. In the harsh fluorescent light, I see my reflection. There's a small cut on my cheek where I must have hit the counter. My eyes look... dead. Empty. I barely recognize myself.",
    "Therapist: What do you feel looking at your reflection?",
    "Client: I feel... disgusted. Ashamed. But also... angry. For the first time, I feel a flicker of anger towards Jack, not just fear. I think... I think this might be the moment I started to realize I needed to get out.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization, Margaret. How does it feel to recognize that moment?",
    "Client: It's... it's bittersweet. I wish I'd acted on it sooner, but I'm proud that I eventually did. My chest feels a little lighter now, like I can breathe a bit easier.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 60. I'm still anxious, but I feel... I don't know, maybe a little empowered?",
    "Therapist: You should feel empowered. You've shown incredible strength. Let's start wrapping up. Take a few deep breaths and slowly open your eyes when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Deep breath, opens eyes) Wow... that was... intense.",
    "Therapist: You did extremely well, Margaret. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. Drained, but okay. It's still hard to talk about, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming as it used to.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Remember, you're safe now, and you've come so far. Is there anything you'd like to discuss before we end our session?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm good for now. Thank you for guiding me through that. It's not easy, but I know it's helping.",
    "Therapist: You're very welcome, Margaret. Your courage is admirable. We'll continue working through this in our next session. Take care of yourself this week.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. I'll see you next week."
