    "Therapist: Welcome, Amir. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember to share your SUDS ratings as we go. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the memory.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in the refugee camp. It's hot, dusty. I can smell sweat and unwashed bodies. There are so many people crammed into this small space. I feel... overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: Um, about a 5, I'd say.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: I see children crying, adults arguing. There's not enough food or water. I feel so helpless, like I can't do anything to improve our situation. My stomach is churning, and my heart is racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm remembering a specific day when tensions were high. There was a fight breaking out near our tent. I can hear the shouting, see people pushing each other. I... I feel scared, like I need to protect myself but I don't know how.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 7. My palms are sweaty, and I feel a tightness in my chest.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: I see myself huddling in the corner of the tent, trying to make myself invisible. I feel so alone, even though there are people everywhere. The neglect is palpable - no one seems to care about us, about our wellbeing. I'm... I'm struggling to breathe normally.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great. What's happening now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm remembering the constant hunger. The ache in my stomach, the dizziness. I see myself searching for scraps, anything to eat. It's... it's humiliating. I feel shame washing over me, even now.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. I feel nauseous, and my hands are shaking a little.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Keep going, you're doing well.",
    "Client: I... I remember the night when a group of men came into our section of the camp. They were angry, violent. I can hear the screams, the sound of things breaking. I'm frozen in fear, unable to move or help anyone. I feel so... so powerless.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My SUDS is at a 9. I'm... I'm really struggling. My heart is pounding, and I feel like I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Amir. Take a moment. Breathe slowly.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm trying. The memory is so vivid. I can still hear the chaos, smell the fear. But... but I'm also aware that I'm here, in this room with you.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's happening in the memory now?",
    "Client: The violence has passed. It's quiet, but a terrible quiet. I see people tending to the injured, others just staring blankly. I feel... I feel a deep sadness, a sense of loss. Not just for what happened that night, but for everything we've lost.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7 now. I still feel shaky, but the intense panic is subsiding.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Let's start to bring you back to the present.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm opening my eyes now. The room is coming back into focus. I feel... drained, but also a bit relieved. It's over.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My SUDS is down to a 4. I'm tired, but I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I faced something difficult and got through it.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent, Amir. You showed great courage today."
