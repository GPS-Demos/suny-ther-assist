    "Therapist: Welcome, Sandra. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is terrified of reliving that day. It's been so long since I've allowed myself to think about it in detail.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay, yes. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in my car. It's a crisp autumn morning, and I'm driving to work. The leaves are just starting to turn, and the sun is peeking through the trees. I remember thinking how beautiful it looked, almost like a painting. I can smell the coffee in my travel mug, and I'm listening to the news on the radio. Everything seems so... normal.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm approaching the intersection near the park. The light is green, so I'm not slowing down. Suddenly, I see movement out of the corner of my eye. It's... it's a truck. Oh God, it's not stopping. It's running the red light, and it's coming right at me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) I'm... I'm terrified. My heart is racing, and I can't breathe. I want to turn the wheel, to do something, but it's happening so fast. I can't... I can't move.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 7. Maybe an 8.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Inhales shakily) The truck hits me. There's this deafening crash, and I feel my car spinning. Glass is flying everywhere. I can smell rubber burning, and there's this horrible screeching sound. My body is being thrown around, and I can't control anything. I think I'm screaming, but I can't hear my own voice over the noise.",
    "Therapist: Stay in the moment. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The airbag deploys, and it feels like I've been punched in the face. My nose is bleeding, and I taste blood in my mouth. Everything's spinning, and I feel so disoriented. The car finally stops moving, but I'm upside down. I'm hanging from my seatbelt, and I can feel it cutting into my shoulder.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: (Voice shaking) Scared. So scared. I... I think I'm going to be sick.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Remember, you're here with me, in a safe place.",
    "Client: (Takes several deep breaths) Okay... okay. I'm... I'm still in the car. It's eerily quiet now. The radio is off, and all I can hear is this... this hissing sound. I smell gasoline, and I'm terrified the car might explode. I try to move, but my left arm won't respond. It hurts so much.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. This is so hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I hear sirens in the distance. They're getting closer. I want to call out for help, but my voice isn't working. I'm just hanging there, feeling helpless. I can hear people outside, shouting. Someone's asking if I'm okay, but I can't answer. I'm so scared they won't get to me in time.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. What happens next?",
    "Client: The firefighters arrive. They're talking to me, telling me they're going to get me out. I hear the sound of metal being cut. It's loud and jarring. They're working so quickly, but to me, it feels like it's taking forever. I just want to get out of the car.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm relieved they're here, but I'm still terrified. My whole body hurts, and I'm worried about permanent damage. What if I can't use my arm again? What if there's internal bleeding they can't see?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens as they work to free you?",
    "Client: They're being so careful, but every movement sends shocks of pain through my body. I can feel the car shifting as they work. Finally, they get me out. As they lift me onto the stretcher, I get my first real look at the scene. There's so much damage... twisted metal, broken glass everywhere. I see the other driver being treated. He looks... he looks okay, and I feel this surge of anger. How could he have been so careless?",
    "Therapist: That anger is valid. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're doing great. What happens in the ambulance?",
    "Client: They're asking me questions, checking my vitals. I'm having trouble focusing. The pain is intense, and I keep thinking about work, about my family. Who's going to tell them? What if I die before they know? The paramedic is so kind, holding my hand and reassuring me, but I can see the concern in his eyes.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. How does the hospital experience unfold?",
    "Client: It's a blur of tests and scans. Doctors and nurses are everywhere. I'm scared of the results, of what they might find. They tell me I have a broken arm, several cracked ribs, and a concussion. I'm relieved it's not worse, but I'm overwhelmed thinking about recovery, about how this will affect my life.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, reliving this?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. My heart is racing, and I feel a bit shaky. But... I also feel a sense of... I don't know, maybe accomplishment? For facing this.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's come down a bit. Maybe a 6 now.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's continue. What do you remember about the days following the accident?",
    "Client: The pain was constant. Every breath hurt because of my ribs. I couldn't sleep well, kept having nightmares about the crash. My daughter came to stay with me, which was a blessing, but I felt so guilty for disrupting her life. I was angry too - at the other driver, at myself for not somehow avoiding it. I kept replaying the moment in my head, thinking of what I could have done differently.",
    "Therapist: How did you cope with these feelings?",
    "Client: Not well, at first. I was irritable, snapping at my daughter even though she was just trying to help. I refused to get in a car, which made getting to doctor's appointments a nightmare. I felt so helpless, so dependent on others. It was hard to accept that I needed help.",
    "Therapist: That must have been challenging. What helped you start to move forward?",
    "Client: (Sighs) Time, I suppose. And therapy. Talking about it, even though it was hard. My daughter's patience was incredible. She never got upset, even when I was at my worst. Gradually, I started to accept what had happened. The physical therapy for my arm gave me something to focus on, a goal to work towards.",
    "Therapist: How did your perspective on the accident change over time?",
    "Client: I... I started to see it as a wake-up call, in a way. It made me realize how fragile life is, how quickly everything can change. I began to appreciate the small things more - being able to dress myself, to walk without pain. It changed my relationships too. I became closer to my daughter, more open with my feelings.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful shift. How do you feel about the accident now?",
    "Client: It's still hard. I still have moments of anger and fear. But... I also feel stronger. I survived something terrible, and I'm still here. I'm more cautious now, especially when driving, but I'm also more aware of the good things in my life. It's like... like the accident shook everything up, and when things settled, I saw my life differently.",
    "Therapist: That's incredible insight, Sandra. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 4, I think. I feel drained, but also... lighter, somehow.",
    "Therapist: You've done amazing work today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... good. Like I've faced something I've been avoiding for a long time. It wasn't easy, but I'm glad I did it.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end the session.",
    "Client: (Takes several deep breaths) Thank you. This... this helped more than I expected.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Sandra. Remember to be kind to yourself this week. We'll process more in our next session."

My daughter came to stay with me, which was a blessing, but I felt so guilty for disrupting her life. I was angry too - at the other driver, at myself for not somehow avoiding it. I kept replaying the moment in my head, thinking of what I could have done differently."
