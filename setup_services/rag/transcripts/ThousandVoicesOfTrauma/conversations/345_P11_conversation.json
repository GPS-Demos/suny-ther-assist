    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving that moment when my wife told me she wanted a divorce... it's bringing up a lot of emotions I thought I'd buried.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you about that experience?",
    "Client: The look in her eyes. I'd never seen her look at me that way before. It was like... like I was a stranger to her. And the way my chest tightened, like I couldn't breathe. I felt so... small. Insignificant. Just like when I was bullied as a kid.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was tough. Really tough. I felt that same helplessness, that same sense of rejection. But... I don't know, maybe it's different now. I'm still here, aren't I? I survived it once, I can survive it again.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How does this connect to your PTSD symptoms?",
    "Client: I guess... well, ever since the divorce, I've been avoiding anything that reminds me of my marriage. Photos, places we used to go, even certain songs. But going through this memory, it's like... maybe I don't need to run from it anymore?",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. How might this affect your recovery goals?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I can start facing some of those things I've been avoiding. It's still scary, but if I can sit here and talk about it without falling apart, maybe I can look at our old photo album or visit our favorite restaurant.",
    "Therapist: That's a great step forward. What else did you notice?",
    "Client: I realized that... well, the pain isn't as sharp as it used to be. Don't get me wrong, it still hurts, but it's not that raw, unbearable pain anymore. And I noticed that even when I felt those intense emotions during the exposure, they eventually started to fade. They didn't last forever.",
    "Therapist: That's a valuable observation. How does this make you feel about continuing therapy?",
    "Client: It's... encouraging, I suppose. I mean, it's not easy. There are moments when I want to just give up and hide away. But I can see that it's helping. I'm starting to understand myself better, and maybe... maybe I'm stronger than I thought.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Any strategies you want to try this week?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I'll try looking at one photo from our wedding album. Just one. And if it gets too much, I'll use those breathing exercises we practiced. And I'll remind myself that the pain won't last forever, like I noticed during the exposure.",
    "Therapist: Excellent plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... okay. Maybe even a little hopeful? It's strange. I came in dreading this session, but now I feel like I've accomplished something. Like I'm not just a victim of my past anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful shift. Anything else you want to share?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I guess. For listening, for guiding me through this. I know I'm not the easiest patient, especially with my depression on top of everything else. But I feel like I'm finally starting to see a way forward.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work. What's your takeaway from today?",
    "Client: That I'm resilient, I suppose. That I can face these painful memories and come out the other side. And that maybe, just maybe, there's still a future for me, even if it looks different from what I had planned.",
    "Therapist: That's a great note to end on. Well done today, Mr. Johnson."
