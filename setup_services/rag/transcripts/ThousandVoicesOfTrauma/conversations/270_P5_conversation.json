    "Therapist: Good morning, Mr. Johnson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Morning, doc. I'm... I'm alright, I suppose. Just a bit on edge, you know? These sessions always make me nervous, especially when I don't know what to expect.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. Are you familiar with it?",
    "Client: Not really. Sounds intimidating, to be honest. What exactly does that mean?",
    "Therapist: It's a technique to help process trauma. We'll revisit your experiences safely. Ready to learn more?",
    "Client: I guess so. But I'm not sure I want to revisit anything. It's all... it's all too much sometimes. Being forced to work like that, treated like I wasn't even human. I've spent years trying to forget.",
    "Therapist: Your hesitation is normal. How about we discuss the benefits first?",
    "Client: Alright, I'm listening. But I'm still not sure about this whole thing. At my age, is it even worth dredging up the past?",
    "Therapist: It can reduce PTSD symptoms at any age. Shall I explain how?",
    "Client: Yeah, go ahead. I mean, I've lived with this for so long, I can't imagine how talking about it now could help. But I trust you, doc. You've been good to me so far.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. It helps by processing memories in a safe environment. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about losing control. What if I can't handle it? What if I start drinking again? My wife, she's been so supportive, I don't want to disappoint her by relapsing.",
    "Therapist: Valid concerns. We'll go at your pace and have coping strategies ready. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's... that's reassuring. I appreciate that, doc. I've come too far to mess it up now. So, what exactly will we be doing? How does this imaginal exposure work?",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit a specific memory. You'll describe it in detail while I guide you. Ready to hear more?",
    "Client: In detail? I... I don't know if I can do that. Some of those memories, they're so vivid already. I'm afraid if I start talking about them, I won't be able to stop. It's like opening Pandora's box.",
    "Therapist: I understand your fear. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we discuss some grounding techniques first?",
    "Client: Yes, please. That would help. I need to know I have a way out if it gets too intense. You know, back when it was happening, I never had a way out. I felt so trapped, so helpless.",
    "Therapist: I'm sorry you experienced that. Let's practice a quick grounding exercise now. Are you willing?",
    "Client: Okay, I can try. Just... just promise me you won't let me get lost in those memories. Sometimes they feel so real, like I'm right back there again.",
    "Therapist: I promise to keep you grounded. Let's start with deep breathing. Follow my lead, okay?",
    "Client: Alright, I'm following. This... this actually feels good. It's been a while since I've felt this calm. Maybe this imaginal exposure thing won't be as bad as I thought.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad you're feeling calmer. Shall we set some goals for today's session?",
    "Client: Goals? I suppose... I suppose my goal would be to face these memories without falling apart. To talk about what happened without feeling like I'm back there. Is that a reasonable goal?",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent goal. How about we start with a less intense memory today?",
    "Client: Less intense... okay, I can work with that. There's so much to unpack, I'm not even sure where to begin. But I trust you, doc. You've helped me come this far. Let's give it a try.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your trust. Remember, we're in this together. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: Ready as I'll ever be, I suppose. Let's do this. Just... just don't let me get lost in there, okay?",
    "Therapist: I won't. You're safe here. Let's start by closing your eyes and taking a deep breath."
