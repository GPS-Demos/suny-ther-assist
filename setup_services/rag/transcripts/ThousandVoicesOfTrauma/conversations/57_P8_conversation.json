    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. The memory of that accident, seeing all that violence unfold... it's like I'm right back there again. My heart's still racing, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's hard to shake off the images.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What specific thoughts are coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: Well, I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. I mean, I was just standing there, watching it all happen. I couldn't do anything to stop it. And then there's this... this guilt, you know? Like maybe I should have done more, even though logically I know there wasn't anything I could've done. It's just... it's a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does your body feel as you're recalling these thoughts?",
    "Client: It's... it's tense. My shoulders are all bunched up, and I've got this knot in my stomach. I can feel my hands shaking a bit too. It's like my body's preparing for something bad to happen, even though I know I'm safe here. It's exhausting, really.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are you experiencing alongside these physical sensations?",
    "Client: Fear, definitely. There's a lot of fear. But also... anger, I think. Anger at the situation, at the people who caused it. And sadness too, a deep sadness for the victims. It's like this cocktail of emotions swirling around inside me, and I'm not sure how to handle it all.",
    "Therapist: Hmm. How do these emotions compare to what you felt during the actual event?",
    "Client: They're... they're similar, but different too. Back then, everything was so immediate, so intense. Now, it's like I'm reliving it, but there's this... this distance, I suppose. I'm more aware of my reactions now. During the actual event, I was just reacting, you know? Now, I can step back a bit and observe my feelings, even if I can't always control them.",
    "Therapist: I see. What's your most prominent memory from the event right now?",
    "Client: The sounds. God, the sounds. The screeching of tires, the shattering glass, people screaming... It's like they're echoing in my head. And the smell of burning rubber and... and blood. It's so vivid, like it's happening all over again. I can see the looks of terror on people's faces, the chaos all around. It's... it's almost too much to bear sometimes.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with these vivid memories when they surface?",
    "Client: I... I try to remind myself that it's over, that I'm safe now. Sometimes I'll take deep breaths or try to focus on something in the present moment, like the feeling of my feet on the ground. But honestly, sometimes I just want to run away from it all. It's hard not to let the memories consume me.",
    "Therapist: Mm. What do you think these memories mean about you and your experiences?",
    "Client: I guess... I guess they show how much this event has affected me. It's like it's become a part of who I am now. Sometimes I worry that I'll never be the same person I was before. But maybe... maybe they also show that I'm strong, you know? That I can face these memories and still keep going. It's just... it's a struggle sometimes to see it that way.",
    "Therapist: How has your perspective on the event changed since it happened?",
    "Client: That's... that's a tough one. I think initially, I was just in shock. I couldn't process it all. Now, I can see it more clearly, but that clarity brings its own challenges. I understand now that it wasn't my fault, that I couldn't have prevented it. But understanding that doesn't always make it easier to accept. I think I've also gained a deeper appreciation for life, for the fragility of it all. It's changed how I see the world, how I interact with people. Everything feels more... significant now, if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: I understand. How do you see these experiences shaping your future?",
    "Client: I... I'm not entirely sure. Part of me hopes that I can use this experience to help others somehow, to be more compassionate. But there's also this fear that it'll always hold me back, that I'll always be defined by this trauma. I want to believe that I can move forward, that I can find meaning in what happened. But it's a day-by-day process, you know? Some days I feel stronger, more optimistic. Other days, it feels like I'm right back there, trapped in that moment. I guess... I guess I'm hoping that with time and work, the good days will start to outnumber the bad ones.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. How are you feeling now, after discussing all of this?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired, honestly. Emotionally drained. But there's also this sense of... I don't know, relief maybe? Like I've let out some of the pressure that's been building up inside. It's still hard to talk about, and I know I've got a long way to go. But being able to put it into words, to share it with someone who understands... it helps. It makes me feel less alone in all of this. And even though it's exhausting, there's a small part of me that feels a bit lighter, like maybe there's hope for moving forward after all.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your openness. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to work more on coping strategies. You know, ways to handle these memories and emotions when they come up in daily life. And maybe... maybe we could talk about how to start rebuilding some of the connections I've lost since this happened. I've been isolating myself a lot, and I know that's not healthy. It's just... it's hard to let people in when you're carrying all of this. But I want to try. I want to find a way to live with this experience without letting it control me.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Is there anything else you'd like to add before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I suppose. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm making progress, even if it's slow. And I appreciate the safe space you've created here. It means a lot to have someone who can help me navigate all of this. I'm nervous about what's to come, but I'm also... I'm also hopeful. And that's not something I could have said a few months ago. So, yeah... thank you.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue this work next time. Take care."
