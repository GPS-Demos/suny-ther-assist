    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Singh. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, doctor. There's a heaviness in my chest. I've been dreading this all week, to be honest.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to help you process these memories safely. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Though part of me wants to run out that door.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. We'll go at your pace. Can you describe where you are in the memory?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in our old house. The one where it all happened. The air feels thick, like a storm is coming. I can hear my daughter playing in the next room, but my son... he's quiet. Too quiet.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see the living room. It's messy - toys scattered about, newspapers on the coffee table. My wife... she's by the window, looking out. Her shoulders are tense. I can tell something's wrong.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 6? My hands are starting to sweat.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear the car pull up. My son... he flinches. I remember thinking, \"Not again.\" But I... I didn't do anything. I just sat there, pretending to read the paper.",
    "Therapist: Stay in the moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Ashamed. Terrified. I want to protect them, but I'm... I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction to fear. Keep going.",
    "Client: The front door slams open. My son-in-law stumbles in. He's drunk again, I can smell it from across the room. He's shouting... something about dinner not being ready. My daughter comes running in, tries to calm him down.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe an 8? My heart's racing.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What do you see happening?",
    "Client: He... he grabs her arm. Twists it. She cries out. I stand up, finally, but I'm too slow. He pushes her, hard. She falls, hits her head on the coffee table. There's blood. So much blood.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you doing?",
    "Client: I'm yelling now. Telling him to stop. My wife is screaming, my grandson is crying. It's chaos. I try to get between them, but he's younger, stronger. He shoves me aside.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My... my chest is tight. I can hardly breathe. My fists are clenched. I feel... helpless. Useless.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here now. You're safe. Take a moment to ground yourself.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... okay. I'm here. But it feels so real.",
    "Therapist: I know. You're doing great. What happens next?",
    "Client: My wife... she's on the phone. Calling the police, I think. My son-in-law, he hears her. He turns, starts towards her. I... I grab him. Try to hold him back. We're struggling. I can hear my daughter sobbing, trying to get up.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. A 9, maybe? I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're here with me. You're safe. Can you feel the chair beneath you?",
    "Client: Yes... yes, I can. It helps a little.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going when you're ready.",
    "Client: There's a crash. He's knocked over a lamp. Glass everywhere. He's screaming at all of us now. Calling us names, threatening us. I'm trying to reason with him, but he's not listening. He's like a wild animal.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in that moment?",
    "Client: Rage. Pure rage. And fear. I want to hurt him, to make him stop. But I'm also terrified. What if he has a weapon? What if he kills one of us?",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to handle. How are you coping?",
    "Client: I... I'm not. Not really. I'm just reacting. Trying to keep him away from my family. But it feels like I'm failing. Every time I push him back, he comes at us again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the best you can in a terrible situation. What happens next?",
    "Client: Sirens. I hear sirens. Relief washes over me, but it's short-lived. He hears them too. He panics, starts looking for a way out. But the police are already at the door. They burst in, guns drawn.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as this is happening?",
    "Client: I'm shaking. Adrenaline coursing through me. I feel sick to my stomach. But there's also... relief. It's over. At least for now.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7? My heart's still racing, though.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're processing a lot. What do you see happening with the police?",
    "Client: They're restraining him. He's still shouting, threatening us. My daughter... she's being tended to by a paramedic. My wife is holding our grandson, trying to calm him. And I... I'm just standing there. Watching it all unfold like I'm outside my own body.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response to trauma. How do you feel about your actions now?",
    "Client: I... I feel like I should have done more. Stopped it sooner. Protected them better. But I also know... I know I did what I could. It just doesn't feel like enough.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those feelings. What happens as they take your son-in-law away?",
    "Client: He's still yelling as they put him in the car. Threats, promises to come back. I watch until they drive away. Then... then I finally break down. I'm crying, holding my family. We're all crying.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful moment. How does it feel to recall it now?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. I feel the same mix of relief and fear and shame. But there's also... I don't know, a sense of closure? Like we survived something terrible together.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's lower. Maybe a 5? I'm feeling drained, but... lighter somehow.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Emotionally wrung out. But also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I've faced this monster and survived again.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after processing trauma. You've shown great courage today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I never thought I'd be able to talk about this. It's always been this dark cloud hanging over me.",
    "Therapist: You've taken an important step. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's hard. Really hard. But I think... I think it's helping. I want to keep going.",
    "Therapist: That's great to hear. We'll continue at your pace. For now, let's work on grounding you before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Good. Take a deep breath and tell me five things you can see in this room.",
    "Client: I see... your desk. The painting on the wall. My hands. The tissue box. And the clock.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Now, four things you can touch.",
    "Client: The armrest of the chair. My wedding ring. The fabric of my shirt. The floor beneath my feet.",
    "Therapist: Good. Three things you can hear?",
    "Client: The ticking of the clock. Traffic outside. And... my own breathing.",
    "Therapist: Very good. Two things you can smell?",
    "Client: Coffee... and maybe some kind of air freshener?",
    "Therapist: Perfect. And finally, one thing you can taste?",
    "Client: The mint from the water you offered earlier.",
    "Therapist: Excellent job. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: More... present. Calmer. Still a bit shaky, but better.",
    "Therapist: That's great. Remember to use these grounding techniques when you feel overwhelmed. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we end?",
    "Client: No, I... I think I'm okay. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. You've done incredibly well today. Remember to be kind to yourself and use the coping strategies we've discussed. I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you, doctor. See you then."
