    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my heart is still racing, you know? I can feel this tightness in my chest, and my hands are a bit shaky. That memory of the dog attack... it just brings everything back so vividly.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep seeing those teeth, those sharp, angry teeth. And I hear the growling, it's so loud in my head. I'm thinking... God, why did this have to happen to me? Why couldn't I have been stronger or faster? Maybe if I had just stayed inside that day...",
    "Therapist: It sounds like you're experiencing some self-blame. Can you tell me more about that?",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess I am. It's just... I've always been the target, you know? First with the bullying in school, and now this. It's like I have a sign on my back that says \"victim.\" I feel so weak and helpless. And angry. I'm angry at myself for not being able to move past this.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's hot. Like there's this burning sensation in my stomach that's spreading outward. My jaw is clenched, and I want to... I don't know, hit something or scream. But at the same time, I feel frozen. Like I can't actually do anything about it.",
    "Therapist: What do you make of that contradiction?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe it's because I've always felt powerless? Like, even when I want to fight back, I can't. It's frustrating. It's like I'm trapped in my own body, my own mind.",
    "Therapist: How does this relate to your experiences with bullying?",
    "Client: Oh man, it's so similar. That same feeling of being cornered, of not being able to escape. Whether it's a group of kids or a vicious dog, the feeling is the same. I'm alone, I'm scared, and I can't do anything to protect myself.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in those moments?",
    "Client: I... I need someone to help me. To tell me it's going to be okay. To make me feel safe. But there's never anyone there. It's always just me, facing this... this monster, whether it's human or animal.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to express that need?",
    "Client: It's... uncomfortable. Like I'm admitting weakness. But also... I don't know, maybe a little relieving? Like maybe it's okay to need help sometimes. I've always tried to be so independent, you know? Especially living alone and going back to school at my age. But this... this makes me feel like a child again.",
    "Therapist: What would you say to that child version of yourself?",
    "Client: I... (long pause) I'd tell him it's not his fault. That he's brave for surviving, for keeping going even when it's hard. That he doesn't have to face everything alone. (voice breaking) God, why is this so hard to say?",
    "Therapist: It's okay. Take your time.",
    "Client: (deep breath) I guess... I've never really been kind to myself. It's always been about pushing through, being tough. But maybe... maybe I need to learn how to be there for myself too. To be the person I needed when I was younger, and even now.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... strange. But not in a bad way. It's like... a weight lifting, you know? Like maybe I don't have to carry all of this alone. Maybe I can be on my own side for once.",
    "Therapist: What might that look like in practice?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. Maybe... talking to myself the way I'd talk to a friend who's been through something similar? Being more patient with myself when I have bad days or when the memories come back? It's hard to imagine, but... I think I'd like to try.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive step. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... tired. Emotionally drained. But also... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful? Like maybe there's a way forward that doesn't involve just gritting my teeth and pushing through. It's scary, but... maybe it's worth trying.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on for the rest of our session?",
    "Client: Can we... can we talk more about this idea of self-compassion? I think I need to learn more about how to actually do that. It's so foreign to me, but I think it might be important.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Where would you like to start?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe with some practical steps? Like, what do I actually say to myself when I'm feeling scared or overwhelmed? How do I counteract that voice in my head that always blames me?",
