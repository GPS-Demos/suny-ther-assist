    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the workplace incident?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in the office. It's a regular Tuesday morning. I'm at my desk, working on a report. My supervisor, Mr. Johnson, approaches. He looks angry. I can feel my heart starting to race.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: He starts yelling about a mistake in the quarterly figures. His face is red, and he's leaning over my desk. I feel so small, so insignificant. It's like I'm a child again, being berated by my parents for not being good enough.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I can't breathe. My chest feels tight. I want to run away, but I'm frozen. Mr. Johnson is still yelling, pointing at the computer screen. I can smell his coffee breath. It's making me nauseous.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I try to explain, but my voice comes out as a whisper. He cuts me off, saying I'm incompetent and threatening to fire me. I feel tears welling up in my eyes. I'm so ashamed, so humiliated. Everyone in the office is staring.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I... I can't. It's too much. I feel like I'm back there again.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm trying. Mr. Johnson finally stops yelling and storms off. I'm left there, shaking. I can't focus on anything. The numbers on my screen are blurry through my tears. I feel so alone, so worthless.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. Scared. But also a little relieved. It's like I've been carrying this weight for so long, and now I'm finally putting it down.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You did well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was hard, but... I think it helped. Can we... can we stop for now?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm taking deep breaths. The office feels far away now. I'm here, in this room, and I'm safe. It's over.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How do you feel about today's session?",
    "Client: It was intense, but I feel... lighter somehow. Like I've faced something I've been avoiding for a long time. Thank you for guiding me through it.",
    "Therapist: You did the hard work. I'm proud of your progress.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I know we have more work to do, but I feel like I can handle it now. Is it normal to feel both exhausted and energized at the same time?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's a common reaction. What you're feeling is valid.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think I'm ready to end the session now. Same time next week?",
    "Therapist: Yes, I'll see you then. Take care of yourself."
