    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of drained. Going through that memory of my brother's death again, it's just... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you this time?",
    "Client: The silence. I remember the silence in the hospital room after they told us he was gone. It was deafening. And then my mom's wail... I can still hear it. It's like it's etched into my brain.",
    "Therapist: How did reliving that moment feel today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. I felt like I was right back there, you know? The antiseptic smell of the hospital, the cold plastic chairs. I could feel my hands shaking, just like they did that day. It's weird, but I also felt this... heaviness in my chest. Like I couldn't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: That sounds difficult. How does it compare to previous times?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a bit easier now. Don't get me wrong, it's still painful, but I don't feel as overwhelmed as I did in the beginning. It's like... I can separate myself from the memory a little bit more now.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. What do you think has changed?",
    "Client: I guess... I'm starting to accept that it happened? Before, it felt like if I thought about it, it would make it real. But now, I know it's real whether I think about it or not. And talking about it... it helps, somehow.",
    "Therapist: How does this relate to your PTSD symptoms?",
    "Client: Well, I've noticed I'm not having as many nightmares about that day. And when I do, they're not as intense. I used to wake up in a cold sweat, feeling like I was back in that hospital room. Now, it's more like... watching a sad movie? It still affects me, but I don't feel trapped in it anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. What else have you noticed?",
    "Client: I... I've been able to look at photos of my brother without breaking down. Last week, I even shared a funny story about him with my parents. It felt good to remember the happy times, you know? But... there's still this guilt...",
    "Therapist: Can you tell me more about that guilt?",
    "Client: It's like... why am I here and he's not? He had so much potential, so many dreams. And here I am, struggling with substance use and living with my parents at 28. Sometimes I feel like I'm wasting the life he could've had.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt impact you?",
    "Client: It... it holds me back, I think. Like, I feel guilty about trying to move forward with my life. And sometimes, it makes me want to use again. To numb everything out. But I'm trying to resist that urge.",
    "Therapist: That's a challenging struggle. What helps you resist?",
    "Client: Honestly? These sessions. And the thought of disappointing my parents again. They've been through so much already. I want to make them proud, to show them that at least one of their sons can make something of himself.",
    "Therapist: How does that motivation feel?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. On one hand, it pushes me to do better. On the other, it's a lot of pressure. But I'm trying to channel it into something positive. I've been looking into going back to school, maybe finishing my degree.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive step. How does it feel to consider that?",
    "Client: Scary, but... exciting too? It's like, for the first time in a long time, I'm thinking about the future instead of being stuck in the past. It's... it's a weird feeling, but a good one, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's a big shift. What do you think brought it about?",
    "Client: I think... facing these memories head-on has helped. It's like, the more I confront them, the less power they have over me. And talking about my brother... it makes me want to live the kind of life he would've wanted for me.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How can we build on this?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe we could work on strategies for when I feel that guilt creeping in? Or ways to honor my brother's memory that don't involve self-destructive behavior? I want to keep moving forward, but I don't want to forget him either.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent ideas. Shall we explore them next time?",
    "Client: Yeah, I'd like that. This session was tough, but... I feel lighter somehow. Like I've put down a weight I've been carrying for a long time. Thanks for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work. Is there anything else you want to discuss?",
    "Client: No, I think I'm good for now. Just... tired. But a good kind of tired, if that makes sense? Like I've accomplished something important.",
    "Therapist: That makes perfect sense. Take care of yourself this week.",
    "Client: I will. Thanks again. See you next time."
