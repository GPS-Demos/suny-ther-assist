    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart's still racing, and I feel like I can't catch my breath. The memory of that animal attack... it's so vivid. I can still hear the growling, you know? It's like I'm right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... anger? I'm angry that this happened to me. I was just doing my job, serving my country, and then this... this random attack. It's not fair. And now I'm stuck with this chronic pain as a constant reminder. I feel like I can't escape it.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's hot. Like a burning in my chest. My fists are clenched, and my jaw feels tight. I want to scream or punch something, but I also feel frozen. It's frustrating, you know? Being stuck between wanting to fight and feeling paralyzed.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why me?\" And then I feel guilty for even asking that because so many others had it worse. But I can't help it. I wonder if I could have done something differently. If I had been more alert, maybe I could have prevented the attack. And then I think about how this has affected my life now. I'm 23, living with roommates, struggling with an entry-level job. This isn't how I pictured my life would be.",
    "Therapist: How do those thoughts impact you?",
    "Client: They make me feel... small. Helpless. Like I'm still that scared soldier facing down a wild animal. But then there's this other part of me that's angry at myself for feeling this way. I should be stronger, right? I mean, I survived combat, for God's sake. Why can't I just get over this?",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Part of me wants comfort, but another part feels like I don't deserve it. I guess... I need to feel safe. To know that it's okay to feel this way. That I'm not weak for struggling with this. But it's hard, you know? Especially as a Middle Eastern woman. There's this expectation of strength and resilience. I feel like I'm letting everyone down.",
    "Therapist: How does sharing this make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of things. There's relief, definitely. Like a weight's been lifted. But there's also fear. Fear that you'll judge me, or think less of me. And shame. So much shame. I feel exposed, vulnerable. But also... maybe a little hopeful? Like maybe by talking about this, I can start to make sense of it all.",
    "Therapist: What's the hardest part about revisiting this memory?",
    "Client: The sensory details, I think. The smell of dust and blood. The feel of the hot sun on my skin. The sound of my own screams. It's like... it's like I'm right back there. And the pain... God, the pain. It's not just the memory of it, but it's like my body remembers too. My chronic pain flares up, and it's this awful reminder that I can never truly escape what happened.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel right now?",
    "Client: Tense. Really tense. My shoulders are up to my ears, and my back is killing me. I can feel a headache coming on too. It's like my whole body is bracing for another attack. And I'm so tired. Exhausted, really. Reliving this... it takes so much out of me. But at the same time, I feel restless. Like I need to move, to do something, but I don't know what.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on next?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to work on feeling safe again. Not just physically, but emotionally too. I want to be able to trust people, to form relationships. I'm 23, and I've never been in a real relationship. I'm scared to let anyone get close. And I want to feel like I have a future. Like this trauma and this pain don't define me. Is that... is that possible?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What small step could you take towards that?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I could try to open up more to my roommates? Nothing big, just... maybe share a meal together or something. And perhaps I could look into some pain management techniques? I've been avoiding dealing with the chronic pain, but maybe if I addressed it, I'd feel more in control. It's scary, but... I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that plan?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of scary and exciting. Part of me is terrified of change, of putting myself out there. But there's also this tiny spark of hope. Like maybe, just maybe, things could get better. And that feels... good. Really good. For the first time in a long time, I feel like I might have a chance at a normal life. Or at least, a life that isn't dominated by fear and pain.",
    "Therapist: What's giving you that hope?",
    "Client: I guess... it's the fact that I'm here, talking about this. Six months ago, I couldn't even think about the attack without having a panic attack. And now, even though it's hard, I'm able to talk about it. To process it. That's progress, right? And if I've made it this far, maybe I can keep going. Maybe I can reclaim the parts of myself that I thought I'd lost forever.",
    "Therapist: How would you like to end our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to take a moment to just breathe. To acknowledge how far I've come, but also how far I still have to go. And maybe... maybe to remind myself that it's okay to not be okay sometimes. That healing isn't linear, and that's alright. Is that... is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take that moment together.",
    "Client: (After a pause) Thank you. I... I feel a bit lighter now. Still scared, still in pain, but... maybe a little more hopeful too. Like maybe I can face whatever comes next. It won't be easy, but... I'm starting to believe that I'm strong enough to handle it. And that... that feels like a big step.",
    "Therapist: It is. You've done great work today. How about we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think I'm ready. This was... intense. But good. Really good. Thank you for... for creating a space where I can be honest about all of this. It means more than I can say."
