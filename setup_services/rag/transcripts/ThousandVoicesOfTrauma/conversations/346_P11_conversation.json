    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: (sighs deeply) It's... it's tough, you know? Reliving that moment when Sarah told me she wanted a divorce... it just brings back all those feelings of failure and abandonment. I can still see her face, the way she couldn't even look at me when she said it. It's like I'm right back there in our kitchen, feeling my whole world fall apart.",
    "Therapist: What stood out to you most about revisiting that memory?",
    "Client: (pauses) I guess... the overwhelming sense of powerlessness. I mean, here I was, just back from my third tour, thinking I was coming home to my rock, my constant. And instead, it's like the ground disappeared beneath my feet. I kept thinking, \"If I can't even keep my marriage together, what good am I?\" It's like all the chaos and violence I'd seen overseas suddenly invaded my home life too.",
    "Therapist: How did your body react during the exposure?",
    "Client: My heart was racing, palms got sweaty. I felt this tightness in my chest, like I couldn't breathe properly. It's funny, you know? Even though I know I'm safe here, my body still responds like I'm in danger.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. How does this connect to your daily experiences?",
    "Client: (exhales slowly) I guess... I'm always on edge, waiting for the next bad thing to happen. It's like I can't relax, can't trust that things will be okay. And my back pain... it seems to flare up more when I'm stressed about relationships or feeling vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: What did you learn about yourself through this exercise?",
    "Client: (thoughtful pause) I... I think I realized how much I've been avoiding anything that reminds me of that day. But going through it again, as painful as it was, made me see that I survived it. I'm still here, still fighting. Maybe I'm stronger than I give myself credit for.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. How might this affect your approach to challenges?",
    "Client: Well... maybe I don't need to be so afraid of facing difficult emotions or situations. If I could make it through that day, and relive it here... perhaps I can handle more than I thought. It's just... it's hard to believe in myself sometimes, you know?",
    "Therapist: Your progress is commendable. What's your takeaway from today's session?",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) I think... I need to stop running from these memories. They're part of me, but they don't define me. And maybe, just maybe, by facing them head-on, I can start to loosen their grip on my life. It's scary, but... I think it might be worth it.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about continuing with these exposures?",
    "Client: Honestly? Part of me wants to run for the hills. (chuckles nervously) But I know that's just fear talking. I've seen some progress, even if it's small. So yeah, I'm willing to keep going. It can't be worse than what I've already been through, right?",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is admirable. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: (sighs) Just... thank you, I guess. For guiding me through this. It's not easy, but... I feel like I'm finally starting to see a way forward. Even with all the pain and the PTSD symptoms, there's a glimmer of hope. And that's... that's something I haven't felt in a long time.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work. We'll continue next session.",
    "Client: (nods) Yeah, okay. I'll be here. It's tough, but... I'm starting to believe it might actually help. See you next time, doc."
