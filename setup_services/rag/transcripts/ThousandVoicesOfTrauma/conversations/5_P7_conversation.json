    "Therapist: Welcome, Jack. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... not great, to be honest. It's been a tough week. I've been thinking a lot about my uncle's passing.",
    "Therapist: I see. Are you ready to explore those feelings?",
    "Client: I guess so. It's just... it's still so raw, you know? I can't believe he's gone.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. We're here to work through this together.",
    "Client: Okay. Well, I remember the day I found out. I was in my dorm room, studying for finals. My phone rang, and it was my mom. Her voice was shaky, and I knew something was wrong. She told me Uncle Tom had a heart attack. He didn't make it. I... I couldn't breathe. It felt like the world stopped spinning.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: I dropped my phone. My hands were shaking so badly. I kept thinking it had to be a mistake. Uncle Tom was always so full of life, you know? He was the one who taught me how to fish, how to change a tire. He was like a second father to me.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I remember sinking to the floor, my back against the bed. I couldn't stop the tears. It was like a flood. I kept seeing his face, hearing his laugh. God, I miss his laugh. He always knew how to make everyone around him smile.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Jack. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I didn't know what to do. I wanted to go home right away, but I had exams. I felt so torn and guilty. Should I stay and finish my finals, or go be with my family? Uncle Tom would've wanted me to finish strong, but I felt like I was abandoning them.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel conflicted in such situations.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess. I ended up staying for two more days to finish my most important exams, then went home. When I got there, the house was so quiet. My aunt was just... sitting there, staring at nothing. My cousins were huddled together on the couch. It hit me then, you know? He was really gone.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. My chest feels tight. I can feel the lump in my throat, just like that day. I keep thinking about all the things he's going to miss. My graduation, my cousins' weddings. He was supposed to be there for all of that.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to acknowledge those feelings of loss.",
    "Client: I miss him so much. Sometimes I think I hear his voice, or I see someone who looks like him on the street, and for a split second, I forget he's gone. Then it all comes crashing back, and it's like losing him all over again.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. You're not alone in feeling this way.",
    "Client: I know, but it doesn't make it any easier. I keep wondering if there was something we could have done. If we had noticed something earlier, maybe we could have prevented it. I know it's not rational, but I can't help thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to have those thoughts. Remember, you're not responsible.",
    "Client: I know, logically. But emotionally... it's hard. I feel like I should have spent more time with him. I was so busy with school and my own life. I didn't visit as often as I should have. Now I'd give anything for just one more conversation with him.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Jack. These feelings are part of the grieving process.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess so. It's just... it's so final, you know? I keep expecting him to walk through the door, to call me and ask how I'm doing. But he never will again. And that's... that's really hard to accept.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to take your time with acceptance. You're processing well.",
    "Client: Thanks. I... I think I need a moment. This is more difficult than I thought it would be.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take all the time you need. You're doing great, Jack.",
    "Client: (After a pause) Okay, I think I'm ready to continue. You know, one of the hardest parts is seeing how it's affected the rest of the family. My aunt is trying to be strong, but I can see how much she's hurting. And my cousins... they're so young. It's not fair that they have to grow up without their dad.",
    "Therapist: You're showing a lot of empathy. How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Helpless, I guess. I want to do something, anything to make it better for them. But I know I can't bring him back. All I can do is be there, but sometimes it doesn't feel like enough.",
    "Therapist: Being there is important. You're doing what you can.",
    "Client: I hope so. I've been trying to step up, you know? Help out more around the house when I visit, spend time with my cousins. It's hard, though. Sometimes I feel like I'm intruding on their grief.",
    "Therapist: It's thoughtful of you to consider their feelings.",
    "Client: Yeah, I'm trying. It's just... it's all so complicated. Grief is messy, isn't it? Some days I feel okay, almost normal. Then something will remind me of him, and it's like a punch to the gut. I'm not sure when or if that will ever go away.",
    "Therapist: Grief is indeed complex. You're navigating it well.",
    "Client: I hope so. I just... I want to honor his memory, you know? Make him proud. But sometimes it feels like I'm failing at that too. Like I'm not doing enough, or I'm not handling it the right way.",
    "Therapist: There's no \"right way\" to grieve. You're doing your best.",
    "Client: I guess you're right. It's just hard to accept sometimes. I keep thinking about all the things I wanted to tell him, all the experiences I wanted to share with him. It's like there's this big hole in my life now, and I'm not sure how to fill it.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that emptiness. It's part of the process.",
    "Client: Yeah... I know. It's just... it's overwhelming sometimes. I miss him so much it physically hurts. And I know that pain isn't going to go away anytime soon. I'm trying to be patient with myself, but it's not easy.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great self-awareness, Jack. That's important.",
    "Client: Thanks. I... I think I need to stop for now. This has been really intense, and I'm feeling pretty drained.",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've done excellent work today, Jack. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Exhausted, honestly. But also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've let some of it out. Thank you for listening and guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Remember to be kind to yourself. We'll continue next time."
