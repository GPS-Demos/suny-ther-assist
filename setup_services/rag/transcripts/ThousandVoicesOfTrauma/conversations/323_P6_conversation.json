    "Therapist: Stay with that. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Scared. Really scared. My palms are sweaty, and I feel like I can't breathe properly.",

    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I should help her. Why can't I move? I'm a coward. I'm letting her down.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe now. Take a deep breath.",

    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue when you're ready.",
