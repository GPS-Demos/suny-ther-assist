    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. My heart is still racing a bit. It's like I was back there, you know? The sounds, the smells... it all felt so real again. I can still hear the choppers overhead and smell the dust in the air. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I think. No, not just fear... terror. Even though I know I'm safe here, my body is still reacting like I'm in danger. My palms are sweaty, and I feel this tightness in my chest. It's hard to shake off the feeling that something terrible is about to happen.",
    "Therapist: I see. Can you tell me more about that tightness in your chest?",
    "Client: It's like... like there's a weight pressing down on me. Making it hard to breathe deeply. I keep wanting to look over my shoulder, you know? Check for threats. I know it's irrational, but I can't help it. It's frustrating because I thought I was getting better at handling these memories, but now I feel like I'm back at square one.",
    "Therapist: How does that frustration feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a knot in my stomach. Tight and uncomfortable. I'm clenching my jaw too, I just noticed. I guess I'm angry at myself for still being affected by this after all these years. I should be over it by now, right? But here I am, a 50-year-old student, still haunted by things that happened decades ago. It makes me feel weak.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are coming up as you say that?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking about my squad. The ones who didn't make it back. I feel guilty for being here, for having the chance to study and live a normal life when they don't. And then I feel guilty for feeling guilty because I know that's not what they would have wanted for me. It's this endless cycle of thoughts that I can't seem to break free from.",
    "Therapist: How does carrying that guilt impact your daily life?",
    "Client: It's... it's exhausting. Some days, I struggle to focus on my studies because these memories and feelings keep intruding. I find myself isolating from my classmates because I feel like they couldn't possibly understand. And with my husband... I love him, but there's this distance sometimes. Like there's a part of me he can never truly know or reach. It makes me sad, you know? I want to be fully present in my life now, but it's like part of me is still stuck in that combat zone.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your body now as you share this?",
    "Client: I... I actually feel a bit lighter. My breathing is slower, and that tightness in my chest has eased a little. Talking about it... it helps, even though it's hard. It's like... like I'm not carrying the weight of these memories alone anymore. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it does. What else are you aware of in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm noticing the sunlight coming through the window. The warmth on my skin. It's grounding, somehow. Reminds me that I'm here, now, not back there. And I'm feeling... grateful, I guess. For the chance to work through this, even though it's painful. For the first time in a while, I'm feeling a glimmer of hope that maybe I can learn to live with these memories without them controlling me.",
    "Therapist: How does that hope feel?",
    "Client: It feels... fragile, but good. Like a small, warm light in my chest. It's not erasing the fear or the guilt, but it's... coexisting with them, I suppose. Making them feel a bit more manageable. I'm realizing that maybe it's okay to still struggle with this sometimes. That it doesn't make me weak or broken. It's just part of my journey.",
    "Therapist: What do you want to remember from this realization?",
    "Client: I want to remember that it's okay to have these feelings, that they're a normal response to an abnormal situation. And that sharing them, facing them head-on like this, it helps. It doesn't make the memories go away, but it makes them feel less overwhelming. I want to remember that I'm not alone in this, even when it feels like I am. And that there's strength in vulnerability, in allowing myself to process these experiences instead of trying to bury them.",
    "Therapist: How might you apply this insight going forward?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to be more open with my husband about what I'm going through. Maybe if I let him in a bit more, it could help bridge that distance I've been feeling. And with my studies, perhaps I could use some of the grounding techniques we've practiced when I feel memories intruding. Oh, and maybe... maybe I could reach out to some veteran support groups. I've always avoided them before, but now I'm thinking it might be helpful to connect with others who've had similar experiences.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but in a good way. Like after a hard workout. There's a sense of accomplishment mixed with the exhaustion. I'm still a bit shaky from the exposure exercise, but I also feel more... centered, I guess. Like I've taken a step forward in understanding and accepting my experiences. It's not easy, but I'm starting to believe that it's worth it.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to work more on strategies for managing flashbacks when they occur outside of our sessions. And maybe we could explore ways to communicate better with my husband about my PTSD. Is that something we could look into?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll address that next time. How will you take care of yourself for the rest of the day?",
    "Client: I think I'll take a walk in the park near my house. Being in nature always helps me feel more grounded. And then maybe I'll call my sister. She's always been a good listener, and I think talking to her might help me process some of what we've discussed today. Is there anything else you'd recommend?",
    "Therapist: Those sound like excellent self-care plans. Remember to be gentle with yourself.",
    "Client: Thank you. I will. This session was tough, but I'm glad we did it. I feel like I'm starting to see a path forward, even if it's still a bit hazy. Thank you for your guidance and support.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. I'll see you next week."
