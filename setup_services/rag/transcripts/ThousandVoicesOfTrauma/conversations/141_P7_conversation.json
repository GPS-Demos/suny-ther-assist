    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the event we've been working on?",
    "Client: Okay... It was a typical evening at home. I was in the kitchen, preparing dinner. My partner at the time came in, already angry about something from work. I could tell by the way he slammed the door. I tensed up immediately, knowing what might come next.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: He stormed into the kitchen, demanding to know why dinner wasn't ready yet. I tried to explain that I had just gotten home myself, but he wouldn't listen. He started yelling, calling me useless and lazy. I felt my heart racing, my hands shaking as I tried to continue chopping vegetables.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The sound of the knife hitting the cutting board seemed so loud. I remember the smell of onions I had just cut. My partner's face was red with anger, and I could see the vein in his forehead pulsing. I wanted to run, but I felt frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: Suddenly, he grabbed my arm, squeezing it so hard I dropped the knife. It clattered to the floor, and I remember thinking how the sound seemed to echo in the sudden silence. He pulled me close to his face, and I could smell alcohol on his breath. That's when I realized he must have been drinking before coming home.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I'm sorry, this is hard. (voice trembling) He started shaking me, screaming in my face about how worthless I was. I closed my eyes, trying to block it out, but I could feel his spit hitting my cheeks as he yelled. I wanted to disappear, to be anywhere but there.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (audible deep breath) Then he shoved me hard. I stumbled backwards and hit my hip on the counter. The pain was sharp, but I was more scared than hurt. I thought he might hit me next. I've never felt so small, so helpless. I wanted to fight back, to scream, to do something, but I just stood there, trembling.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: He grabbed a plate from the counter and threw it against the wall. The crash made me jump, and I could feel tears starting to run down my face. I hated crying in front of him, it always made things worse. He sneered at me, called me pathetic, and stormed out of the kitchen. I heard him grab his keys and leave the house. As soon as the door slammed, my legs gave out, and I sank to the floor, surrounded by broken ceramic and the half-prepared meal.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... shaky. My heart is racing, just like it did then. But I also feel angry. Angry at him for treating me that way, and angry at myself for not leaving sooner. It's strange to talk about it now, after all this time. I can still see it so clearly in my mind.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to have these feelings. You're processing it well.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think... I think I need a moment. This is more intense than I expected. Can we pause for a bit?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take a short break."
