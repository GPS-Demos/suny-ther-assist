    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. I can still feel my heart racing, and my hands are shaky. Going through that memory of being imprisoned after the abuse... it's like I was right back there, you know? The cold concrete, the smell of mold, the feeling of being trapped... it all came rushing back.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The silence. It was deafening. In that cell, all I could hear was my own breathing and occasional footsteps outside. It made me feel so... alone. And helpless. I kept thinking about what had happened, replaying the abuse in my mind, and feeling like I had no control over anything anymore.",
    "Therapist: How does that connect to your everyday life now?",
    "Client: I guess... I still struggle with feeling powerless sometimes. Especially in my business. I'm self-employed, but I often feel like I'm not in control, like I'm still trapped in a way. And the silence... I can't stand being alone in quiet spaces. I always need background noise or I start to panic.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful connection. How else has this affected you?",
    "Client: Well, it's affected my marriage too. My husband... he's supportive, but there are times when I flinch if he touches me unexpectedly. And intimacy... it's a struggle. I feel guilty, like I'm punishing him for something he didn't do. And then there's the anxiety. It's like a constant hum in the background, always there, reminding me of what happened.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great awareness. How did today's session feel different?",
    "Client: It was... hard, but different. I felt more present, if that makes sense? Like, I could acknowledge the memory without completely losing myself in it. There were moments when I could step back and say, \"This is a memory. I'm safe now.\" It didn't make it easy, but it felt... I don't know, maybe like progress?",
    "Therapist: That is progress. What do you think helped with that?",
    "Client: I think... the breathing exercises we've been practicing. And maybe just the repetition? This isn't the first time we've gone through this memory, and each time, it feels a little less overwhelming. Don't get me wrong, it's still awful, but... I don't feel as trapped by it anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's significant. How might you use this moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I can start applying that \"stepping back\" technique in my daily life? Like, when I start to feel anxious or trapped, I could try to remind myself that I'm safe now, that I have control. And maybe... maybe I could try to be more open with my husband about what I'm going through. It's hard, but I think it might help.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like valuable strategies. How are you feeling about continuing?",
    "Client: It's scary, but... I want to keep going. I want my life back, you know? I want to feel like me again, not this anxious, traumatized version of myself. It's hard work, and sometimes I wonder if it's worth it, but then I have moments like today where I can see a glimmer of hope. So yeah, I'm in. Let's keep going.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is admirable. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... maybe we could work more on those grounding techniques? For when I start to feel overwhelmed or anxious. And... I'd like to talk more about how to communicate with my husband. I want to let him in, but it's hard to find the words sometimes.",
    "Therapist: Those are great goals. Is there anything else you'd like to add?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I guess. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm not alone in this anymore. And that... that means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your strength is inspiring. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, definitely. Thank you again. See you next week."
