    "Therapist: Mrs. Lee, today we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: I'm not sure, to be honest. I've been dreading this part. The idea of reliving that terrible earthquake... it makes my heart race just thinking about it. Is it really necessary?",
    "Therapist: Your concern is understandable. Can you tell me more about your hesitation?",
    "Client: Well, I've spent years trying to forget what happened. The thought of purposely remembering it feels... wrong, somehow. Like I'm inviting those horrible memories back in. And what if I can't handle it? I'm not as young as I used to be.",
    "Therapist: I hear your concerns. How about we discuss the purpose behind this exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I need to understand why we're doing this if I'm going to go through with it.",
    "Therapist: Imaginal exposure helps process traumatic memories. It can reduce PTSD symptoms over time.",
    "Client: I see. But how does remembering something awful make it better? It seems counterintuitive.",
    "Therapist: By facing the memory in a safe environment, we can change how your brain processes it.",
    "Client: That makes some sense, I suppose. But what if I become overwhelmed? I'm worried about losing control.",
    "Therapist: I'll be here to support you throughout. We can pause or stop anytime you need.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I trust you, but I'm still nervous. What should I expect to feel during this?",
    "Therapist: You might experience strong emotions or physical reactions. This is normal and will pass.",
    "Client: I appreciate your honesty. I'm scared, but I want to get better. How long will this process take?",
    "Therapist: It varies for each person. We'll go at your pace and adjust as needed.",
    "Client: Okay. I think I'm ready to try. Can you tell me exactly what I need to do?",
    "Therapist: You'll describe the traumatic event in detail, in the present tense, as if it's happening now.",
    "Client: That sounds intense. Will you guide me through it or do I just... start talking?",
    "Therapist: I'll guide you with questions. Remember, you're safe here. Your courage is admirable.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot. I've carried this burden for so long... I hope this helps. Let's begin.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes, take a deep breath, and when you're ready, start describing that day."
