    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Ahmed?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a mix of emotions, really. Going through that memory of the cyber bullying incident was harder than I expected. I felt my heart racing, and my palms got sweaty. It's like I was right back there, reading those horrible messages and comments. But at the same time, I feel... I don't know, maybe a little relieved? Like I've finally faced it head-on.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The isolation, I think. Remembering how alone I felt, even though I was surrounded by people online. It's ironic, isn't it? Social media is supposed to connect us, but in that moment, I felt more disconnected than ever. I could almost feel the weight of all those eyes judging me, laughing at me. It brought back memories of my childhood, you know? The neglect... always feeling like I wasn't important enough for anyone to care.",
    "Therapist: How does that connection feel to you?",
    "Client: It's... eye-opening, actually. I never really thought about how my past experiences might be influencing how I react to things now. It's like the cyber bullying hit me so hard because it confirmed all these fears I've had since I was a kid. That I'm not worthy of love or attention, that I'm somehow fundamentally flawed. God, saying it out loud makes it sound so... ridiculous.",
    "Therapist: Yet it feels very real to you.",
    "Client: Yeah, it does. Or at least, it did. I'm starting to see how maybe those beliefs aren't as solid as I thought. Going through the memory again, I could see that the people bullying me were just... well, bullies. Their actions say more about them than about me. It doesn't make it hurt less, but it does make me feel less... I don't know, defined by it?",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. How might this change things for you?",
    "Client: I think... I think it might help me be less afraid of putting myself out there. I've been so scared of being attacked online again that I've basically withdrawn from all social media. But maybe I don't need to let those bullies have that power over me anymore. I'm not that helpless kid anymore, you know? I have friends, a good job... I'm more than what those trolls tried to make me believe I was.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a significant shift. What's that like?",
    "Client: It's... liberating, I guess? But also a little scary. It's like I've been hiding behind this wall for so long, and now I'm considering stepping out from behind it. What if I get hurt again? But then again, what if I don't? What if I actually connect with people who appreciate me for who I am? I've been so focused on avoiding pain that I've also been avoiding any chance of joy or real connection.",
    "Therapist: How might you move forward with this new perspective?",
    "Client: I think... I think I might try reconnecting with some old friends online. Nothing too big, maybe just send a message or two. And I've been thinking about starting a blog about my work in tech. I've always been passionate about it, but I've been too scared to put myself out there. Maybe it's time to take that leap. Baby steps, though. I don't want to overwhelm myself.",
    "Therapist: That sounds thoughtful. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... good. Like I've climbed a mountain and can finally see the view. It's beautiful, but I know I've still got a long way to go. But for the first time in a while, I'm actually looking forward to the journey. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know it's not easy, but I feel like I'm finally making progress.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work, Ahmed. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. I've got a lot to process, but I'm feeling... hopeful. Is that weird? After going through such a difficult memory, I didn't expect to feel hopeful.",
    "Therapist: Not weird at all. It's a positive sign. See you next week?",
    "Client: Definitely. Thanks again, Doctor. See you next week."
