    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is buzzing, you know? My heart's still racing a bit. That memory of the car accident... it felt so real again. I could almost smell the gasoline and hear the screeching tires. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Mhm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt in that moment. How I couldn't do anything to stop it. And then... I don't know, there's this guilt. Like, why did I survive when others didn't? It doesn't make sense. And then I start wondering if I could have done something differently, you know? Maybe if I had left work earlier or taken a different route...",
    "Therapist: I see. How does your body feel as you share these thoughts?",
    "Client: Tense. Really tense. My shoulders are all bunched up, and there's this knot in my stomach. It's like my body is still bracing for impact, even though I know I'm safe here. And my hands... they're kind of shaky. I guess I'm still pretty worked up from reliving it all.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are you experiencing?",
    "Client: Fear, definitely. A lot of fear. But also... anger? Yeah, I'm angry. Angry at the other driver, angry at myself, angry at the whole situation. And there's this deep sadness too. It's like a heavy weight on my chest. I think about the lives that were lost, the families affected. It's just... it's a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to right after the accident?",
    "Client: They're... they're similar, but different too. Back then, everything was so raw and intense. I was in shock, I think. Now, it's like... the edges are a bit softer? But the core feelings are still there. The fear, the guilt, the anger. They've kind of become a part of me, you know? But reliving it in here... it brings it all back to the surface.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about how you're coping now versus then?",
    "Client: Well, I guess I'm able to talk about it more now. Right after it happened, I just shut down. Couldn't speak about it at all. And now, even though it's hard, I can put words to what I'm feeling. I'm also more aware of my body's reactions. Back then, I was just numb. Now I can feel the tension, the anxiety. It's uncomfortable, but... I don't know, maybe it's progress?",
    "Therapist: How does sharing this make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. Really hard. But there's also this tiny sense of relief? Like, I've been carrying this alone for so long, and now I'm letting someone else see it. It's scary, but also... I don't know, maybe a little freeing? And talking about it, putting it into words... it's like I'm starting to make sense of it all. Slowly, very slowly, but still.",
    "Therapist: What do you think this means for your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to believe that this means I'm getting better, that I'm healing. But another part of me is terrified that I'll never fully recover, that I'll always carry this weight. I guess... maybe it means I'm at least facing it now? Instead of running away or trying to numb it out. It's painful, but maybe that pain is necessary for healing? I don't know. It's all so confusing.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel now compared to when we started?",
    "Client: It's... it's different. Still tense, but not as much. My heart's not racing as fast. I feel kind of drained, actually. Like I've run a marathon or something. But there's also this weird sense of... I don't know, maybe release? Like some of the pressure has been let out. My hands aren't shaking anymore, which is good. I just feel... heavy. Tired. But maybe a little less wound up?",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm thinking about how hard this was, but also... maybe how necessary? I'm scared of doing it again, but there's a small part of me that sees the value in it. I'm wondering what this means for my day-to-day life. Will I be more on edge? Or will this help me process things better? I'm also thinking about my chronic pain... it seems to flare up when we do these exercises. I'm worried about that, but also curious if working through this trauma might help with the pain in the long run. It's a lot to think about.",
    "Therapist: How would you like to care for yourself after this session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need some quiet time. Maybe go for a walk in the park near my place. Just be in nature for a bit, you know? And then probably call my partner. I know they're worried about how these sessions affect me. Maybe take a hot bath to help with the tension and pain. And... I don't know, maybe write a bit in my journal? Get some of these thoughts out of my head and onto paper. Yeah, that sounds good.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful plan. How are you feeling about our next session?",
    "Client: Honestly? I'm nervous. This was really intense, and part of me wants to avoid doing it again. But I also see that it might be helping, even if it's hard to feel that in the moment. I guess I'm... cautiously willing to continue? But also scared. It's a mix of hope and fear, I suppose. I just hope it gets easier with time.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. We'll end here for today.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you. This was tough, but... I appreciate your guidance through it. I'll see you next week, I guess. Take care.",
    "Therapist: You too. Take care."
