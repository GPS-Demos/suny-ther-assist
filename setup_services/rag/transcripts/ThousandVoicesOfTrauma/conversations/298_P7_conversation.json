    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the combat situation you mentioned last time?",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. It was a hot day in Vietnam. The air was thick with humidity, and the jungle seemed to close in around us. We were on patrol, moving slowly through the dense vegetation. I remember the weight of my rifle, the sweat trickling down my back...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there was a crack of gunfire. It came from nowhere and everywhere at once. I dropped to the ground, my heart pounding in my chest. The sound was deafening, and I could smell the acrid scent of gunpowder...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I see my squadmate, Rodriguez, to my left. He's yelling something, but I can't hear him over the gunfire. His face is contorted with fear and determination. I want to reach out to him, but I'm frozen in place...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The bullets are whizzing past us, tearing through leaves and branches. I can feel the earth vibrating beneath me with each explosion. I'm terrified, but training kicks in. I start returning fire, my hands shaking as I aim...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I see someone fall. It's Johnson. He's hit. There's blood... so much blood. I want to help him, but I can't move. I'm paralyzed with fear. I feel so helpless, so guilty...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) The firefight seems to last forever. I can hear screams, both from our side and theirs. The smell of blood mixes with the jungle air. I'm shaking uncontrollably, praying for it to end...",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Eventually, the gunfire dies down. There's an eerie silence, broken only by groans and distant bird calls. I slowly raise my head, surveying the carnage around me. My friends... some of them aren't moving. I feel sick to my stomach...",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel that way. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (crying softly) I start checking on my squad. Some are okay, others are wounded. Johnson... he didn't make it. I keep thinking, 'Why him and not me?' The guilt is overwhelming. I can still see his face, hear his last words...",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. Sad. Angry. It's like I'm back there, but I know I'm here with you. It's confusing and exhausting. My hands are shaking, just like they did that day...",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're processing difficult memories.",
    "Client: I remember the aftermath. The silence was deafening. We had to call for evacuation, tend to the wounded. The jungle that once seemed so alive now felt dead and oppressive. I couldn't stop looking at Johnson's body...",
    "Therapist: You're very courageous. How do you feel as you recall these details?",
    "Client: I feel a mix of emotions. Sadness for the lives lost, anger at the senselessness of it all, and a deep, lingering guilt. Why did I survive when others didn't? I keep replaying the moment, wondering if I could have done something differently...",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those thoughts. You're doing well in expressing them.",
    "Client: (sighing) The memory of that day has haunted me for years. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night, thinking I'm back there. The sounds, the smells, they're all so vivid. It's like time hasn't passed at all...",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. Emotionally drained. But there's also a small sense of relief, like I've shared a burden I've been carrying alone for so long. It's still painful, but maybe a little less sharp than before...",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. You've done excellent work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this. It's always been locked away, too painful to touch. But being here, describing it... it's hard, but I feel like I'm finally facing it instead of running away.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable courage. How would you like to end our session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to sit quietly for a moment, if that's okay. Just to gather myself before I leave. This has been intense, but I'm glad I did it. I feel like I've taken a step towards healing, even if it's a small one.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take all the time you need. You've done great work today."
