    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Can you describe the cult experience you mentioned?",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. It was about 15 years ago. I had just lost my wife, and I was feeling lost. That's when I met them. They promised enlightenment, purpose... I was vulnerable. The compound was isolated, deep in the woods. At first, it seemed peaceful, but things changed quickly.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: The leader, he... he had this charisma that drew people in. But behind closed doors, he was a monster. He'd single out members, especially the younger ones. I... I saw things. Terrible things. But I felt powerless to stop it.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) There was this girl, couldn't have been more than 16. The leader took a \"special interest\" in her. One night, I heard her screaming... I... I should have done something, but I was afraid. I just lay there, frozen, listening to her cries...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel upset. You're handling this bravely.",
    "Client: (taking a deep breath) The guilt... it's overwhelming. I was an adult. I should have protected her, protected all of them. But I was weak. I let it happen.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're not there now. Stay present.",
    "Client: Right, right... (pauses) The worst part is, even after that night, I stayed. For months. I convinced myself it was a one-time thing, that maybe I had misunderstood. But deep down, I knew. I saw the fear in that girl's eyes every day after.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: Eventually, I couldn't take it anymore. The lies, the abuse, the manipulation. I planned my escape for weeks. One night, I just... ran. I left everything behind. But I couldn't shake the guilt. I should have done more, should have helped others escape too.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. You're processing it now.",
    "Client: (voice breaking) Sometimes, I still have nightmares about it. I see their faces, hear their voices. The leader's laugh... it haunts me. And that girl... I wonder what happened to her. Did she ever escape? Is she okay? I'll never know, and that kills me.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: (taking a few deep breaths) It's hard to talk about this. For years, I've tried to bury it. But it's always there, just below the surface. I feel like I lost a part of myself in that place. My trust in people, my faith in humanity... it's never been the same.",
    "Therapist: You're reclaiming your story. That takes courage.",
    "Client: I guess so... It's just... I've never told anyone the full story before. Not even my family knows the extent of what happened. I'm afraid of how they'd look at me if they knew. Would they see me as a victim? A coward? Both?",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you... I think I need a moment. This is... it's a lot.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take your time. You've done well today.",
    "Client: (after a pause) I want to heal from this. I want to stop letting it control my life. But it's hard. Every time I think I'm making progress, something triggers a memory, and I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Healing isn't linear.",
    "Client: I know... I just wish it was easier. Sometimes I feel like I'll never fully move past it. Like I'll always be that person who was too weak to stand up to evil.",
    "Therapist: You're not weak. You're here, facing it.",
    "Client: I suppose you're right. It's just... it's been such a long journey. And sometimes, I wonder if I'll ever reach the end of it.",
    "Therapist: Each step matters. You're making progress.",
    "Client: Thank you for listening. For not judging. It means more than you know.",
    "Therapist: That's what I'm here for. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. This session... it was difficult, but I feel like a weight has been lifted. Like maybe, just maybe, I can start to forgive myself.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. We'll continue next time.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'll see you next week."
