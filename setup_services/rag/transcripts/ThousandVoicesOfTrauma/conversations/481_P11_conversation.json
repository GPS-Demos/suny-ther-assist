    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart is still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. Going through that memory of the animal attack brought up so many emotions I wasn't expecting.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you?",
    "Client: The intensity of the fear, I guess. I could almost feel the dog's breath on my skin again, hear its growling. It's like I was right back there in that moment, you know? And I kept thinking about how helpless I felt, both during the attack and... and during the abuse. It's like my body just freezes up in these situations.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was tough, really tough. But... also different from when I usually think about it. Like, I could see it more clearly? Does that make sense? Usually, when I remember it, everything's kind of blurry and chaotic. But this time, I could see details I'd forgotten. The color of the dog's collar, the sound of a car passing by right before it happened. It's weird how those little things stick with you.",
    "Therapist: That's insightful. How does this connect to your everyday life?",
    "Client: I think... well, I've been avoiding dogs for so long. Even small ones. And I realize now it's not just about the dogs themselves, it's about feeling out of control. Like in both situations - the attack and the abuse - I felt completely powerless. And I guess I've been trying to control everything in my life to avoid feeling that way again. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What else?",
    "Client: I've also noticed how it affects my relationships. I'm always on edge, waiting for something bad to happen. It's hard to trust people or feel safe, even with my girlfriend. And I feel guilty about that, you know? She doesn't deserve my constant anxiety and suspicion.",
    "Therapist: How do you think this process might help with that?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe by facing these memories head-on, I can start to see them for what they are - just memories. They can't hurt me now. And maybe if I can learn to feel safe when thinking about the past, I can start to feel safer in the present too. It's just... it's really hard.",
    "Therapist: It is hard. How are you coping?",
    "Client: Some days are better than others. The breathing exercises you taught me help a lot, especially when I'm feeling overwhelmed. And talking about it here... it's scary, but it also feels like I'm finally confronting these things instead of running from them. I just wish progress was faster, you know?",
    "Therapist: Progress takes time. What's one thing you're proud of?",
    "Client: I guess... I'm proud that I showed up today. That I went through with the exposure even though every part of me wanted to avoid it. And I'm proud that I'm starting to understand myself better. It's like I'm finally connecting the dots between my past experiences and how I react to things now.",
    "Therapist: That's significant. How do you want to move forward?",
    "Client: I want to keep pushing myself. Maybe... maybe try some in vivo exposures soon? Like, visiting a dog park or something. I know it'll be scary, but I think I'm ready to start reclaiming some of the things I've been avoiding. And I want to work on being more open with my girlfriend about what I'm going through. She's been so supportive, and I think letting her in more might help both of us.",
    "Therapist: Excellent goals. Anything else you want to discuss?",
    "Client: I... I don't think so. I'm feeling pretty drained right now, to be honest. But also... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful? Like, today was hard, but I got through it. And maybe that means I can get through other hard things too. Is that... is that normal to feel?",
    "Therapist: It's very normal. How about we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know I still have a long way to go, but I feel like I'm finally moving in the right direction. It's scary, but... I think it's worth it."
