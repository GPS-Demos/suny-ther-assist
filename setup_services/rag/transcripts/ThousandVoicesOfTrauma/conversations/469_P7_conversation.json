    "Therapist: Welcome back. Are you ready to continue our exposure work today?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay. I'll try my best. Should I start describing the car accident again?",
    "Therapist: Yes, whenever you're ready.",
    "Client: Alright. I was driving home from the grocery store. It was a cloudy day, and the roads were a bit wet. I remember gripping the steering wheel tightly, feeling anxious about the slippery conditions. As I approached the intersection, the light turned yellow. I thought I could make it, so I sped up a little...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: Suddenly, I saw a car coming from the right. They must not have seen the red light. I tried to brake, but it was too late. I felt this intense panic, like time slowed down. The screeching of tires was deafening. Then came the impact. It was so loud, like an explosion. My body jerked forward, and I felt this sharp pain in my chest from the seatbelt...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I can feel my heart racing just thinking about it. The airbag deployed, and there was this acrid smell. I couldn't breathe properly. Everything was hazy, and I could taste blood in my mouth. I was so disoriented, and all I could think was, \"Am I going to die?\"",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to talk about. I remember hearing people shouting outside the car, but it sounded muffled, like I was underwater. I tried to move, but my body felt so heavy. The pain was getting worse, especially in my left arm. I started to panic, thinking I might be trapped...",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: I closed my eyes, trying to calm down. When I opened them again, I saw a firefighter at my window. He was talking to me, but I couldn't understand what he was saying. They had to use the jaws of life to get me out. The sound of metal being torn apart was terrifying. I thought the car might explode at any moment...",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job describing this. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm feeling shaky and a bit nauseous. My palms are sweaty, and I can feel my heart pounding. It's like I'm reliving it all over again.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember, you're safe now.",
    "Client: Right, I'm safe. It's just a memory. After they got me out, I remember being placed on a stretcher. The brightness of the sky hurt my eyes. I could hear the sirens of more emergency vehicles arriving. As they were loading me into the ambulance, I caught a glimpse of the other driver. They looked so young and terrified. I felt a mix of anger and pity...",
    "Therapist: You're handling these intense emotions well.",
    "Client: In the ambulance, everything became a blur. The paramedics were asking me questions, but I was struggling to focus. I kept thinking about my family, wondering if anyone had contacted them. The pain was getting worse, and I started to feel really cold. I remember one of the paramedics holding my hand and telling me to stay awake...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a deep breath if you need to.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm trying to stay calm. When we arrived at the hospital, there was so much activity. Doctors and nurses everywhere, bright lights, and the constant beeping of machines. I was wheeled into the emergency room, and they started cutting off my clothes. I felt so exposed and vulnerable. They were poking and prodding, asking me questions, but all I wanted was for the pain to stop...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I know, but it's still so vivid. The worst part was waiting for the test results, not knowing how badly I was hurt. Every time a doctor came near, I felt this surge of fear. Would they tell me I'd never walk again? Or that I had some internal injury they couldn't fix? The uncertainty was almost worse than the pain...",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling drained, but also a bit relieved. Talking about it is hard, but I think it's helping. The memories don't seem quite as overwhelming as they used to be.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. You should be proud.",
    "Client: Thank you. I am proud, actually. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It's still difficult, but I feel like I'm regaining some control over these memories.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Let's end here."
