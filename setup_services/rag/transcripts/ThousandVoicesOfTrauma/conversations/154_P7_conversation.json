    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit anxious, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about the bullying and my divorce, and it's making me nervous.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate that. It's just... thinking about those times brings back so many painful memories.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Can you tell me about a specific incident?",
    "Client: Well, there was this time in high school... I was walking to class, and suddenly I felt something hit my back. It was a crumpled paper ball. I turned around, and there was this group of girls laughing at me. They had been tormenting me for weeks, but this time it felt different. More public, more humiliating.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that memory. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I can still hear their laughter. It was so cruel. I felt my face getting hot, and tears were welling up in my eyes. I wanted to disappear. I remember thinking, \"Why me? What did I do to deserve this?\" The worst part was, a teacher saw it happen and did nothing. Just walked by like it was normal.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I ran to the bathroom and locked myself in a stall. I cried silently, trying not to make any noise. I was so afraid they'd follow me in there. I stayed there for what felt like hours, missing my next class. When I finally came out, my eyes were red and puffy. I felt so alone, so worthless.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're handling this bravely.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to talk about. You know, that feeling of worthlessness... it followed me into my marriage. When my ex-husband started becoming distant, those old feelings resurfaced. I started thinking maybe I deserved to be treated poorly, that I wasn't good enough for anyone to truly love me.",
    "Therapist: You didn't deserve that treatment. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The day he asked for a divorce, it was like being back in that high school hallway. The same feeling of humiliation, of being discarded. I remember sitting on our bed, staring at the wall, feeling numb. He was talking, explaining why he wanted out, but all I could hear was those girls laughing at me. It's like my past and present collided in this awful moment.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Keep going.",
    "Client: I didn't fight it. I just nodded and agreed to everything. Inside, I was screaming, begging him not to leave me. But outwardly, I was calm. It was like I was watching myself from outside my body. I kept thinking, \"This is what you get. This is what you deserve.\" It's taken me years to realize that's not true, but sometimes I still struggle with those thoughts.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to struggle. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I know, logically, that I didn't deserve the bullying or the divorce. But emotionally, it's hard to shake that feeling. Sometimes, when I'm having a bad day at work or an argument with my current partner, those old insecurities come flooding back. It's like I'm constantly fighting against this voice in my head that tells me I'm not good enough.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great confronting these feelings.",
    "Client: Thank you. It helps to talk about it, even though it's painful. I want to move past this, to fully believe that I am worthy of love and respect. But it's a daily struggle. Some days are better than others. Today, talking about it... it's bringing up a lot of those old feelings. But I'm also feeling a glimmer of hope. Like maybe by facing this head-on, I can finally start to heal.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive perspective. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling drained, but also a bit lighter. It's like I've been carrying these memories around for so long, and sharing them is helping to lessen the burden. I'm realizing that while these experiences shaped me, they don't define me. I'm more than what happened to me in high school or in my marriage. It's a strange mix of exhaustion and relief.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. We'll continue next session.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your support and guidance through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm making progress. I'm looking forward to our next session, even though I know it might be difficult. Is there anything specific I should focus on or think about before we meet again?",
    "Therapist: Just continue to be gentle with yourself. We'll pick up here next time.",
    "Client: Okay, I'll try to do that. It's not always easy, but I'm working on it. Thank you again for today's session. It means a lot to have someone listen without judgment and help me work through these painful memories. I'll see you next week.",
    "Therapist: Take care, Sarah. See you next week."
