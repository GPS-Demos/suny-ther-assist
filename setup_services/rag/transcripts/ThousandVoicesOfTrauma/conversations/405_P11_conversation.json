    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Maria?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like I'm right back there, you know? Reliving those moments when I'd open my computer and see all those horrible messages. My heart's still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The overwhelming sense of isolation. It's like... even though I was at home, I felt so exposed and vulnerable. Every ping from my computer made me flinch. I kept thinking, \"What now? Who else is going to join in on tormenting me?\" It's funny how a device meant to connect us can make you feel so alone.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. But different from when it actually happened. Back then, I felt paralyzed. Today, even though it was painful, I felt like I could breathe through it. Does that make sense? It's like... I'm starting to see it from a distance, if that makes any sense.",
    "Therapist: That's a great observation. How do you think this relates to your recovery?",
    "Client: Well, I guess it shows I'm making progress? I mean, before, I couldn't even think about those times without having a panic attack. Now, it still hurts, but I can talk about it. It's like... I'm reclaiming some power over the memory.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent insight, Maria. How else has this affected you?",
    "Client: I've noticed I'm less jumpy when I use my computer now. I still get anxious, but I'm not avoiding it completely like before. And I've been thinking... maybe I could start looking for work again. The idea still scares me, but it doesn't feel impossible anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. What's helping you feel more capable?",
    "Client: I think... it's realizing that what happened wasn't my fault. And that those people don't have power over me anymore. It's like, by facing the memory, I'm proving to myself that I can handle it. It's tough, but... I feel stronger after each session.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of your hard work. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I want to keep pushing forward. Maybe... maybe I could try reconnecting with some old friends online? Baby steps, you know? And I've been thinking about volunteering at the local community center. Being around people in a safe environment might help me feel less isolated.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like great goals. How can we support that in our sessions?",
    "Client: Could we... maybe practice some scenarios? Like, how to respond if I encounter negativity online again? I want to feel prepared, not paranoid. And maybe we could work on building my self-esteem? I still struggle with feeling worthy sometimes.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll incorporate that. Any final thoughts today?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. This isn't easy, but I feel like I'm finally moving forward instead of being stuck. It's like I'm starting to see a future for myself again, you know? It's scary, but also... kind of exciting.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work, Maria. See you next week."
