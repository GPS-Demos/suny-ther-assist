    "Therapist: Alright, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Can you close your eyes and bring to mind the memory of the natural disaster? What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Okay, I'm closing my eyes. Um, I can see the cyclone approaching. The sky is so dark, and the wind is picking up. I'd say my SUDS is about a 4 right now.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: The trees are swaying violently, and I can hear the roar of the wind. It's getting louder and louder. I'm starting to feel really anxious. My heart is racing, and my palms are getting sweaty. I remember thinking, \"This is it. We're not going to survive this.\"",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. The memory is becoming more vivid. I can almost feel the pressure in my ears from the storm.",
    "Therapist: Keep going. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The roof is starting to lift. I can hear it creaking and groaning. Debris is flying everywhere. I'm huddled in the bathroom with my ex-wife and our dog. We're holding onto each other so tightly. I'm terrified, but I'm trying to stay strong for them. My whole body is shaking.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's an 8. This is really intense. I can feel my chest tightening, just like it did then.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The sound is deafening now. It's like a freight train is running through our house. Water is starting to seep in under the door. I'm thinking about all the things we might lose, our home, our memories. But mostly, I'm just praying we'll make it out alive. My ex-wife is crying, and I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now? What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's still an 8. My heart is pounding so hard. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep breathing. What happens next?",
    "Client: The storm seems to last forever. But eventually, the wind starts to die down. We're too scared to move at first. When we finally open the bathroom door, it's like stepping into a war zone. Our home is destroyed. Water everywhere, furniture scattered. It's devastating.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone down to a 6. The immediate danger is over, but the shock is setting in.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How does your body feel?",
    "Client: I feel drained. My muscles are so tense. There's this knot in my stomach as I look at all the destruction.",
    "Therapist: Keep going. You're almost there.",
    "Client: We step outside, and it's eerily quiet. Our neighbors start emerging from their homes. Everyone looks shell-shocked. There's debris everywhere, trees uprooted. It's like our whole world has been turned upside down. I remember feeling so lost, not knowing where to even begin.",

    "Therapist: You did very well. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves."
