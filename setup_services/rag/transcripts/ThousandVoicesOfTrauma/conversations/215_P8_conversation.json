    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my whole body is shaking on the inside, but I'm frozen on the outside. That memory... it's so vivid. I can still hear the screams, you know? It's like they're echoing in my head.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What physical sensations are you noticing right now?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I can feel it pounding in my chest. And my hands... they're clammy. It's like I'm back there again, watching it all happen. I feel so helpless, just like I did then.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... why didn't I do something? I should have helped, should have stopped it somehow. But I was so scared. I just froze. And now, I can't shake this feeling that I'm a coward. That I failed those people.",
    "Therapist: How does that belief impact you?",
    "Client: It... it eats away at me. Every day, I second-guess myself. I avoid confrontation at all costs because I'm afraid I'll freeze up again. It's affecting my relationships, my work... everything. I feel like I can't trust myself to do the right thing when it really matters.",
    "Therapist: What else comes up for you?",
    "Client: Anger. I'm so angry at the people who caused this violence. But I'm also angry at myself. And... I'm scared. What if something like that happens again? Will I be able to act next time? Or will I just stand there, useless?",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your daily life?",
    "Client: It's like I'm always on edge, waiting for something bad to happen. I have trouble sleeping because I keep replaying that scene in my head. And during the day, I'm exhausted and irritable. I snap at my coworkers over little things. I've been avoiding social situations because I'm afraid I'll have a panic attack or something.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your anxiety now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a bit less intense than before we started talking. I mean, I still feel shaky and nervous, but... I don't know. Talking about it, putting it into words... it's like it takes some of the power away from the memory. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it does. How else has this experience affected you?",
    "Client: I've become hyper-vigilant. I'm always scanning for potential threats, even in safe places. It's exhausting. And I feel so... disconnected from people. Like there's this invisible wall between me and everyone else. They haven't seen what I've seen, you know? How can they possibly understand?",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to you to feel understood?",
    "Client: God, it would mean everything. To not feel so alone in this. To know that someone else gets it, that I'm not crazy for feeling this way. Maybe... maybe it would help me feel less ashamed about how I reacted that day.",
    "Therapist: How do you think that might change things for you?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe I'd be able to forgive myself a little. Maybe I could start to see that freezing was just... a normal reaction to an abnormal situation. Not a character flaw or a moral failing. It's hard to imagine, but... maybe I could start to feel okay again.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you consider that possibility?",
    "Client: It's... scary, actually. Part of me wants to hold onto the guilt because it feels like if I let it go, I'm somehow excusing what happened. But another part of me is so tired of carrying this weight. I want to be able to live my life without constantly looking over my shoulder or reliving that day.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel now compared to earlier?",
    "Client: It's... calmer, I think. My heart isn't racing as much. I still feel a bit shaky, but it's not as intense. It's like... talking about it is helping me process it somehow. I didn't expect that.",
    "Therapist: What's surprised you most about this conversation?",
    "Client: I guess... how much I had bottled up inside. I've never really talked about this in detail before. It's always been this big, scary thing that I've tried to avoid thinking about. But now that I'm facing it... it's still scary, but it feels a little more manageable.",
    "Therapist: How might this experience inform your path forward?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to keep talking about it. As hard as it is, I can see that avoiding it hasn't helped. Maybe... maybe if I can face this memory, I can start to regain some control over my life. I don't want to be ruled by fear anymore.",
    "Therapist: What support do you need to continue this work?",
    "Client: I think... I need someone to remind me that it's okay to feel whatever I'm feeling. That there's no right or wrong way to process this. And maybe... maybe I need help learning some techniques to manage my anxiety when it gets overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about our session today?",
    "Client: It was tough, really tough. But... I also feel a sense of... I don't know, maybe relief? Like I've taken a small step towards something better. I'm scared about what comes next, but I also feel a tiny bit hopeful. Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to explore more about how this experience has shaped my relationships. And maybe... maybe start looking at ways to rebuild my sense of safety in the world. Is that something we can work on?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How are you feeling as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm feeling drained, but also... lighter, somehow. Like I've put down a heavy backpack I've been carrying for years. I know there's still a long way to go, but... thank you. For listening, for understanding. It means more than I can say.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
