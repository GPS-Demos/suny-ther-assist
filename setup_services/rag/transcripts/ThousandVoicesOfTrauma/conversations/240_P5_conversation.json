    "Therapist: Mr. Lee, today we'll begin imaginal exposure. Are you ready to discuss this?",
    "Client: I suppose so, Dr. Chen. To be honest, I'm feeling a bit apprehensive about it. Can you tell me more about what we'll be doing?",
    "Therapist: Of course. It involves revisiting your airplane crash experience in a safe environment. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That sounds... challenging. I've spent years trying to avoid thinking about that day. The idea of purposely bringing it up makes me nervous. Will it be too overwhelming?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace and I'll support you throughout. How else can I address your worries?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about losing control of my emotions. What if I can't handle it? And... will reliving it make my symptoms worse instead of better?",
    "Therapist: Those are common concerns. Remember, you're in control here. We can pause anytime. This process helps reduce symptoms over time. How does that reassure you?",
    "Client: It helps a little. I appreciate that I can stop if needed. I guess I'm just scared of facing those memories head-on. They've haunted me for so long.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. This exercise is crucial for healing. What questions do you have about the process?",
    "Client: Thank you for saying that. I'm curious about what exactly I'll need to do. Do I just... start talking about the crash? And how long will this part of the session last?",
    "Therapist: You'll describe the event in detail, in the present tense. We'll aim for about 30-45 minutes. How does that timeline feel to you?",
    "Client: That sounds like a long time to focus on such a difficult memory. I'm not sure I can talk about it for that long. What if I run out of things to say or get too upset to continue?",
    "Therapist: We'll take breaks if needed. Your resilience might surprise you. Shall we discuss coping strategies?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think having some strategies would help me feel more prepared. What do you suggest?",
    "Therapist: We can use grounding techniques and deep breathing. How do these sound as starting points?",
    "Client: Those sound helpful. I've used deep breathing before, but I'm not familiar with grounding techniques. Could you explain those a bit more?",
    "Therapist: Grounding involves using your senses to stay present. For example, naming objects you see. Would you like to try now?",
    "Client: Sure, I can give it a try. I see... your desk, the painting on the wall, my shoes, the tissue box, and the window. That does help me feel more centered in the present moment. I can see how this could be useful during the exposure exercise.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. You did well. Remember, I'm here to support you throughout. Are you feeling more prepared now?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I am. It's still daunting, but knowing these techniques and understanding the process better helps. I appreciate your patience in explaining everything. I think... I think I'm ready to try this.",
    "Therapist: Your willingness is commendable. Shall we begin, or do you need a moment?",
    "Client: I think I need just a moment to collect myself. Maybe we could do some of that deep breathing together before we start? That might help calm my nerves a bit.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's take a few deep breaths together. Ready when you are."
