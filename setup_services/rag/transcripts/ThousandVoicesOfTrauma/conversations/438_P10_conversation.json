    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. How are you feeling about our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: Honestly, doc, I'm a bit on edge. My stomach's in knots, and I keep second-guessing if I'm ready for this. But I know we've been working towards it, so... I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Uh, I'd say about a 6 out of 10. Not panicking, but definitely tense.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath, and when you're ready, describe the scene.",
    "Client: *exhales slowly* Alright. It's... it's a warm evening in July. I'm walking home from work, cutting through the park like I always do. The sun's just starting to set, casting long shadows across the path. I can hear kids laughing in the distance, probably at the playground...",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay in the present tense. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see the trees lining the path, their leaves rustling in the breeze. There's... there's a group of teenagers hanging out near the basketball court. They're laughing, horsing around. It all seems so normal, you know? But then I hear sirens in the distance, and my heart... my heart starts racing a little.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: The sirens are getting closer. I see a police car pull up to the edge of the park, lights flashing. Two officers get out, and they're... they're heading straight for the group of teens. I can see the kids tensing up, their laughter dying out. One of the officers, he's... he's reaching for his belt, and I... I can't breathe...",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Remember, you're safe here. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: *voice shaking* It's... it's up to an 8. God, it feels so real.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a few deep breaths. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. The officer, he's yelling at the kids to put their hands up. They look terrified. One of them, a young boy, he's... he's fumbling, trying to pull something out of his pocket. The other officer starts shouting, \"Gun! Gun!\" But it's not... it's just a phone. It's just a damn phone!",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm furious. And scared. My heart's pounding so hard I can hear it in my ears. I want to yell, to tell them to stop, but I... I can't move. I'm frozen, watching as they tackle the boy to the ground. He's crying, begging them to stop. The others are screaming...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Carlos. Remember, you're observing, not reliving.",
    "Client: *breathing heavily* Right, right. I... I see the other kids backing away, hands in the air. Some are crying. The officers are cuffing the boy on the ground. He's not resisting, but they're... they're being so rough. I can see blood on his face where it hit the pavement.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking, \"This isn't right. This isn't justice.\" I feel... God, I feel so helpless. Like when I was a kid, and my old man would... *pauses* No, no, focus. The park. I'm in the park.",
    "Therapist: Good catch. Stay in the present scene. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I finally find my voice. I'm shouting at the officers, telling them to stop, that he's just a kid. One of them turns to me, hand on his holster, and tells me to back off. His eyes... they're cold, threatening. I can feel myself shrinking back, that old familiar feeling of... of being small, powerless.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. Maybe even a 10. I can feel my hands shaking.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Feel your feet on the floor. You're here, you're safe.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... okay. I'm here. I'm safe. But in the memory, I... I'm not. I'm watching them put the boy in the back of the squad car. The other kids are scattered now, some running away, others just standing there, shocked. And I... I feel like I failed them. Like I should have done more.",
    "Therapist: What do you do after they leave?",
    "Client: I... I sit down on a nearby bench. My legs feel weak. I'm... I'm shaking all over. I can hear people around me talking, some on phones probably calling about what happened. But it all feels distant, like I'm underwater. I keep replaying it in my mind, thinking of all the things I should have done differently.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What else?",
    "Client: I... I start to feel sick to my stomach. The adrenaline's wearing off, and now I'm just... I'm overwhelmed. I can feel tears in my eyes, but I'm fighting them back. I don't want to break down here, in public. But inside, I'm... I'm screaming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Carlos. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8? My heart's still racing.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take some deep breaths. What happens as you sit there?",
    "Client: I... I pull out my phone. My hands are shaking so bad I can barely dial. I'm calling my sister. I need... I need to talk to someone who'll understand. As it's ringing, I'm looking around the park. It's like nothing happened. People are jogging, walking their dogs. But for me, everything's changed.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Angry. Frustrated. Like I'm living in a different world from everyone else. My sister picks up, and I... I just start talking. I'm telling her what happened, my voice cracking. She's trying to calm me down, but I can hear the worry in her voice.",
    "Therapist: What does she say?",
    "Client: She's... she's telling me to come over. Says I shouldn't be alone right now. But I... I don't know if I can move. My legs feel like lead. I tell her I'll call her back, but... but I don't. I just sit there as the sun sets, feeling... feeling lost.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Carlos. Let's start winding down. How does the scene end?",
    "Client: I... I finally stand up. My body aches like I've run a marathon. I start walking home, but... but everything looks different now. Threatening. Every car that passes, every person I see... I'm on edge. When I get to my apartment, I... I lock the door behind me and just... just slide down to the floor. And that's when I finally let myself cry.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Carlos. You did very well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. Emotionally and physically. But also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've let something out that's been bottled up for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's common after an exposure session. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about a 5, I think. Still there, but not as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves. Can you name five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: Uh, yeah. I see... the clock on the wall, your desk lamp, the bookshelf, the plant in the corner, and... and the painting behind you.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Now, four things you can touch?",
    "Client: The armrest of this chair, my jeans, the smooth surface of my watch, and... and the texture of my shirt.",
    "Therapist: Great. Three things you hear?",
    "Client: The hum of the air conditioner, cars passing outside, and... and my own breathing.",
    "Therapist: Two things you smell?",
    "Client: The faint scent of your air freshener and... coffee? Yeah, coffee.",
    "Therapist: And finally, one thing you taste?",
    "Client: The lingering mint from the gum I was chewing earlier.",
    "Therapist: Well done, Carlos. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Better. More... more present, I guess. Still a bit shaky, but not as overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Remember, it's normal to feel drained after an exposure session. Do you have any questions or concerns?",
    "Client: No, I... I think I'm okay. It was tough, but... but I'm glad we did it. I feel like I understand some things better now.",
    "Therapist: I'm proud of the work you did today, Carlos. Remember to be kind to yourself this evening. We'll process this more in our next session.",
    "Client: Thanks, doc. I... I appreciate it. I'll try to take it easy tonight.",
    "Therapist: That's a good plan. We'll end here for today. Take care, Carlos.",
    "Client: You too, doc. See you next week."
