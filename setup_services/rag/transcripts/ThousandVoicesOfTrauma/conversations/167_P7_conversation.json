    "Client: Okay... I'm in my living room, watching TV. It's late, maybe around 11 PM. I hear a noise at the back door, like someone's trying to force it open. My heart starts racing...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I get up, feeling scared. The noise gets louder, and suddenly I hear glass breaking. I freeze, not knowing what to do. Then I see a shadow moving in the kitchen...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm terrified. My hands are shaking, and I can't breathe properly. I want to run, but I'm paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel scared. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The intruder enters the living room. He's tall, wearing dark clothes and a mask. He's holding something... I think it's a crowbar. I can't move or speak. He sees me and starts walking towards me...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep describing what's happening.",
    "Client: I finally find my voice and yell, \"Who are you? What do you want?\" My voice is shaking. He doesn't say anything, just keeps coming closer. I back away, stumbling over the coffee table...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: I fall backwards onto the couch. He's standing over me now, raising the crowbar. I think he's going to hit me. I close my eyes and raise my arms to protect myself...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud bang from outside. It sounds like a car backfiring. The intruder jumps and looks towards the window. In that moment, I find the strength to move. I leap up and run towards the front door...",
    "Therapist: Good. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My heart is pounding so hard. I can feel the adrenaline coursing through me. I'm scared, but also determined to escape.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel that way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I fumble with the lock on the front door. My hands are sweating and shaking. I can hear the intruder coming after me. I finally get the door open and run out into the street...",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. What happens after you run out?",
    "Client: I'm running down the street, screaming for help. It's dark and quiet. I don't see anyone around. I keep looking back, expecting to see the intruder chasing me...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you experiencing?",
    "Client: I feel so exposed and vulnerable. My legs are weak, and I'm gasping for air. I'm terrified that he'll catch up to me at any moment.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory bravely. Continue.",
    "Client: I see a neighbor's porch light turn on. I run towards their house, still yelling for help. The neighbor opens the door, looking confused and scared. I rush in, slamming the door behind me...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I'm shaking uncontrollably. I can barely speak to explain what happened. The neighbor is calling the police. I feel a mix of relief and intense fear...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: The police arrive quickly. They take my statement and search the area. They find signs of forced entry at my house, but the intruder is gone. I feel... I don't know... numb, I guess.",
    "Therapist: You've done very well. Let's take a moment to breathe.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) That was... intense. Reliving it like that... it feels so real again.",
    "Therapist: You showed great courage. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I survived it again.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. You did survive, both then and now.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess I did. It's still scary to think about, but maybe a little less overwhelming now.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. Let's end here for today."
