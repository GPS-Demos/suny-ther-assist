    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit nervous, to be honest. We're going to talk about the earthquake again, right?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's right. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. It's just... it still feels so raw, you know? But I want to try.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Remember, you're safe here. Let's start with your SUDS level.",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 6 right now. My stomach feels a bit tight.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Close your eyes when you're ready and describe that day.",
    "Client: Okay... *deep breath* It's early morning. I'm in bed, and suddenly everything starts shaking. The noise... it's so loud. Like a freight train. I jump out of bed, but I can barely stand.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: The walls are... they're moving! Pictures are falling. I hear glass breaking downstairs. I'm trying to get to the doorway, but it's so hard to walk. I'm calling out for my husband, but I can't hear him over the noise.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to an 8. My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Okay. I make it to the hallway. The shaking is getting worse. I can hear my neighbors screaming. I'm terrified the house is going to collapse. I... I can't find my husband. Where is he? *voice breaks*",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm stumbling down the stairs. There's broken glass everywhere. I cut my foot, but I barely feel it. I'm just focused on getting out. The front door is jammed. I'm pushing, pushing... finally, it opens.",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you see outside?",
    "Client: It's... chaos. People are running, crying. Cars are honking. I see a huge crack in the street. Trees have fallen. And the dust... there's so much dust in the air. I can barely breathe.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My SUDS is probably a 9. It feels so real.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here with me. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: *takes a shaky breath* Okay. I'm... I'm looking around frantically for my husband. I keep calling his name. Then I see him. He's helping our elderly neighbor out of her house. I run to him, relief flooding through me.",
    "Therapist: What happens when you reach him?",
    "Client: We hold each other tightly. We're both trembling. I can feel his heart pounding. We look around... our neighborhood is unrecognizable. Houses have collapsed. People are crying, screaming for help. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What do you do next?",
    "Client: We... we start helping others. Checking on neighbors, pulling people from rubble. It's like we're on autopilot. The aftershocks keep coming. Each time, I think, \"This is it. We're not going to survive this.\"",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's still high... maybe an 8. My hands are clammy.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Hours pass. It feels like days. We're exhausted, covered in dust and sweat. Then... then we hear about the tsunami warning. My God, I thought the worst was over, but it's not.",
    "Therapist: What goes through your mind at that moment?",
    "Client: Panic. Pure panic. We live close to the coast. I remember thinking, \"We survived the earthquake, but now we're going to drown.\" We start running inland, helping as many people as we can along the way.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you're running?",
    "Client: My legs are like lead. My lungs are burning. But the adrenaline... it keeps me going. I can taste the salt in the air. The sound of the ocean is getting louder. It's terrifying.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: We make it to higher ground. There are hundreds of people there, all of us watching the ocean. The water... it starts receding. It's like nothing I've ever seen before. Then we see it... the wave. It's massive.",
    "Therapist: Describe what you see.",
    "Client: It's... it's like a wall of water. Debris, cars, parts of houses... all being carried by this enormous wave. The sound is deafening. We watch as it hits the shore, destroying everything in its path. I'm frozen, unable to look away.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, Maria?",
    "Client: I... I feel nauseous. My SUDS is at a 10. Can... can we pause for a moment?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take a few deep breaths. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *breathes deeply* Okay... I think I can continue.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. When you're ready, tell me what happens after the wave hits.",
    "Client: The destruction is... indescribable. Where there were houses, businesses, streets... it's all gone. Just... gone. We stay on the hill for hours, terrified of more waves. When we finally go back down... *voice breaks* it's like entering a war zone.",
    "Therapist: What do you see?",
    "Client: Debris everywhere. Cars overturned. Buildings reduced to rubble. And the smell... salt, mud, gasoline. But the worst part... the bodies. There are bodies in the streets, in trees. I... I can't...",
    "Therapist: It's okay, Maria. Take a moment. You're here with me, you're safe.",
    "Client: *crying* It's just... so many people. People we knew. Our community... destroyed in a matter of hours.",
    "Therapist: I know this is difficult. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... hollow. Overwhelmed. My SUDS is still at a 10. I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Let's take a few deep breaths together.",
    "Client: *breathes with the therapist* Thank you. It helps a little.",
    "Therapist: Good. Can you tell me what happens in the days following?",
    "Client: It's... it's a blur. We're in survival mode. No electricity, no running water. We're sleeping in a makeshift shelter with hundreds of others. The aftershocks keep coming. Every time the ground shakes, I think it's happening all over again.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope during this time?",
    "Client: I... I focus on helping others. It's the only way I can function. We're distributing food, water, blankets. Searching for survivors. But with each passing day, hope fades. The smell of death gets stronger.",
    "Therapist: What about your own home?",
    "Client: We... we don't go back for days. When we finally do... *pauses* it's gone. Everything we owned, all our memories... just gone. I remember standing there, staring at the empty space where our house used to be, and feeling... nothing. I was numb.",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly difficult. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My SUDS is down to about an 8. I feel... drained. But also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've released something.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. You've done very well today, Maria.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to talk about, but... I think it's getting a little easier each time.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay. *takes a deep breath* I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Good. Can you tell me five things you can see in this room right now?",
    "Client: I see... the blue painting on the wall, the plant in the corner, your desk, the box of tissues, and the clock.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Now, four things you can touch?",
    "Client: The armrest of the chair, my necklace, the fabric of my shirt, and... my wedding ring.",
    "Therapist: Good. Three things you can hear?",
    "Client: The ticking of the clock, traffic outside, and the hum of the air conditioner.",
    "Therapist: Two things you can smell?",
    "Client: The lavender air freshener and... coffee, I think?",
    "Therapist: And finally, one thing you can taste?",
    "Client: The mint from the gum I had earlier.",
    "Therapist: Wonderful job, Maria. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Better. More... present. My SUDS is down to about a 5 now.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. You've done incredibly well today. How are you feeling about the session overall?",
    "Client: It was tough, but... I think it helped. I feel like I'm starting to process it all a bit better.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. Remember to practice your breathing exercises this week. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we end?",
    "Client: No, I think I'm okay. Thank you for your help today.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Maria. I'm proud of the work you did today. We'll continue next week. Take care.",
    "Client: Thank you. See you next week."
