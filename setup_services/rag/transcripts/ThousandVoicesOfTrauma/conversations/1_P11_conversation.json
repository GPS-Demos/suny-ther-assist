    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Lee?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's strange, you know? I've never been in a plane crash, but reliving that bullying experience while imagining it happening on a plane... it brought up so many emotions. My heart's still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The feeling of helplessness, I think. In the memory, I was cornered by those bullies in the school bathroom. But in this scenario, I was trapped in an airplane seat, hearing the engines fail, and... it was like I was that scared little boy again, but this time with no way out.",
    "Therapist: How did that feel, physically?",
    "Client: My palms got sweaty, just like they used to back then. And I felt this tightness in my chest, like I couldn't breathe properly. It's funny, I haven't thought about those physical reactions in years, but they came flooding back.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. And emotionally?",
    "Client: Terrified. Absolutely terrified. But also... angry? I think I'm angry at myself for still being affected by something that happened so long ago. I'm 75, for goodness sake! I should be over this by now.",
    "Therapist: It's common to feel that way. How might this connect to your day-to-day life?",
    "Client: Well, now that you mention it... I've always hated confined spaces. I avoid elevators, and I get anxious in crowded places. I guess I never really connected that to the bullying before. It's like... I'm always subconsciously looking for an escape route, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. How else has this affected you?",
    "Client: I... I think it's affected my relationships too. I've always had trouble trusting people, especially men. Even now, I sometimes feel like I'm that vulnerable kid again, waiting for someone to hurt me. It's probably why I don't have many close friends. I love my wife, but even with her, I sometimes struggle to open up completely.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. What do you think about these realizations?",
    "Client: It's... it's a lot to take in. But in a way, it's also a relief? Like, there's a reason for why I am the way I am. I'm not just being irrational or weak. There's a root to all this.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive perspective. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm scared, to be honest. But I also feel a glimmer of hope. If I can understand these connections, maybe I can start to change them? I don't want to live in fear anymore. I want to be able to travel without panic, to make new friends without always waiting for the other shoe to drop.",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. What's one small step you could take this week?",
    "Client: Hmm... maybe I could try taking the elevator instead of the stairs next time I visit my daughter? Just one floor, to start with. And maybe... maybe I could tell my wife a bit about what we're doing here. I've never really told her about the bullying.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like excellent steps. How do you feel about our session today?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... good? Like I've run a marathon, but crossed a finish line I didn't even know was there. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know we have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can overcome this.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. We'll continue next week?",
    "Client: Yes, definitely. I'll be here. Thank you again, doctor."
