    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing but also blank at the same time. My heart is still pounding, and I feel a bit shaky. That memory... it brought back so much.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: It's overwhelming. I can still see the police officer's face, hear his harsh voice. I feel small again, like that scared child. My hands are clammy, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's hard to breathe normally.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why me? Why did this have to happen?\" I feel angry, but also helpless. It's like I'm reliving that moment when the officer grabbed my arm. I can feel his grip, smell his cologne. It's so vivid. I'm trying to remind myself that I'm safe now, but part of me still feels trapped in that memory.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you remember this?",
    "Client: My muscles are tense, especially in my shoulders and jaw. I notice I'm clenching my fists. There's this knot in my stomach, and I feel slightly nauseous. It's like my body is preparing to defend itself, even though the threat isn't real anymore.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are you experiencing?",
    "Client: Fear is the strongest. It's this primal, gut-wrenching fear that makes me want to run and hide. But there's also anger - at the officer, at the system that allowed this to happen. And shame... I feel ashamed that I couldn't protect myself, that I still struggle with this after all these years.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when it first happened?",
    "Client: They're... they're not as intense now. Back then, I felt completely paralyzed by fear. Now, it's still scary, but I can recognize it as a memory. The anger is newer, though. As a child, I was just confused and scared. Now, I understand the injustice of it all, and that makes me angry.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your ability to process these emotions now?",
    "Client: It's different. I can... I can step back a little. Before, I'd be completely overwhelmed, maybe even have a panic attack. Now, it's still difficult, but I can observe my reactions. I'm more aware of my thoughts and feelings, even if I can't always control them.",
    "Therapist: How does this awareness impact you?",
    "Client: It's... empowering, in a way. Terrifying, but empowering. I feel like I'm slowly regaining control. The memory doesn't have the same power over me that it used to. Don't get me wrong, it's still incredibly painful, but I'm not completely lost in it anymore.",
    "Therapist: What helps you stay grounded in the present?",
    "Client: Focusing on my breath helps a lot. And reminding myself of where I am now - that I'm an adult, that I'm safe. Sometimes I look around the room, focus on objects I can see. It helps pull me back to the present. And... talking about it like this, it helps too. It makes the memory feel less overwhelming when I can put it into words.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about your progress in therapy?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of feelings. I'm proud of how far I've come. A year ago, I couldn't even think about that incident without having a breakdown. Now, I can talk about it, even if it's still painful. But sometimes I get frustrated. I wish I could just 'get over it' completely. I know that's not realistic, but there are days when I feel like I'm not making progress fast enough.",
    "Therapist: What would you say to that part of yourself that's frustrated?",
    "Client: I'd... I'd try to be kind to myself. I'd say that healing isn't linear, that it's okay to have good days and bad days. I'd remind myself of how far I've come, of the strength it takes to face these memories. And I'd say that it's okay to be patient, that I'm doing the best I can.",
    "Therapist: How does your progress impact your daily life?",
    "Client: It's made a big difference. I used to avoid anything that might trigger memories - certain streets, interactions with authority figures. Now, I can handle those situations better. I still get anxious sometimes, but it doesn't control my life like it used to. I'm more present with my family, more focused at work. It's like... it's like I'm reclaiming parts of myself that I thought were lost.",
    "Therapist: What strengths have you discovered through this process?",
    "Client: I've realized I'm more resilient than I thought. Every time I face these memories and come out the other side, I feel stronger. I've also discovered a capacity for self-compassion that I didn't know I had. And... I've found my voice. I'm better at expressing my needs and setting boundaries now.",
    "Therapist: How do you see these strengths shaping your future?",
    "Client: I think... I think they'll help me continue to heal and grow. I feel more equipped to handle challenges now. And I hope I can use my experiences to help others, maybe advocate for change. I don't want what happened to me to happen to anyone else. It's like... turning this painful experience into something meaningful, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful perspective. How do you feel now, compared to when we started?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, I guess. Talking about it is still hard, but it's like each time I do, I'm releasing a little bit of the weight I've been carrying. I'm tired, emotionally drained, but also... I don't know, maybe hopeful? Like I'm making progress, even if it's slow.",
    "Therapist: What do you need right now to take care of yourself?",
    "Client: I think I need some time to process everything we've talked about. Maybe do some deep breathing or meditation when I get home. And I might call my wife, just to hear her voice. It helps ground me. Oh, and probably have a cup of tea. Something soothing.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. We're nearing the end of our session. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm on the right path. And I'm grateful for the support.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Take care, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. See you next week."
