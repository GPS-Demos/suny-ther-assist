    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. The memory of that animal attack... it felt so vivid, like I was right back there. My heart's still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out most?",
    "Client: The fear. It was overwhelming. I could hear the growling, feel the pain... But, um, there was something else too. I kept thinking about how helpless I felt, just like... just like during the abuse.",
    "Therapist: I see. How did that connection feel?",
    "Client: It was... surprising, actually. I never realized how similar those feelings were. It's like both experiences left me feeling so powerless and vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. How does this relate to your symptoms now?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... I'm always on edge, always feeling like I need to protect myself. It's exhausting. But now I can see why I react that way, given what I've been through.",
    "Therapist: You're making valuable connections. What else?",
    "Client: I... I noticed that during the imaginal, I started using some of the breathing techniques we've practiced. It helped a little, which was... unexpected, I suppose.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: It's... encouraging, I think. Like maybe I'm not as helpless now as I was then. But it's also frustrating because I wish I could just... get over it all, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. What do you think about your progress so far?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard to see sometimes. But I guess I am doing better than when we started. I'm sleeping a bit more, and the nightmares aren't as frequent. And now this... being able to use the breathing during the imaginal. It's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How does this affect your goals moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I want to keep working on this. Maybe focus more on those moments when I feel powerless in my daily life and try to use these techniques. And... and maybe start talking more about the abuse. I've been avoiding that, but I can see now how it's all connected.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a solid plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... okay. Better than I expected, actually. It's still hard, but I feel like I understand myself a bit more now. And that's... that's something, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: It certainly is. What would you like to focus on next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to delve more into the abuse. It's scary, but I feel like I'm ready to face it more directly now. Is that... is that alright?",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll take it at your pace. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm not alone in this anymore. And that... that means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. I'm here to support you. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, I'll be here. Thank you again."
