    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Lee. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to be talking about some difficult things, and I'm not sure how I'll handle it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's... let's give it a try.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in our living room. It's evening, and the lights are dim. I can smell dinner cooking \u2013 something with garlic. My wife, she's in the kitchen. I can hear her moving around, pots clanging.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm sitting on the couch, scrolling through my phone. Work emails. I'm... I'm feeling tense. There's a deadline coming up, and I'm behind. I can feel my shoulders getting tight.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 40? It's building, though.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Right. So, I'm sitting there, and I hear my wife call out that dinner's ready. But I... I don't move. I'm fixated on this email from my boss. It's... it's not good.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Anger. Frustration. I feel... I feel like I'm going to explode. My heart's racing now.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: My wife comes into the room. She's wiping her hands on a dishcloth. She says, \"Didn't you hear me? Dinner's ready.\" But her tone... it's not angry. It's worried. I can see it in her eyes.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Guilty. Ashamed. But also... also more angry. It's like I can't control it. I snap at her, \"I heard you! Can't you see I'm busy?\"",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 70.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. Remember, you're here in the office with me.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay. Okay, I'm... I'm alright.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: She... she flinches when I snap. Just for a second, but I see it. And it... it breaks something in me. I stand up, and I'm shouting now. \"Why can't you just leave me alone? Why do you always have to nag?\"",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you notice?",
    "Client: Her face. She looks... scared. Hurt. I've never seen her look at me like that before. And I... I hate myself for it. But I can't stop.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I throw my phone. Not at her, but it smashes against the wall. The sound... it's so loud in the quiet room. She jumps, and... and I see tears in her eyes.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Awful. Disgusted with myself. My distress... it's probably at 90 now.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: *breathing deeply* It's... it's hard to stay with this.",
    "Therapist: I know. You're doing well. Can you continue?",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, I can. So, after I throw the phone, there's this... this moment of silence. It's like time stops. I can hear my own heartbeat, my breathing. It's so loud.",
    "Therapist: What do you do in that moment?",
    "Client: I... I look at my hands. They're shaking. And suddenly, it's like I'm seeing myself from outside. This... this angry, violent man. I don't recognize him. I don't want to be him.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I start to cry. Just... just break down. I sink to the floor, and I'm sobbing. I can't even look at my wife. I'm so ashamed.",
    "Therapist: How does your wife react?",
    "Client: She... she doesn't run away like I expect. She comes to me, slowly. Kneels beside me. She doesn't touch me at first, just... just sits there while I cry.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: Overwhelmed. Grateful. Undeserving. My distress... it's still high, maybe 85, but it's... it's different now.",
    "Therapist: Different how?",
    "Client: It's... it's not anger anymore. It's sadness. Regret. I finally look at her, and I say, \"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.\"",
    "Therapist: How does she respond?",
    "Client: She... she takes my hand. Squeezes it. She doesn't say anything, but... but I can see forgiveness in her eyes. And it... it breaks me all over again.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: We just... we just sit there for a while. On the floor. Her hand in mine. I can smell the dinner burning in the kitchen, but neither of us moves.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in this moment?",
    "Client: That I need help. That I can't... I can't keep doing this. To her. To us. I'm thinking about my father, how he used to... to lose control like this. And I swore I'd never be like him.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Drained. But... but also determined. My distress... it's down to maybe 60 now. I'm... I'm exhausted, but I feel like... like maybe there's hope.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: Okay. *deep breath* I'm... I'm back in the room with you now.",
    "Therapist: Well done. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Tired. Emotional. But... but also relieved, I think. Like... like I've faced something I've been avoiding for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's very common. You did well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was... it was harder than I expected. But I think... I think I needed to face this.",
    "Therapist: Indeed. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I... I want to be better. For my wife. For myself.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. Shall we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think... I think that would be good. I need some time to process all this.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you... thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
