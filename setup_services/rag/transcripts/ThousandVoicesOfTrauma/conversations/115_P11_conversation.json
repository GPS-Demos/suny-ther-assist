    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, John?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. Going through that memory of the combat... it brought back so many intense feelings. I could almost smell the gunpowder and hear the shouting again. It's like I was right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The fear. God, the fear was paralyzing. I remember thinking I was going to die, that I'd never see my family again. And the guilt... one of my buddies got hit right next to me. I keep thinking maybe if I'd reacted faster, I could've... I don't know. Saved him somehow. It's stupid, I know, but...",
    "Therapist: It's not stupid. How did reliving that affect you today?",
    "Client: It was... hard. Really hard. But also... different? I mean, I've had flashbacks before, but this felt more... controlled, I guess? Like, I knew I was here, in this room, even while I was describing what happened. It's usually not like that. Usually, it just takes over completely.",
    "Therapist: That's an important observation. How does that difference feel?",
    "Client: It feels... better? I mean, it's still awful to remember, but having some control... it's like maybe I'm not completely at the mercy of these memories. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Can you say more about that sense of control?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... before, these memories would just ambush me. I'd be going about my day and suddenly, bam! I'm back there. But this time, I chose to go there. I knew it was coming, and even though it was hard, I did it. I got through it. And now... I don't know. I feel drained, but also kind of... proud? Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It takes courage to face these memories.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess it does. It's just... for so long, I've been trying to avoid anything that reminds me of what happened. But avoiding hasn't made it go away. If anything, it's made it worse. This is the first time I've felt like maybe... maybe there's a way through this.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How might this affect your daily life?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe I could start doing some of the things I've been avoiding? Like, I haven't been to any veteran events because I was afraid of triggering memories. But if I can face them here, maybe I could try that? It'd be nice to connect with people who understand, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great goal. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: Scared, honestly. But also... hopeful? For the first time in a long time, I feel like maybe there's a light at the end of this tunnel. It's not going to be easy, but... I think I'm ready to keep going. I want my life back.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable, John. Shall we schedule our next session?",
    "Client: Yeah, let's do it. I'm nervous, but... I'm ready. Thank you for guiding me through this. It means more than I can say.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, John. I'll see you next week."
