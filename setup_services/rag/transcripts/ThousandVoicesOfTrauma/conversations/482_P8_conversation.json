    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mrs. Patel?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's like I was right back there, in the middle of the flood. The sound of the water rushing, the panic in everyone's voices... it all felt so real again. My heart is still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I think. No, not just fear... it's more like... helplessness. I felt so powerless against the force of nature. And now, with this cyber bullying situation my granddaughter is facing, I'm feeling that same helplessness all over again.",
    "Therapist: How does that helplessness manifest in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a heaviness in my chest. And my shoulders feel tense, like I'm bracing for impact. I can feel my hands trembling a bit too. It's as if my body is still in that fight-or-flight mode from the flood, even though I'm safe here.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are accompanying these physical sensations?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"I can't protect anyone.\" During the flood, I couldn't protect my home, my neighbors. And now, I can't protect my granddaughter from these online bullies. It's... it's overwhelming. I feel like I should be able to do something, but I don't know what.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your broader experience with trauma?",
    "Client: I suppose... well, the flood took away my sense of security. My home, which was supposed to be safe, suddenly wasn't. And now, with the cyber bullying, it's like that safety is being threatened again. The internet was supposed to be this wonderful tool for connection, especially at my age, but now it feels like another unpredictable force that can hurt the people I love.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you make that connection?",
    "Client: Anger, actually. I'm angry that I've had to face these situations where I feel so... so out of control. First the flood, and now this. It's not fair. I've worked hard all my life, I should be enjoying my retirement, not dealing with all this stress and worry.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a heat in my stomach. My jaw feels tight too, like I want to grit my teeth. But there's also this... this energy. It's not all negative. Part of me wants to channel this anger into action, to find a way to help my granddaughter, even if I don't understand all this technology stuff.",
    "Therapist: What do you make of that energy?",
    "Client: I... I think it's giving me a bit of hope, actually. During the flood, we all came together as a community to help each other. Maybe I can do something similar now. I may not understand social media, but I understand people. Perhaps I can rally support for my granddaughter, talk to other parents and grandparents. It won't stop the bullying entirely, but it might help her feel less alone.",
    "Therapist: How does this realization affect your feelings of helplessness?",
    "Client: It... it lessens them a bit. I'm still worried, of course, but I feel like I have a direction now. I'm not just a victim of circumstances. I can take some action, even if it's small. It reminds me that even during the flood, when everything seemed hopeless, small actions made a difference. Helping a neighbor, sharing supplies... those things mattered.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing about your emotional state now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... I'm feeling more grounded, I suppose. The panic has subsided a bit. I'm still anxious, but it's not as overwhelming. And there's this... this strange mix of sadness and determination. Sadness for what my granddaughter is going through, but determination to be there for her, to use what I've learned from my own experiences to help her.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel now compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: It's... it's more relaxed. The tightness in my chest has eased up a bit. My shoulders aren't as tense. I still feel some of that heat in my stomach, but it feels more like... like a source of strength now, rather than just anger. And my hands have stopped trembling. I feel more... present, I suppose.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are you having about your ability to cope?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... I'm thinking that maybe I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. I survived the flood, didn't I? And I've been dealing with chronic pain for years now. It's not easy, but I manage. So maybe... maybe I can handle this too. It won't be easy, but I've got resources I didn't have before. I've got you, this therapy, and I've got the lessons I've learned from my past experiences.",
    "Therapist: How does that feel, acknowledging your strength?",
    "Client: It feels... good. Empowering, even. I've been so focused on feeling helpless that I forgot about all the times I've been strong. It doesn't make the situation with my granddaughter any less serious, but it makes me feel more capable of supporting her through it. And it makes me feel like I can face my own memories of the flood without being completely overwhelmed by them.",
    "Therapist: What's your biggest takeaway from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's that my past experiences, even the traumatic ones, can be a source of strength. They've shaped me, yes, but they haven't broken me. And maybe, just maybe, they've given me tools to help others. It's not about forgetting or pretending the bad things didn't happen. It's about learning from them, growing from them. I can use what I've been through to be there for my granddaughter in a way that maybe others can't.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How do you want to carry this forward?",
    "Client: I want to... I want to talk more with my granddaughter. Really listen to her, share some of my experiences if she's open to it. And I want to keep working on processing my trauma from the flood. It's hard, and it hurts, but I can see now how facing it might help me in other areas of my life. And maybe... maybe I'll look into some community groups for grandparents dealing with cyber bullying. I might not know much about technology, but I know about resilience, and that's something worth sharing.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great plan. We'll explore these ideas more in our next session. How are you feeling as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... cautiously optimistic, I think. Still a bit raw from the exposure exercise, but also... stronger. More capable. It's like I've reconnected with a part of myself I'd forgotten about. Thank you for guiding me through this. It wasn't easy, but I think it was important.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today, Mrs. Patel. Take care of yourself this week."
