    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the moment when you first learned about the divorce?",
    "Client: Okay... I was at the base, just finishing up a long shift. I got a call from Sarah, my wife... well, ex-wife now. She sounded different, cold almost. She said, \"We need to talk.\" I knew something was wrong. My heart started racing...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: She told me she couldn't do it anymore. The long deployments, the constant worry... She said she'd met someone else. I felt like I'd been punched in the gut. My hands were shaking, I could barely hold the phone...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I remember feeling so angry. I wanted to yell, to break something. But I was surrounded by my fellow soldiers. I had to keep it together. I remember walking outside, trying to breathe. The hot desert air felt suffocating...",
    "Therapist: That's it. Keep going.",
    "Client: I sat down on a crate, my head in my hands. I could hear the sounds of the base around me, but it all seemed distant. I felt so alone. All I could think was, \"What about our daughter? What about our life together?\" It felt like everything I was fighting for was suddenly gone.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. How did your body feel?",
    "Client: My chest felt tight, like I couldn't breathe properly. My stomach was in knots. I felt nauseous. I remember my back aching, probably from tensing up. I wanted to cry, but I couldn't. Not there, not surrounded by everyone.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions now.",
    "Client: I... I'm sorry, this is hard. (voice breaking) I keep thinking about how I failed them. How I wasn't there enough. Maybe if I had been home more, if I had...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: (taking a deep breath) Right, safe. Okay. I remember walking back to my bunk in a daze. Everything looked the same, but it all felt different. Like the world had shifted. I lay down, staring at the ceiling, feeling like my whole future had just disappeared.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What were you thinking?",
    "Client: I was thinking about all the plans we had made. The house we were going to buy when I got back. The school we had picked out for our daughter. It all seemed so pointless now. I felt like I had lost my anchor, my reason for being there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How did you cope in that moment?",
    "Client: I... I didn't, really. I just lay there, feeling numb. I think I eventually fell asleep, but it was a restless sleep. I kept waking up, hoping it was all a bad dream. But each time I woke up, the reality hit me again. It was like reliving it over and over.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. You're very brave for sharing this.",
    "Client: The next morning was the worst. I had to get up, go about my duties like nothing had happened. But everything reminded me of her, of home. I remember looking at the photo of us I kept in my locker, and just feeling this overwhelming sense of loss.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How did you manage your duties?",
    "Client: It was hard. I felt like I was on autopilot. I went through the motions, but I wasn't really there. I made stupid mistakes, forgot simple things. My commanding officer noticed and pulled me aside. I had to tell him what happened. That was... that was tough.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to acknowledge how challenging that was.",
    "Client: Yeah, it was. I felt like I was letting everyone down. My family, my unit. I remember thinking, \"What's the point of all this if I don't have a home to go back to?\" It was the first time I really questioned why I was there.",
    "Therapist: You're showing a lot of strength. Keep going.",
    "Client: The following days were a blur. I threw myself into work, trying to stay busy. But at night, when everything was quiet, it would all come rushing back. The anger, the sadness, the feeling of betrayal. I started having trouble sleeping, which made everything worse.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those feelings. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: I started to withdraw from the others. I didn't want to talk about it, didn't want their pity. I felt like I was carrying this huge weight that no one else could understand. The worst part was not being able to see my daughter, to explain things to her. I felt like I was abandoning her too.",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly painful. You're doing great sharing this.",
    "Client: It was. I... I'm sorry, I need a moment. (deep breath) Talking about this, it brings it all back. I can feel that tightness in my chest again, that sick feeling in my stomach.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (after a pause) I remember the day I finally broke down. It was about a week after the call. I was cleaning my weapon, a task I'd done a thousand times before. Suddenly, I just couldn't do it anymore. My hands were shaking so bad I dropped the gun. I sat there on the floor, and for the first time since the call, I let myself cry.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're doing well.",
    "Client: It felt like hours, just sitting there. One of my buddies found me. He didn't say anything, just sat with me. That was... that was the first time I felt like maybe I could get through this. It didn't fix anything, but it was a moment where I felt like I wasn't completely alone.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful moment. How do you feel now, recalling this?",
    "Client: It's... it's still painful. But it's different now. I can talk about it without feeling like I'm right back there. I still feel sad, angry sometimes, but it's not as overwhelming. I guess that's progress, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You've shown incredible resilience.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's still hard sometimes, especially when I think about how it affected my relationship with my daughter. But I'm trying to focus on being the best father I can be now, even if things are different than I imagined.",
    "Therapist: That's a very positive approach. How are you feeling after sharing all this?",
    "Client: Tired, honestly. But also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've been carrying this around for so long, and talking about it helps somehow. It's still there, but it feels more manageable.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: Thanks. I know we're almost out of time, but I wanted to say... this helps. Talking about it, even though it's hard. I think I'm starting to understand why we do this.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad you find it helpful. We'll continue next session."
