    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. The memory of the accident, it's so vivid now. I can still hear the screeching of the tires, the shattering glass. My heart's pounding, and I feel a bit shaky.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I think. No, not just fear... terror. It's like I'm right back there in that moment, trapped in the car. I can feel the panic rising in my chest. But there's also this... this overwhelming sadness. I keep thinking about how different my life was before the accident. How carefree I used to be.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does that sadness feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's heavy. Like a weight pressing down on my chest. My shoulders feel tense, and there's this knot in my stomach. I just want to curl up and disappear. It's not just about the accident itself anymore. It's about everything that came after - the pain, the surgeries, the depression. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel normal again.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really challenging. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"Why me?\" Why did this have to happen to me? I was always so careful, always followed the rules. And then in one moment, everything changed. I think about how unfair it all is. And then I feel guilty for thinking that way because I know others have it worse. But I can't help it. I also keep replaying the moment over and over, wondering if there was something I could have done differently.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts affect you?",
    "Client: They... they make me feel helpless. Like I'm stuck in this loop of fear and regret. Sometimes I get angry - at myself, at the other driver, at the world. But mostly, I just feel... lost. Like I don't know who I am anymore. The accident changed me, and I'm not sure I like who I've become. I used to be confident, outgoing. Now I'm anxious all the time, always waiting for the next bad thing to happen.",
    "Therapist: I hear you. What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to run away from these feelings, to forget it all. But another part knows I need to face this. I guess... I need to feel safe again. To believe that I can move past this. That there's still good things waiting for me in life. But it's so hard to see that right now. Everything just feels... dark.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. What's one small step you could take towards feeling safer?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe I could try some of those breathing exercises we talked about? They helped a little last time. And maybe... maybe I could reach out to my sister. She's been worried about me, and I've been pushing her away. It might help to talk to someone who cares.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like great ideas. How do you feel about trying them?",
    "Client: A bit nervous, to be honest. Opening up is scary. But also... there's a tiny spark of hope. Like maybe, just maybe, things could get better. It's faint, but it's there. I want to hold onto that feeling, even if it's hard.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm realizing that... maybe I'm stronger than I thought. I've been through so much, and I'm still here. Still fighting. It doesn't always feel like it, but maybe that counts for something. And talking about it like this... it's painful, but it also feels like... like I'm finally facing it head-on instead of running away.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant realization. How does it feel to acknowledge your strength?",
    "Client: It's... strange. Part of me wants to deny it, to say I'm weak for struggling so much. But another part feels a glimmer of pride. Like maybe I've underestimated myself all this time. It doesn't make the pain or fear go away, but it does make me feel... I don't know, less alone in it all? Like maybe I have the resources to get through this, even when it feels impossible.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful shift. What do you want to remember from this session?",
    "Client: I think... I want to remember that it's okay to feel all these complex emotions. That facing them doesn't make me weak, it makes me brave. And that even though the accident changed me, it doesn't define me. I'm still here, still me, even if I'm different now. And maybe, just maybe, I can find a way to be okay with that new version of myself.",
    "Therapist: That's beautiful. How are you feeling now compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: I feel... exhausted, honestly. But also a bit lighter. Like I've set down a heavy burden, even if just for a moment. The fear and sadness are still there, but they don't feel quite as overwhelming. There's this tiny sense of... I don't know, possibility? Like maybe healing isn't as impossible as I thought. It's scary, but also... kind of exciting.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful progress. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to explore more about how to deal with the flashbacks when they happen. And maybe talk more about rebuilding my relationships. I've been so isolated, and I'm starting to see how much that's affecting me. If that's okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll pick up there next session. Take care.",
    "Client: Thank you. This was hard, but... I think it was good. I'll try those breathing exercises and maybe call my sister. See you next time."
