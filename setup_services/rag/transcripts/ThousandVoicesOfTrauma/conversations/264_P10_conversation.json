    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to be diving into that day at the zoo, and just thinking about it makes my heart race a little.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm at the zoo with my niece. It's a bright, sunny day. We're walking towards the big cat enclosure. There are lots of people around, families with kids. I can hear excited chatter and... and the distant sounds of animals.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: We approach the tiger exhibit. My niece is so excited, tugging at my hand. I lift her up so she can see better. The tiger is... it's pacing back and forth. It looks agitated.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm starting to feel uneasy. Something doesn't feel right.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you?",
    "Client: Um, maybe a 30? I'm tense, but okay.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue. What do you notice?",
    "Client: There's a zookeeper entering the enclosure. He has a bucket, probably food. But the tiger... oh god, it's crouching low. I remember thinking, \"That doesn't look normal.\"",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What's happening in your body?",
    "Client: My... my heart is pounding. I'm holding my niece tighter. I want to shout a warning, but my voice is stuck.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The tiger... it... it lunges at the zookeeper. There's a horrible roar and... and screaming. So much screaming. I can't... I can't look away. The tiger's on top of the keeper, and there's... there's blood. Oh god, there's so much blood.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. Maybe 80? I feel like I'm there again.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing great. Keep breathing. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I turn away, covering my niece's eyes. People are panicking, running. I can hear the zookeeper's screams... they're getting weaker. I'm frozen, I can't move.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I... I should help. But I can't. I'm terrified. I feel so guilty, so helpless.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. You're safe now. Continue.",
    "Client: More zookeepers arrive. They're shouting, trying to distract the tiger. There's a loud bang - I think they tranquilized it. But the keeper on the ground... he's not moving. There's so much blood...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Sick. Shaky. I want to run, but I'm rooted to the spot.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're doing well. What happens after that?",
    "Client: Emergency services arrive. They're taking the zookeeper away on a stretcher. My niece is crying, and I'm... I'm just numb. I can't believe what I've seen.",
    "Therapist: And now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Shocked. Like the world isn't safe anymore.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down. Maybe 60 now?",
    "Therapist: Good. You're processing this well. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I take my niece home. I'm on autopilot. I can't stop replaying it in my head. The roar, the blood, the screams...",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What do you notice in your body?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking. I feel nauseous. I keep checking over my shoulder, like danger could come at any moment.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response to trauma. You're safe now. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I can't sleep that night. Every time I close my eyes, I see the tiger attacking. I feel so guilty for not doing anything, for exposing my niece to that...",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with these feelings?",
    "Client: I... I try to distract myself. I clean the house obsessively. I avoid the news, afraid I'll see something about it. I can't bear to talk about it with anyone.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. How are you feeling now, as you recall all this?",
    "Client: It's... it's still intense. But talking about it... it feels a little less overwhelming. Like I'm starting to process it.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe 40? It's coming down.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's continue. What happens in the days following?",
    "Client: I... I have nightmares. I wake up in cold sweats, hearing the tiger's roar. I'm jumpy during the day. Loud noises make me flinch. I... I can't bring myself to go near the zoo or even watch nature documentaries.",
    "Therapist: How does this affect your daily life?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. I feel on edge all the time. I'm overprotective of my niece, afraid to let her out of my sight. I... I start avoiding crowded places. What if something happens and I can't protect her?",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. Remember, you're working through this. Continue.",
    "Client: I... I start having panic attacks. The first one happens at work. Someone drops a stack of books, and suddenly I'm back there, hearing the tiger's roar. I can't breathe, I'm shaking...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. How do you handle these moments?",
    "Client: I... I try to remind myself I'm safe. I focus on my breathing, like you taught me. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I feel so out of control.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 30. Talking about it... it's helping.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's continue. How do your relationships change?",
    "Client: I... I withdraw. I cancel plans with friends. I'm afraid to explain why I'm so jumpy, so I just... I isolate myself. My husband, he tries to understand, but I can't put it into words.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Lonely. Frustrated. I want to be normal again, but I don't know how.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. You're working through it. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I start having intrusive thoughts. What if it had been my niece in that enclosure? What if I see something like that again? I can't shake the feeling that the world isn't safe anymore.",
    "Therapist: Those are normal thoughts after trauma. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's getting easier to talk about. My heart isn't racing as much. I feel... I feel like I'm starting to process it.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe 20 now? It still hurts, but it's not overwhelming anymore.",
    "Therapist: You've made great progress today. How do you feel about the session?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained, but also... lighter? Like I've started to lift some of the weight I've been carrying. It's still hard, but... but I feel like I can work through this.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful. You've done excellent work today. Let's end here and discuss some coping strategies for the week ahead."
