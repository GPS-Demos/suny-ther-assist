    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. That memory... it's so vivid. I can still hear the screams, you know? The sound of glass shattering. It's like I'm right back there, watching it all unfold again.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's this... this overwhelming sense of dread in the pit of my stomach. Like something terrible is about to happen, even though I know I'm safe here. My heart is pounding, and my palms are sweaty. It's like my body is preparing for danger that isn't really there.",
    "Therapist: How does this compare to when you first experienced the event?",
    "Client: It's... it's less intense now, I suppose. Back then, I felt completely paralyzed. Now, it's more like... like I'm watching it happen from a distance. I'm still scared, but I can breathe. I can think. It's not consuming me entirely like it used to.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"Why didn't I do something?\" I was just frozen there, watching. I should have helped, should have tried to stop it. And then I think about my wife... how she would have known what to do. She was always so brave. And then I feel this... this crushing guilt. Because I'm here, and she's not. It's not fair.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts make you feel physically?",
    "Client: There's this tightness in my chest, like someone's sitting on it. My shoulders are so tense they're almost up to my ears. And I feel... cold. Like all the warmth has been drained from my body. It's strange because I know it's warm in here, but I can't stop shivering.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about these sensations?",
    "Client: They're... they're familiar. It's like my body remembers even when my mind tries to forget. But... but they're not as overwhelming as they used to be. It's like... like I can observe them without being completely overtaken. Is that... is that progress?",
    "Therapist: What do you think?",
    "Client: I... I guess it is. A few months ago, I couldn't even think about that night without having a full-blown panic attack. Now, it's still hard, still painful, but... I can talk about it. I can remember without feeling like I'm right back there. It's like... like I'm starting to separate the memory from the present, if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: How does that feel, recognizing that change?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of things. There's relief, definitely. Hope, maybe? Like maybe I'm not going to feel this way forever. But there's also this... this weird sense of guilt. Like I'm betraying the memory of what happened by not being as affected by it. And sadness, because moving forward means... means leaving her behind in a way.",
    "Therapist: Can you elaborate on that feeling of leaving her behind?",
    "Client: It's... it's like every step I take towards healing is a step away from her. From us. Our life together. I know it's not rational, but part of me feels like holding onto the pain is the only way to keep her memory alive. If I'm not constantly grieving, constantly reliving that night, then... then am I forgetting her? Am I dishonoring what we had?",
    "Therapist: How might your wife view your progress?",
    "Client: (Long pause) She... she would want me to heal. To live. She was always pushing me to be better, to grow. She'd probably be frustrated with me for holding onto the pain for so long. (Chuckles softly) She'd tell me to get my act together, to honor her by living, not by suffering.",
    "Therapist: What does that realization mean for you?",
    "Client: It's... it's liberating, in a way. Like maybe I have permission to heal. To move forward. Not to forget, never to forget, but to... to carry her with me in a different way. To honor her by living the kind of life she'd want for me. It's scary, though. The idea of letting go of the pain... it's been a constant companion for so long.",
    "Therapist: How can you honor both your wife's memory and your own healing?",
    "Client: I... I think maybe by focusing on the good memories. By talking about her, sharing stories about our life together. Maybe... maybe I could volunteer at the community center where she used to work. Continue some of the projects she was passionate about. That way, I'm keeping her memory alive, but in a positive way. Not through pain, but through love and action.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea sit with you?",
    "Client: It feels... right. Like I can almost hear her voice encouraging me. There's still sadness, of course. I miss her every day. But there's also this... this spark of something. Hope, maybe? Or purpose? It's small, but it's there. For the first time in a long time, I feel like maybe there's a way forward that doesn't betray what we had.",
    "Therapist: What's your next step?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'll start by calling the community center. See if they need any help. And maybe... maybe I'll start going through our old photos. Not to dwell on what I've lost, but to remember the good times. To remind myself of the love we shared, and how that love can still guide me forward. It won't be easy, but... I think it's what she would want. What I need.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about our session today?",
    "Client: Exhausted, honestly. But... but also lighter, somehow. Like I've set down a heavy burden I've been carrying for too long. There's still a long way to go, I know that. But for the first time, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can do this. I can heal. I can live again. And that's... that's something. That's everything.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. We'll continue next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I'm actually looking forward to it. That's new. But good. Definitely good."
