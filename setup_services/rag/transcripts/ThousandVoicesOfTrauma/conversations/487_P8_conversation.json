    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. My heart's still racing a bit. It felt so real, like I was right back there in that hospital room, waiting for news about my condition. The beeping of the machines, the smell of disinfectant... it's all so vivid.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you now as you sit with those sensations?",
    "Client: It's a mix of things. There's this overwhelming sense of helplessness, you know? Like, I'm just lying there, and my life is in someone else's hands. I keep thinking about how everything could change in an instant. And then there's this... anger. Why did this have to happen to me? I was supposed to be finishing my degree, not stuck in a hospital bed.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How do those feelings of helplessness and anger show up in your body?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, like there's this weight pressing down on it. My hands are clammy, and I notice I'm clenching my jaw. It's like my body is bracing for bad news all over again. And there's this knot in my stomach that just won't go away.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are accompanying these physical sensations?",
    "Client: I keep hearing the doctor's voice in my head, telling me they found something concerning. And then my mind starts racing, thinking about all the worst-case scenarios. What if I don't recover? What if I can't finish school? Will I be a burden to my parents? It's like a never-ending loop of \"what ifs\" that I can't escape.",
    "Therapist: How does reliving this memory impact your view of yourself?",
    "Client: It... it makes me feel weak, honestly. Like I should be stronger, able to handle this better. But at the same time, there's a part of me that recognizes how scared that version of me was. I want to comfort her, tell her it's going to be okay, but I also feel frustrated with her for being so powerless.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about that internal conflict?",
    "Client: I guess... it's like I'm at war with myself. Part of me wants to be compassionate, to acknowledge how difficult that situation was. But another part is so angry and disappointed that I couldn't just... I don't know, will myself to be okay. It's exhausting, this back-and-forth.",
    "Therapist: How does this memory connect to your broader trauma experience?",
    "Client: It's like... this moment in the hospital became a turning point. Everything before feels like a different life, and everything after is colored by this experience. It's made me hyper-aware of my own mortality, and I feel like I'm constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop. Even small health issues now send me into a panic.",
    "Therapist: What's it like to share these reflections?",
    "Client: It's... oddly relieving, in a way. Like I'm finally giving voice to all these thoughts and feelings that have been swirling around in my head. But it's also scary. Saying it out loud makes it feel more real, you know? And there's a part of me that's worried you'll think I'm overreacting or being dramatic.",
    "Therapist: How does that fear of judgment affect you?",
    "Client: It makes me want to hold back, to downplay what I'm feeling. I've gotten so used to putting on a brave face for everyone else. My parents, my friends... they all want me to be okay, to move on. So I pretend I am, even when I'm not. But then I end up feeling isolated, like no one really understands what I'm going through.",
    "Therapist: What would it be like to let others see your true feelings?",
    "Client: Terrifying, honestly. I'm afraid they'd see how broken I feel inside. But... maybe also a relief? To not have to pretend all the time. I just... I don't want to burden anyone. They've all been through enough with my illness already.",
    "Therapist: How does carrying this burden alone impact you?",
    "Client: It's... it's exhausting. Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning, but I can't call for help. The depression makes it worse. There are days when just getting out of bed feels impossible, but I force myself to go through the motions. I'm so tired of pretending, but I don't know how to stop.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in those moments?",
    "Client: I... I think I need someone to just sit with me in the pain. To not try to fix it or make it better, but to just... be there. To tell me it's okay to not be okay. That this is hard, and it's normal to struggle. I need to feel like I'm not alone in this.",
    "Therapist: How might allowing yourself that support change things?",
    "Client: I suppose... it might make me feel less isolated. Maybe it would help me be kinder to myself, too. If others can accept me as I am, struggles and all, maybe I can start to accept myself. It's scary to think about being that vulnerable, but... maybe it's scarier to keep going like this.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you could take towards that?",
    "Client: I... I could try being more honest with my mom. Maybe tell her when I'm having a particularly rough day, instead of always saying I'm fine. It's a small thing, but it feels big, you know?",
    "Therapist: How does considering that step make you feel?",
    "Client: Nervous, definitely. But also... hopeful? Like maybe there's a way forward that doesn't involve constantly hiding parts of myself. It's a tiny glimmer, but it's there.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to remember from our session today?",
    "Client: I think... that it's okay to struggle with this. That what I went through was genuinely traumatic, and it's normal for it to still affect me. And maybe that I don't have to face all of this alone. That there might be people who can handle seeing the real me, even the messy parts.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful takeaway. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, but in a good way? Like I've released some of the pressure that's been building up. There's still a lot to work through, but I feel a bit lighter. Thank you for listening and... for helping me see things a bit differently.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. We'll continue next week?",
    "Client: Yes, I'd like that. Thank you again."
