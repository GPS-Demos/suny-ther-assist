    "Therapist: Good morning, Mrs. Chen. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Oh, hello Dr. Thompson. I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is... scared, I suppose. It's been so long since I've really talked about this.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to support you. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's... let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I'm in our living room. It's early morning, and the sun is just starting to peek through the curtains. I can smell coffee brewing in the kitchen. John always... he always made coffee before leaving for his shift at the base.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear a knock at the door. It's... it's not loud, but it echoes through the house. My heart... it starts racing. I know. I just know something's wrong.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 6. I can feel my hands shaking as I walk to the door.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I open the door, and there are two men in uniform. Their faces are... they're so serious. One of them asks, \"Mrs. Chen?\" and I... I can't speak. I just nod.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. It's hard to breathe. I... I want to close the door, to make them go away.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: They... they tell me there's been an incident. John's helicopter... it went down during a mission. They're still searching, but... but... (starts crying)",
    "Therapist: It's okay to cry. You're doing great. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. God, it hurts so much.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Can you describe what's happening around you?",
    "Client: I... I can't really focus. The room is spinning. I hear one of the officers say something about \"presumed dead,\" but it's like I'm underwater. Everything is muffled.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I stumble backwards. I feel my back hit the wall, and I slide down to the floor. I'm shaking all over. One of the officers kneels beside me, asking if I need water or... or someone to call.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, in this moment?",
    "Client: Numb. Just... numb. Like this can't be real. It has to be a mistake.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. What happens after that?",
    "Client: I... I don't know how long I sit there. Time doesn't make sense anymore. Eventually, I hear my daughter's voice. She must have come home from college... oh God, I had to tell her. How could I tell her?",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly difficult. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. I can feel the panic rising again.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here with me, and you're safe.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) Okay... okay. I... I remember standing up. My legs felt like jelly. I walked to the kitchen, where my daughter was. She took one look at my face and... and she knew. She just knew.",
    "Therapist: How did you handle that moment?",
    "Client: I... I tried to be strong for her. I hugged her tight, and we both cried. I kept saying, \"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry,\" over and over. As if it was my fault somehow.",
    "Therapist: It wasn't your fault. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I feel... guilty. Like I should have done something, even though I know that's not rational.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. Remember, you couldn't have prevented this.",
    "Client: I know, but... it's hard. The next few days were a blur. People coming and going, bringing food, offering condolences. I felt like I was sleepwalking through it all.",
    "Therapist: How did you cope during that time?",
    "Client: I... I didn't, really. I just went through the motions. Making arrangements, talking to the military officials. It was like I was watching someone else do these things.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 7. I feel drained, but... but also a little lighter, I think.",
    "Therapist: You're doing very well. Can you tell me about the memorial service?",
    "Client: It was... it was beautiful, in a way. So many people came. John was... he was loved by so many. There were flags everywhere, and his fellow soldiers spoke about his bravery and kindness.",
    "Therapist: How did you feel during the service?",
    "Client: Proud. Sad. Angry. All at once. I remember standing there, holding our daughter's hand, trying to be strong. But inside, I was screaming. It wasn't fair. He should have been there with us.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid emotions. What happened after the service?",
    "Client: We... we went home. The house felt so empty. I remember sitting in John's favorite chair, holding his jacket. It still smelled like him. I... I broke down then. Really broke down.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful moment. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 again. I can almost smell his cologne right now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here with me.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Thank you. I... I remember in the days after, I kept expecting him to walk through the door. To call and say it was all a mistake. I'd wake up in the middle of the night, reaching for him.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. How did you handle those moments?",
    "Client: Not well, at first. I'd cry myself back to sleep, or sometimes not sleep at all. I started avoiding our bedroom, sleeping on the couch instead.",
    "Therapist: How long did that go on?",
    "Client: Weeks. Maybe months. Time... time lost all meaning. I was just going through the motions, trying to be there for our daughter, but... but I was barely holding it together.",
    "Therapist: What helped you start to move forward?",
    "Client: I... I joined a support group for military widows. It helped to talk to others who understood. And my daughter... she was so strong. She encouraged me to see a therapist, to start taking care of myself again.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still hard. Some days are better than others. I miss him every day, but... but I'm learning to live with the grief. To honor his memory by living the life he'd want for me.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible resilience. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 5, I think. Talking about it... it hurts, but it also feels like I'm lifting a weight off my chest.",
    "Therapist: You've done an amazing job today. How do you feel about ending the session here?",
    "Client: I... I think that would be good. I feel drained, but... but also a little stronger. Thank you for listening.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Remember to practice self-care today. We'll process this more next time.",
    "Client: Okay. I will. Thank you again, Dr. Thompson.",
    "Therapist: Take care, Mrs. Chen. I'll see you next week."
