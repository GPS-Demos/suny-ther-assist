    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, I want you to describe the car accident in vivid detail, as if it's happening right now. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: I... I think so. My heart's already racing a bit, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember to use present tense. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 4 or 5.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath and begin when you're ready.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm sitting in my car, waiting at a red light. It's late, maybe around 11 PM. The streets are pretty empty. I'm... I'm feeling tired after a long day of studying. The light turns green, and I start to accelerate. As I'm crossing the intersection, I see... oh God, I see bright headlights coming from my left side. They're moving so fast. I barely have time to react. My heart is pounding. I try to swerve, but it's too late. The other car is coming straight at me. I hear the screeching of tires, and then... BANG! The impact is deafening. My body jerks violently to the side. The airbag explodes in my face. It hurts. Everything hurts. I can't breathe. The smell of burning rubber and something metallic fills my nose. I think... I think it's blood. My blood.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with it. What's happening now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm trapped. The door is crushed inward. I can feel something warm trickling down my face. My vision is blurry. I'm trying to move, but my leg is pinned. The pain is excruciating. I hear people shouting outside, but it sounds muffled, like I'm underwater. I'm so scared. I don't know if I'm going to die here.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's probably an 8. This is really intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember to breathe. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: I see shattered glass everywhere. The windshield is spider-webbed. My phone... I can see my phone on the passenger seat, but I can't reach it. The dashboard is caved in. I'm trying to call for help, but my voice is weak. I'm starting to feel lightheaded. The pain in my leg is getting worse. I can hear sirens in the distance. They sound like they're getting closer, but it feels like it's taking forever. Every second feels like an eternity.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about my family. What if I never see them again? I'm angry at myself for being so tired, for not seeing the other car sooner. I'm worried about what's going to happen to me. Will I be able to walk again? Will I be able to finish school? Everything I've worked for... it could all be gone in an instant. I feel so helpless, just waiting here, not knowing what's going to happen next.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's still high... maybe a 9. My heart is racing just talking about it.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm trying. It's just... it feels so real.",
    "Therapist: I know. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The sirens are getting louder now. I can see flashing lights through the cracked windshield. There are people outside the car now. I hear them talking, but I can't make out what they're saying. Someone's trying to open my door, but it won't budge. I'm starting to feel really cold. My whole body is shaking. I want to tell them I'm scared, but I can't seem to form the words. There's a firefighter at my window now. He's saying something to me, trying to keep me calm. I can see the worry in his eyes, and it's making me even more scared.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. It's hard to breathe. My hands are clammy, and I can feel my heart pounding in my ears. My leg... the pain is almost unbearable. I feel dizzy, like the world is spinning around me.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here in the room with me. You're safe. What's happening next?",
    "Client: They're... they're using some kind of tool to cut through the car. The noise is deafening. Sparks are flying everywhere. I'm terrified they might accidentally hurt me more. The firefighter is still talking to me, asking me questions. What's my name? How old am I? I'm trying to answer, but my voice is so weak. I just want this to be over. I want to go home. The pain is getting worse, and I'm starting to feel really sleepy. I'm fighting to stay awake, but it's so hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 10. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you survived this. You're here now, safe.",
    "Client: Right... right. I'm here. I'm safe. It's just... it feels so real.",
    "Therapist: I know. You're very brave for facing this. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: They've finally gotten the door open. There are paramedics all around me now. They're putting a neck brace on me, asking me where it hurts. Everywhere. It hurts everywhere. They're so gentle, but every movement sends shocks of pain through my body. I can hear them talking about my injuries, but I can't understand all the medical terms. They're preparing to move me onto a backboard. I'm terrified of how much it's going to hurt. One of the paramedics is holding my hand, telling me to squeeze if the pain gets too bad. As they lift me, I scream. The pain is excruciating. I'm being carried out of the car, and for the first time, I see the full extent of the accident. There are so many emergency vehicles, their lights painting everything in red and blue. I catch a glimpse of the other car. It's completely wrecked. I wonder if the other driver is okay. Guilt washes over me, even though I know it wasn't my fault.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm overwhelmed. My heart is racing, and I feel a bit nauseous.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel the chair supporting you.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm trying to calm down.",
    "Therapist: When you're ready, continue with what happened next.",
    "Client: They're loading me into the ambulance now. The inside is so bright, and there's a constant beeping from all the machines. The paramedic is hooking me up to an IV. I hate needles, but right now, I barely feel it compared to everything else. They're cutting away my clothes to check for more injuries. I feel so exposed, so vulnerable. The ambulance starts moving, and every bump in the road sends waves of pain through my body. I'm trying to stay awake, but it's getting harder. The paramedic keeps talking to me, asking me questions to keep me conscious. What's my mother's name? What school do I go to? But my thoughts are getting fuzzy. The world starts to fade around the edges. I'm so scared. I don't want to die. I have so much left to do. The last thing I remember is the paramedic yelling something about my blood pressure dropping. Then everything goes black.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaken up. My hands are trembling, and I feel drained. But... I also feel a sense of relief, like I've finally let it all out.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's come down to about a 7, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Let's take a few moments to do some deep breathing exercises.",
    "Client: Okay... that sounds good.",
    "Therapist: Inhale deeply through your nose for 4 counts, hold for 4, then exhale for 4. Ready?",
    "Client: Ready.",
    "Therapist: Good. Inhale... 2... 3... 4... Hold... 2... 3... 4... Exhale... 2... 3... 4...",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) That helps a bit.",
    "Therapist: Let's do it a few more times. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Better. Still a bit shaky, but more grounded.",
    "Therapist: That's great. You did an excellent job today. Is there anything else you'd like to share about the experience?",
    "Client: I... I didn't realize how much I was still holding onto. It's like I've been carrying this weight around, and now some of it has been lifted. It's still scary to think about, but... I feel like I can face it now.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step forward. How do you feel about continuing these sessions?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to. It's hard, but I can see how it might help in the long run.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. We'll continue to work through this at your pace. For now, let's focus on some self-care strategies for the rest of your day.",
    "Client: That sounds good. I think I'll need some time to process all of this.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Remember to be kind to yourself. You've done some challenging work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your support through all of this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll end our session here. Take care, and I'll see you next time."

As they lift me, I scream. The pain is excruciating. I'm being carried out of the car, and for the first time, I see the full extent of the accident. There are so many emergency vehicles, their lights painting everything in red and blue. I catch a glimpse of the other car. It's completely wrecked. I wonder if the other driver is okay. Guilt washes over me, even though I know it wasn't my fault.",

I hate needles, but right now, I barely feel it compared to everything else. They're cutting away my clothes to check for more injuries. I feel so exposed, so vulnerable. The ambulance starts moving, and every bump in the road sends waves of pain through my body. I'm trying to stay awake, but it's getting harder. The paramedic keeps talking to me, asking me questions to keep me conscious. What's my mother's name? What school do I go to? But my thoughts are getting fuzzy. The world starts to fade around the edges. I'm so scared. I don't want to die. I have so much left to do. The last thing I remember is the paramedic yelling something about my blood pressure dropping. Then everything goes black."
