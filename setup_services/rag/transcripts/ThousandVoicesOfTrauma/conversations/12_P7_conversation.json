    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and recall the cyberbullying incident. Describe what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm sitting at my desk, scrolling through my social media feed. My heart starts racing as I see a flood of hateful comments on my recent post. They're calling me names, saying I'm worthless, that I should... that I should kill myself. I feel my chest tightening, and my hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with that memory.",
    "Client: It's hard to breathe. I want to look away, but I can't stop reading. Each comment feels like a punch to the gut. I'm thinking about my brother who passed away last year. He always protected me from bullies when we were kids. Now he's gone, and I feel so alone and vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: That's it. Keep going. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I'm trembling now. I close the laptop, but the words are still echoing in my head. I feel so small, so insignificant. I wish I could call my brother, hear his voice telling me it'll be okay. But I can't. I'll never hear his voice again. The silence in my apartment is deafening.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Remember, you're here now, not there.",
    "Client: I curl up on my bed, hugging my knees to my chest. Tears are streaming down my face. I'm thinking about how my brother would react if he saw this happening to me. Would he be disappointed that I can't stand up for myself? I feel like I'm letting him down.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're not letting anyone down.",
    "Client: My phone keeps buzzing with notifications. Each sound makes me flinch. I'm scared to look, but I'm also scared not to. What if they're saying even worse things? What if they're spreading lies about me? I feel so powerless, so exposed. It's like everyone can see my vulnerabilities, and they're all laughing at me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: I'm shaking uncontrollably now. I can't stop crying. I'm remembering my brother's funeral, how lost I felt without him. Now I feel that same emptiness, that same overwhelming sense of loneliness. The cyberbullies' words are mixing with my grief, amplifying every insecurity I've ever had.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: I reach for my phone, desperate to talk to someone, anyone. But I stop. Who would understand? Who would believe me? I feel so isolated, like I'm trapped in a bubble of pain and fear. The room seems to be closing in on me. I can't breathe. I want to scream, but no sound comes out.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're here now, safe.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can continue. It's too much. The pain, the fear, the loneliness... it's overwhelming. I miss my brother so much. I need him now more than ever. Why did he have to leave me? Why am I the target of so much hate? What did I do to deserve this?",
    "Therapist: It's okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I'm trying to breathe, but it's so hard. My chest feels so tight. I keep seeing flashes of my brother's face, mixed with the cruel words from the cyberbullies. It's like a storm in my head, and I can't make it stop. I feel so weak, so helpless. Is this how I'm going to feel forever?",
    "Therapist: You're stronger than you think. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I think I need a moment. This is really intense. I can still feel the panic, the despair. It's like I'm right back there, reliving it all over again. But... but I'm also here, in this room with you. It's confusing. Part of me wants to run away, to hide, but another part knows I need to face this.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Take your time.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm focusing on my breathing. In and out. In and out. I'm remembering what you taught me about grounding techniques. I can feel the chair beneath me, the coolness of the air on my skin. I'm here, not there. The cyberbullying happened, but it's not happening right now. My brother is gone, but the love he had for me isn't. I'm not alone, even if it feels that way sometimes.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still painful, but I think I can continue. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Whenever you're ready.",
    "Client: Alright. So, after curling up on my bed for what felt like hours, I finally gathered the courage to look at my phone again. The notifications were still coming in, but slower now. I scrolled through some of the comments, trying to detach myself emotionally. It was hard, but I managed to report and block the worst offenders.",
    "Therapist: That's very brave. Well done.",
    "Client: I felt a tiny spark of empowerment doing that. It wasn't much, but it was something. I thought about what my brother would say. He'd probably tell me to stand up for myself, to not let them win. I opened up a document on my computer and started writing out my feelings. It was messy and raw, but it helped me process what was happening.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great resilience.",
    "Client: As I was writing, I realized that these bullies didn't really know me. They were attacking an idea of me, not the real me. It still hurt, but that thought gave me a little distance from the pain. I decided to reach out to a close friend, someone I trust. I was scared to be vulnerable, but I knew I needed support.",
    "Therapist: That was a wise decision.",
    "Client: My friend was amazing. They listened without judgment and reminded me of my worth. It didn't fix everything, but it helped. I felt less alone. I cried as I told them about missing my brother, how I wished he was here to help me through this. They reminded me that my brother's strength lives on in me.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this incredibly well.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard, and I know I have a long way to go. But I'm starting to see that I'm not as helpless as I felt in that moment. I can't control what others say or do, but I can control how I respond. I'm learning to value myself, to see my worth beyond what strangers on the internet think of me.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization.",
    "Client: It is. I know there will be tough days ahead, days when I'll doubt myself again. But I'm trying to hold onto this feeling, this understanding that I'm more than the cruel words of cyberbullies. My brother might be gone, but his love and strength are still with me. I'm carrying that forward, using it to face these challenges.",
    "Therapist: You've made incredible progress today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It means a lot to hear that. This process is difficult, but I'm starting to see its value. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. It's a common experience.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I think I'm ready to end for today. This was intense, but I feel like I've taken a step forward. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You did the hard work. Well done."
