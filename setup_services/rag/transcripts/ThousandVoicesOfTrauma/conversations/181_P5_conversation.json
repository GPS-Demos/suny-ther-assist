    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been thinking about it since our last session, and I'm not sure I'm ready for this.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... the idea of reliving that moment when I witnessed the violence. It was a racially motivated attack, and being European, I felt so helpless and shocked. I'm worried that going back to that memory will be too overwhelming. What if I can't handle it?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. Let's discuss the process.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm listening. But I'm still feeling quite apprehensive about this whole thing. It's been affecting my work, you know? Being self-employed, I can't afford to let these memories interfere with my productivity. And my family... they've been so supportive, but I don't want to burden them more with my issues.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Imaginal exposure helps process trauma memories. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: I get that it's supposed to help, but it's scary. The depression I've been dealing with already makes everything feel so heavy. And now, deliberately revisiting that traumatic event... it feels like I'm walking into a nightmare voluntarily. How can this possibly help?",
    "Therapist: It can reduce PTSD symptoms over time. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: I have so many questions. Will I be able to stop if it becomes too much? What if I have a panic attack during the session? And afterwards, how will I cope with any lingering effects? I'm worried about how this might impact my relationship with my husband and kids. They've already seen me struggle so much.",
    "Therapist: You can pause anytime. We'll practice coping skills. What else concerns you?",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I guess I'm also worried about how this might affect my cultural identity. Being European and witnessing racial violence... it's made me question a lot about society and my place in it. Will revisiting this memory make those feelings more intense? And how do I reconcile my feelings of guilt for not doing more during the incident?",
    "Therapist: We'll address those feelings. Your experiences are valid. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm still nervous, but I trust you. And I want to get better, for myself and my family. Can you just walk me through what exactly we'll be doing? And maybe remind me of some of those coping skills we've talked about before? I want to feel as prepared as possible.",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll start slowly. Remember deep breathing and grounding techniques.",
    "Client: Okay, deep breathing and grounding. I can do that. I've been practicing those at home, especially when I feel overwhelmed with work or when the memories start creeping in. It helps to know I have these tools. Is there anything else I should keep in mind as we start this process?",
    "Therapist: Trust the process. Your courage is admirable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Alright, I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Thank you for your patience and guidance. I know this won't be easy, but I'm committed to working through it. Let's do this."
