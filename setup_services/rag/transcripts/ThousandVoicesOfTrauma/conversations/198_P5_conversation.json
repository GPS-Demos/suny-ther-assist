    "Therapist: Let's discuss the imaginal exposure we'll be doing today. How are you feeling about it?",
    "Client: I'm honestly quite nervous. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of reliving that car accident... it makes my stomach churn. I've spent so long trying to avoid thinking about it, and now you're asking me to dive right in. It's scary.",
    "Therapist: Your nervousness is completely understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried that once I start talking about it, I won't be able to stop the flood of emotions. What if I completely fall apart? And... I'm afraid it might bring back the nightmares I used to have. I've finally gotten to a point where I can sleep through most nights, and I don't want to lose that progress.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How can I support you during this process?",
    "Client: I'm not sure... Maybe if you could remind me that I'm safe here? And perhaps we could have a signal if I need to stop? I just... I need to know I have some control over this. My anxiety is already starting to spike just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll use those strategies. Why do you think this exercise might be helpful?",
    "Client: I suppose... if I can face it here, in a safe environment, maybe it won't have such a strong hold on me in my daily life? It's like you've said before about avoiding things only making them scarier. But it's so hard to believe that when I'm feeling this anxious about it.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. What do you hope to gain from this experience?",
    "Client: I hope to feel... lighter, I guess. Like I'm not carrying this heavy secret around with me all the time. And maybe, just maybe, I can drive again without feeling like I'm going to have a panic attack. That would be amazing. But right now, it feels impossible.",
    "Therapist: Those are great goals. Shall we begin? Remember, you're in control here.",
    "Client: Okay... I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Can you walk me through what's going to happen one more time? Just so I feel prepared?",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll start slowly, and you can pause anytime. Ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm taking deep breaths like we practiced. It's helping a little. I just keep reminding myself that I'm here, in your office, not back in that moment. Okay... I'm ready. Let's do this."
