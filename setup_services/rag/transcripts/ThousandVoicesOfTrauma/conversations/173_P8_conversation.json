    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mrs. Thompson?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like I'm back there again, you know? I can still hear their taunts, those awful words they used to call me. \"Go back to where you came from,\" they'd say. I'm... I'm not even from anywhere else! I was born right here in this town. It's just... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What physical sensations are you noticing right now?",
    "Client: My hands are trembling a bit. And there's this tightness in my chest, like I can't quite catch my breath. It's... it's as if I'm that young girl again, cornered in the schoolyard. I feel so small and... and vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: I see. Can you tell me more about those feelings of vulnerability?",
    "Client: It's... it's like I'm exposed, you know? Like everyone can see right through me and they're all judging me. I feel... I feel ashamed, I guess. Ashamed that I couldn't stand up for myself back then. And... and angry too. Angry that I had to go through that, that no one helped me. It's... it's a lot.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"Why me?\" Why did they choose to pick on me? Was it just because I looked different? And then I start wondering... maybe there was something wrong with me. Maybe I deserved it somehow. I know that's not true, but... but the thought still creeps in. And then I feel guilty for even thinking that way. It's like... it's like a never-ending cycle in my head.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts and feelings compare to when you first started therapy?",
    "Client: Oh, it's... it's different now. Before, I couldn't even talk about it without breaking down completely. I'd just shut down, you know? But now, even though it's still painful, I can... I can actually put it into words. It's like... like I'm looking at it from a distance. It still hurts, but... but I'm not drowning in it anymore. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it does. What do you think has changed?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'm starting to understand that it wasn't my fault. That I was just a child, and those bullies... they were the ones with the problem, not me. It's still hard to fully believe that, but... but I'm getting there. And talking about it here, with you... it's helping me see it more clearly. It's like... like I'm finally giving that little girl a voice, you know?",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How does it feel to give her that voice?",
    "Client: It's... it's empowering, in a way. Scary too, because it brings up all these old feelings. But there's also this sense of... of relief? Like I'm finally letting go of a burden I've been carrying for so long. It's... it's bittersweet, I suppose. I wish I could go back and protect that little girl, tell her it's not her fault. But... but I guess in a way, that's what I'm doing now, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm noticing that... that even though remembering is painful, it doesn't have the same hold on me that it used to. It's like... like I'm stronger now. I can face these memories without feeling like they're going to swallow me whole. And there's this... this tiny spark of hope. Like maybe, just maybe, I can move past this. It's... it's a new feeling for me.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. How do you want to honor that progress?",
    "Client: I... I hadn't really thought about that. I suppose... I could start by being kinder to myself. Maybe... maybe write a letter to my younger self, telling her all the things I wish someone had told me back then. And... and perhaps I could look into volunteering at a local school, help kids who might be going through similar experiences. Turn this pain into something... something positive, you know?",
    "Therapist: Those sound like meaningful steps. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... I'm feeling drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've just run a marathon or something. There's this... this heaviness, but also a sense of accomplishment. And... and a little bit of pride, I think. Pride that I'm facing this head-on after all these years. It's... it's a mix of emotions, really. But overall, I think I feel... I feel hopeful. Yeah, hopeful. That's the word.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing so openly. We'll end here for today.",
    "Client: Thank you, doctor. This... this hasn't been easy, but I'm grateful for your guidance. I feel like I'm finally starting to see a light at the end of this very long tunnel. It's... it's a good feeling. I'm looking forward to our next session, even though I know it'll be challenging. But I think... I think I'm ready for it now."
