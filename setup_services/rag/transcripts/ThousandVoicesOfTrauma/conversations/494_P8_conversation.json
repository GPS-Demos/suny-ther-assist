    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's like my body is buzzing, but also heavy at the same time. The memory of that earthquake, it's so vivid now. I can still feel the ground shaking beneath my feet, hear the rumbling... It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's like... it's like I'm right back there, you know? My heart is racing, and I feel this tightness in my chest. I keep thinking about how powerless I felt, how I thought the whole building was going to come down on top of me.",
    "Therapist: I see. Where in your body do you feel that fear most intensely?",
    "Client: It's... it's in my stomach. Like a cold, heavy knot. And my hands are shaking a bit. I'm trying to take deep breaths, but it's hard. It's like my body is preparing for another quake, even though I know logically that I'm safe here.",
    "Therapist: Hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"What if it happens again?\" I know it's not rational, but I can't shake this feeling that I need to be prepared, that I need to be ready to run at any moment. And then there's this voice in my head saying, \"You're overreacting. It's been years. Get over it.\" But I can't seem to...",
    "Therapist: How do those conflicting thoughts make you feel?",
    "Client: Frustrated. Angry at myself. I mean, I survived, right? I should be grateful. But instead, I'm sitting here, years later, still shaking over a memory. It makes me feel weak, like I can't handle things. And then I feel guilty for feeling this way when so many others had it worse...",
    "Therapist: I hear you're being quite hard on yourself. How might you respond to a friend feeling this way?",
    "Client: I... I guess I'd be more understanding. I'd tell them it's okay to still be affected by it, that trauma doesn't just disappear. But it's so much harder to extend that same kindness to myself. I keep thinking I should be \"over it\" by now.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What do you think \"being over it\" would look like?",
    "Client: I suppose... not feeling this intense fear every time I think about it. Being able to talk about the earthquake without my body going into panic mode. Maybe even being able to help others who've been through similar experiences. But right now, it feels like I'm nowhere near that.",
    "Therapist: I see. What's one small step you could take towards that goal?",
    "Client: I... I guess continuing with these sessions is a step. And maybe... maybe I could try to be a little kinder to myself when these feelings come up. Not push them away so hard. It's just... it's scary to let myself feel all of this.",
    "Therapist: That's a brave insight. How does it feel to consider that?",
    "Client: It's... uncomfortable. But also a little relieving? Like, maybe I don't have to fight so hard all the time. Maybe it's okay to just... feel what I'm feeling sometimes. But then there's this part of me that's afraid if I let myself feel it, I'll get overwhelmed and never come out of it.",
    "Therapist: Mm. What might help you feel safe enough to sit with those feelings?",
    "Client: I'm not sure... Maybe reminding myself that I'm here, in this room, not back there. And... and knowing that you're here too, that I'm not alone in facing this. It's still scary, but... maybe a little less so.",
    "Therapist: That's a great observation. How else has support helped you?",
    "Client: Well, my housemates have been really understanding. There was a small tremor a few months ago, and I completely freaked out. But they didn't judge me. They just... sat with me, made me tea. It made me realize that maybe I don't have to go through this alone.",
    "Therapist: Mm. How does that realization impact your recovery journey?",
    "Client: It... it gives me hope, I think. Like, maybe I'm not as stuck as I thought I was. Maybe there are people who can understand, even if they haven't been through exactly what I have. It makes me feel less... isolated.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... a mix of things. There's still fear there, but also a bit of... I don't know, maybe determination? Like, maybe I can actually work through this. It won't be easy, but... maybe I'm stronger than I've been giving myself credit for.",
    "Therapist: Mm. How might you carry that strength forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I could start by talking to my housemates more about what I'm going through. And maybe... maybe look into some local support groups for trauma survivors. It's scary to think about, but also... kind of exciting? Like I'm taking some control back.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive direction. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired, honestly. But it's a different kind of tired than when we started. Less... heavy, I guess? Like I've put down a weight I didn't even realize I was carrying. I'm still anxious, but there's also this tiny spark of... I don't know, maybe hope?",
    "Therapist: Mm. That's a significant shift. What would you like to remember from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... that it's okay to feel what I'm feeling. That I don't have to fight it so hard. And that... that I'm not alone in this. There are people who want to help, and maybe... maybe it's okay to let them.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful takeaway. How would you like to close our session today?",
    "Client: I think... maybe with a deep breath? And just... sitting with this feeling of possibility for a moment. It's small, but it feels important.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's do that together."
