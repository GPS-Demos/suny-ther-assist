    "Therapist: Welcome, Priya. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this session all week. The idea of revisiting that car accident... it's making my stomach churn.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We'll take it slow.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate that. It's just... every time I think about it, I can feel my heart racing. I've been having trouble sleeping, too. The nightmares are getting worse.",
    "Therapist: I'm sorry you're struggling. Today, we'll try imaginal exposure.",
    "Client: Imaginal exposure? What exactly does that mean? It sounds a bit intimidating.",
    "Therapist: It's revisiting the trauma memory in a safe environment.",
    "Client: Oh, I see. But won't that make things worse? I'm already having such a hard time coping with the memories as it is.",
    "Therapist: It might be uncomfortable, but it helps reduce symptoms over time.",
    "Client: I understand, but I'm scared. What if I can't handle it? What if I have a panic attack right here in your office?",
    "Therapist: That's a valid concern. I'll be here to support you throughout.",
    "Client: Okay, that's reassuring. Can you tell me more about what to expect? Will I have to close my eyes? Will you be asking me questions?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the memory aloud. Eyes closed or open, your choice.",
    "Client: Alright, I think I can manage that. But what if I get overwhelmed? Can I stop if it becomes too much?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We can pause anytime you need.",
    "Client: That's good to know. I'm still nervous, but I think I'm ready to give it a try. How long will this part of the session last?",
    "Therapist: We'll start with about 30 minutes. How does that sound?",
    "Client: Thirty minutes feels like a long time, but I suppose it's necessary. I'll do my best. Is there anything I should do to prepare myself?",
    "Therapist: Just try to relax. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay, I'll try. It's just... this accident has affected me so much. I haven't driven since it happened. I'm scared to even be a passenger now.",
    "Therapist: That's common after trauma. This process will help you regain control.",
    "Client: I really hope so. I miss the independence of driving. It's impacting my work too, since I'm self-employed and need to travel to clients.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Just... please be patient with me if I struggle or need to stop, okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Your comfort is my priority. Let's start slowly."
