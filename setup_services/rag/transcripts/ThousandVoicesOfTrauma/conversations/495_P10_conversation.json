    "Therapist: Welcome, Margaret. How are you feeling about our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: Oh, I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. My arthritis is acting up, and I didn't sleep well last night. But I'm here, and I suppose that's what matters, right?",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is admirable. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10. Not too bad, but definitely feeling some tension.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Let's begin. Close your eyes and describe the night of the home invasion.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Alright... It's late, maybe around 11 PM. I'm in my bedroom, reading a book. The house is quiet, just the ticking of the old grandfather clock in the hallway. I'm feeling... content, I guess. Peaceful.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue in the present tense.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a crash from downstairs. My heart starts racing. I... I freeze, unsure if I really heard something or if it's just my imagination. Then I hear footsteps, heavy and unfamiliar. Oh God, someone's in the house.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest is tight, and my hands are shaking. I can feel sweat forming on my forehead. I'm... I'm terrified.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I want to call for help, but my phone is downstairs. I'm trapped. The footsteps are getting closer, coming up the stairs. I can hear things being knocked over, drawers being opened. They're ransacking my home.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 7. This is harder than I thought it would be.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Inhales shakily) Okay. I'm trying to be quiet, but my breathing is so loud. I'm sure they can hear me. The doorknob to my bedroom starts to turn. I'm paralyzed with fear. The door creaks open, and there's a man there. He's tall, wearing dark clothes and a mask. I can see his eyes, cold and calculating.",
    "Therapist: What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I scream. It's a primal sound, one I didn't know I could make. The man lunges forward, grabbing my arm. His grip is so tight, I think he might break it. I'm struggling, kicking, doing anything I can to get away.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What are you experiencing?",
    "Client: Pain in my arm where he's gripping me. The smell of sweat and something metallic. My heart is pounding so hard I think it might burst out of my chest. I'm crying, begging him not to hurt me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: He's yelling at me, asking where I keep my valuables. His voice is gruff, angry. I'm sobbing, trying to tell him about the safe in the closet. My mind is racing - will he kill me when he's done? What about my family? Will I ever see them again?",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. This is so vivid, it's like I'm there again.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: (Takes a few deep breaths) Okay... The man drags me to the closet, forcing me to open the safe. My hands are shaking so badly, I can barely turn the dial. He keeps threatening me, saying he'll hurt me if I don't hurry. I finally get it open, and he shoves me aside, grabbing everything inside.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Helpless. Violated. Like my whole world is crumbling around me. I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: He's stuffing everything into a bag. Jewelry, cash, even the old photos I kept in there. Suddenly, there's a noise downstairs - maybe a car passing by. He panics, pushes me onto the bed, and runs out. I hear his footsteps pounding down the stairs, then the sound of breaking glass. And then... silence.",
    "Therapist: And now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm frozen. I can't move. I can still feel his hands on me, smell his scent in the air. The house is so quiet, but my ears are ringing. I'm afraid to move, afraid he might come back. I just lie there, sobbing silently, feeling so alone and vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's still high... maybe an 8. My heart is racing just talking about it.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you survived this. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (Inhales deeply) Yes, I... I did survive. But in that moment, I felt so helpless. Like everything I'd built in my life could be taken away in an instant. The safety I thought I had... it was just an illusion.",
    "Therapist: Those are powerful realizations. How long do you stay there?",
    "Client: It feels like hours, but it's probably only about 30 minutes. Eventually, I find the courage to move. My whole body is sore and stiff. I stumble to the phone in the hallway, my hands shaking as I dial 911. The operator's voice seems so far away, like I'm underwater.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling as you make that call?",
    "Client: Relief, but also shame. I feel like I should have done more, fought harder. And I'm terrified that he might come back before the police arrive. Every little sound makes me jump.",
    "Therapist: It's common to feel that way. What happens when the police arrive?",
    "Client: They come quickly, sirens blaring. The sound both comforts and startles me. When they enter, I flinch away from them at first. Their uniforms, their authoritative presence... it's overwhelming. They ask me questions, but I'm having trouble focusing. Everything feels surreal, like a terrible dream I can't wake up from.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 6. Talking about the aftermath... it's easier than reliving the invasion itself.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Let's continue. What happens after the police leave?",
    "Client: They're gone, and I'm alone again. The house feels different now, alien and threatening. Every shadow seems menacing. I can't bear to go back to my bedroom, so I sit on the couch in the living room, hugging my knees to my chest. I leave all the lights on, but I still feel exposed.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep replaying the invasion, wondering if I could have done something differently. Should I have fought harder? Hidden better? And then I start thinking about all the things he took - not just the valuables, but my sense of security, my peace of mind. I feel... broken.",
    "Therapist: Those are very normal thoughts after such a traumatic experience. How do you cope in the immediate aftermath?",
    "Client: I... I don't sleep that night. Or the next. I call my daughter, and she comes to stay with me. But even with her there, I jump at every sound. I keep checking the locks, over and over. I feel like a stranger in my own home.",
    "Therapist: How does this experience change your daily life?",
    "Client: Everything changes. I can't sleep in my bedroom anymore - I move a bed into the guest room downstairs. I install an alarm system, but I still don't feel safe. I stop going out at night. I'm constantly looking over my shoulder, expecting danger around every corner. It's... it's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well describing this. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's about a 5. Talking about the long-term effects... it's sad, but not as immediately frightening as reliving the invasion itself.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start wrapping up. How do you see this event affecting you today?",
    "Client: It's... it's still with me. I've made progress, but I still struggle with trust, with feeling safe. Sometimes, I'll have a good day, and then a small thing - a loud noise, an unexpected visitor - will bring it all rushing back. But I'm here, talking about it. That's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You've shown incredible strength. Let's take a few deep breaths together to close out this session.",
    "Client: (Breathes deeply) Thank you. This was hard, but... I think it was important.",
    "Therapist: You did very well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, but also... maybe a little lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive sign. We'll end here for today. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Margaret. We'll continue working through this together."
