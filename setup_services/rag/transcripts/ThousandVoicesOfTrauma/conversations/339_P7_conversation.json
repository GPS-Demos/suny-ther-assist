    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure exercise. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the airplane crash scene?",
    "Client: Okay... I was at the airport, waiting for my flight. It was a sunny day, and I remember feeling excited about my trip. Suddenly, I heard a loud noise. When I looked out the window, I saw a plane coming in too low. It was wobbling... oh god, it was terrifying.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The plane hit the ground before the runway. There was a massive explosion, and flames erupted everywhere. People around me started screaming and running. I felt frozen, unable to move. The smell of smoke filled the air, and I could hear the sirens of emergency vehicles in the distance.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that memory. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I saw people running from the wreckage. Some were on fire. Others were helping injured passengers. It was chaos. I wanted to help, but I couldn't move. I felt so helpless and scared.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: The worst part was seeing a child... a little girl. She was crying, covered in blood, looking for her parents. I can still hear her screams. It haunts me. I should have done something to help her, but I just stood there, paralyzed.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: The next few hours were a blur. Emergency services arrived, and the area was cordoned off. I remember being interviewed by the police, but I couldn't stop shaking. I kept thinking about all those lives lost, the families torn apart. I've never felt so vulnerable and aware of how fragile life is.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... overwhelmed. My heart is racing, and I'm sweating. It's like I'm back there again. I can smell the smoke, hear the screams. It's so vivid.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I know, but it feels so real. After the crash, I couldn't fly for years. I still get anxious in airports or when I hear planes overhead. Sometimes, I wake up in the middle of the night, reliving that moment. It's affected my work, my relationships. I feel like I'm not the same person anymore.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to talk about this, but I want to get better. I'm tired of living in fear, of letting this experience control my life. But sometimes, I wonder if I'll ever truly move past it.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel drained, but also... a bit relieved. Talking about it is hard, but it feels like I'm facing it instead of running away. I'm still shaky, but I think I can continue.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Shall we continue?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. After the crash, I struggled with guilt. I kept thinking about that little girl, wondering if she survived, if her parents made it. I tried to find out, but there was so much confusion and conflicting information. Not knowing has been one of the hardest parts.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have those feelings.",
    "Client: I started having nightmares almost every night. In my dreams, I'm on the plane that crashes, or I'm watching it happen over and over again. Sometimes, I dream that I'm trying to save people, but I can never reach them in time. I wake up in a cold sweat, feeling helpless and terrified.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The crash changed how I view the world. I became hyper-vigilant, always looking for potential dangers. I stopped traveling, avoided crowded places, and pushed away friends and family. I felt like no one could understand what I was going through. It was isolating and lonely.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I started using alcohol to numb the pain and anxiety. It helped at first, but it quickly became a problem. I'd drink to fall asleep, to forget the images that haunted me. But it only made things worse in the long run. I lost my job, strained relationships with my family. That's when I realized I needed help.",
    "Therapist: Recognizing that was brave. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, somehow. Talking about it is painful, but it's also like releasing a burden I've been carrying for so long. I'm exhausted, but there's a small sense of hope. Maybe I can learn to live with this, to not let it control me anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's incredible progress. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in years, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this. I want to be able to fly again, to not panic every time I hear a plane. I want to be present in my life again, to rebuild relationships and find joy. It's scary, but I'm willing to keep working at it.",
    "Therapist: Your resilience is inspiring. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that's enough for today. I'm tired, but I feel... okay. Thank you for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone listen without judgment, to help me face these memories. I'm nervous about our next session, but also a bit excited. I feel like I'm finally moving forward.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellently today. We'll end here."
