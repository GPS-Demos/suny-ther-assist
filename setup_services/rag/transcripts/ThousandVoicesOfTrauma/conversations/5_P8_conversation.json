    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing but also blank at the same time. My heart's still pounding a bit. I can feel this tightness in my chest, you know? It's like... like I'm back there again, seeing my best friend's face after the accident. God, it's so vivid.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Guilt. Overwhelming guilt. I keep thinking, what if I had insisted we take a cab that night instead of him driving? Maybe he'd still be here. And then there's this... this anger. I'm angry at myself, at the world, at him for being so stubborn about driving. It's all mixed up with this deep, aching sadness. I miss him so much.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt manifest in your body?",
    "Client: It's like... it's like a heavy weight on my shoulders. My stomach feels knotted up. I can barely breathe sometimes when I think about it. And my hands... they're shaky. I keep clenching and unclenching them, trying to get rid of this restless energy.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep replaying that night over and over. The argument we had about who should drive, the screeching of tires, the... the impact. And then silence. So much silence. I think about how I couldn't save him, how I failed him as a friend. And then I think about all the things he'll never get to do, all the experiences we'll never share. It's like... like there's this gaping hole in my life now, and I don't know how to fill it.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when the event first happened?",
    "Client: It's... it's different now. At first, it was just shock, you know? Like I was numb. I couldn't process it. Now, it's like... like the pain is sharper, more defined. I'm more aware of the loss, of what it means for my life going forward. But also... I don't know, maybe there's a tiny bit more acceptance? Like, I can talk about it now without completely breaking down. That's progress, right?",
    "Therapist: Indeed. What's helping you cope with these feelings?",
    "Client: Honestly? These sessions help. Talking about it, facing it head-on... it's hard, but it feels like I'm doing something. And... and I've been trying to honor his memory, you know? I volunteer at the animal shelter he loved. It hurts, but it also feels right. Sometimes, when I'm there, I almost feel like he's with me.",
    "Therapist: How does volunteering impact your healing process?",
    "Client: It's... it's bittersweet. On one hand, it reminds me of him, which can be painful. But on the other, it feels like I'm keeping a part of him alive. It gives me a sense of purpose, you know? Like I'm doing something good in his name. And sometimes, when I'm playing with the dogs or cleaning the cages, I get these moments of... I don't know, peace? Like maybe, just maybe, things will be okay someday.",
    "Therapist: What else have you noticed about your coping strategies?",
    "Client: I've been trying to take better care of myself. I know I was... I was drinking a lot after it happened. Trying to numb the pain, I guess. But lately, I've been cutting back. It wasn't helping, just making everything worse. I'm trying to exercise more, eat better. Some days are harder than others, but... I'm trying. And I've been reaching out to our mutual friends more. We share memories, cry together sometimes. It hurts, but it also helps, you know?",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about your progress so far?",
    "Client: It's... it's complicated. Some days, I feel like I'm making real progress. Like I can see a future where the pain isn't so overwhelming. But other days, it feels like I'm right back at the beginning, drowning in grief and guilt. But I guess... I guess the good days are becoming a little more frequent? And even on the bad days, I'm learning to be kinder to myself. To recognize that healing isn't linear. It's hard, though. Really hard.",
    "Therapist: What's been the most challenging aspect of this process for you?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's accepting that life goes on. That the world keeps turning even though he's gone. Sometimes I feel guilty for having good moments, you know? Like I'm betraying his memory by not being sad all the time. And then there's the fear... the fear of forgetting. What if I forget the sound of his laugh? Or the way he'd scrunch up his nose when he was concentrating? It terrifies me.",
    "Therapist: How do you handle those moments of fear?",
    "Client: I... I try to remind myself that forgetting details doesn't mean forgetting him. I've started writing down memories, little things about him that I want to remember. And I talk to our friends, share stories. It helps, most of the time. But sometimes... sometimes it just makes me miss him more. It's like... like I'm constantly walking this tightrope between honoring his memory and learning to live without him.",
    "Therapist: What gives you hope in this journey?",
    "Client: Hope... that's a tough one. I guess... I guess seeing small improvements gives me hope. The fact that I can talk about him now without completely breaking down. The moments when I catch myself smiling at a memory instead of just feeling pain. And... and the thought that maybe, just maybe, I can live a life that would make him proud. Use this experience to be a better friend, a better person. It's not much, but it's something to hold onto.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea of making him proud influence your actions?",
    "Client: It... it pushes me to be better, I guess. To make choices he would approve of. Like, I'm taking my studies more seriously now. He always believed in me, even when I didn't believe in myself. And I'm trying to be there for our friends, the way he always was. It's hard sometimes, being the strong one, but... it feels right. Like I'm carrying on his legacy in a way. And it gives me a reason to keep going, you know? On the days when the grief feels overwhelming, I think about what he would want for me. It doesn't make the pain go away, but it helps me face it.",
    "Therapist: What have you learned about yourself through this process?",
    "Client: I've learned that I'm stronger than I thought. That I can face this pain and keep going. I've also learned how important it is to reach out for help, to not try to shoulder everything alone. And I've realized how much I took for granted before. How precious life is, how quickly it can change. It's made me more appreciative of the people in my life, more aware of the impact we have on each other. And... and I've learned that it's okay to not be okay sometimes. That healing isn't about erasing the pain, but learning to live with it.",
    "Therapist: How do you see these realizations shaping your future?",
    "Client: I think... I think they're changing how I approach life. I'm trying to be more present, more engaged. To really listen when people talk, to show them I care. And I'm thinking more about what I want my life to mean, you know? What kind of impact I want to have. It's like... like his death has made me more aware of my own life, if that makes sense. I don't want to waste it. I want to live in a way that honors him, that makes a difference. It's scary, and overwhelming sometimes, but it also feels... important. Like maybe something good can come from all this pain.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful perspective. How does it feel to reflect on this?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. There's still so much pain, so much grief. But there's also... I don't know, a glimmer of something else. Not hope, exactly, but maybe... possibility? Like maybe I can find a way to carry this loss with me without letting it define me. It's exhausting, though. All these emotions, all this thinking about life and death and meaning. Sometimes I just want to curl up and forget about everything. But I know that's not the answer. So I keep pushing forward, one day at a time. It's all I can do, right?",
    "Therapist: Indeed. We're nearing the end of our session. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained, honestly. Talking about all this, reliving those memories... it takes a lot out of me. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've unpacked some of the weight I've been carrying. It's still there, but it feels more manageable somehow. And I'm grateful, you know? For this space to process everything. It's hard, but I think it's helping. Slowly, but it's helping.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for your openness. We'll continue next week.",
    "Client: Yeah, thank you. I... I appreciate it. See you next week."

I've also learned how important it is to reach out for help, to not try to shoulder everything alone. And I've realized how much I took for granted before. How precious life is, how quickly it can change. It's made me more appreciative of the people in my life, more aware of the impact we have on each other.
