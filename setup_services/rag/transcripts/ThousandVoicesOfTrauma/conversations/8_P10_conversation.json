    "Therapist: Welcome, Mar\u00eda. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Gracias, Dr. Thompson. I'm... I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. My hands are a little shaky. I know we've been working towards this, but actually facing it... it's daunting.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do this before I lose my nerve.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see the sky first. It's so dark, almost green. The wind is picking up, and I can hear the trees creaking. I'm at home, in my kitchen. The radio is on, blaring warnings about the hurricane.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's happening around you?",
    "Client: My husband, Carlos, he's boarding up the windows. The sound of the hammer is so loud, competing with the wind. I'm trying to fill containers with water, but my hands are shaking. I keep spilling...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 40? It's uncomfortable, but I can handle it.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: The lights are flickering now. I can hear things hitting the house - branches, maybe? I'm scared. I want to call my daughter, but the cell signals are down. Oh God, what if something happens to her?",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. It's hard to breathe. I... I need a moment.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath with me. In... and out. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... okay. I'm back in the kitchen. The power's gone out now. It's so dark. Carlos is trying to light candles, but his hands are shaking too. We can hear the wind howling, it sounds like a monster trying to get in. I'm... I'm terrified.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Mar\u00eda. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 60. This is harder than I thought it would be.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Remember, you're here, safe in my office. Can you continue?",
    "Client: Yes, I... I can. The house is creaking now. We hear a loud crash from upstairs. Carlos wants to go check, but I'm begging him not to leave me. I'm clutching his arm so tightly. The wind is so loud, it's like a freight train. I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: There's water coming in under the door now. It's rising so fast. We're trying to move things up higher, but it's chaos. I slip and fall in the water. For a moment, I'm back in my childhood, when the older kids would hold me under in the pool. I can't breathe, I'm panicking...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Mar\u00eda. You're safe here. Can you ground yourself?",
    "Client: *gasping* I... I can feel the chair. I'm here. I'm safe. But God, it felt so real...",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 75 now. My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: Remember your coping strategies. Can you use one now?",
    "Client: Yes, I... I'm going to count my breaths. One... two... three... *deep breath* Okay, I'm feeling a bit calmer.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue with what happened next.",
    "Client: The water kept rising. We had to go upstairs. I was so worried about our photos, our memories. Carlos practically had to drag me up the stairs. We huddled in the bedroom, listening to the storm rage. I kept thinking about my daughter, about our neighbors. Were they okay? Would we survive this?",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling as you recall this?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. My hands are clammy. But I'm here, I'm safe. I can do this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: We spent hours in that room. The noise was deafening. At one point, part of the roof came off. Rain was pouring in. We tried to cover ourselves with a mattress. I was praying, begging for it to stop. I've never felt so helpless, so small.",
    "Therapist: You're describing it vividly. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 80. But I want to keep going.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a moment if you need to. Then continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *deep breath* The storm seemed to last forever. When it finally started to calm, we were afraid to move. The house was creaking and groaning. When we finally looked outside... Dios m\u00edo, it was like a war zone. Trees down everywhere, cars overturned. Our neighbor's house... half of it was just gone.",
    "Therapist: How did you feel seeing that?",
    "Client: Shocked. Numb. Grateful we were alive, but... guilty for feeling grateful when others had lost so much. We went downstairs, wading through the water. Everything was ruined - photos, furniture, everything. I remember picking up a photo of my daughter, the frame broken, the image warped by water. I just... I broke down.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm crying. But it feels... different. Like I'm letting something go.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal part of the process. Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually down to about 65 now. Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also a relief.",
    "Therapist: You're doing excellent work, Mar\u00eda. Do you want to continue?",
    "Client: Yes, I... I think I need to. The next few days were a blur. No power, limited water. We were trying to salvage what we could, but it felt hopeless. The streets were flooded, we couldn't leave. I was so worried about my daughter, about our future. Everything we'd worked for... gone.",
    "Therapist: How did you cope during those days?",
    "Client: I... I didn't, really. That's when I started drinking more. It was the only way I could sleep, to stop the thoughts racing through my head. Carlos was trying to be strong, but I could see the fear in his eyes too.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard to admit that. But I feel... lighter? Like I'm not carrying it alone anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's down to about 50 now. I'm tired, but... okay.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today, Mar\u00eda. How do you feel about the session?",
    "Client: It was tough, tougher than I expected. But... I feel like I've faced something I've been running from for a long time. Thank you for guiding me through this, Dr. Thompson.",
    "Therapist: You did all the hard work, Mar\u00eda. I'm proud of your courage today.",
    "Client: Gracias. I... I think I'm ready to start rebuilding, not just my home, but myself too.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. We'll continue working together on this journey.",
    "Client: I'm looking forward to it. For the first time in a while, I feel... hopeful.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful to hear. We'll end our session here. Take care of yourself this week.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again, Dr. Thompson. Until next time.",
    "Therapist: Take care, Mar\u00eda. I'll see you next week."
