    "Therapist: Welcome, Amara. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's begin. Close your eyes and describe the memory.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back at the compound. It's late at night, and I can hear chanting in the distance. The air feels heavy, and there's a sickly sweet smell of incense. I'm in my small room, sitting on the thin mattress on the floor. My heart is racing because I know what's coming.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 5. I'm anxious, but not overwhelmed yet.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue.",
    "Client: The door creaks open, and He walks in. The leader. He's wearing those ridiculous robes, but his eyes... they're so cold. He tells me it's time for my \"purification ritual.\" I want to scream, to run, but I can't move. My body feels frozen.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's going up. Maybe a 7? My palms are sweating, and I feel nauseous.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: He grabs my arm, his fingers digging into my skin. I can smell the alcohol on his breath. He starts dragging me out of the room, and I'm trying to resist, but I'm so weak from the fasting. My legs are shaking, and I stumble. He laughs, this horrible, mocking laugh. I feel so helpless, so ashamed.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: (voice trembling) It's... it's an 8 now. My chest feels tight, and I can barely breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Remember, this is a memory.",
    "Client: (taking a deep breath) Right. Okay. He pulls me into this dark room. There are candles everywhere, and other members are there, watching. They start chanting louder. He pushes me to the ground, and I can feel the cold stone against my skin. I'm shaking uncontrollably now. He raises his hand, holding something... I think it's a belt. I close my eyes, bracing for the pain...",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: (sobbing) It's... it's a 9. I can feel the pain, even now. It's like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Stay with it.",
    "Client: The first strike hits, and it's like fire across my back. I cry out, but no one helps. They just keep chanting. Strike after strike, and I'm begging him to stop, but he won't. He keeps saying it's for my own good, that I need to be cleansed. I feel so broken, so alone.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) It's still... still a 9. My back is burning, and I feel dizzy.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: Finally, it stops. I'm lying there, sobbing. Everyone leaves, and I'm alone in the dark. I can feel blood on my back, and everything hurts. But worse than the physical pain is the feeling of betrayal, of being so utterly alone and powerless.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down. Maybe an 8 now? I feel drained.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I don't know how long I lay there. Eventually, I drag myself back to my room. I curl up on my mattress, trying not to touch my back. I'm in so much pain, but I'm also angry. For the first time, I start to question everything they've told me. I realize I need to get out, somehow.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6, I think. I feel exhausted, but also... I don't know, maybe a little proud? Like I survived it.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant shift. Well done.",
    "Client: Yeah, it's like... remembering how I felt then, but also knowing I'm not there anymore. I got out. I survived.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. You're safe now. Let's end the exercise here. Open your eyes when you're ready.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay, I'm back. That was... intense.",
    "Therapist: You did incredibly well. How do you feel?",
    "Client: Drained, but also... lighter? Like I faced something I've been avoiding for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's often how it feels. We'll process this more next time. For now, let's focus on grounding yourself."
