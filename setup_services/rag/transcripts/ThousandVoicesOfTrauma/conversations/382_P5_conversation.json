    "Therapist: Mr. Johnson, today we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm not sure, to be honest. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of reliving those experiences... it's quite frightening. I've spent years trying to forget, you know? And now you're asking me to remember it all in detail. It's... well, it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Your hesitation is understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about losing control. What if I can't handle it? What if I break down completely? I've managed to keep it together all these years, but this feels like I'm opening Pandora's box. And at my age, is it really wise to stir up all these old memories?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How do you think revisiting might help?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe it could help me process what happened? I've noticed that even though I try not to think about it, the memories still affect me. Sometimes I have nightmares, or I get anxious in certain situations. If facing it head-on could reduce that, it might be worth trying. But I'm still scared.",
    "Therapist: That's a courageous perspective. Let's discuss what to expect.",
    "Client: Alright, I'm listening. But please, be gentle with me. I'm not as resilient as I used to be, and this anxiety... it's not helping matters. What exactly will we be doing?",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit the traumatic memory gradually, with my support throughout. Ready to hear more?",
    "Client: I suppose so. It's not like I have much choice if I want to get better, right? But please, go slowly. I'm already feeling my heart rate picking up just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll go at your pace. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Well, firstly, what if I panic? I mean, I've had anxiety attacks before, and they're terrifying. And secondly, will this make my nightmares worse? I'm already not sleeping well, and I'm worried this might exacerbate the problem.",
    "Therapist: We'll have grounding techniques ready. Nightmares may initially increase but often improve with time.",
    "Client: Grounding techniques? That sounds helpful. And I appreciate your honesty about the nightmares. It's a bit scary to think they might get worse before they get better, but I guess that's part of the process. Is there anything else I should be prepared for?",
    "Therapist: You might experience strong emotions. Remember, you're safe here. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It sounds challenging, but I think I can handle it with your support. I've been through a lot in my life, and while this feels different, I know I'm stronger than I sometimes give myself credit for. I just hope... I hope this really does help in the long run. It's hard to imagine feeling better after all these years.",
    "Therapist: Your strength is admirable. Shall we begin with a relaxation exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, please. That would be very helpful. I can feel the tension in my shoulders already. A relaxation exercise sounds like just what I need to calm my nerves before we dive into the harder stuff. How do we start?",
    "Therapist: Let's start with deep breathing. Follow my lead..."
