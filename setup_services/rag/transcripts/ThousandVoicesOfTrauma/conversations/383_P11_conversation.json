    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Patel?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Revisiting that memory of the police brutality incident... it brought back so many emotions I thought I had buried.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sounds, I think. The shouting, the sirens... it was like I was right back there. And the feeling of helplessness, you know? I kept thinking about how I couldn't protect my son from seeing all that violence.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. My heart was racing, and I felt this tightness in my chest. But, um, it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I mean, it was still difficult, but I didn't feel like I was completely losing control like I used to.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant observation. How do you make sense of that?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... maybe I'm starting to process it better? Or perhaps the techniques we've been practicing are helping. I don't know, it's hard to say.",
    "Therapist: What do you think this experience tells us about your progress?",
    "Client: I suppose it shows that I'm getting stronger, in a way. Before, I couldn't even think about that day without having a panic attack. Now, I can talk about it, albeit with difficulty. It's... it's a step forward, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: Indeed. How does this relate to your overall recovery goals?",
    "Client: I... I want to be able to support my son without being triggered by memories of that day. This feels like progress towards that. And maybe... maybe I'm starting to regain some control over how these memories affect me.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What strategies helped you during the exposure?",
    "Client: The breathing exercises really helped. And reminding myself that I'm safe now, that it's just a memory. Oh, and focusing on the present \u2013 the feeling of the chair, the sound of the clock ticking. It... it grounded me.",
    "Therapist: Excellent use of those techniques. How do you feel about continuing with the exposures?",
    "Client: It's still scary, to be honest. But I can see how it's helping. I want to keep going. I want to be able to talk about this without... without feeling like I'm going to fall apart. For my family's sake, and for mine.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is commendable. What support do you need moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need reassurance sometimes. That what I'm feeling is normal, that it's okay to struggle. And maybe some more strategies for when the anxiety gets really bad between sessions?",
    "Therapist: That's very insightful. We'll definitely address those needs. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For helping me through this. I know it's a long road, but for the first time in a while, I feel like there might be light at the end of it. It's... it's a good feeling.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work, Mr. Patel. We'll continue this journey together."
