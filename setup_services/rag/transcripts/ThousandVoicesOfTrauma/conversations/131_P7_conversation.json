    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Can you describe the natural disaster you experienced?",
    "Client: Okay... It was a hurricane. I was in my apartment when it hit. The wind was so loud, like a constant roar. I remember looking out the window and seeing trees bending sideways. It was terrifying.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Continue describing what you saw and felt.",
    "Client: The rain was coming down in sheets. I could barely see anything outside. Then I heard a loud crack, and a huge tree branch crashed onto the street below. I jumped back from the window, my heart racing. I felt so alone and scared.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure I can do this. It's bringing back all those emotions.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're handling it well.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Alright. As the storm intensified, the power went out. Everything was pitch black. I fumbled around for a flashlight, my hands shaking. I kept thinking, \"What if the building collapses? What if I don't survive this?\"",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job describing the experience. Keep going.",
    "Client: The wind was howling, and I could hear things hitting the building. Glass breaking somewhere. I huddled in my bathroom, clutching my phone, trying to get a signal. I felt so helpless, so small against the force of nature. Hours passed, and I was exhausted but too scared to sleep.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for facing these memories.",
    "Client: As dawn broke, the storm started to subside. I cautiously left the bathroom and looked out the window. The street was unrecognizable. Trees were down everywhere, cars overturned, debris scattered all around. It was like a war zone. I felt a mix of relief that I had survived and shock at the destruction.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, reliving this?",
    "Client: It's... intense. My heart is racing, and I feel a bit shaky. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I'm facing it instead of running from it.",
    "Therapist: That's a very insightful observation. You are facing it.",
    "Client: Yeah... I remember stepping outside later that day. The air was thick and humid, and there was this eerie silence. No birds, no traffic, just the occasional sound of emergency vehicles in the distance. I saw my neighbors for the first time in days. We were all in shock, surveying the damage. It was surreal, like being in a movie.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an incredible job describing the details. How does it feel to share this?",
    "Client: It's difficult, but also... relieving? I've never really talked about it in such detail before. I can still feel the fear and uncertainty, but it's not overwhelming me like it used to. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: That's a common and positive response. You're processing the experience.",
    "Client: I guess I am. The days after the hurricane were tough. No power, limited water, trying to clean up and salvage what we could. But there was also this sense of community. People helping each other, sharing resources. It made me realize how resilient humans can be in the face of disaster.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you feel about your own resilience?",
    "Client: I... I never really thought about it that way. I survived something terrifying. I got through it. Maybe I'm stronger than I give myself credit for.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent insight. Let's explore that further."
