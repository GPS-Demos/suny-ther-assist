    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Can you describe the workplace bullying incident?",
    "Client: Okay... It was about two years ago. I was in a meeting with my team, presenting a project I'd been working on for months. As I started speaking, I noticed my colleague, Mark, rolling his eyes and whispering to others. I tried to ignore it, but then he interrupted me, saying, \"Is this really necessary? We've heard this all before.\" I felt my face getting hot, and my hands started shaking...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I stumbled over my words, trying to continue. But Mark kept interjecting with snide comments, and I could see others smirking. I felt so small, like I was shrinking in my chair. My throat tightened, and I couldn't speak. I wanted to run out of the room, but I was frozen...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I can feel my heart racing now, just like it did then. The room felt so suffocating. I managed to finish somehow, but I was barely coherent. As soon as the meeting ended, I rushed to the bathroom and broke down crying. I felt so humiliated, so worthless...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: I can still hear Mark's condescending tone, see the smirks on my colleagues' faces. It's like it's happening all over again. I feel so angry and hurt. Why didn't anyone stand up for me? Why couldn't I stand up for myself?",
    "Therapist: You're processing these difficult memories. Keep going.",
    "Client: After that incident, I dreaded going to work every day. I'd have anxiety attacks before meetings, worried that it would happen again. I started doubting my abilities, second-guessing every decision. It affected my performance, my relationships... I felt like I was constantly on edge, waiting for the next attack.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Continue.",
    "Client: The worst part was feeling so alone. I didn't tell anyone at first, not even my husband. I was ashamed, thinking maybe I deserved it, that I wasn't good enough. It took me months to finally report it to HR, and even then, nothing substantial was done. They said it was just \"workplace conflict.\" I felt betrayed by the system I thought would protect me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking a bit. My palms are sweaty, and I feel a knot in my stomach. But it's not as overwhelming as before. Talking about it... it's hard, but I also feel a bit lighter. Like I'm finally acknowledging what happened instead of trying to push it away.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. You're very brave.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without breaking down completely. It still hurts, but... I think I'm starting to see that it wasn't my fault. I didn't deserve that treatment, no matter what. And maybe... maybe by facing this, I can start to heal and regain my confidence.",
    "Therapist: You're making excellent progress. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: I think I can go on. It's difficult, but I want to work through this. I'm tired of letting this experience control my life. I want to be able to go to work without fear, to trust my abilities again. It's a long road, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I might actually get there.",
    "Therapist: You're showing remarkable resilience. Let's continue.",
    "Client: Alright. After that incident, I started noticing other subtle forms of bullying. Mark would often \"forget\" to include me in important emails or meetings. He'd make backhanded compliments in front of others, like \"Oh, you actually did a good job this time.\" It was constant, wearing me down day by day. I started to dread every interaction, every ping of an email...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep describing what you experienced.",
    "Client: I remember one day, I overheard Mark talking to our manager, suggesting that I wasn't pulling my weight in the team. It was so unfair - I was working longer hours than anyone, trying desperately to prove my worth. But in that moment, hearing those words, I felt like all my efforts were worthless. I went home that night and cried for hours. My husband tried to comfort me, but I couldn't even explain what was wrong. I felt so ashamed and isolated...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The stress started affecting my health. I developed insomnia, constantly replaying these interactions in my head at night. I started getting frequent headaches, my appetite decreased. I lost weight, and people started noticing. But I couldn't bring myself to explain what was really going on. I felt like admitting it would make it more real, somehow...",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. My heart is racing, and I feel a bit nauseous. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a bit empowered? Like I'm finally confronting this instead of running from it. It's painful, but there's also a sense of release.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive perspective. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's strange, but talking about it like this, I'm starting to see how much it affected every aspect of my life. My relationships suffered because I was always on edge, my self-esteem plummeted. But I'm also realizing how strong I've been. Despite everything, I kept going. I didn't give up. Maybe I'm stronger than I thought...",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. How do you want to proceed?",
    "Client: I think... I want to keep going. It's difficult, but I feel like I'm finally starting to process all of this. I want to understand it better, to see it for what it really was - not my fault, but a form of abuse that I didn't deserve. I want to learn how to move past it, how to reclaim my confidence and my passion for my work. It's scary, but I'm ready to face it.",
    "Therapist: You're showing tremendous courage. Let's continue."
