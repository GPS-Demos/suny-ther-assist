    "Therapist: Alright, let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's begin. Close your eyes and recall the memory.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in the compound. It's early morning, and I can smell incense burning. The leader is gathering everyone for the daily meditation session. I... I don't want to go, but I know I have to.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 4. I'm feeling uneasy, but it's manageable.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue.",
    "Client: As I walk to the meditation hall, I see other members. They all look... vacant. Like they've lost themselves. I feel so alone, even though I'm surrounded by people. The leader starts speaking, and his voice... it's hypnotic. I can feel myself starting to dissociate.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. My heart is racing, and I feel a tightness in my chest.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Keep going, you're doing well.",
    "Client: The leader is talking about sacrifice and devotion. He's singling people out, praising some, shaming others. I'm terrified he'll call on me. My palms are sweating, and I feel dizzy. I... I want to run, but I can't move.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's an 8 now. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (inhales deeply) Okay... The session is ending, but the leader is asking for volunteers for a special assignment. I know these \"assignments\" are usually dangerous or degrading. I'm praying he doesn't pick me. I feel so helpless, so trapped.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's still at an 8. My whole body is tense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The leader's eyes are scanning the room. They land on me, and I feel like I'm going to pass out. But then he moves on, choosing someone else. I feel relieved, but also guilty. I know whatever happens to them is partly my fault for not speaking up.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's dropped to a 7. The immediate danger has passed, but I still feel awful.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. Continue.",
    "Client: As we file out of the hall, I catch a glimpse of the person who was chosen. They look terrified, but everyone else is acting like nothing's wrong. I feel sick to my stomach. I want to help, but I'm too scared. I hate myself for being such a coward.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Back up to an 8. The guilt is overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you were in a difficult situation. How does the memory end?",
    "Client: I go back to my room and cry silently into my pillow. I feel so trapped, so hopeless. I don't know how I'll ever escape this place.",
    "Therapist: And your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's a 7. I feel drained and sad, but also a bit relieved that it's over.",
    "Therapist: You did really well. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves."
