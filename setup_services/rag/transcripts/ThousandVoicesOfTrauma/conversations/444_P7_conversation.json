    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure exercise. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe what happened during your imprisonment?",
    "Client: Okay... I was captured during a routine patrol. It was supposed to be a simple mission, but everything went wrong so quickly. We were ambushed, and before I knew it, I was separated from my unit. I tried to fight back, but they overwhelmed me. They... they knocked me unconscious, and when I woke up, I was in a dark, damp cell.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The cell was tiny, barely enough room to lie down. The smell was awful - a mixture of sweat, urine, and something I couldn't identify. I was terrified. I kept thinking about my family, wondering if I'd ever see them again. The guards... they would come at random times. Sometimes they'd bring food, but other times...",
    "Therapist: It's okay. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Other times, they'd come for interrogations. They'd drag me out of the cell, blindfolded, to this room. I could hear screams from other prisoners. When they removed my blindfold, the bright lights would hurt my eyes. They'd ask me questions I couldn't answer, about troop movements and strategic plans. I kept telling them I didn't know anything, but they wouldn't believe me.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: They... they used various methods to try to make me talk. Sometimes it was sleep deprivation - they'd keep the lights on constantly and play loud noises. Other times, they'd withhold food and water. But the worst was when they'd use physical violence. I can still feel the sting of the lashes on my back, the ache in my joints from being hung by my wrists for hours. I tried to stay strong, to remember my training, but it was so hard...",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: Days blurred into weeks. I lost track of time. I started to hallucinate, seeing things that weren't there. I thought about my family constantly, wondering if they knew what had happened to me. The guilt was overwhelming - I felt like I had failed them, failed my unit. There were moments when I wished they'd just kill me and end it all.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have felt that way. You're doing great.",
    "Client: One day, I heard gunfire and explosions. At first, I thought it was just another hallucination, but then my cell door burst open. It was a rescue team. I was so weak and disoriented that I could barely stand. They had to carry me out. As we left, I saw the facility burning. Part of me felt relieved, but another part was... I don't know, almost sad? Like I was leaving a part of myself behind.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. You're safe now.",
    "Client: The journey back to base is mostly a blur. I remember being in a helicopter, then a hospital. Doctors and nurses were all around me, but I couldn't focus on what they were saying. I kept expecting to wake up back in that cell. It took weeks before I really believed I was free. But even now, years later, I still have nightmares. I still flinch at loud noises. Sometimes, I feel like I never really left that place.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I'm shaking a bit. My heart's racing. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've let out something I've been holding in for a long time. It's still painful to remember, but talking about it... it makes it feel more distant somehow. Less immediate.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. You did very well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I didn't think I could get through talking about all of that. It's always been so hard to put into words. But having you here, guiding me through it... it helped. I still feel anxious, but it's different now. Like I'm starting to see that these memories don't have to control me anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. We'll end here for today."
