    "Therapist: Welcome, Amira. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to do this, but another part is screaming to run away. It's like my body is tense, but my mind is all over the place.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 6? My hands are a bit shaky.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. When you're ready, describe the scene.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Alright... I'm... I'm back in Afghanistan. It's hot, so hot. The sun is beating down, and I can feel sweat trickling down my back. I'm on patrol with my unit near a small village. The air smells like dust and... something else. Something not right.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see... mud-brick houses, a few scraggly trees. There's a group of kids playing in the distance. But it's too quiet. Usually, there are more people, more... life. My grip tightens on my rifle.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: We're moving slowly, carefully. I'm scanning the area, my heart's starting to race. Then... then I hear it. A low growl. I spin around and... oh God... *voice shaking* there's a huge dog. Its teeth are bared, foam dripping from its mouth. It's... it's coming right at me!",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're doing great. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: *breathing heavily* Eight... maybe nine. I can almost feel its hot breath.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. What happens as the dog approaches?",
    "Client: I... I freeze. My training disappears. I can't move, can't think. The dog lunges, and I feel its teeth sink into my arm. The pain is... it's excruciating. I'm screaming, but it sounds far away, like it's not even me.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here in the office.",
    "Client: *takes a shaky breath* Okay... okay. I can hear my squadmates yelling, gunshots. The dog yelps and lets go, but I'm on the ground now. There's blood everywhere, my blood. I'm crying, shaking. Someone's putting pressure on my arm, it hurts so much.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: Terrified. Helpless. I thought I was trained for anything, but this... I feel like a scared little girl. I'm sobbing, begging for my mom. I'm so ashamed.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. Keep going.",
    "Client: Everything's a blur after that. I remember being lifted, the sound of a helicopter. The pain is making me dizzy. I keep fading in and out. I can hear people talking, but I can't understand them. I'm so cold, despite the heat. I think I'm going into shock.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: Still high... maybe an 8? My heart's pounding just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Take another deep breath and continue.",
    "Client: *breathes* I wake up in the hospital. The lights are so bright. My arm is bandaged, and there are tubes everywhere. A nurse is checking my vitals. I try to speak, but my throat is so dry. I'm scared, confused. I don't know how long I've been here or how bad it is.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: Heavy. Weak. My arm is throbbing, and I feel nauseous. But mostly, I feel... broken. Like I've let everyone down. I was supposed to be strong, but I couldn't even defend myself against a dog.",
    "Therapist: Those are tough feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: The doctor comes in. He's explaining something about rabies shots, potential nerve damage. I'm barely listening. All I can think about is how I'll never be the same. How can I go back out there? How can I face my team?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those emotions. What are you telling yourself?",
    "Client: That I'm weak. That I don't deserve to wear the uniform. That maybe I should have died instead of being such a burden. *voice breaking* I... I can't stop replaying it in my head. The growl, the teeth, the pain...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Amira. Remember, you survived. What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: *sniffles* Maybe a 7 now? Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also like releasing pressure.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Keep going. What happened after the hospital?",
    "Client: I was sent home. Physical therapy, psychological evaluations. It was... it was hell. The nightmares were constant. I'd wake up screaming, thinking the dog was there. I couldn't be around any dogs, even tiny ones. I felt so useless, so... broken.",
    "Therapist: How did others react to your return?",
    "Client: They tried to be supportive, but I could see the pity in their eyes. Some avoided me. Others treated me like I was made of glass. I hated it. I wanted to scream at them that I wasn't weak, but... maybe I was.",
    "Therapist: What do you think about that now?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Part of me still feels weak, but another part knows that surviving that... it took strength too. It's confusing. Sometimes I feel angry at myself, other times at the dog, sometimes at the whole situation.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: Maybe a 6? Talking about it... it's draining, but also kind of freeing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing very well. Let's continue.",
    "Client: The recovery was slow. So slow. Every day was a battle. Not just with my arm, but with my mind. I'd have flashbacks at the smallest things - a dog barking in the distance, the smell of antiseptic. I felt like I was constantly on edge, waiting for the next attack.",
    "Therapist: How did you cope with those feelings?",
    "Client: At first, badly. I isolated myself. Drank too much. Pushed away anyone who tried to help. But then... then I met this veteran at the VA. He'd been through something similar. He told me it was okay to not be okay. That hit me hard.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like an important moment.",
    "Client: It was. It... it gave me permission to feel what I was feeling. To stop pretending I was fine when I wasn't. I started opening up more in therapy, started actually doing the exercises they gave me.",
    "Therapist: How did that change things for you?",
    "Client: Slowly. So slowly. But... I started having more good days than bad. I could walk past a dog without having a panic attack. I could talk about what happened without breaking down. It wasn't perfect, still isn't, but... it got better.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: Maybe a 5? Talking about the recovery... it's bittersweet, but not as intense as before.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's start wrapping up. How do you feel about the incident now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still hard. I still have nightmares sometimes. I still flinch at unexpected noises. But I also feel... stronger, in a way? Like, if I could survive that, I can survive anything. It doesn't define me anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Last SUDS check?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 now. I feel... drained, but also lighter? Like I've set down a heavy backpack.",
    "Therapist: That's normal after an exposure session. Let's do some grounding exercises before we end.",
    "Client: Okay. *takes a deep breath* Thank you. This was hard, but... I think it was good.",
    "Therapist: You did excellent work today, Amira. We'll process this more next time."
