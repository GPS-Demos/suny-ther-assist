    "Therapist: Welcome, James. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to be talking about the animal attack today, and just thinking about it makes my heart race a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm at the edge of our camp. It's early morning, the sun's just coming up. The air is crisp, and there's a light mist hanging over the ground. I can smell the damp earth and... and a hint of smoke from last night's campfire.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm on patrol. My rifle's in my hands, and I'm scanning the treeline. Everything's quiet, too quiet. Then... then I hear it. A low growl coming from the bushes to my left.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Uh, about a 5... maybe 6.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: The growl gets louder, and I spin around. My heart's pounding in my chest. I can see... I can see these glowing eyes in the shadows. It's... it's a wolf. But it's huge, bigger than any wolf I've ever seen.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. My hands are shaking on my rifle. I want to run, but I know I can't turn my back on it.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, James. Keep going.",
    "Client: The wolf lunges at me. I try to bring my rifle up, but it's so fast. I feel its weight slam into my chest, knocking me to the ground. The impact... it knocks the wind out of me. I can smell its breath... it's hot and rancid.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe 9.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're doing great, James.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... okay. The wolf's jaws are snapping at my face. I'm using my rifle to keep it away, but it's so strong. I can feel its claws digging into my shoulders. The pain... it's intense, burning.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I manage to get my knee up between me and the wolf. With all my strength, I push it off. As it stumbles back, I finally get my rifle up and... and I fire. The sound is deafening in the early morning quiet.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: Adrenaline's pumping through me. My hands are shaking so bad I can barely hold the rifle. I'm gasping for air, and my shoulders are on fire where the wolf clawed me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I scramble to my feet, keeping my rifle trained on the wolf. It's lying there, not moving. Blood's seeping into the ground around it. I can't believe how big it is... its teeth... they're like knives.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I can't believe I survived. I'm thinking about how close I came to dying. And... and I feel guilty. It was just an animal, probably hungry. But I had to... I had to protect myself.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to process. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe a 7?",
    "Therapist: Good. Take another deep breath. You're doing well, James.",
    "Client: *exhales slowly* I'm standing there, just staring at the wolf. My whole body's shaking. I can hear shouting from the camp... my team must have heard the shot. But it sounds far away, like I'm underwater or something.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: It's... it's like I'm disconnected from it. I know I'm in pain, but it feels distant. My heart's still racing, and I'm covered in sweat. I feel cold, even though the sun's coming up.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those physical sensations. What happens as your team arrives?",
    "Client: They're... they're running towards me, weapons ready. I hear them shouting, asking if I'm okay. But I can't seem to answer. I'm just... frozen. Staring at the wolf.",
    "Therapist: What do you want to do in that moment?",
    "Client: I want to... I want to sit down. My legs feel weak. But I can't... can't seem to move. It's like I'm stuck in place, my rifle still pointed at the wolf.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction to intense stress. How does your team respond?",
    "Client: One of them... I think it's Rodriguez... he puts his hand on my shoulder. The touch... it snaps me out of it. Suddenly, all the sounds come rushing back. The pain hits me full force. I... I stumble, and Rodriguez catches me.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 6, I think.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, James. Can you describe what happens next?",
    "Client: They... they help me back to camp. The medic checks me out, cleans the claw marks. They're not as deep as they felt. Everyone's talking, asking questions, but I... I can't focus on what they're saying.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling emotionally at this point?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm all over the place. Relieved to be alive, but also scared. Angry at the wolf, but also... also sad. And I feel... I feel ashamed. Like I should have handled it better.",
    "Therapist: Those are all normal reactions, James. What happens as the day goes on?",
    "Client: I... I can't stop replaying it in my head. Every time I close my eyes, I see those glowing eyes in the bushes. I jump at every little sound. The guys... they try to joke about it, tell me I'm a badass for taking down a wolf. But it doesn't help.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Isolated. Like... like they don't understand. They weren't there, they didn't feel its breath on their face, its claws in their skin. I want to explain, but I... I don't have the words.",
    "Therapist: That's a heavy burden to carry. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about a 5.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, James. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you tell me three things you can see in this room right now?",
    "Client: Uh... I see the plant in the corner, your desk lamp, and... and the painting on the wall.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, two things you can hear?",
    "Client: I hear... the air conditioning humming and... traffic outside the window.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Lastly, one thing you can feel?",
    "Client: I can feel... the softness of the chair I'm sitting in.",
    "Therapist: Great job, James. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling a bit more present. Less caught up in the memory.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You've done excellent work today. How do you feel about the progress we've made?",
    "Client: It's... it's tough. Reliving it is hard, but... but I think it helps. It doesn't feel as overwhelming as it did before.",
    "Therapist: That's often the case. Exposure can be challenging, but it typically becomes easier with practice. Do you have any questions or concerns?",
    "Client: No, I... I think I'm okay. Just tired. It takes a lot out of me, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's completely normal. Remember to be kind to yourself for the rest of the day. You've done some hard work here.",
    "Client: Thanks, I'll try. Same time next week?",
    "Therapist: Yes, I'll see you then. Take care, James."
