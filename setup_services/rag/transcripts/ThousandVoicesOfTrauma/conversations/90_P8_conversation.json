    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mr. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken up, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit, and my hands are clammy. It's like I was right back there, you know? I could almost smell the musty air in my house that night. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: Well, I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. I'm an old man now, but even back then, I couldn't do anything to stop them. They just barged in, and I... I froze. I keep wondering if I could have done something differently. Maybe if I had been braver or stronger... But then I remember I'm not young anymore, and that makes me feel even more vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How does that vulnerability feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a heaviness in my chest. And my shoulders feel tense, like I'm trying to make myself smaller. I guess... I guess I'm still trying to hide, even though it's been years since it happened. It's funny, you know? I faced so much in my life - coming to this country, building a life, raising a family - but this... this broke something in me.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really difficult. What emotions are coming up for you?",
    "Client: Anger. A lot of anger. At those men who invaded my home, at myself for not being able to stop them, at the world for making me feel so... so damn powerless. But there's fear too. I hate admitting it, but I'm scared. Every little noise at night still makes me jump. And... and there's shame. I feel ashamed that at my age, after everything I've been through, I can still be reduced to this trembling old man by a memory.",
    "Therapist: You've been through a lot. How do these feelings compare to right after the incident?",
    "Client: Back then, it was all just... numb, you know? Like I was watching everything happen to someone else. But now, it's raw. It's like... like the scab's been ripped off, and everything's exposed. I didn't let myself feel much back then. Had to be strong for my wife, God rest her soul. But now... now it's all coming out, and I don't know how to handle it.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal part of the healing process. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to run away from all this, to go back to numbing it with the bottle. But I know that's not the answer. I guess... I guess I need to know that it's okay to feel this way. That I'm not weak for struggling with this. And maybe... maybe I need to know that there's still hope for an old man like me to find some peace.",
    "Therapist: There absolutely is hope. How can we work towards that peace?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to keep facing this. As hard as it is, I feel like I'm finally starting to process what happened. And maybe... maybe I need to start rebuilding my life. I've been so isolated since my wife passed and this happened. Perhaps it's time to reconnect with my children, my grandchildren. To remind myself that there's still good in the world, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive step. Anything else you'd like to share?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I think... I think it's necessary. I've spent so long running from this, drowning it in alcohol. But maybe, just maybe, by facing it head-on, I can start to reclaim some of what I lost that night. My sense of safety, my peace of mind... my dignity.",
    "Therapist: You're very welcome. How are you feeling now compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, to be honest. Emotionally drained. But there's also a strange sense of... I don't know, maybe relief? Like I've finally started to unpack this heavy burden I've been carrying around. I'm still scared, still angry, but it feels... manageable somehow. Like maybe I can face this after all.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to explore more about how to cope with these feelings when they come up outside of therapy. And maybe... maybe we could talk about how I can start rebuilding those connections with my family. I've pushed them away for so long, and I'm not sure how to bridge that gap.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Is there anything else before we wrap up?",
    "Client: No, I think... I think that's all for now. Thank you again, doctor. This isn't easy, but I'm starting to see that it might be worth it. I'm... I'm actually looking forward to our next session, as strange as that might sound.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. Take care, Mr. Johnson. I'll see you next week."
