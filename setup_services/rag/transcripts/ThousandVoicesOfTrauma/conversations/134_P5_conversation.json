    "Therapist: Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: I'm honestly quite nervous. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of reliving that car accident... it makes my heart race just thinking about it. I'm not sure I'm ready for this.",
    "Therapist: Your anxiety is understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried that talking about the accident in detail will bring back all those intense feelings of fear and helplessness. I've been trying so hard to avoid thinking about it, and now you're asking me to dive right in. It feels counterintuitive, you know? Plus, I'm concerned that it might affect my ability to drive or even be a passenger in a car afterward. I've only recently started feeling comfortable in vehicles again.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How do you think this exercise might help?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe it could help me process what happened? I've heard exposure can reduce anxiety over time. But it's hard to imagine how reliving such a traumatic event could be beneficial. Could you explain a bit more about how this is supposed to work?",
    "Therapist: Certainly. Imaginal exposure helps by...",
    "Client: (interrupting) Sorry, but before you continue, I just want to make sure - will you be there to support me if things get too intense? I'm worried about becoming overwhelmed or having a panic attack during the session.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'll be here throughout. What else might help you feel safe?",
    "Client: I think having some water nearby would be good, and maybe knowing that we can take breaks if needed. Also, is it okay if I bring a small comfort object? I have this keychain that's been a sort of talisman for me since the accident.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Those are excellent ideas. Anything else on your mind?",
    "Client: Yes, actually. I'm curious about what happens after the exposure. Will we have time to talk about it? And how might this affect me in the days following our session? I'm worried about potential nightmares or increased anxiety.",
    "Therapist: We'll definitely process the experience afterward. As for after effects...",
    "Client: (nodding) I see. That makes sense. I appreciate your thorough explanation. I'm still nervous, but I think I understand the purpose better now. It's about facing the memory head-on rather than letting it control me from the shadows, right? I'm willing to give it a try, even though it's scary. I want to get better, to move past this trauma and not let it dictate my life anymore.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. Your courage is commendable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: (taking a deep breath) Okay, yes. I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Let's do this. Just... please be patient with me if I struggle or need to pause. This is a big step for me."
