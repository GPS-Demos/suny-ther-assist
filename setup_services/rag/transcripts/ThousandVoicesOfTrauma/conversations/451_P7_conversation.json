    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the bullying incident?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in the school hallway. It's crowded, and I can smell the musty odor of old textbooks. I see a group of girls approaching me. They're whispering and giggling, looking at me. My heart starts racing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: They surround me, blocking my path. The leader, Sarah, starts taunting me about my accent. \"Hey, curry girl,\" she says, \"why don't you go back where you came from?\" The others laugh. I feel my face burning with shame and anger.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I want to disappear. I can feel tears welling up in my eyes, but I'm trying so hard not to cry. Sarah reaches out and tugs on my hijab, saying, \"What are you hiding under there?\" I flinch away, feeling violated and scared.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: I try to push past them, but they shove me back. I stumble and drop my books. The hallway goes quiet, and I can feel everyone staring. Sarah kicks my books, scattering papers everywhere. I'm on my knees, scrambling to pick everything up, and they're all laughing. I feel so small, so helpless.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can keep going. This memory, it's so vivid. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Can you continue?",
    "Client: I... I'll try. As I'm gathering my things, I hear a teacher's voice. The girls quickly disperse, but Sarah whispers, \"This isn't over, freak.\" I'm left there, kneeling on the floor, feeling utterly alone and terrified of what might come next.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. My heart is still pounding, and I can feel tension in my shoulders. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe relief? Like I've faced something I've been avoiding for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've done well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to revisit these memories, but I think it's helping. Sometimes I wonder, though, if I'll ever fully get over this. The fear of being targeted, of being seen as different... it still affects me today.",
    "Therapist: It's a process. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I guess so. It's just... sometimes I feel like that scared girl in the hallway all over again. Especially when I'm in new situations or around people I don't know well. I start to worry that they're judging me, that they see me as an outsider.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are valid. You're working through them.",
    "Client: You're right. I am working through them. And I suppose being able to talk about this memory without completely breaking down is progress. It's just... it's exhausting, you know? Constantly feeling like you have to prove you belong.",
    "Therapist: It is exhausting. You're showing great strength.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate that. I think what hurts the most is that this experience made me doubt myself, my worth. For a long time, I believed what they said about me - that I didn't belong, that I was a freak. It's taken a lot of work to start undoing that damage.",
    "Therapist: You're reclaiming your narrative. That's powerful.",
    "Client: I hadn't thought of it that way, but you're right. I am reclaiming my narrative. I'm not letting their words define me anymore. It's still a struggle sometimes, but I'm learning to see myself through my own eyes, not theirs.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, I think. Talking about this memory is still painful, but it doesn't have the same overwhelming power it used to. I feel like I'm starting to take control back. It's a good feeling, even if it's a bit scary too.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. Well done today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I know we're almost out of time, but I wanted to say that these sessions, as difficult as they are, are really helping. I'm starting to see a future where these memories don't control me anymore. It's still far off, but it feels possible now.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful progress. We'll continue next time.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you for your support today. I'm looking forward to our next session, even though I know it'll be challenging. But I feel like I'm finally moving forward, you know?",
    "Therapist: You are. Take care, and we'll talk next week."
