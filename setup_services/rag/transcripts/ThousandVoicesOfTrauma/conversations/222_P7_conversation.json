    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Can you describe the home invasion, starting from the moment you first realized something was wrong?",
    "Client: Okay... I was in my bedroom, studying for my finals. It was late, maybe around 11 PM. I heard a noise downstairs, like glass breaking. At first, I thought maybe my cat had knocked something over, but then I heard footsteps. Heavy footsteps. My heart started racing immediately.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what happened next.",
    "Client: I froze for a moment, not sure what to do. Then I heard more noise, like someone rummaging through drawers. I realized it wasn't my parents; they were out of town. I grabbed my phone and quietly locked my bedroom door. My hands were shaking so much I could barely dial 911.",
    "Therapist: That must have been terrifying. Keep going, you're safe here.",
    "Client: The 911 operator answered, and I whispered that someone had broken into my house. She told me to stay quiet and hide. I crawled under my bed, still clutching my phone. I could hear the intruder coming up the stairs. Each creak felt like it lasted forever. I was trying so hard not to make any noise, but my breathing felt so loud.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with that memory.",
    "Client: The footsteps stopped right outside my door. I held my breath. Then the doorknob rattled. I thought I was going to pass out from fear. The intruder started pounding on the door, and I heard a man's voice shouting, \"I know you're in there! Open up!\"",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I was shaking uncontrollably. The pounding got louder, and I heard wood splintering. I thought, \"This is it. I'm going to die.\" Then suddenly, there were sirens outside. The intruder must have heard them too because the pounding stopped. I heard running, then a crash downstairs.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this really well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I stayed under the bed, paralyzed with fear. I could hear voices downstairs, but I couldn't tell if it was the police or the intruder. Then there was a knock on my bedroom door, and a woman's voice said, \"Police! Is anyone in there?\" I was crying so hard I could barely speak, but I managed to call out.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job. How did you feel when you heard the police?",
    "Client: I felt... relief, but also still terrified. What if it wasn't really the police? What if the intruder was still in the house? I crawled out from under the bed, my legs felt like jelly. I opened the door, and there was a female officer there. She looked so concerned. That's when I just broke down completely.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those feelings. You're very brave for sharing this.",
    "Client: The officer helped me downstairs. There were police cars everywhere, lights flashing. They told me they'd caught the intruder trying to escape through the back door. I saw him in the police car as they took him away. He looked... so ordinary. Not like the monster I'd imagined. That somehow made it worse.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... shaky. My heart is racing again, just like that night. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like, I survived that, and I can survive talking about it too.",
    "Therapist: That's a very insightful observation. You are strong.",
    "Client: After that night, I couldn't stay in the house anymore. I moved back in with my parents. I still have nightmares sometimes. But they're less frequent now. I just... I hate that one person could make me feel so powerless in my own home.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to feel that way. You're making progress.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess I am. It's still hard though. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night, convinced I hear someone in the house. It takes me a while to calm down and realize it was just a dream or a normal house noise.",
    "Therapist: Those reactions are normal. You're coping well.",
    "Client: Thanks. I'm trying. It helps to talk about it, even though it's scary. I want to get to a point where I can live on my own again without constantly being afraid. Do you think that's possible?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're already showing great courage.",
    "Client: I hope so. Sometimes I feel guilty for being so affected by this when other people have been through worse. But then I try to remind myself that my feelings are valid too. It's just... it's a process, you know?",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are indeed valid. You're making excellent progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate that. I know I still have a long way to go, but being able to talk about it like this... it feels like a step in the right direction. Even if it's a small one.",
    "Therapist: Every step counts. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: I'm trying to be. It's not easy, but sessions like this help. I feel like I'm slowly reclaiming my life, you know? Like, the intruder took something from me that night, but I'm taking it back, bit by bit.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. You're doing great work.",
    "Client: Thanks. I think that's enough for today, though. I'm feeling pretty drained. Is it okay if we wrap up?",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've done excellent work today. Let's end here."
