    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, John?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. Going back to that cell, reliving those moments... it's intense. I can still feel the cold concrete under my feet, you know? And the smell... that musty, damp smell. It's like I was right back there.",
    "Therapist: What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The isolation, I think. The overwhelming sense of being cut off from everything and everyone. It's funny, I've lived alone before, but this was different. It was... suffocating. And the constant noise - the clanging of metal doors, shouting, it never stopped. But at the same time, it felt so quiet, like I was trapped in my own head.",
    "Therapist: How did your body react during the memory?",
    "Client: My heart was racing. I could feel my palms getting sweaty, and there was this tightness in my chest. It's like my body forgot it wasn't actually there anymore. I noticed I was clenching my jaw too, probably without even realizing it at first.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts went through your mind?",
    "Client: I kept thinking, \"How did I end up here?\" There was a lot of anger, both at myself and at the system. But mostly, I felt... small. Insignificant. Like I'd been reduced to just a number. And I couldn't stop wondering if I'd ever feel normal again, you know? If I'd ever shake off that feeling of being watched, of being controlled.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your day-to-day experiences now?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... I still struggle with feeling trapped sometimes. Even in my own home, I can get this sudden panic, like the walls are closing in. And loud noises still set me on edge. I've been avoiding crowded places too, which I guess is my way of trying to control my environment. It's affecting my work, my relationships... everything, really.",
    "Therapist: What progress do you notice?",
    "Client: Hmm... Well, I suppose I'm getting better at recognizing when I'm starting to spiral. And talking about it, like we're doing now - that would've been impossible before. It's still hard, but... I'm here, right? That's something.",
    "Therapist: Indeed. How do you feel about continuing with the exposures?",
    "Client: It's tough, I won't lie. Part of me wants to run away from all this. But... I also know that's not the answer. I want my life back, you know? So yeah, I'm scared, but I'm also... determined, I guess. If this is what it takes to move forward, then I'm willing to keep trying.",
    "Therapist: That's a courageous stance. What helps you stay committed?",
    "Client: I think... it's the small moments of peace I've started to experience. They're fleeting, but they're there. And my sister - she's been really supportive. Seeing how proud she is of me for doing this... it helps. Plus, I've started volunteering at a community garden. Being outside, working with my hands - it grounds me. Reminds me there's more to life than what happened in that cell.",
    "Therapist: How can we build on these positive elements?",
    "Client: I'm not sure... Maybe I could try to be more intentional about creating those peaceful moments? And perhaps... I could open up a bit more to my sister about what I'm going through here. It's hard, but I think it might help. As for the gardening, I've been thinking about starting a small herb garden at home. Something I can tend to daily, you know?",
    "Therapist: Those sound like great ideas. Shall we set some specific goals?",
    "Client: Yeah, let's do that. I think I need that structure, something concrete to work towards. It makes all of this feel a bit more... manageable, I suppose.",
    "Therapist: Alright. What's one goal you'd like to set for this week?"
