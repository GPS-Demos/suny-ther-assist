    "Therapist: Mr. Johnson, today we'll be starting imaginal exposure. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so, but I'm not entirely sure what that means. Can you explain it to me? I'm feeling a bit nervous about this whole process.",
    "Therapist: Of course. It's a technique to help process traumatic memories. How are you feeling about it?",
    "Client: Well, to be honest, I'm quite apprehensive. At my age, I've seen a lot, and the idea of revisiting painful memories isn't very appealing. Especially after losing my wife... it's all been rather overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Your feelings are valid. How do you think this might help?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. I've been struggling with nightmares and anxiety since... since I witnessed that terrible incident. And then losing Margaret... it's all jumbled up in my mind. I suppose if this could help me sleep better and feel less on edge, it might be worth trying. But I'm worried about feeling overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's a common concern. We'll go at your pace. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Well, what exactly will I need to do? And how will you support me through this? I'm not as resilient as I used to be, you know. These old bones have seen better days, and my mind... well, it's not as sharp as it once was.",
    "Therapist: You'll describe the traumatic event in detail. I'll guide you and provide support throughout. Shall we start?",
    "Client: I see. That does sound challenging. But I suppose if it might help, I should give it a try. You'll be here the whole time, right? And if it gets too much, can we stop? I'm just worried about losing control of my emotions. It's not something I'm used to, you see.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We can pause anytime. Your comfort is important. How else can I support you?",
    "Client: That's reassuring, thank you. I think just knowing that you're here and that we can stop if needed helps a lot. Maybe... could you remind me to breathe if I seem to be getting too worked up? Sometimes I forget, especially when I'm anxious. And perhaps, if it's not too much trouble, could you have a glass of water nearby? My throat tends to get dry when I'm nervous.",
    "Therapist: Of course. I'll remind you to breathe and have water ready. You're very brave for doing this.",
    "Client: Thank you, that means a lot. I don't feel very brave, to be honest. But I want to get better, for Margaret's sake if nothing else. She always encouraged me to take care of myself. I just wish she was here now... But I suppose that's partly why we're doing this, isn't it? To help me cope with everything that's happened.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. This process honors Margaret's memory too. Are you ready to begin now?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I am. It won't be easy, but I'm willing to try. For Margaret, for myself, and for the hope of finding some peace. I appreciate your patience with me, doctor. It's not easy being vulnerable at my age, but I feel safe here with you. Let's begin, and see where this journey takes us."
