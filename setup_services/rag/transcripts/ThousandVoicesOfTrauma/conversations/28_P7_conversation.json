    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Nassar. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I suppose. A bit nervous about revisiting these memories.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We're here to support you.",
    "Client: Thank you. I've been thinking about what we discussed last time, about my divorce. It's still so vivid, even after all these years.",
    "Therapist: You're ready to explore that memory?",
    "Client: I think so. It's just... it brings back so many painful emotions.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay. Well, I remember the day my ex-wife told me she wanted a divorce. It was a Tuesday evening. I had just come home from work, feeling exhausted after a long day at the office. I walked in, and I could sense something was off. The air felt heavy, you know? She was sitting at the kitchen table, her hands wrapped around a mug of tea that had long gone cold. She wouldn't look at me at first.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: I asked her what was wrong, and she just... she just burst into tears. I felt my heart racing, my palms getting sweaty. I knew something terrible was about to happen. She finally looked up at me and said, \"I can't do this anymore. I want a divorce.\" It felt like the floor dropped out from under me. I couldn't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling.",
    "Client: It's hard... I feel like I'm right back there. My chest is tightening...",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: I remember stumbling backwards, grabbing onto the counter for support. I kept asking \"Why? What did I do wrong?\" But she just shook her head and cried. I felt so... so helpless. So inadequate. All those years of being bullied as a kid came rushing back. That same feeling of not being good enough, of being rejected.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: I started to feel angry. I wanted to lash out, to blame her, to make her feel as hurt as I was feeling. But I couldn't. I just stood there, frozen. I remember the ticking of the clock on the wall, each second feeling like an eternity. The silence between us was deafening. I wanted to run, to hide, to wake up from this nightmare. But I couldn't move.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can keep going. It's too much.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. After what felt like hours, I finally managed to ask her why. She said we'd grown apart, that she didn't feel the same way anymore. But all I could hear was that I wasn't enough. That I'd failed. Just like when I was a kid, being taunted and excluded. I felt so small, so insignificant.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: I remember walking out of the kitchen in a daze. I went to our bedroom - soon to be just her bedroom - and started packing a bag. My hands were shaking so badly I could barely zip it up. I felt like I was having an out-of-body experience, watching myself fall apart from somewhere outside myself. When I came back downstairs with my bag, she was still at the table, crying silently. I wanted to comfort her, but I also wanted to scream at her. I did neither. I just... left.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Drained. Sad. Angry. It's all mixed up together. I can still feel the weight of that bag in my hand as I walked out the door. The cool night air on my face. The sound of the door closing behind me. It felt so final, like I was closing the door on my entire life.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions.",
    "Client: I drove to a hotel that night. I remember sitting on the edge of the bed, staring at the wall, feeling completely lost. I kept replaying every moment of our marriage in my head, trying to figure out where it all went wrong. How I could have missed the signs. It was like being bullied all over again, but this time by my own thoughts and memories.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this courageously.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's... it's hard to talk about. But I guess it's getting a little easier each time. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's a positive sign. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... maybe a little lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time. It still hurts, but it's not as sharp as it was before.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. We'll stop here for today.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone listen without judgment.",
