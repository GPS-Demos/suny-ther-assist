    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Johnson. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Oh, hello Dr. Thompson. I'm... well, I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I've been thinking about this all week, and I'm not sure I'm ready to dive back into those memories.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Can you rate your distress right now on a scale of 0 to 100?",
    "Client: I'd say... maybe a 40? My stomach's a bit knotted, but I'm here, aren't I?",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's begin when you're ready. Close your eyes and take us back to that day.",
    "Client: Alright... *deep breath* I'm... I'm on the boat. It's crowded, so crowded. The air is thick with sweat and fear. I can hear children crying, and the constant slosh of waves against the hull. It's dark, and I'm holding onto my granddaughter's hand so tightly. I'm afraid if I let go, I'll lose her in this sea of bodies.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see... faces. So many faces, all around me. Some look determined, others terrified. There's an old man next to me, his eyes are vacant, like he's already given up. I want to say something to him, but I don't know his language.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I can feel it pounding in my chest. My legs ache from standing for so long, and there's this constant swaying that makes me feel sick. I'm... I'm scared we might capsize at any moment.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's higher. Maybe 60? This feels so real.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *inhales shakily* Okay... There's a commotion near the front of the boat. People are shouting, pushing. I pull my granddaughter closer, trying to shield her. Someone yells that there's a leak, and I feel panic rising in my throat. I'm thinking of my son, who we left behind. Did we make a mistake? Should we have stayed?",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: The boat is tilting. Water is coming in fast. People are screaming now, real terror. I'm looking for something, anything to hold onto. My granddaughter is crying, and I'm trying to comfort her, but I'm terrified too. I keep thinking, \"This is it. This is how we die.\"",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. Take a moment if you need to. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. Maybe 80? I can feel my hands shaking.",
    "Therapist: Let's take a few deep breaths together. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: *breathes deeply* Okay... I'm... I'm still on the boat. The crew is trying to bail water, but it's not enough. Someone throws me a life jacket, but there aren't enough for everyone. I put it on my granddaughter instead. The guilt... it's overwhelming. I should have found a safer way, a legal way to leave. But we were so desperate...",
    "Therapist: You were in an impossible situation. What happens as the boat continues to take on water?",
    "Client: It's chaos. Pure chaos. People are jumping overboard, even though we're far from shore. I'm holding onto my granddaughter, trying to keep her calm, but I'm falling apart inside. I'm praying, begging any god who will listen to save us. The boat is listing badly now, and I know we have to jump. But I can't swim well, and I'm so afraid.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Stay with it. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I gather all my courage. I tell my granddaughter we have to jump. Her eyes are so wide, so trusting. I feel like I'm betraying that trust. We move to the edge of the boat. The water looks black and angry. I hold her tight and... we jump.",
    "Therapist: What do you experience as you hit the water?",
    "Client: It's so cold, it knocks the breath out of me. The salt stings my eyes, and for a moment, I lose my grip on my granddaughter. I'm thrashing, panicking, searching for her. The waves are tossing us around like ragdolls. I can hear people screaming all around me, but it sounds muffled underwater. I finally grab hold of her life jacket and pull her close.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. Take a moment. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 75? My heart is racing, but I'm here. I know I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're doing really well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *deep breath* We're in the water for what feels like hours. My arms and legs are burning from the effort of staying afloat. I keep thinking about sharks, about drowning, about failing my family. I see others from the boat, some floating, some... not moving at all. I try to keep my granddaughter's face turned away from the worst of it.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I see a light. At first, I think I'm hallucinating. But then I hear engines. It's a rescue boat. They're throwing out lines, pulling people in. I use the last of my strength to swim towards them, pushing my granddaughter ahead of me. Someone grabs her, pulls her in. I'm so relieved, but I'm also so tired. I can barely keep my head above water.",
    "Therapist: You're almost there. What happens as you reach the rescue boat?",
    "Client: They... they pull me in. I collapse on the deck, coughing up seawater. Someone wraps a blanket around me, and I'm shaking uncontrollably. I'm looking for my granddaughter, and when I see her, safe and being cared for, I start sobbing. It's relief, it's guilt, it's trauma all hitting me at once. I made it, but at what cost? So many others didn't.",
    "Therapist: You've been through so much. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. Emotionally and physically. But there's also this weight that feels a bit lighter. Like I've finally let some of it out.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. Can you give me a final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: I think... maybe a 50 now? It's lower, but I'm still shaken.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. You did very well today. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay... thank you. I... I didn't think I could do this, but I did.",
    "Therapist: You showed immense courage. How about we practice some deep breathing exercises?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I could use that right now.",
    "Therapist: Alright, let's begin. Inhale slowly through your nose...",
    "Client: *inhales deeply*",
    "Therapist: And exhale slowly through your mouth...",
    "Client: *exhales slowly* That does help a bit.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's continue this for a few more breaths."
