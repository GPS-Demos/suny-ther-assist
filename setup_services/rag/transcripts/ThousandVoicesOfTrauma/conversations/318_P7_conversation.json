    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about the earthquake again, and it's still hard for me.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Yeah, I know. It's just... every time I think about it, my heart starts racing. The earthquake happened right when Maria told me she wanted to break up. It's like the world was literally falling apart around me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Can you tell me more about that moment?",
    "Client: I was in my dorm room, talking to Maria on the phone. She was telling me she didn't think our relationship was working anymore. I was trying to process what she was saying when suddenly everything started shaking. The walls were creaking, and I could hear people screaming in the hallway. I froze, I couldn't move. Maria was still on the phone, asking if I was okay, but I couldn't answer.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that memory. You're safe now.",
    "Client: It's hard... I remember the sound of glass breaking somewhere nearby. My roommate's computer fell off the desk. I was gripping the edge of my bed, trying to stay upright. The shaking felt like it lasted forever, but I think it was only about a minute. When it finally stopped, I realized I was crying. Maria was still on the phone, sounding worried.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How did you feel in that moment?",
    "Client: I felt... overwhelmed. Terrified. Like everything was spinning out of control. The physical danger of the earthquake mixed with the emotional pain of Maria breaking up with me... it was too much. I couldn't distinguish between the two feelings. I remember thinking, \"Is this how the world ends?\"",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. Keep going.",
    "Client: After the shaking stopped, I stumbled out of my room. The hallway was chaos. People were crying, hugging each other. Some were trying to call their families but the cell networks were down. I felt so alone in that moment. Maria had hung up, probably to check on her own family. I didn't know what to do, where to go. I just stood there, shaking, as aftershocks kept coming.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. What happened next?",
    "Client: We all gathered in the common area. Someone had a battery-powered radio, and we listened to the news. The earthquake had been a big one, 7.8 magnitude. There was talk of buildings collapsed downtown, possible tsunamis. I kept thinking about Maria, wondering if she was safe, if her family was okay. But at the same time, I felt angry that she chose that moment to break up with me. It was all so confusing.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have mixed emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: The next few days were a blur. Classes were cancelled, and many students left campus to be with their families. I couldn't go home - my family is in another country. I felt so isolated. I tried calling Maria, but couldn't reach her. I was worried about her safety, but also dreading talking to her, knowing our relationship was over. The aftershocks kept coming, each one bringing back that feeling of helplessness and fear.",
    "Therapist: You're showing a lot of strength recalling this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still hard. My hands are sweaty, and my heart is racing a bit. But I think I'm okay. It's getting easier to talk about it, even though the memories are still vivid.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job. Let's take a deep breath together.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Yeah, that helps. You know, I've never really told anyone the full story like this before. It's always been bits and pieces. Talking about it all at once... it's intense, but I think it's good. It's like I'm finally seeing the whole picture instead of just fragments.",
    "Therapist: That's a great observation. How does seeing the whole picture feel?",
    "Client: It's... clarifying, I guess? Like, I can see now how the breakup and the earthquake got all tangled up in my mind. For a long time, I couldn't think about one without the other. But now, telling the story, I can see they were two separate events that just happened to occur at the same time. It doesn't make either one less painful, but it helps me understand my reactions better.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. Well done.",
    "Client: Thanks. I think... I think I'm starting to understand why I've been having such a hard time with relationships since then. It's like I've been waiting for the ground to shake every time I get close to someone. But that's not fair, is it? Not every relationship is going to end in a disaster - literal or figurative.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you feel about it?",
    "Client: It's a bit scary, to be honest. But also kind of liberating? Like, maybe I can start to separate my fear of earthquakes from my fear of getting hurt in relationships. They're not the same thing, even if they happened at the same time for me once.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent perspective. We're nearing the end of our session. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but in a good way? Like I've run a marathon or something. My heart isn't racing as much anymore, and I feel a bit lighter. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: It's very normal. You've done great work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think... I think I'm ready to end for today. This was tough, but I'm glad we did it. Can we talk more about this next time?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll continue next session. Take care, Carlos."
