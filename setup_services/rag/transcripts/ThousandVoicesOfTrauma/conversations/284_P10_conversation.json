    "Therapist: Welcome, Amir. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is dreading it. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 40. It's not overwhelming yet, but I can feel the tension building.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we're here to process this together. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Yes, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that night of the home invasion. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I'm in bed. It's dark, maybe around 2 AM. The house is quiet, eerily quiet. I can hear the faint ticking of the clock downstairs. My wife is sleeping next to me, her breathing slow and steady. I'm... I'm restless. Something doesn't feel right.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: There's a sound. A soft scraping noise from downstairs. At first, I think I'm imagining it, but then I hear it again. My heart starts racing. I sit up in bed, straining to listen. The noise is getting louder. Oh God, someone's in the house.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe 60? My palms are sweating just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I shake my wife awake. She's groggy, confused. I whisper urgently, \"Someone's in the house.\" Her eyes widen with fear. We can hear footsteps now, heavy and unfamiliar. My mind is racing. Should I confront them? Hide? Call the police? I feel... I feel paralyzed.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Right, okay. I... I reach for my phone on the nightstand. My hands are shaking so badly I can barely dial 911. The operator answers, but I'm whispering so quietly, afraid they'll hear me upstairs. I'm trying to explain, but the words aren't coming out right. And then... then I hear a crash downstairs. They're breaking things, ransacking the house. My wife is crying silently next to me. I feel so... so helpless.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 75. My heart is pounding just like it did that night.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Amir. Remember to stay in the present tense. What happens next?",
    "Client: The footsteps are coming up the stairs now. Slow, deliberate. I can hear them creaking. My wife and I are huddled together on the bed. I'm still on the phone, the operator is telling me police are on the way, but it feels like an eternity. The footsteps are in the hallway now. Closer... closer... I'm holding my breath. The doorknob starts to turn...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The door bursts open. There are two of them, dressed in black, faces covered. One has a crowbar. They see us and start yelling, demanding money, jewelry. My wife is sobbing. I try to speak, to tell them we'll give them whatever they want, but my voice is barely a whisper. They're so angry, so aggressive. I feel... I feel like a failure. I can't protect my family, my home. I'm just... frozen.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's at 85. I can feel my chest tightening.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor. You're here, you're safe.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm trying. It's just... it's so vivid.",
    "Therapist: I know. You're doing really well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: They're ransacking our room now. Drawers pulled out, clothes everywhere. My wife's jewelry box is emptied. They keep shouting, threatening us. I can smell their sweat, their aggression. It's suffocating. And then... then we hear sirens in the distance. The intruders panic. They grab what they can and run. We hear them thundering down the stairs, the front door slamming. And then... silence. Just the sound of my wife crying and my own ragged breathing.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaken. My SUDS is probably around 90. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: Take a few deep breaths. Remember, you survived this. You're here now.",
    "Client: Yes... yes, you're right. We did survive. But the aftermath... it was almost worse than the invasion itself.",
    "Therapist: Can you tell me more about that?",
    "Client: The police arrived, asked questions, took statements. But I felt... numb. Detached. Like I was watching everything happen to someone else. The next few days were a blur. We couldn't sleep. Every little noise made us jump. I kept replaying it in my mind, thinking of all the things I should have done differently. I felt like I had failed as a husband, as a protector.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 85. Talking about the aftermath brings up a lot of shame.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you did the best you could in a terrifying situation. How did you and your wife cope in the following weeks?",
    "Client: We... we struggled. We both had nightmares. I installed a new security system, but it didn't really help. We felt violated, unsafe in our own home. My wife wanted to move, but I... I felt like that would be admitting defeat. We argued about it. I started staying up all night, \"keeping watch.\" I was exhausted, irritable. Our relationship suffered. I felt like I was failing her all over again.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. My SUDS is probably around 75 now. Talking about it... it's painful, but there's also a sense of relief. Like I'm finally letting it out.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. You're processing a traumatic event. What happened next?",
    "Client: We... we eventually sought counseling. It was my wife's idea. I was resistant at first. I felt like I should be able to handle it on my own. But it helped. Slowly, we started to feel safer. We made changes to the house - better locks, security cameras. It took months, but we finally started sleeping through the night again. The nightmares became less frequent.",
    "Therapist: How did this experience change you?",
    "Client: It... it made me realize how vulnerable we all are. I became more cautious, more aware of my surroundings. But it also made me appreciate what I have. My wife, our home, our safety. I don't take those things for granted anymore. And in some ways, it brought us closer. We went through this terrible thing together, and we survived.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 60. Talking about how we overcame it... it helps.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Amir. How do you feel about the invasion now, looking back?",
    "Client: It's still painful to think about. There's still some fear, some anger. But there's also pride, I guess. Pride that we got through it, that we didn't let it destroy us. We're stronger now, in a way. More resilient. I just wish... I wish it hadn't taken something so terrible to teach us that.",
    "Therapist: Those are very insightful reflections. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. What do you notice in this room right now?",
    "Client: I... I can feel the chair beneath me. The light coming through the window. I can hear traffic outside. My breathing... it's slower now. More steady.",
    "Therapist: Good. And your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to about 40 now. I feel... tired, but also lighter somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's normal after processing such an intense memory. How do you feel about today's session?",
    "Client: It was hard. Harder than I expected. But also... helpful, I think. Talking through it like this, it makes it feel less overwhelming. Like I'm taking back some control.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent, Amir. You've done really well today. Remember to be kind to yourself this week. We'll continue working through this in our next session.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I appreciate your guidance through this. It's not easy, but I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
