    "Therapist: Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: I'm not sure, to be honest. What exactly does that mean? It sounds a bit intimidating.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel uncertain. Imaginal exposure involves revisiting your trauma memory in a safe space. What concerns do you have?",
    "Client: Well, I've spent so long trying to forget about my experiences in the cult. The physical abuse... it's not something I like to think about. I'm worried that talking about it might make everything worse. What if I can't handle it?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. This process can be challenging, but it's designed to help you process the trauma. How do you typically cope with difficult memories?",
    "Client: I usually try to distract myself. Sometimes I turn to alcohol, which I know isn't healthy. But when the memories come, they're so overwhelming. I feel like I'm right back there, powerless and afraid.",
    "Therapist: I understand. We'll work through this together. What questions do you have about the process?",
    "Client: How long will it take? And what exactly will I need to do? I'm worried about losing control or breaking down completely.",
    "Therapist: The session will last about 45 minutes. You'll describe your experience while I guide you. It's okay to feel emotional. How can I support you?",
    "Client: I think I might need frequent breaks. And maybe... could you remind me that I'm safe here? Sometimes I forget where I am when I think about the past.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We can take breaks, and I'll remind you of your safety. Your courage is admirable. How do you feel about starting?",
    "Client: I'm nervous, but I think I'm ready. I want to move past this, to not let the cult control my life anymore. It's been years, but sometimes it feels like I never left. I want to be free from that fear and pain.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is inspiring. Remember, this is a step towards healing. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do it. I trust you, and I'm going to try my best to get through this. I know it won't be easy, but I'm tired of living in fear. I want to reclaim my life and my peace of mind. I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: I'm here with you. Let's start by focusing on your breath. When you're ready, describe the memory."
