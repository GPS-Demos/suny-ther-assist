    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's a bit overwhelming. My heart's still racing, and I feel a bit shaky. The memories of fleeing my village as a child... they're so vivid now. I can almost smell the smoke from the burning houses.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's like I'm that scared little boy again, running through the jungle, not knowing if I'd ever see my parents again. My palms are sweaty, and there's this tightness in my chest.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. And what thoughts are accompanying that fear?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"I'm not safe. They're coming for me.\" It's irrational, I know. I'm here in this room, decades later, but part of me still feels like I need to hide or run.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. How does your body feel as you sit with these memories?",
    "Client: Tense. Very tense. My shoulders are up to my ears, and my jaw is clenched. I notice I'm gripping the armrests of the chair pretty hard too. It's like my body is ready to spring into action at any moment.",
    "Therapist: I see. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: There's a deep sadness too. For the life I lost, the childhood that was taken from me. I'm remembering the faces of my friends, my neighbors... some of them didn't make it out. It's... it's hard to bear sometimes.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to carry. How do these feelings compare to when you first came to therapy?",
    "Client: They're... they're actually less intense now. Before, I couldn't even talk about this without completely shutting down or having a panic attack. Now, it's still painful, but I feel like I can breathe through it. It's more... manageable, I guess?",
    "Therapist: That's progress. What helps you feel grounded in the present moment?",
    "Client: Focusing on my surroundings helps. The color of the walls, the texture of the chair I'm sitting on. And... and your presence, actually. Knowing that I'm not alone with these memories anymore. It's comforting.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad you feel supported. What else comes up for you?",
    "Client: There's a part of me that feels... I don't know... almost guilty? Like I shouldn't be talking about this, like it's betraying my culture or my family somehow. We were always taught to be strong, to not show weakness. Talking about these feelings... it goes against everything I was raised to believe.",
    "Therapist: How do you reconcile those beliefs with your healing process?",
    "Client: It's a struggle, honestly. But I'm starting to realize that talking about it, facing these memories... it takes a different kind of strength. It's not about forgetting or pretending it didn't happen. It's about acknowledging the pain and learning to live with it.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How does that realization make you feel?",
    "Client: Oddly enough, it makes me feel... proud? Like I'm honoring my experiences and those of my people by confronting this trauma. It's still scary, but there's a sense of... I don't know, maybe empowerment? Like I'm taking back control of my story.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant shift. What do you think has contributed to this change?",
    "Client: I think... well, these sessions for one. Having a safe space to explore these memories without judgment. And also, connecting with other refugees who've gone through similar experiences. It helps to know I'm not alone, that my reactions are normal given what I've been through.",
    "Therapist: Mm. How has this affected your daily life?",
    "Client: I've noticed I'm less jumpy, less prone to sudden outbursts of anger. I'm sleeping better too. The nightmares are less frequent. And I'm... I'm starting to enjoy things again. Simple things, like a walk in the park or a cup of coffee with a friend. It's like I'm slowly reclaiming parts of myself that I thought were lost forever.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful progress. What's been the most challenging part of this process for you?",
    "Client: The most challenging part... I think it's allowing myself to be vulnerable. To really feel the pain instead of pushing it away. There's always this fear that if I let myself feel it all, I'll be overwhelmed, that I won't be able to function. But I'm learning that it's okay to feel, that emotions, even the painful ones, come and go.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope when those intense emotions arise?",
    "Client: I try to use the grounding techniques we've practiced. Deep breathing, focusing on my senses. Sometimes I'll call a friend or go for a walk. And I remind myself that I've survived worse, that I'm stronger than I give myself credit for.",
    "Therapist: Those are great strategies. What gives you hope for the future?",
    "Client: The fact that I'm here, talking about this... that gives me hope. The progress I've made, however small it might seem sometimes. And the thought that maybe, by working through my own trauma, I can help others who've been through similar experiences. That idea... it gives my suffering some meaning, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful perspective. How do you see yourself moving forward?",
    "Client: I see myself continuing this work, facing my fears bit by bit. I want to build a life here, to fully embrace the opportunities I have now. Maybe even... maybe even share my story more widely someday, to raise awareness about refugee experiences. It's scary to think about, but also exciting.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a meaningful goal. How are you feeling now, compared to when we started?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, somehow. Still a bit shaky, but more grounded. Like I've set down a heavy burden, even if just for a moment. There's a calmness that wasn't there before. It's... it's a good feeling.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for creating this safe space. I know we have a long way to go, but for the first time in a long time, I feel like there's hope. Like maybe I can heal from this, and have a life that's not defined by my trauma.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your courage is inspiring. Shall we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that's good. Thank you again."
