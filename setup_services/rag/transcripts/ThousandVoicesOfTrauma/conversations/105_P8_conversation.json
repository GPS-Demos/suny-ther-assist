    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like my whole body is vibrating. The memories were so vivid, almost as if I was right back there in the middle of it all. I can still hear the explosions, smell the smoke... It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: It's a mix of emotions, really. There's fear, definitely. But also this deep sadness. I keep thinking about the faces of the people I saw, both civilians and fellow soldiers. Some of them didn't make it... And then there's this guilt. Why did I survive when others didn't? It doesn't feel fair.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How do these feelings manifest in your body?",
    "Client: My heart is racing, and my palms are sweaty. There's this tightness in my chest, like I can't get enough air. And my muscles are so tense, especially in my shoulders and jaw. It's like my body is still in fight-or-flight mode, even though I'm sitting here safe.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep replaying certain moments, wondering if I could have done something differently. Maybe if I had been faster, or more alert, I could have saved more lives. And then there's this voice in my head telling me I should be over this by now, that I'm weak for still being affected. But at the same time, I feel angry. Angry at the circumstances, at the people who put us there, at myself for not being able to just move on.",
    "Therapist: Those are powerful emotions. How do you think this experience connects to your broader trauma?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's all interconnected. The war experiences, the racial discrimination I faced both in the military and after coming home... It's like layers of trauma, you know? Each layer reinforces the others. The combat made me hypervigilant, always on edge. And then facing racism back home, it's like... it confirms that the world isn't safe, that I'm not valued. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly challenging. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much I've been avoiding these memories. It's like I've built this wall around them, and now that wall is crumbling. It's scary, but... there's also a small part of me that feels relieved. Like maybe by facing this, I can start to process it properly. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Can you tell me more about that feeling of relief?",
    "Client: It's like... for so long, I've been carrying this heavy weight. Pretending everything was fine, pushing these memories down. But now, talking about it, it's like I can finally acknowledge how much it affected me. It's painful, yeah, but there's also this sense that maybe I'm not crazy for feeling this way. That what I went through was real and significant.",
    "Therapist: How do you think this might impact your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I think... I think it might be a turning point. I've been stuck for so long, trapped between wanting to forget and needing to remember. But maybe by facing these memories head-on, I can start to make sense of them. It's terrifying, but also... hopeful? Like maybe I can learn to live with these experiences instead of being controlled by them.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I think I need a moment to just... breathe. To sit with these feelings without trying to push them away. And maybe... maybe I need to be a little kinder to myself. To recognize that healing isn't linear, and that it's okay to still be affected by what I've been through.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a compassionate approach. How can we support that?",
    "Client: I think... maybe we could work on some self-compassion exercises? And perhaps explore ways to ground myself when these memories and feelings become overwhelming. I want to learn how to sit with the discomfort without being consumed by it. And... I think I might be ready to start talking more about the racial trauma too. It's all connected, and I can't heal one part without addressing the other.",
    "Therapist: That's a thoughtful plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but also a bit lighter. Like I've taken a small step forward. It's scary, but I think I'm ready to keep going. Thank you for creating a safe space for me to explore all of this.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible courage today. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. I need some time to process everything we've talked about. But I'm grateful for this session. It feels like the start of something important.",
    "Therapist: I agree. Take care, and we'll continue next time."
