    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is buzzing, but my mind is... blank? No, not blank. Jumbled. Like a thousand thoughts are all trying to push their way forward at once.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. Can you describe any physical sensations you're noticing?",
    "Client: My hands are shaky. And there's this tightness in my chest, like I can't quite catch my breath. It's as if... as if I'm right back there, you know? In that moment. I can feel the fear creeping up my spine, just like it did then.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are coming up for you now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"Why didn't I fight back?\" It's stupid, I know. I was just a kid. But I can't shake this feeling that I should have done something, anything. And then I feel angry. So angry at him, at the world, at myself for still letting this affect me after all these years.",
    "Therapist: How do those thoughts make you feel?",
    "Client: Ashamed. Helpless. Like I'm that scared little boy all over again. But there's also this... I don't know... determination? Like part of me is screaming, \"Never again.\" It's confusing, these conflicting emotions all swirling around.",
    "Therapist: What do you make of those conflicting emotions?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe it shows I'm healing? Like, the part of me that feels strong and determined, that's the adult me. The me that's been through therapy, that's learned coping skills. But the scared, ashamed part... that's the child in me that's still hurting. It's like they're both there, fighting for control.",
    "Therapist: How does recognizing that feel?",
    "Client: It's... oddly comforting, actually. Like, yeah, I'm still hurting, but I'm also growing. It's not all or nothing. I can be both vulnerable and strong at the same time. And maybe... maybe that's okay?",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much this has affected my relationships. The trust issues, the fear of intimacy... it all stems from this. But I'm also seeing how far I've come. A year ago, I couldn't even talk about this without having a panic attack. Now, it's still hard, but... I'm doing it. I'm facing it.",
    "Therapist: How does that progress feel?",
    "Client: It's... empowering. Scary, but empowering. Like I'm taking back control, bit by bit. I used to feel like my past defined me, you know? Like I was just a victim. But now... now I'm starting to see myself as a survivor. Someone who's been through hell but is still standing.",
    "Therapist: What do you think has contributed to that shift?",
    "Client: These sessions, definitely. Facing the memories head-on instead of running from them. And... I think just time, and support. Learning that it wasn't my fault, that I'm not alone. It's been a long journey, but I'm starting to see light at the end of the tunnel.",
    "Therapist: How does this realization impact your view of the future?",
    "Client: It's... hopeful, I guess? For the first time in a long time, I'm actually looking forward to the future instead of dreading it. I mean, I know I still have a lot of work to do, but I feel like I'm on the right path. Like maybe, just maybe, I can have a normal life. Relationships, intimacy, all that stuff that seemed impossible before.",
    "Therapist: What does that \"normal life\" look like to you?",
    "Client: Wow, that's... that's a big question. I guess... being able to trust people. To let them in without constantly worrying they're going to hurt me. Maybe even finding a partner, someone I can be vulnerable with. And just... peace. Not having these memories and feelings dictate my every move. Being able to live in the present instead of constantly reliving the past.",
    "Therapist: How does imagining that future make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's bittersweet, honestly. There's hope there, definitely. But also a bit of sadness for all the years I've lost to this trauma. And fear, too. Like, what if I can't get there? What if I'm too broken? But mostly... mostly it feels like something to strive for. A goal to work towards, you know?",
    "Therapist: What small step could you take towards that goal?",
    "Client: I think... maybe trying to be more open with my flatmates? Nothing big, just... maybe sharing a bit more about my day, or how I'm feeling. Baby steps, right? And continuing with these sessions, of course. They're tough, but I can see now how much they're helping.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that plan?",
    "Client: It's scary, but... good scary, if that makes sense? Like, I'm nervous about opening up more, but I'm also excited about the possibility of deeper connections. And I'm proud of myself for even considering it. A few months ago, I wouldn't have even entertained the idea.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to delve more into how this trauma has affected my relationships. Maybe explore some strategies for building trust and intimacy. And... if I manage to open up a bit more to my flatmates, I'd like to discuss how that goes. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Is there anything else you'd like to add before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. I know I've said it before, but these sessions... they're changing my life. It's not easy, and sometimes I leave here feeling raw and exposed. But I also leave feeling stronger, more in control. So yeah, thank you for helping me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. I'll see you next week."
