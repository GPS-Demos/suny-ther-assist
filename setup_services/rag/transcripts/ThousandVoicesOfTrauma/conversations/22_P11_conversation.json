    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my emotions are all over the place. Going through that memory of my time in the cult... it brought up so much. I feel drained, but also kind of... I don't know, maybe relieved? It's confusing.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sense of isolation, I think. Remembering how cut off I felt from the outside world, from my family and friends. It was like being in this bubble where everything revolved around the cult's teachings. I can still feel that tightness in my chest when I think about it.",
    "Therapist: How does that tightness feel now?",
    "Client: It's there, but not as intense as it was during the exposure. It's like... a reminder, I guess? Of how trapped I felt back then. But now I can breathe through it. I'm not stuck there anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it relate to your recovery?",
    "Client: I think... it shows me how far I've come. I'm not that isolated person anymore. I have my partner, my studies, a life outside of those cult experiences. But sometimes, especially when I'm stressed about school, I can feel those old thought patterns creeping back in.",
    "Therapist: What helps when that happens?",
    "Client: Taking a step back, reminding myself that I'm not there anymore. Sometimes I call my partner or a friend, just to hear a friendly voice. It grounds me in the present. Oh, and the breathing exercises we've practiced \u2013 those help a lot too.",
    "Therapist: Excellent strategies. What else came up for you during the exposure?",
    "Client: The guilt. It hit me hard when I recalled how I pushed away people who tried to help me leave the cult. I was so convinced they were wrong and we were right. Now, looking back, I feel awful about it.",
    "Therapist: How do you handle those feelings of guilt now?",
    "Client: It's still tough. I try to remind myself that I was manipulated, that it wasn't really \"me\" making those decisions. But sometimes it's hard to believe that. I worry that I'm just making excuses for my behavior.",
    "Therapist: That's a common struggle. How might self-compassion play a role here?",
    "Client: Self-compassion... that's still a work in progress for me. I guess I could try to talk to myself like I would to a friend who went through the same thing. I wouldn't blame them, so maybe I shouldn't blame myself so harshly either.",
    "Therapist: That's a great approach. What else?",
    "Client: I noticed during the exposure that my depression symptoms felt more intense. Like, remembering how hopeless I felt in the cult brought back some of those same feelings. It's scary how easily they can resurface.",
    "Therapist: How do you differentiate between past and present emotions?",
    "Client: That's... that's a good question. I think I need to work on that more. Sometimes it all blends together. But I guess the key is remembering that I have options now that I didn't have then. I'm not trapped anymore.",
    "Therapist: Excellent insight. How do you feel about continuing with exposures?",
    "Client: It's tough, but I think it's helping. Each time, I feel like I understand myself a little better. And even though it brings up painful memories, I feel stronger afterward. Like I'm reclaiming parts of myself that the cult took away.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful perspective. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I guess. For guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm making progress. Sometimes it's two steps forward, one step back, but at least I'm moving forward.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work. We'll continue next session."
