    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Chen?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken up, to be honest. Reliving that earthquake... it's not easy. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel a little light-headed.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sounds. The rumbling of the earth, the crashing of objects falling... and the screams. I can still hear the screams of people in the hospital. I was there for a routine check-up, and suddenly everything was chaos. I remember thinking, \"This is it. This is how I die.\"",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. I felt helpless all over again. But... um, it wasn't as overwhelming as I thought it would be. I mean, it was still difficult, but I didn't feel like I was actually there this time. I knew I was here, in this room, even as I described it.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant observation. How does this compare to your usual reactions?",
    "Client: Well, usually when I think about it, I feel like I'm right back there. My chest tightens, I can't breathe, and I feel this overwhelming panic. But today, even though I felt anxious, it was... different. More manageable, I guess?",
    "Therapist: What do you make of that difference?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe it's because I knew what to expect this time? Or perhaps it's because I've been practicing those breathing exercises you taught me. It's like... I had a bit more control this time.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How might this relate to your recovery goals?",
    "Client: I suppose it means I'm getting better at managing my reactions. Maybe... maybe I won't always be at the mercy of these memories. It's a hopeful feeling, actually. I've been avoiding anything that reminds me of that day for so long, but if I can face it like this... well, maybe I can start living more fully again.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I realized something during the exposure. When I was describing helping that young mother find her child in the rubble... I felt a sense of... I don't know, purpose? Strength? In all my fear, I'd forgotten that I actually helped people that day. It's like I've only been focusing on the terror, but there was more to it than that.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization affect you?",
    "Client: It's... comforting, in a way. Like maybe I'm not just a victim of this trauma, but also someone who rose to the occasion. I've been so caught up in feeling weak and scared that I forgot I could be strong too.",
    "Therapist: That's a valuable perspective. How might you apply this moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I think I want to try reconnecting with some of the people I helped that day. I've been avoiding all reminders of the earthquake, including them. But maybe hearing their stories, seeing how they've moved on... it could help me too. Is that... is that a good idea?",
    "Therapist: It sounds like a thoughtful step. How do you feel about trying that?",
    "Client: Nervous, definitely. But also... excited? It's the first time I've felt excited about anything related to that day. I think I'm ready to try, even if it's difficult.",
    "Therapist: That's courageous. What support might you need?",
    "Client: I... I might need help finding them. And maybe... could we discuss it in our sessions? I think I'll need guidance on how to approach those conversations without triggering myself or them.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll work on that together. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... good. Like I've accomplished something important. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know we have more work to do, but for the first time in a long while, I feel hopeful about the future.",
    "Therapist: You've made significant progress today. We'll continue next session."
