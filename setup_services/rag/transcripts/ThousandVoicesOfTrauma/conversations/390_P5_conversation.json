    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. Today we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: I'm... not sure, to be honest. A bit nervous, I guess. I've been trying not to think about my time in combat for so long. The idea of deliberately going back there in my mind is scary.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about losing control. What if I get overwhelmed by the memories? Or what if I can't stop thinking about them afterward? I've worked so hard to keep these experiences locked away.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. Let me explain how we'll approach this together.",
    "Client: Okay, I'm listening. But I'm still not sure I can do this.",
    "Therapist: The goal is to process these memories safely. We'll go at your pace. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It sounds... okay, I guess. But what exactly will we be doing? And how will this help me?",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit a specific memory. You'll describe it in detail, in the present tense. This helps reduce its power over you.",
    "Client: That makes sense, but it still feels daunting. I've spent years trying to forget these experiences. The idea of voluntarily reliving them is... well, it's terrifying.",
    "Therapist: Your fear is normal. Remember, you're in control here. We can pause anytime.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. But what if I start panicking? Or if I can't handle it?",
    "Therapist: I'll be here to guide you. We have grounding techniques if needed. Your safety is my priority.",
    "Client: Okay, that helps. I trust you, but I'm still scared. Can you tell me more about what to expect during the session?",
    "Therapist: You might feel intense emotions or physical reactions. That's normal and will pass. We'll process it together afterward.",
    "Client: I appreciate your honesty. It's scary, but I understand why we're doing this. I want to get better, to not let these memories control my life anymore.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable, Sarah. This is a big step towards healing. Any other questions?",
    "Client: I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. But can we start with something small? Maybe not the worst memory right away?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll start where you're comfortable. Your bravery today is commendable.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm still nervous, but I feel a bit more prepared now. Let's do this."
