    "Therapist: Alright, Mar\u00eda. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and describe the earthquake.",
    "Client: Okay... I was in my dorm room, studying for finals. It was late afternoon, and suddenly everything started shaking. At first, I thought it was just a truck passing by, but then it got stronger. Books started falling off my shelves, and I could hear people screaming in the hallway. I... I froze. I didn't know what to do.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably a 5 out of 10. My heart is beating a little faster just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Continue.",
    "Client: The shaking got worse. I could hear glass breaking somewhere. I finally snapped out of it and tried to get under my desk, but I stumbled and hit my knee hard on the floor. The pain was sharp, but I was more scared of the building collapsing. I remember thinking, \"This is it. I'm going to die here.\"",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 7. My palms are sweaty, and I feel a bit dizzy.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The earthquake felt like it lasted forever, but it was probably only a minute or so. When it stopped, everything was eerily quiet for a moment. Then I heard people crying and shouting. I was shaking so badly I could barely stand up. When I finally got out of my room, the hallway was a mess. There was a girl, I didn't know her name, sitting against the wall, bleeding from her forehead. I wanted to help her, but I... I just walked past. I feel so ashamed about that now.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's an 8 now. My chest feels tight, and I'm having trouble breathing normally.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) Okay... As I was leaving the building, there was another aftershock. Not as strong, but it sent me into a panic. I ran outside, barefoot, not even thinking about what I was doing. The campus was chaos. People were crying, hugging each other. I saw a professor I knew trying to calm some students. I wanted to go to him, but I couldn't move. I just stood there, feeling so alone and scared.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's still an 8. My hands are shaking, and I feel like I might cry.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Let it out if you need to.",
    "Client: (Voice breaking) I... I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. How I couldn't even help that injured girl. I was so focused on my own fear that I ignored everyone else. What kind of person does that make me?",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 9. I feel overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe now. This is just a memory.",
    "Client: (Taking deep breaths) Right... safe. I'm safe now. It's just... it's hard to shake off that feeling of terror and guilt. After the earthquake, I couldn't sleep for weeks. Every little noise made me jump. I stopped going to classes, stopped talking to friends. I felt like I didn't deserve to be okay when others had it worse.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's coming down a bit... maybe a 7. I still feel shaky, but talking about it... it helps, somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Exhausted, honestly. But also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been holding onto for too long.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. Well done today, Mar\u00eda."
