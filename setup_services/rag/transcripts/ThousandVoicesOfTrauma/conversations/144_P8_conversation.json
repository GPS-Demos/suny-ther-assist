    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart's still racing, and I feel this tightness in my chest. The memories of the refugee camp, they're so vivid now. I can almost smell the damp air and hear the constant chatter and crying.",
    "Therapist: What's the most prominent emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I think. No, not just fear... terror. It's like I'm back there, waiting for something terrible to happen at any moment. I keep thinking about how helpless I felt, how I couldn't protect myself or anyone else.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. And where do you feel that terror in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's in my stomach. Like a cold, heavy stone. And my hands are shaking. I didn't even notice until now. It's strange, isn't it? How these memories can affect us so physically?",
    "Therapist: That's a very insightful observation. What thoughts are accompanying these physical sensations?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"I should have done more.\" Even though I know, logically, there wasn't much I could do as a child. But the guilt is overwhelming. I see the faces of other children, hungry and scared, and I wonder why I survived when others didn't.",
    "Therapist: How does this guilt relate to your experiences now?",
    "Client: I... I guess it's why I push myself so hard at work. Why I have trouble relaxing or enjoying things. There's always this voice in the back of my head saying I don't deserve happiness when others suffered so much. It's exhausting, really.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to curl up and hide, to forget everything. But another part feels... I don't know, maybe relieved? Like finally facing this might help somehow. It's confusing.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel confused. Can you tell me more about that sense of relief?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... for years, I've been carrying this weight, these memories, all alone. Talking about it, even though it's painful, feels like... like I'm not alone anymore. Like maybe I don't have to bear this burden by myself. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How does sharing this experience impact your feelings of isolation?",
    "Client: It's... it's oddly comforting. For so long, I've felt different, set apart because of what I've been through. But talking about it, having someone listen and understand... it makes me feel more connected. Like maybe I'm not as alone as I thought.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm noticing that as we talk, the physical sensations are changing. The tightness in my chest is easing a bit. I'm still shaky, but not as much. And there's this... warmth in my chest. Is that hope? I'm not sure I recognize it.",
    "Therapist: Hope can feel unfamiliar after trauma. How does this potential hope sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... scary, actually. Hope feels dangerous, like I'm setting myself up for disappointment. But at the same time, it's... nice. Like maybe there's a possibility that things can get better, that I can heal from this.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to allow yourself to feel that hope?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It would mean being vulnerable, I guess. Letting go of some of the control I've held onto so tightly. But maybe... maybe it would also mean giving myself a chance at a fuller life? One where I'm not constantly haunted by the past?",
    "Therapist: How does that idea resonate with you?",
    "Client: It's both terrifying and exciting. Part of me wants to run from it, to stick with what I know, even if it's painful. But another part... another part is so tired of living this way. Of feeling stuck and alone. Maybe... maybe it's time to try something different?",
    "Therapist: What would that \"something different\" look like for you?",
    "Client: I'm not entirely sure. Maybe... maybe it would mean being kinder to myself? Allowing myself to enjoy things without feeling guilty. Perhaps even... opening up to others about my experiences? It's scary to think about, but also... liberating, in a way.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a significant shift. How are you feeling now, as we near the end of our session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired, but in a good way? Like I've done something important. I'm still shaky, and the memories are still there, but they don't feel as overwhelming. And there's this tiny spark of... possibility? That maybe things can change. It's small, but it's there.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing so openly. Is there anything else you'd like to express before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. I know we have a long way to go, but for the first time in a long time, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can face this. And that... that means more than I can say.",
    "Therapist: You've shown immense courage today. We'll continue this journey together."
