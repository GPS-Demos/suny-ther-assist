    "Therapist: Alright, James. Today we'll be doing an imaginal exposure exercise focused on your combat experience. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with your SUDS rating. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 40. My heart's beating a bit faster than usual.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath and close your eyes. Start describing the memory.",
    "Client: (inhales deeply) Alright... We were on patrol in a small village. It was hot, dusty. I remember the weight of my gear, the sweat running down my back. We'd been walking for hours, everyone was on edge. Suddenly, there was a loud explosion. I felt the ground shake beneath my feet. My ears were ringing...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's going up. Maybe 60? My palms are getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: There was smoke everywhere. I couldn't see my team. I heard screaming, but it sounded far away. I tried to move, but my body felt heavy. I saw... I saw bodies on the ground. I couldn't tell if they were civilians or my teammates. The smell of burning flesh... it was overwhelming. I felt like I was going to be sick.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: (voice shaking) It's... it's up to 75 now. My chest feels tight. It's hard to breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep breathing. What happened next?",
    "Client: I... I managed to get up. I was calling out for my team. I found Johnson. He was... he was badly injured. There was so much blood. I tried to apply pressure to his wounds, but... (pauses, breathing heavily)",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, James. SUDS?",
    "Client: (choked voice) 85. I can almost smell the blood again. My hands... they feel sticky.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I couldn't save him. He died in my arms. I felt so helpless, so angry. More explosions in the distance. I had to leave him there. I had to find cover. I... I've never felt so alone, so scared.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: (voice breaking) It's... it's 90. I feel like I'm back there. My heart's racing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Stay with it. What happened after that?",
    "Client: I found cover behind a damaged wall. I could hear gunfire, more explosions. I was trying to radio for help, but there was no response. I felt like I was going to die there, alone. I thought about my family, how I'd never see them again. The guilt of leaving Johnson... it was overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: And now? SUDS?",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) It's... it's still at 90. I feel shaky, like I might pass out.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, James. Keep breathing. What happened next?",
    "Client: After what felt like hours, I heard familiar voices. It was the rest of my team. They found me. I was... I was crying. I couldn't stop. They had to practically carry me out. I felt so weak, so ashamed.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe 80? I still feel shaky, but... I'm starting to remember I'm here, not there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's start bringing you back to the present.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay. I... I can feel the chair beneath me. I can hear the clock ticking.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep focusing on those sensations. SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to 65 now. My breathing is slowing down.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. You did incredibly well, James. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. But also... I don't know. Maybe a little relieved? Like I've let something out that I've been holding in for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's down to 50. I feel drained, but... okay.",
    "Therapist: You showed immense courage today. How about we end here and discuss what you experienced?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think that would be good. Thank you... for guiding me through that.",
