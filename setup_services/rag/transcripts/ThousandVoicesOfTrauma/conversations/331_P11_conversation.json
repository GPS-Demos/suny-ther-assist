    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's not easy revisiting that memory. The racial slurs, the violence... it all felt so vivid again. I could almost smell the fear in the air, you know? It's like I was right back there, watching it unfold all over again.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. I keep replaying the moment when I saw that young man being beaten. I wanted to step in, to do something, but I was frozen. I've always prided myself on being strong, on standing up for what's right. But in that moment, I just... couldn't. And that haunts me.",
    "Therapist: How does that feeling of helplessness affect you now?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a constant weight on my shoulders. I find myself being overly cautious in public spaces, always on edge. I'm constantly scanning for potential threats, not just for myself but for my family too. It's exhausting, really. And I feel... I feel like I've let my community down somehow.",
    "Therapist: I hear your struggle. How does this connect to your recovery goals?",
    "Client: Well, I want to feel safe again, to not be constantly on high alert. And I want to be able to engage with my community without this overwhelming sense of guilt and fear. I guess... I want to reclaim the sense of dignity and strength that I feel was taken from me that day.",
    "Therapist: Those are important goals. What insights have you gained today?",
    "Client: I... I realized that maybe I'm being too hard on myself. The situation was dangerous, and my reaction was... normal, I suppose. It doesn't make me weak. And maybe by working through this, by speaking out, I'm actually standing up in a different way. It's not easy, but it feels... important.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's challenging, no doubt. But I feel... I feel like I'm making progress. Each time we do this, it gets a little easier to face. And I'm starting to see how it might help me in the long run. I'm committed to seeing this through, for myself and for my family.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is commendable. What strategies have you found helpful?",
    "Client: The breathing exercises have been a lifesaver, honestly. When I feel myself getting overwhelmed, I focus on my breath, and it helps ground me. And... talking about it, as difficult as it is, seems to be taking some of the power away from the memory. It's no longer this big, unspoken thing looming over me.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How can we build on this progress?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to work on feeling more empowered in my daily life. Maybe we could explore ways for me to engage with my community that feel safe but also meaningful? And I want to keep practicing these coping strategies. They're making a real difference.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great plan. Anything else you'd like to share?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's not an easy journey, but I feel like I'm not alone in it anymore. And that... that means more than I can express.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your resilience is inspiring. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. I feel drained, but in a... in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've done something important. I'm looking forward to our next session, even though I know it won't be easy. But I'm ready to keep working on this.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Take care, and we'll continue next time."
