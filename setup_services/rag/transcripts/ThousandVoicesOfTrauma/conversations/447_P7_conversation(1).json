    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm back in that room. It's dark, and I can smell incense. The cult leader, he's there, and he's... he's telling me to come closer. I don't want to, but I feel like I have to.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: He's touching me now. I feel sick. I want to run, but I can't move. It's like I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (voice shaking) He's... he's undressing me. I feel so ashamed. I should have fought back, but I didn't. Why didn't I fight back?",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: I'm crying silently. I don't want the others to hear. They're in the next room, chanting. The leader, he's... (pauses, breathing heavily)",

    "Client: I'm shaking. My heart is racing. I feel like I'm back there again.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here with me. You're safe.",
    "Client: It's hard to believe that sometimes. The memories feel so real.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're doing important work here.",
    "Client: After it happened, I couldn't tell anyone. I was too ashamed. I thought it was my fault somehow.",
    "Therapist: It wasn't your fault. You were a victim.",
    "Client: I know that now, but it's still hard to accept. I trusted him. We all did. He was supposed to guide us, protect us.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Keep going.",
    "Client: I remember lying in bed that night, unable to sleep. I felt so alone, so trapped. I wanted to leave, but I was scared of what would happen if I did.",
    "Therapist: You're very courageous for sharing this.",
    "Client: It took me years to finally leave. Even now, sometimes I have nightmares about it. I wake up in a cold sweat, feeling like I'm still there.",
