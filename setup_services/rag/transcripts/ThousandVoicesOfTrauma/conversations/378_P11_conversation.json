    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. That hostage situation... it felt so real again, like I was right back there in that bank.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The sound of the gunshot. God, it was so loud. I remember feeling like my ears were ringing for hours afterward. And the smell of gunpowder... it's funny how vivid that memory is. I can almost smell it now.",
    "Therapist: How did reliving that memory feel today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. Scary, but also... I don't know, different somehow. Like, I knew I was here in your office, safe, but part of me was back there too. It's hard to explain.",
    "Therapist: Different how?",
    "Client: Well, um... I guess I felt more in control this time? Like, I could observe what was happening without being completely overwhelmed by it. Don't get me wrong, it was still terrifying, but... I didn't feel as helpless as I did when it actually happened.",
    "Therapist: That's an important observation. How does this relate to your daily life?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe it means I'm starting to process it better? Like, when I have flashbacks in real life, they're usually so intense that I completely lose touch with reality. But this time, even though it felt real, I still knew where I was. That's progress, right?",
    "Therapist: It certainly can be. What else did you notice?",
    "Client: I... I realized something about the gunman. He looked scared too. I never noticed that before. I was always so focused on my own fear that I never really saw him as a person. But he was shaking... his voice was trembling when he shouted at us. It doesn't excuse what he did, but... it makes me see the situation differently.",
    "Therapist: How does this new perspective affect you?",
    "Client: It's... confusing, honestly. Part of me feels almost... sorry for him? Which feels wrong, because he put us through hell. But another part of me feels... I don't know, maybe a little less afraid? Like, he wasn't this all-powerful monster, just a scared, desperate person making terrible choices.",
    "Therapist: That's a complex realization. How might this insight help you moving forward?",
    "Client: I... I think it might help me feel less powerless? Like, if I can see him as human, flawed and scared, maybe I can start to see myself as stronger. I survived that situation. I got through it. Maybe I'm tougher than I give myself credit for.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful shift. How does it feel to acknowledge your strength?",
    "Client: It's... kind of amazing, actually. I've spent so long feeling like a victim, like that experience defined me. But maybe... maybe I'm more than that. Maybe I'm a survivor.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant realization. What's next for you in this process?",
    "Client: I... I want to keep going. This is hard, really hard, but I feel like I'm finally starting to make progress. I want to work on carrying this feeling of strength into my daily life. Maybe... maybe I can start challenging some of my avoidance behaviors? Like, I haven't been to a bank since the incident. I always use ATMs or online banking. But now, I'm thinking maybe I could try going into a bank, just for a little while.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a brave next step. How can we prepare for that?",
    "Client: Um, maybe we could... role-play it? Or... or maybe I could start by just driving past a bank, not going in yet? And then maybe work up to standing outside one, then going in just for a minute... Is that too much? Am I rushing things?",
    "Therapist: There's no rush. What feels manageable to you?",
    "Client: I think... I think driving past might be a good start. It feels scary, but not overwhelming. And maybe we could work on some coping strategies for when I feel anxious? Like those breathing exercises we've practiced?",
    "Therapist: Excellent idea. Shall we plan that for next week?",
    "Client: Yes, I... I think I'm ready for that. It's strange, I feel nervous about it, but also kind of... excited? Like I'm finally taking my life back. Thank you... for helping me get to this point.",
    "Therapist: You've done the hard work. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired, but in a good way? Like I've accomplished something important. And I feel... hopeful. More hopeful than I have in a long time."
