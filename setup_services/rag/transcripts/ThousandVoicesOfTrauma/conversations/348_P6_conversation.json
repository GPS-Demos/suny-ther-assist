    "Therapist: Alright, Amira. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the scene.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in the crowded marketplace. It's loud, and I can smell spices and food cooking. My mom is holding my hand tightly. Suddenly, there's a loud explosion. People are screaming and running. I... I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 6. My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Keep going.",
    "Client: Everything is chaotic. I see people pushing past us, some are crying. There's smoke in the air, and I can taste dust in my mouth. My mom is pulling me, trying to get us away from the crowd. I'm so scared, I can't move my legs properly.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to an 8. I feel like I'm really there again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with it.",
    "Client: I... I see a man on the ground. There's blood... so much blood. My mom is covering my eyes, but I've already seen it. I can hear sirens in the distance. People are still running and shouting. I'm shaking all over.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (breathing deeply) Okay... We're moving away from the center now. My mom is half-carrying me. I can still hear screaming behind us, but it's getting fainter. We reach a quieter street. My legs feel weak, and I'm crying uncontrollably.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating at this point?",
    "Client: It's coming down a bit... maybe a 7? I still feel shaky, but not as panicked.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're processing this well.",
    "Client: We're sitting on a curb now. My mom is hugging me tightly, whispering that we're safe. I can still smell smoke in the air, and my ears are ringing. I'm hiccuping from crying so hard. I feel... I feel helpless and confused.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's about a 6 again. I feel drained, but the intense fear is fading.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm surprised. It was intense, but I got through it. I feel exhausted, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger?",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. Well done today, Amira."
