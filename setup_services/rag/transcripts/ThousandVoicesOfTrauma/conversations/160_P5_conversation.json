    "Therapist: Mr. Lee, today we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm... not sure, doctor. I've been dreading this part. The idea of revisiting those memories from Vietnam... it's unsettling. I've spent years trying to forget.",
    "Therapist: Understandable. It's a challenging but crucial step. Ready to discuss how it works?",
    "Client: I suppose so. But I'm worried it might make things worse. What if I can't handle it?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace and I'll support you throughout.",
    "Client: That's somewhat reassuring. Can you tell me more about what to expect? I'm feeling quite anxious about the whole process.",
    "Therapist: Certainly. We'll gradually revisit your combat experiences. You may feel distressed initially, but it typically decreases over time.",
    "Client: I see. It's hard to imagine feeling better by thinking about those terrible events. Will I have to relive everything in detail?",
    "Therapist: Not all at once. We'll start small and build up. Your comfort is priority.",
    "Client: Alright, I appreciate that. I've been having more nightmares lately, just thinking about this session. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it's common. Addressing these memories can temporarily increase symptoms. It's part of the healing process.",
    "Client: I understand. It's just... after my wife passed, these memories seemed to intensify. I'm worried about losing control.",
    "Therapist: I'm sorry about your loss. We'll work together to manage any intense emotions that arise.",
    "Client: Thank you, doctor. I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be. How exactly do we start this process?",
    "Therapist: We'll begin with a specific memory. You'll describe it in present tense, as if it's happening now.",
    "Client: That sounds intense. I've always tried to distance myself from these memories. It's strange to purposely bring them closer.",
    "Therapist: It can feel counterintuitive. But it's key to processing the trauma and reducing its impact.",
    "Client: I understand the logic, but it's still scary. Will this really help with my flashbacks and nightmares?",
    "Therapist: Many find it does. It helps the brain process and store these memories differently.",
    "Client: Alright. I trust your expertise, doctor. I've come this far in therapy, I suppose I can face this too.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable, Mr. Lee. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do it. I'm nervous, but I'm ready to try. Thank you for your patience and guidance through this."
