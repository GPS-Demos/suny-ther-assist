    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the airplane crash scene?",
    "Client: Okay... I was sitting in my seat, 14C, on a flight from Bangkok to Singapore. It was supposed to be a short trip, just over two hours. The plane had taken off about 30 minutes ago, and I was trying to relax, but I've always been a nervous flyer. Suddenly, there was a loud bang, and the plane started shaking violently. People were screaming, and oxygen masks dropped from the ceiling. I... I'm not sure I can continue...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Right, okay. I fumbled with the oxygen mask, my hands shaking so much I could barely get it on. The plane was lurching from side to side, and I could see the wing outside my window bending at an unnatural angle. The flight attendants were trying to calm everyone down, but their voices were drowned out by the panic. I could smell something burning, and the cabin was filling with smoke. I... I thought I was going to die.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: The plane started to nose dive. I could feel the pressure in my ears, and my stomach lurched. People around me were crying and praying. I closed my eyes and gripped the armrests so hard my knuckles turned white. I thought about my family, how I'd never see them again. The smoke was getting thicker, and I was struggling to breathe even with the oxygen mask. Then there was another massive jolt, and I was thrown forward against my seatbelt. I hit my head on the seat in front of me, and everything went black for a moment.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. You're safe now.",
    "Client: When I came to, the plane had somehow leveled out. But we were still descending rapidly. The captain's voice came over the intercom, telling us to brace for impact. I could see the ground coming up fast through the windows. Trees, buildings, they were all a blur. The last thing I remember before we hit was the deafening sound of the engines and the screams of the passengers. Then there was a tremendous crash, and I was thrown around like a rag doll. Metal was tearing, glass was shattering, and I felt an intense pain in my leg. I... I can't...",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's just... so vivid. After the initial impact, there was this eerie silence for a few seconds. Then I heard groans and cries from other passengers. I was upside down, still strapped to my seat. My leg was pinned under the seat in front of me, which had collapsed. I could smell fuel and smoke, and I knew we had to get out fast. I managed to unbuckle my seatbelt and fell onto what used to be the ceiling of the plane. The pain in my leg was excruciating, but adrenaline kept me moving. I crawled towards a crack in the fuselage, cutting my hands on broken metal and glass. I could hear explosions behind me as I finally made it out onto the wing.",
    "Therapist: You're incredibly brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: Once I was out, I saw the full extent of the crash. We had come down in a field, and there was debris everywhere. The plane was broken into several pieces, and fires were starting to spread. I slid down the wing onto the ground, my injured leg giving way as I landed. I dragged myself away from the wreckage, terrified it might explode. Other survivors were stumbling away too, many of them injured and in shock. I remember looking back at the plane, seeing people still trapped inside, and feeling utterly helpless. The heat from the fires was intense, and the air was thick with smoke and the smell of jet fuel. In the distance, I could hear sirens approaching. I collapsed on the ground, exhausted and in pain, watching as rescue workers arrived and began to help the injured. It was... it was like a nightmare that I couldn't wake up from.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I'm shaking. My heart is racing, and I feel like I can still smell the smoke. But... I also feel a bit lighter, like I've let go of something I've been holding onto for a long time. It's strange, but talking about it in detail like this... it's helping me process what happened. I've never been able to describe it so fully before.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're making progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think I need a moment to catch my breath. This was intense, but I'm glad I did it. I've always avoided thinking about the crash in such detail, but facing it like this... it's difficult, but I think it's helping. I'm starting to see that I survived, that I made it through something horrific, and that maybe... maybe I'm stronger than I thought.",
    "Therapist: You've done exceptionally well today. Let's take a break."
