    "Therapist: Good afternoon, Carlos. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Hola, Dr. Ramirez. To be honest, I'm a bit on edge. Work's been crazy lately, and thinking about revisiting that day at the hospital... it's making my stomach churn.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's start with a SUDS rating. From 0 to 100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: Uh... I'd say about a 40. Not great, but I've been worse.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Whenever you're ready, close your eyes and take us back to that day.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Alright... I'm at work. It's a Tuesday morning, and I'm feeling pretty good. I just landed a big client, and I'm heading to a meeting to share the news. As I'm walking down the hallway, I suddenly feel this sharp pain in my chest. It's like someone's squeezing my heart. I... I can't breathe properly. My left arm starts to tingle, and I'm thinking, \"Dios m\u00edo, this is it. I'm having a heart attack.\"",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I stumble against the wall. My colleague, Maria, she sees me and rushes over. Her face... she looks so scared. I try to tell her what's happening, but I can barely speak. The pain is getting worse, and I'm sweating buckets. I slide down to the floor, and everything's starting to go fuzzy.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now, Carlos?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, and my heart's racing. It's like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember, you're safe here. Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 60 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... The next thing I remember clearly is being in the ambulance. The sirens are so loud, and there's an EMT hovering over me. He's asking me questions, but I can't focus. All I can think about is my kids. What if I never see them again? What if I die right here in this ambulance? The pain is unbearable, and I'm terrified.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The smell of disinfectant... it's so strong. And the cold. I remember feeling so cold. We arrive at the hospital, and everything's a blur of bright lights and urgent voices. They're wheeling me through corridors, and I catch glimpses of other patients. Some look even worse than I feel, and that scares me even more.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's pretty high. Maybe 75?",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) Thanks... I needed that. So, they take me to a room, and there's a flurry of activity. Nurses are attaching monitors, a doctor is firing questions at me, and I'm struggling to keep up. The pain is still intense, but now there's this overwhelming feeling of helplessness. I'm at their mercy, and I hate it. I've always been in control, you know? But now... I'm just lying there, vulnerable and scared out of my mind.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Carlos. Keep going.",
    "Client: They start running tests, taking blood, doing an EKG. Every minute feels like an hour. I'm trying to stay calm, but my mind keeps racing to worst-case scenarios. What if I need surgery? What if I'm permanently disabled? How will I support my family? The uncertainty is almost worse than the pain.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are coming up for you now?",
    "Client: Fear... frustration... and this deep sense of loneliness. Even though there are people all around me, I feel so alone. I wish my ex-wife was there, or my kids. Anyone familiar.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really difficult. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 85 now. This is harder than I thought it would be.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Carlos. Remember, you survived this. You're here now, safe.",
    "Client: (Nods) Right... So, after what feels like forever, the doctor comes back. He's got this serious look on his face, and my heart just sinks. But then he says it wasn't a heart attack. It was a severe panic attack that mimicked heart attack symptoms. Part of me is relieved, but another part is... embarrassed? Angry? I mean, all that fear and pain, and it wasn't even \"real\"?",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are valid, Carlos. How did you react to the news?",
    "Client: I... I didn't know how to feel. I was still shaky and exhausted. They kept me for observation, and I remember lying in that hospital bed, staring at the ceiling, feeling completely drained. The relief was there, but so was this new fear. If my own body could betray me like this, how could I trust it again? How could I go back to work, back to my life, knowing this could happen again at any moment?",
    "Therapist: That uncertainty must have been challenging. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's come down a bit... maybe 70?",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this well. What happened next?",
    "Client: They discharged me the next day. My daughter came to pick me up. Seeing her... it brought up so many emotions. I felt guilty for scaring her, grateful that I was okay, but also... I don't know, diminished somehow? Like I wasn't the strong father figure I wanted to be. The drive home was quiet. I could tell she was worried, and I didn't know how to reassure her when I wasn't sure myself.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling as you recall this part?",
    "Client: It's a mix of sadness and... I guess, vulnerability? I've always been the one taking care of others. It's hard to be on the other side of that.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant shift. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's around 60. Talking about my daughter... it's emotional, but not as intense as before.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Let's continue.",
    "Client: The next few days at home were tough. I was supposed to be resting, but my mind wouldn't stop racing. Every little twinge or ache sent me into a panic. I couldn't sleep properly. I'd wake up in the middle of the night, gasping for air, convinced I was having another attack. And work... God, just thinking about going back to work made my chest tighten. What if it happened again, in front of my colleagues or clients?",
    "Therapist: How did you cope with those fears?",
    "Client: Not well, at first. I isolated myself. Stopped answering calls from work. My kids were worried, but I pushed them away too. I was ashamed, I guess. And scared. It was like I was waiting for the other shoe to drop. Every day I woke up thinking, \"Is this the day it happens again?\"",
    "Therapist: That sounds really challenging. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually down to about 50. Talking about it... it's helping, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Carlos. How did things change over time?",
    "Client: Slowly. Very slowly. My doctor recommended therapy, which is how I ended up here. And gradually, I started to venture out more. First just short walks around the block. Then longer ones. I started doing breathing exercises, which helped a bit with the anxiety. But going back to work... that was the hardest part.",
    "Therapist: Can you tell me about your first day back?",
    "Client: Dios m\u00edo, I was a mess. I almost called in sick. My hands were shaking as I got dressed. The drive to the office felt like it took hours. Walking through those doors... my heart was pounding so hard I was sure everyone could hear it. I kept expecting to feel that pain again, to collapse in the hallway like before.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, recalling that day?",
    "Client: Tense. My shoulders are all knotted up. But... also a bit proud, I guess? Because I did it. I made it through that day.",
    "Therapist: That's a big accomplishment. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to about 40 now.",
    "Therapist: You've made great progress today, Carlos. How do you feel about wrapping up?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'm ready. This was tough, but... I feel a bit lighter, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful. Let's do some grounding exercises before we end.",
    "Client: Okay. And... gracias. For listening, for helping me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Carlos. You did the hard work today. I'm proud of your progress."
