    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Lee. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, Dr. Chen. I know we're going to talk about the animal attack again, and it's making me anxious.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's just... every time I think about it, my heart starts racing.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. We'll go through this together.",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. It was a sunny day, and I was walking in the park near my house. I've always loved that park, especially in spring when the cherry blossoms bloom. But now... now I can't even look at it without feeling scared.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: I was sitting on a bench, enjoying the warmth of the sun, when I heard a growl. At first, I thought it was just someone's dog playing, but when I turned... there was this huge, angry dog. Its teeth were bared, and it was coming straight for me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I can still see its eyes. They were so... wild. I froze. I couldn't move. My heart was pounding so hard I thought it might burst out of my chest. The dog lunged at me, and I barely had time to lift my arm to protect myself.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: Its teeth... they sank into my arm. The pain was excruciating. I screamed, but it felt like no sound came out. I could feel its hot breath, smell the... the... oh god, I can't...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. You're handling this bravely.",
    "Client: I... I'm sorry. It's just... the memory is so vivid. I can almost feel the pain again.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Take your time.",
    "Client: Okay... The dog was shaking its head, still holding onto my arm. I thought I was going to die. I've survived so much in my life - wars, natural disasters - but at that moment, I truly believed this was the end.",
    "Therapist: You're incredibly strong. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Someone must have heard my screams because suddenly there were people there. A man hit the dog with a stick, and it finally let go. I collapsed to the ground, holding my bleeding arm. Everything after that is a blur of faces, sirens, and hospital lights.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable courage. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained, but also... lighter? Like I've released something that's been weighing on me.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive sign. You've done well today.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Chen. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart.",
    "Therapist: You're making great progress. We'll end here for today.",
    "Client: Okay. I appreciate your support. Same time next week?",
    "Therapist: Yes, I'll see you then. Take care, Mrs. Lee."
