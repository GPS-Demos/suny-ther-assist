    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit anxious, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about my experiences with police brutality, and it's making me nervous.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's just... every time I think about it, my heart starts racing.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. We'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: Okay. I'll try. So, it was about two years ago. I was at a peaceful protest against racial injustice. Everything was fine at first, but then...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there was chaos. The police started pushing people, using tear gas. I couldn't breathe. I saw an officer grab a young man next to me and throw him to the ground.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you see, hear, feel?",
    "Client: I... I hear screaming. People are running. The air is thick with tear gas. My eyes are burning. I'm trying to help the young man, but an officer pushes me away. I fall, and...",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: I hit my head on the pavement. Everything is spinning. I can taste blood in my mouth. I'm terrified. I thought they were supposed to protect us, but they're hurting us.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I manage to get up, but I'm disoriented. People are still screaming. I see more officers approaching, batons raised. I want to run, but my legs won't move.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: I... I'm frozen. An officer grabs my arm. It hurts. I try to explain that I wasn't doing anything wrong, but he won't listen. He's twisting my arm behind my back.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I'm crying, begging him to stop. But he just pushes me harder. I hear the click of handcuffs. I can't believe this is happening. I've never been arrested before. I'm a professional, a wife... This isn't me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: They drag me to a police van. I'm still crying, my head is throbbing. I see others being thrown in too. We're all scared, confused. I keep thinking about my husband, wondering if he knows what's happening to me.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. You're handling this bravely.",
    "Client: The ride to the station is rough. We're all being tossed around in the back. I can hear people praying, crying. I'm trying to stay calm, but I'm terrified. What if they hurt us more? What if I never see my family again?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you survived this.",

    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. You're safe now.",
    "Client: They put me in a cell with others from the protest. We're all shell-shocked. I can't stop shaking. Hours pass, and finally, they let me call my husband. I break down crying when I hear his voice.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. You're doing great.",
    "Client: It was hours before they released me. No charges, just a \"warning.\" But the damage was done. I couldn't sleep for weeks after. Every time I saw a police officer, I'd panic. I still do sometimes.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Angry. Sad. But... also a little relieved. Talking about it... it's hard, but it helps somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You did well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I need a moment to collect myself.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take all the time you need. You've made great progress today."
