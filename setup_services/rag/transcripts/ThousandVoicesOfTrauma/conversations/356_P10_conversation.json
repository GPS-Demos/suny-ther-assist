    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Patel. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Oh, hello Dr. Chen. I... I'm not sure. There's a heaviness in my chest. I've been dreading this, to be honest.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to support you. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Though I'm not sure I'm ready to... to relive it all.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. We'll go at your pace. Can you describe where you are in the memory?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in the hospital. The smell of disinfectant is so strong, it's making me nauseous. The fluorescent lights are harsh, casting everything in this sickly glow. I can hear the beeping of machines, steady at first, then... then growing erratic.",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see my son, Rahul. He's... he's lying in the bed. So pale, so thin. The cancer has ravaged him. His eyes are sunken, and his breathing is labored. I want to look away, but I can't. I'm frozen, watching every rise and fall of his chest, terrified each breath might be his last.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 70. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. What happens next?",
    "Client: The doctor comes in. His face is grim. He's speaking, but I can barely hear him over the roaring in my ears. \"I'm sorry,\" he says, \"We've done all we can.\" I feel like I'm falling, like the floor has disappeared beneath me. I reach for Rahul's hand. It's so cold.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I... I can't believe this is happening. My baby boy, my Rahul... he can't be dying. He's only 45. I was supposed to go first. This isn't right. It isn't fair! I want to scream, to beg the doctor to do something, anything. But I know it's too late.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 85. My chest feels so tight.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I sit by his bed. I'm holding his hand, trying to warm it with mine. I'm telling him stories from when he was little, hoping he can hear me. Memories of him learning to ride a bike, his first day of school, the time he won the spelling bee. My voice is shaking, and tears are streaming down my face.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay present in the memory.",
    "Client: The beeping... it's getting slower. Rahul's breathing is so shallow now. I'm pleading with him, \"Please, beta, don't go. Don't leave me.\" But I know... I know it's time. His fingers twitch in mine, just slightly. And then... then the beeping stops. It's just one long, continuous tone. And he's... he's gone.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I... I feel like I can't breathe. My heart is racing. It's like I'm losing him all over again.",
    "Therapist: Focus on my voice. You're here, in the present. You're safe. Take slow, deep breaths.",
    "Client: (Audible deep breaths) It's... it's so hard. I miss him so much.",
    "Therapist: I know. You're showing incredible strength. What happens after that moment?",
    "Client: Everything becomes a blur. Nurses rush in, the doctor returns. They're speaking to me, but I can't process their words. I'm just staring at Rahul's face. He looks... peaceful. Like he's sleeping. I keep expecting him to open his eyes, to smile at me one last time. But he doesn't.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's still high... maybe 90. I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you've survived this before. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I lean over and kiss his forehead. It's still warm. I whisper, \"I love you, beta. I'll always love you.\" Then I just... I collapse into the chair beside his bed. I can't stop crying. The grief is overwhelming, like a physical weight crushing me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... how am I supposed to go on without him? He was my only child, my whole world. I'm remembering all the milestones we'll never share - grandchildren, his retirement, growing old together. It feels like my future has been stolen from me.",
    "Therapist: These are powerful emotions. How are you coping in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure I am coping. I feel lost, adrift. Part of me wants to deny it's happening, to believe it's just a horrible nightmare. But the reality is setting in, and it's unbearable.",
    "Therapist: You're showing immense courage. What happens as time passes in the room?",
    "Client: Slowly, family members start to arrive. My ex-husband, Rahul's father, comes in. He's sobbing. We haven't spoken in years, but in this moment, we're united in our grief. We hold each other, crying together over our son's body. It's... it's both comforting and painful.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe to 75. Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also releasing something.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Continue with what you remember.",
    "Client: As the day wears on, more people come and go. Friends, colleagues of Rahul's. They're all saying such beautiful things about him, how he touched their lives. I feel a mix of pride and sorrow. My son was so loved, and now he's gone.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling physically at this point?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted. My eyes are swollen from crying, my throat is raw. I feel hollow, like something vital has been scooped out of me. But I can't leave. I can't bear the thought of leaving him alone.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens as the day turns to evening?",
    "Client: The hospital staff are gentle but insistent. They need to... to take him away. I know I have to let go, but it feels impossible. I keep touching his face, his hands, trying to memorize every detail. When they finally wheel him out, I feel like a part of me is going with him.",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly difficult. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. Emotionally and physically. The pain is still there, raw and intense, but it's like I'm too tired to feel it fully anymore.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable strength. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 60 now. Talking about it... it hurts, but it's also releasing something.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Let's take a few deep breaths together. You've done excellent work today.",
    "Client: (Deep breaths) Thank you. I... I didn't think I could do this.",
    "Therapist: You did, and you should be proud. How are you feeling about the session?",
    "Client: It was hard, really hard. But... there's a small sense of relief. Like I've shared some of the burden.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. We'll end here for today. Well done, Mrs. Patel.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Chen. I... I think this might be helping, even if it doesn't feel like it sometimes.",
    "Therapist: That's often the case. Take care of yourself this week. We'll continue next session."
