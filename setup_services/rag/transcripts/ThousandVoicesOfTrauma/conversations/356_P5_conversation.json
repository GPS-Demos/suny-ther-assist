    "Therapist: Mrs. Chen, today we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, Dr. Parker. To be honest, I'm quite nervous. After losing my husband last year, and with all the memories of my past... it's overwhelming. I've been trying to keep busy with my grandchildren, but the thought of revisiting those painful experiences makes my heart race.",
    "Therapist: Your nervousness is understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I've spent so long trying to forget the hurtful things my ex-husband used to say. And now, with the grief of losing my second husband... I'm afraid I might fall apart if I start remembering everything. Plus, at my age, is it even worth stirring up all this old pain?",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. How do you think facing these memories might help?",
    "Client: I... I suppose it could help me stop avoiding certain thoughts or places that remind me of the past. Maybe I'd feel less jumpy when my son raises his voice, even if he's just excited. But I'm still scared, Dr. Parker. What if I can't handle it?",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. What questions do you have about the process?",
    "Client: How long will each session last? Will you be with me the whole time? What if I start crying and can't stop? Oh, and... will this affect my recovery from alcohol dependency? I've been sober for three months now, and I don't want to jeopardize that.",
    "Therapist: Good questions. Let's address each one. First...",
    "Client: (Interrupting) I'm sorry, Dr. Parker. Before you continue, I just remembered something else. My daughter-in-law has been urging me to try meditation for stress relief. Would that be a better alternative to this exposure therapy? I'm just so worried about opening up old wounds.",
    "Therapist: I understand your concern. Meditation can be helpful, but...",
    "Client: (Nodding) I see. So, this exposure therapy is specifically for trauma, right? I guess I'm just looking for ways to avoid it. (Sighs) I know I need to face this, but it's so hard. Can you tell me again how this will help with my PTSD symptoms?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Imaginal exposure helps by...",
    "Client: (Listening intently) I think I understand. It's like exercising a muscle, right? The more I face these memories, the stronger I'll become in dealing with them. But Dr. Parker, what if I remember something I've completely forgotten? What if there are even worse memories buried deep down?",
    "Therapist: That's a common concern. If new memories surface...",
    "Client: (Taking a deep breath) Okay. I think I'm ready to try. But can we start with something small? Maybe just a minor incident? I don't think I can jump into the worst memories right away. And... can I hold onto something during the session? My late husband's watch, perhaps? It always makes me feel safer.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll start gently and...",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Parker. I appreciate your patience with all my questions and concerns. I know this won't be easy, but I want to get better. For myself, and for my family. They've been so supportive through everything. I just hope I'm strong enough to do this.",
    "Therapist: You're showing immense courage. Shall we begin?"
