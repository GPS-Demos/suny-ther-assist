    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Thompson?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. It's not easy revisiting those moments from the refugee camp. The memories are so vivid, you know? I can still hear the shouting, feel the fear in my chest. It's like I'm right back there, even though it's been decades.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. Being pushed around by those guards, not knowing if we'd ever get out. I remember clutching my little granddaughter's hand so tightly... I was terrified they'd separate us. It's... it's overwhelming to think about.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to share that now?",
    "Client: It's... strange. My heart's still racing a bit, but there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe relief? Like I'm finally letting out something I've kept bottled up for so long. But it's also bringing up a lot of anxiety.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. How does this connect to your day-to-day life?",
    "Client: Well, I suppose... I've always been on edge, you know? Always watching over my shoulder, even here in safety. It's affected my sleep, my relationships. I push people away sometimes, afraid of losing them like I almost lost my granddaughter that day.",
    "Therapist: I see. What have you learned from this experience?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm starting to see that these memories, while painful, don't have the same power over me they once did. Talking about them, it's hard, but it's also... freeing, in a way. Maybe I don't have to be constantly afraid anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How might you use this moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I can start opening up more to my family. They've always wanted to know about my past, but I've kept it locked away. And perhaps... perhaps I can work on feeling safer in the present. Maybe even sleep better at night.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like positive steps. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's daunting, I won't lie. But... I also feel a glimmer of hope. For the first time in years, I feel like maybe I can move past this, you know? It's like... like I'm finally starting to see a way forward.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to delve deeper into that day at the camp. There's more I haven't shared, moments that still haunt me. It's scary, but I think it might help to get it all out in the open. And maybe... maybe we could talk about ways to manage my anxiety when these memories come up?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll work on that together. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired, emotionally drained. But there's also this strange sense of accomplishment. Like I've faced something I've been running from for years. It's a mix of exhaustion and... I don't know, maybe pride? Is that odd?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a common and positive response. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I suppose. For listening, for guiding me through this. I never thought I'd be able to talk about these things, but here I am. It's... it's a start, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: It certainly is. Well done today, Mr. Thompson."
