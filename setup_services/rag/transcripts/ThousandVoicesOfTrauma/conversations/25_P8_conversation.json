    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. The memory of the earthquake, it's so vivid now. I can still feel the ground shaking beneath my feet, hear the rumbling... It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I think. No, not just fear. It's more like... terror. My heart is pounding, and I feel this tightness in my chest. It's like I'm right back there, you know? I keep thinking about how powerless I felt, how I couldn't do anything to stop it.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How does that sense of powerlessness affect you now?",
    "Client: It's... it's frustrating. I mean, I know logically that there's nothing I could have done to stop an earthquake, but emotionally? I still feel this guilt, like I should have been able to do something, anything. And it's not just about the earthquake anymore. It's like this feeling has seeped into other parts of my life.",
    "Therapist: Can you elaborate on that?",
    "Client: Yeah, um... Like with my recent breakup. I keep replaying it in my head, thinking about all the things I could have done differently. It's the same feeling of helplessness, you know? Like I'm watching everything fall apart around me, and I can't do a damn thing to stop it.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts come up when you make that connection?",
    "Client: I... I guess I feel like a failure. Like I'm not in control of my own life. The earthquake, the breakup... it's like I'm just this passive observer in my own story. And that scares me. What if I can't ever feel secure again? What if I'm always waiting for the next disaster to strike?",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you express these fears?",
    "Client: Tense. Really tense. My shoulders are up to my ears, and my jaw is clenched. I hadn't even noticed until you asked. And there's this knot in my stomach, like I'm constantly bracing for impact.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to acknowledge those sensations. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I'm breathing faster. And my palms are sweaty. It's like my body is preparing for fight or flight, even though there's no immediate danger. God, is this how I've been living? Always on edge, always waiting for the next catastrophe?",
    "Therapist: That sounds exhausting. How does recognizing this pattern make you feel?",
    "Client: Honestly? A mix of things. Part of me feels relieved, like I'm finally putting words to something I've been experiencing but couldn't name. But there's also this sadness. I've been carrying this weight for so long, and I didn't even realize it. And... and there's a glimmer of hope, too. Like maybe now that I can see it, I can start to change it.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What do you think that change might look like?",
    "Client: I'm not entirely sure, but... maybe it starts with acknowledging that I can't control everything. The earthquake, the breakup - they happened. I can't change that. But maybe I can change how I respond to things. Maybe I can learn to feel secure even when things are uncertain.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... it's both scary and liberating. Scary because it means letting go of this illusion of control I've been clinging to. But liberating because... well, because it means I don't have to carry the weight of the world on my shoulders anymore. I don't have to be responsible for everything.",
    "Therapist: Mm. What emotions come up as you consider this shift?",
    "Client: Relief, definitely. A lot of relief. But also... grief? Yeah, grief. It's like I'm mourning the loss of this idea I had about myself, about how life should work. And there's anxiety too, because this is all new territory for me. But underneath all of that, there's this tiny spark of excitement. Like maybe, just maybe, I can learn to live differently.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to process. How are you feeling now compared to when we started?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but in a good way? Like I've just run a marathon or something. My body feels less tense, and my mind feels clearer. It's like I've taken this huge, tangled ball of emotions and started to unravel it a bit. I know there's still a lot of work to do, but for the first time in a long time, I feel like maybe I can do it.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant shift. What do you want to remember from this session?",
    "Client: I think... I want to remember that it's okay to not have control over everything. That feeling powerless doesn't make me a failure. And that even though the earthquake and the breakup were traumatic, they don't define me or my future. I can learn from them, grow from them, without being trapped by them.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful takeaway. How might you remind yourself of this in the coming week?",
    "Client: I think I'll write it down, actually. Maybe put it somewhere I can see it every day, like on my bathroom mirror. And when I start to feel that anxiety creeping in, that fear of the next disaster, I'll try to take a moment to breathe and remind myself of what we talked about today.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great plan. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up?",
    "Client: No, I think... I think this is good for now. It's a lot to process, but I feel like I have a direction, you know? Like I'm not just flailing in the dark anymore. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and we'll continue next week."
