    "Therapist: Let's discuss the imaginal exposure we'll be doing today. How are you feeling about it?",
    "Client: I'm not sure, to be honest. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of reliving that violence... it's making me nervous. Can you explain why we need to do this?",
    "Therapist: Of course. It helps process the trauma memory. What concerns you most?",
    "Client: I'm worried I'll lose control. What if I can't handle it? I've spent years trying to forget, and now you want me to remember everything in detail. It seems counterintuitive.",
    "Therapist: I understand. It's normal to feel apprehensive. How have you been coping so far?",
    "Client: Well, I've been using some of the breathing techniques we practiced. They help a bit, but this feels different. It's like I'm voluntarily walking into a nightmare. I've had issues with substance use in the past, and I'm afraid this might trigger a relapse. How can you be sure this won't make things worse?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace and can stop anytime. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's somewhat reassuring. But what exactly will happen during the exposure? Will I need to close my eyes? Will you be asking me questions throughout? I'm trying to prepare myself mentally.",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the memory while I guide you. Eyes closed or open - your choice. Questions help us process. Comfortable with that?",
    "Client: I think so. It's still scary, but I understand the purpose better now. I appreciate you taking the time to explain it to me. I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be. What should I expect to feel during and after the session?",
    "Therapist: You may experience strong emotions. That's normal and part of healing. How do you typically handle intense feelings?",
    "Client: I usually try to distract myself or sometimes I isolate. But I know those aren't always healthy coping mechanisms. I'm working on being more open with my emotions, especially since my divorce. It's been a challenge living alone and dealing with all of this.",
    "Therapist: Your willingness to face this is courageous. How can I support you today?",
    "Client: Just knowing you're here helps. Maybe remind me to breathe if I seem overwhelmed? And... could we have a moment of silence after the exposure before we start discussing it? I think I might need that.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'll guide your breathing and respect your need for silence. Anything else?",
    "Client: No, I think that covers it. Thank you for being so patient with me. I know this is necessary, but it's not easy. I'm glad we're doing this together.",
    "Therapist: Your strength is admirable. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I'm ready. Let's do this before I change my mind. I trust you to guide me through this, and I'm committed to the process, no matter how difficult it might be."
