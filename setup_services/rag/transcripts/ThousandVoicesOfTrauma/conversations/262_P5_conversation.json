    "Therapist: Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: I'm honestly pretty nervous. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of reliving that earthquake... it's terrifying. I've spent so much time trying to forget it all.",
    "Therapist: Your anxiety is understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried that talking about it will make everything worse. What if I can't handle it? And... I don't know... I guess I'm scared of feeling out of control. During the earthquake, I felt so helpless, and I'm afraid of feeling that way again.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How can I support you today?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. Maybe... could you explain more about why we're doing this? And what exactly is going to happen? I think knowing more might help me feel a bit more prepared.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Imaginal exposure helps process trauma memories. We'll revisit the event safely, reducing its emotional impact over time.",
    "Client: That makes sense, I guess. But how does just talking about it actually help? It seems too simple to work on something so... big.",
    "Therapist: By facing memories repeatedly, they become less overwhelming. Your brain reprocesses the trauma, reducing its power.",
    "Client: Okay, I can see how that might work. But what if I panic? Or if I can't get through it?",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. You're in control. We can pause anytime. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I appreciate your patience with all my questions. I think... I think I'm ready to try. Or as ready as I'll ever be, anyway. What exactly do I need to do?",
    "Therapist: You'll describe the earthquake in detail, in present tense. I'll guide you through it.",
    "Client: In the present tense? Like it's happening now? That sounds intense. How long will we do this for?",
    "Therapist: About 30-45 minutes. We'll record it for you to listen to between sessions.",
    "Client: Wow, that's longer than I expected. And listening to it again? That sounds really tough. But I understand why it might be helpful. I'm still nervous, but I'm willing to give it a try.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. This work isn't easy, but it's crucial for healing.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot. I've been feeling stuck for so long, and even though this is scary, it feels like a step forward. Is there anything else I should know before we start?",
    "Therapist: Just remember to breathe. Stay present. If overwhelmed, we'll use grounding techniques.",
    "Client: Okay, I can do that. Deep breaths. Stay present. I'm here, I'm safe. It's just a memory. Alright... I think I'm ready to begin.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's start. Close your eyes and describe where you are when the earthquake begins."
