    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the hostage situation?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in the mess hall. It's early morning, and I'm having breakfast with my unit. Suddenly, there's shouting and gunfire outside. Everyone jumps up, grabbing weapons, but before we can react, armed insurgents burst through the doors. They're yelling in a language I don't understand, waving guns around. My heart is racing, and I can feel sweat breaking out all over my body.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: They force us to the ground, zip-tying our hands behind our backs. I can smell the dirt and feel the cold floor against my face. One of my teammates tries to resist, and they... they shoot him. The sound is deafening, and I can feel the vibration in my chest. There's blood... so much blood. I'm terrified they'll kill us all.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can continue. My hands are shaking just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: Okay... The insurgents are shouting at us, demanding information. I can see the fear in my teammates' eyes. We're all thinking the same thing - will we make it out alive? Hours pass, and we're still on the floor. My arms are numb, my mouth is dry, and I'm so thirsty. Every time someone moves, the insurgents threaten them. I keep thinking about my family back home, wondering if I'll ever see them again.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: As night falls, we hear commotion outside. Gunfire erupts, and there's chaos everywhere. The insurgents are panicking, and for a moment, I think this might be our chance. But then one of them grabs me, uses me as a human shield. I can feel the cold metal of his gun against my head, and I'm certain this is it. This is how I die.",
    "Therapist: You're so brave. Remember, you survived this.",
    "Client: The next few minutes are a blur. There's more gunfire, shouting, and suddenly I'm on the ground. Someone's cutting my zip ties, telling me it's okay, that I'm safe now. But I don't feel safe. I can't stop shaking, can't stop seeing my teammate's lifeless body, can't stop hearing the gunshots. Even now, years later, I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night, feeling that gun against my head.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to feel that way. You've shown incredible strength.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's... it's hard to talk about this. But I know it's necessary.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted, honestly. Reliving it is draining, but... I also feel a little lighter. Like I've released some of the weight I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. We'll end here for today."
