    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving those moments in the cult, especially the physical abuse... it's like I was right back there. I can still feel the tension in my body, you know? Like I'm bracing for something.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The fear. God, the constant fear. I remember thinking, \"Is today the day they'll hurt me again?\" It's funny, I thought I'd forgotten a lot of it, but it all came rushing back. The smells, the sounds... even the taste of that awful \"purification\" drink they made us take.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. Scary, but also... I don't know, liberating in a way? Like, I'm finally facing it head-on instead of running from it. But it also made me realize how much that experience still affects me. I mean, I've been clean for a while now, but I can see how I turned to substances to numb this stuff out.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength, Sarah.",
    "Client: Thanks. It doesn't always feel that way. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever truly be free of this. Like, will I always be jumping at shadows, you know? But then I remind myself that I'm here, I'm doing this work. That's got to count for something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How do you see this connecting to your recovery?",
    "Client: Well, I think... I think I'm starting to understand why I've struggled with relationships. Always keeping people at arm's length, never really trusting anyone. It's all tied to what happened in the cult. And the substance use, it was my way of coping, of trying to forget. But now I'm facing it, and it's hard, but it feels like the right path.",
    "Therapist: What insights have you gained from this process?",
    "Client: I'm realizing that I'm stronger than I thought. And that... it's okay to be vulnerable sometimes. I've always tried to be so self-reliant, you know? But maybe that's not always the healthiest approach. I'm learning that it's okay to reach out, to trust others... to trust you. And that facing these memories, as painful as it is, is helping me reclaim parts of myself I thought I'd lost.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization, Sarah. How can we build on this?",
    "Client: I think... I want to keep pushing forward with this. Maybe explore more of those memories, try to understand them better. And I want to work on opening up more in my day-to-day life. Maybe try to form some new relationships, or strengthen the ones I have. It's scary, but I feel like I'm ready to take those steps.",
    "Therapist: You're making great progress. What's your takeaway today?",
    "Client: My takeaway is... I'm not defined by what happened to me. I'm defined by how I choose to move forward. And I'm choosing to face this head-on, to heal, to grow. It's not easy, but I'm worth it. I deserve a life free from the shadow of the cult, free from substance use. And for the first time in a long time, I actually believe I can have that life.",
    "Therapist: That's incredibly powerful, Sarah. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm ready. It's tough, and there are moments when I want to run away from all of this. But I know this is the path to healing. And honestly? I'm curious about what else I might discover about myself through this process. It's like I'm getting to know myself all over again, in a way. So yeah, I'm nervous, but I'm ready to keep going."
