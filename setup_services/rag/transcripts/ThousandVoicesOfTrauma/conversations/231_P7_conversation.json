    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and take a deep breath.",
    "Client: Okay, I'm closing my eyes. I'm feeling a bit nervous.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I'm back in the compound. It's early morning, and I can hear the others stirring. The air is thick with tension because we know today is a \"cleansing\" day. I'm dreading what's to come.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: I can smell the musty odor of unwashed bodies and incense. The leader, Brother Jacob, enters the room. His eyes are wild, and I know he's been up all night \"communing with the spirits.\" My heart starts racing.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling.",
    "Client: He's pointing at me, shouting that I'm impure, that I need to be cleansed. Two of his followers grab my arms. I try to resist, but they're too strong. They're dragging me outside.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. Keep going.",
    "Client: The gravel is digging into my bare feet as they force me to kneel. Brother Jacob is standing over me with a wooden staff. He's yelling about demons and sin. I'm terrified, but I can't show it. Showing fear only makes it worse.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Continue.",
    "Client: The first blow comes down on my back. It's excruciating. I bite my lip to keep from crying out. He keeps hitting me, over and over. I can feel my skin splitting open. The pain is overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can keep going. It's too much.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay. I'll try. The beating seems to go on forever. I'm dizzy from the pain and the smell of my own blood. Finally, it stops. Brother Jacob is praying over me, saying the demons have been cast out. I'm left there, lying in the dirt, as everyone goes back inside.",
    "Therapist: You're very strong. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... shaky. My back is throbbing with phantom pain. But I also feel a strange sense of relief, like I've faced something I've been avoiding for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was hard, but I think it helped. Can we take a break now?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves."
