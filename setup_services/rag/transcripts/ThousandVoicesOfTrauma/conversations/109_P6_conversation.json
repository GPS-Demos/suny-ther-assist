    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's begin when you're comfortable.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in that room. It's dark, and I can hear muffled voices outside. My heart is racing, and I feel so helpless. The ropes are digging into my wrists, and I can't move. I'm... I'm terrified.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 7. I can feel my palms getting sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The door opens, and I see a shadowy figure. I can't make out their face, but I know it's one of them. My mouth goes dry, and I'm struggling to breathe. I keep thinking, \"This is it. This is how I die.\" The fear is overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to an 8. I can feel my chest tightening.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: They're speaking, but I can't understand the language. The voice sounds angry, threatening. I'm trying to make myself as small as possible, hoping they'll just leave. But they're coming closer, and I can smell cigarette smoke. It makes me want to gag.",
    "Therapist: How about your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still an 8. My hands are shaking, and I feel dizzy.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Continue.",
    "Client: I hear a loud bang outside, and the person in the room turns quickly. For a moment, I think maybe I'll be rescued. But then I hear shouting, and more footsteps. More of them are coming. I'm so scared I can barely breathe. I'm trying to stay quiet, but I'm crying now. I can't help it.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. I feel like I'm right back there. My whole body is tense.",
    "Therapist: That's intense. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: I know, but it feels so real. They're all in the room now, arguing loudly. One of them grabs my arm roughly, and I cry out in pain. I'm begging them to let me go, but they're not listening. I feel so powerless, so alone. I just want it to be over.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating at this point?",
    "Client: It's... it's still a 9. I'm feeling nauseous now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: I'm trying. They're dragging me to my feet now. I can barely stand because my legs are so weak from fear. They're pushing me towards the door, and I don't know what's going to happen next. I'm terrified they're going to kill me. I can hear my heart pounding in my ears.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down to an 8. I think... I think I'm starting to feel a little detached from the memory.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud crash, and bright lights flood the room. I hear shouting in English now. It's the police. Everything's happening so fast. I'm on the ground, and someone's cutting the ropes off my wrists. I'm crying uncontrollably, but I'm starting to realize it's over.",
    "Therapist: How about your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 6 now. I'm feeling relief, but I'm still shaking.",
    "Therapist: You've done well. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. But also... I don't know, maybe a little proud? I got through it. It was hard, but I did it.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant achievement. Well done."
