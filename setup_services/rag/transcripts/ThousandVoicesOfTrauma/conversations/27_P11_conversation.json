    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's strange, you know? Reliving that hostage situation... it's like I was right back there in that moment. My heart's still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The fear. It was so intense. I could feel it in my chest, like this heavy weight. And the uncertainty... not knowing if I'd make it out alive. It's funny, I thought I'd forgotten some of the details, but they all came flooding back.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was tough, really tough. But... I don't know, maybe a little different this time? Like, I could see it happening, but I also knew I was here, safe in this room. It's confusing, to be honest.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. What else did you notice?",
    "Client: I realized how much anger I still have. Not just at the people who held us hostage, but at myself. I keep thinking I should have done something more, you know? Protected the others somehow. It's... it's hard to shake that feeling of helplessness.",
    "Therapist: How does that connect to your day-to-day life now?",
    "Client: I guess... I'm always on edge, aren't I? Always looking for potential threats, trying to control everything. It's exhausting. My wife, she's been so patient, but I know it affects her too. I'm not the same person I was before this happened.",
    "Therapist: What do you think about that change?",
    "Client: It's... it's not all bad, I suppose. I'm more aware, more appreciative of life. But the constant anxiety, the nightmares, the way I sometimes snap at my kids... that's not who I want to be. I want to find a balance, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a great insight. How might we work towards that?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I need to be kinder to myself? Accept that what happened wasn't my fault, and that I did the best I could in an impossible situation. And perhaps... learn to let go a little? Not try to control everything all the time?",
    "Therapist: Those sound like valuable goals. How was today's session for you?",
    "Client: It was intense, but... I feel like I understand myself a bit better now. It's still hard, but I think I'm making progress. Slowly, but... it's there.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think I'd like to work more on managing my anxiety in daily life. Maybe some techniques to help when I start feeling overwhelmed? And... I'd like to talk about how to reconnect with my family. I miss feeling close to them.",
    "Therapist: Those are great areas to explore. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm tired, but... okay, I think. A bit lighter, maybe? Like I've put down a heavy bag I've been carrying. It's nice to feel understood, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful. What will you do to take care of yourself today?",
    "Client: I think I'll go for a walk in the park near our house. It always helps clear my head. And maybe I'll call my wife, see if we can have dinner together tonight. Just... try to be present, I guess.",
