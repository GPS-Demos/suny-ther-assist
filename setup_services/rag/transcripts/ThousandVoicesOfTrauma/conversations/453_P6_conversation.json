    "Therapist: Alright, Mr. Patel, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day in combat...",
    "Client: (taking a deep breath) Okay... I'm there. It's hot, unbearably hot. The air is thick with dust and the smell of gunpowder. I can hear distant explosions and my heart is racing...",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um... I'd say about a 4 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue...",
    "Client: We're moving through a village. It's eerily quiet. Suddenly, there's a burst of gunfire. My squad scatters for cover. I dive behind a low wall, my rifle clutched tightly. The sound is deafening... I can barely think...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's going up. Maybe a 6 now. My palms are sweating, and I feel my heart pounding in my chest.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep going...",
    "Client: (voice trembling) There's shouting all around. I peek over the wall and see one of my men down. He's not moving. I... I want to help him, but I'm frozen. I can't move. The guilt... it's overwhelming...",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) It's an 8 now. I feel like I'm right back there. My chest is tight, and I feel so ashamed...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're here in a safe place.",
    "Client: (nodding) Right... safe... (pauses) The gunfire intensifies. I finally force myself to move. I'm crawling towards my fallen comrade, bullets whizzing overhead. I reach him, and... oh god, there's so much blood...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: (voice shaky) It's... it's a 9. I feel like I can't breathe. The memory is so vivid...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it if you can.",
    "Client: (nods, swallowing hard) I start dragging him back to cover. His blood is soaking through my uniform. I can smell it, mixed with the dust and gunpowder. I'm terrified, but I keep moving...",
    "Therapist: And now? SUDS?",
    "Client: Still a 9... maybe edging towards 10. My heart feels like it's going to burst out of my chest.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Remember, you're here now, not there.",
    "Client: (nodding, taking deep breaths) We make it back behind the wall. I'm calling for a medic, but deep down, I know... I know he's gone. The guilt, the fear, the anger... it's all crashing over me...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down a bit. Maybe an 8 now. I'm... I'm remembering that I'm here, in your office.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're doing excellent work. Let's start to bring you back...",
    "Client: (opening eyes, looking shaken) That was... intense. I haven't let myself remember that day so vividly in years.",
    "Therapist: You showed incredible courage. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Drained, but... maybe a little lighter? My SUDS is down to about a 5 now.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. We'll process this more next time. Well done today."
