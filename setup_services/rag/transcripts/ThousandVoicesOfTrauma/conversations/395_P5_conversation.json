    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this session all week. The idea of revisiting those memories... it's terrifying. But I trust you, Dr. Thompson. I know you wouldn't suggest something that wasn't helpful.",
    "Therapist: Your anxiety is understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about losing control. What if I can't handle the emotions that come up? And... I'm scared of feeling that helpless again. It's taken me so long to feel somewhat safe, and I'm afraid this might undo all that progress.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. Let's address them together.",
    "Client: Okay... I appreciate that. It's just... every time I think about my ex-husband and the abuse, my heart starts racing. I've worked so hard to put it behind me, especially since the divorce. But I guess that's why we're doing this, right? Because it's not really behind me at all.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. This process helps integrate those experiences. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: How long will we be doing this? And what if I need to stop? I'm worried I might panic or... I don't know, just completely fall apart.",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. You can stop anytime. What else?",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I guess I'm also wondering what happens after? Will I feel worse before I feel better? And how will this help with my nightmares and flashbacks?",
    "Therapist: It may be challenging initially, but it often reduces symptoms over time. Shall we discuss the process?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think understanding what's going to happen might help me feel more in control. And maybe... maybe it'll help me gather my courage. Because I do want to get better. I'm tired of living in fear, of flinching at loud noises, of not being able to trust anyone.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your courage. Let's walk through the steps together.",
    "Client: Okay, I'm listening. And thank you for saying that. Sometimes I don't feel very courageous at all. But I'm here, and I'm willing to try. That has to count for something, right?",
    "Therapist: It absolutely does. Your commitment is commendable. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. I mean, I'm still nervous, but I feel a bit more prepared now. Can you... can you just remind me one more time that I'm safe here? I know it sounds silly, but it helps to hear it.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Maria. I'm here to support you throughout.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Thompson. That means a lot. Okay, let's do this. I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Where do we start?"
