    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also kind of numb at the same time. You know? I can still see those messages on my screen, all those horrible comments about my appearance after I posted that picture from the hospital. It's making my stomach churn.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What physical sensations are you noticing right now?",
    "Client: My hands are clammy, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's hard to take a deep breath. I keep thinking about how exposed I felt, lying in that hospital bed, and then having strangers on the internet pick apart every detail of my appearance. It's like I can't escape that vulnerability.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep hearing their words. \"Ugly.\" \"Attention-seeking.\" \"Pathetic.\" It's like they're echoing in my head. And I start to wonder, what if they're right? What if I am all those things? I know it's not rational, but in this moment, it feels so real.",
    "Therapist: How does that belief impact you?",
    "Client: It makes me want to disappear. To never share anything about myself online again. I feel this overwhelming shame, like I'm not worthy of being seen or heard. And it's not just about the internet anymore. It bleeds into my real life too. I second-guess everything I say or do, wondering if people are judging me.",
    "Therapist: Mm. What else comes up for you?",
    "Client: I feel angry too. Not just at the bullies, but at myself for letting it affect me so much. I was already dealing with the trauma of my medical condition, and then this happened. It's like a double whammy, you know? I feel weak for not being able to just brush it off.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger manifest?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a fire in my gut. Sometimes I want to lash out, to hurt them back somehow. But mostly, I turn it inward. I criticize myself for every little thing. It's exhausting, constantly being at war with myself.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about that pattern?",
    "Client: I... I guess I'm perpetuating the cycle. The bullies aren't in my life anymore, but I've internalized their voices. I'm doing their job for them now. That's... that's pretty messed up, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: How does that realization sit with you?",
    "Client: It's uncomfortable. But also... maybe a little empowering? Like, if I'm the one keeping this going, maybe I have some control over stopping it too. I don't know how, but... it's a thought.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What would it look like to start that process?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe I could start by challenging those negative thoughts when they come up? Or... or maybe I could try to remember the people who were supportive during my hospital stay. Focus on their kindness instead of the cruelty of strangers.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea feel?",
    "Client: It feels... hopeful. A little scary too. Like, what if I try and fail? But... but also like maybe there's a way out of this cycle. Like maybe I don't have to be trapped in this moment forever.",
    "Therapist: What strengths can you draw on?",
    "Client: I... I guess I'm resilient. I mean, I survived my medical ordeal, right? And I'm here, doing this therapy work. That takes courage. And... and I have people who care about me. Who see the real me, not just what's on the surface.",
    "Therapist: How can those strengths help you move forward?",
    "Client: They... they remind me that I'm more than what happened to me. That I have value beyond my appearance or what strangers think. Maybe I can use that resilience to face my fears, to start reclaiming my voice online and in real life. It won't be easy, but... but maybe it's possible.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter somehow. Like I've put down a heavy weight I didn't even realize I was carrying. There's still fear and uncertainty, but also a glimmer of hope. Like maybe, just maybe, I can heal from this and come out stronger on the other side.",
    "Therapist: How would you like to close our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to set a small goal for myself. Maybe I could write down one positive thing about myself each day this week. Just as a start, you know? To begin countering those negative voices. It's a tiny step, but it feels like something I can actually do.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful plan. We'll pick up here next time.",
    "Client: Thank you. This was hard, but... but I think it was good. I feel like I understand myself a little better now. I'm nervous about what comes next, but also kind of excited to see where this journey takes me."
