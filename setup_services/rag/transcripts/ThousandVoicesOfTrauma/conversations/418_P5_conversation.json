    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Patel. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I suppose. A bit nervous about what we're going to do. I've been having more nightmares lately about the... incident.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you familiar with this?",
    "Client: Not really. Is it... is it going to be difficult? I'm already feeling anxious just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: It can be challenging, but it's very helpful. Shall I explain more?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I want to understand what I'm getting into. It's been so long since the attack, but sometimes it feels like it just happened yesterday. Will this really help?",
    "Therapist: It will. We'll revisit the memory in a safe space. It helps process the trauma.",
    "Client: Revisit it? Oh dear, I don't know if I can do that. Just thinking about those teeth and claws... (voice trembles) I'm sorry, I'm already getting upset.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. We'll go at your pace. How does that sound?",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's just... since my husband passed, I've felt so vulnerable. This attack made it worse. But I want to get better. For my children, you know?",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Shall we discuss what to expect?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I need to know what's coming. Will I have to close my eyes? Will you be guiding me through it? I'm worried I might... I don't know, lose control or something.",
    "Therapist: You'll describe the memory aloud. I'll be here to support you throughout.",
    "Client: Alright, I can try that. But what if I start panicking? Sometimes when I think about it, my heart races and I feel like I can't breathe. It's embarrassing, but it happens.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. We have techniques to help if that happens.",
    "Client: Okay, that's reassuring. I've been trying to be strong, you know? Running my business, taking care of everything alone. But this... it's been hard to shake off. Will this really help me move forward?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it's a proven method for reducing PTSD symptoms. You're very brave.",
    "Client: Thank you. I don't always feel brave, but I'm trying. So, how long will this take? And will we do this every session from now on?",
    "Therapist: We'll do this for about 30-45 minutes today. We'll continue in future sessions too.",
    "Client: I see. That's quite a long time to talk about... that. But I suppose if it helps, I'll do my best. Is there anything I should do to prepare myself before we start?",
    "Therapist: Just try to relax. Remember, you're safe here. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. Yes, let's do this. I want to get better, to not be afraid anymore. Thank you for being so patient with me. I'm nervous, but I trust you.",
    "Therapist: That's great. Let's start by taking a deep breath together."
