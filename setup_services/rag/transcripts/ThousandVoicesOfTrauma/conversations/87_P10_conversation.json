    "Therapist: Good morning, Mr. Thompson. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Ah, well... to be honest, I'm feeling a bit on edge. Been tossing and turning all night, thinking about having to relive... you know, that night.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: (Deep breath) I suppose we should. No use putting it off, right?",
    "Therapist: That's right. Start when you're ready, and remember to use present tense.",
    "Client: Okay... It's late evening. I'm sitting in my armchair, reading the newspaper. The house is quiet, just the ticking of the old grandfather clock in the hallway. I've got a glass of whiskey next to me - probably shouldn't, given the meds, but old habits... Anyway, I'm feeling relaxed, maybe even a bit drowsy.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear a noise. At first, I think it's just the house settling, you know? But then... there's another sound. Like... like someone's trying the back door handle. My heart starts racing. I'm frozen in my chair, straining to listen.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 40? It's building, though.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath and continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Right... So, I'm sitting there, and suddenly there's a loud crash. Glass breaking. I jump up, spilling my drink. My hands are shaking. I'm thinking, \"This can't be happening. Not here, not to me.\" I can hear footsteps now, heavy boots on the kitchen tile. I'm... I'm terrified. My throat's so dry I can barely swallow.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with it.",
    "Client: I... I try to move towards the phone, but my legs feel like lead. Then I see a shadow in the hallway. A man, big guy, wearing a dark hoodie. He's got something in his hand - a crowbar, I think. I want to run, to shout, but no sound comes out. I'm just standing there, trembling like a leaf.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 70. My heart's pounding just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Remember, you're safe here. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) The intruder, he sees me. Our eyes meet and there's this moment of... I don't know, shock maybe? Then he rushes at me. I finally find my voice and yell, but it sounds weak, pathetic. I try to back away, but I trip over the rug. I fall hard, hitting my head on the coffee table. Everything's spinning, I can taste blood in my mouth.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. Helpless. I feel like a frail old man, which I guess I am. I'm thinking about my late wife, wishing she was here. Wishing I could protect our home like I used to. The intruder is standing over me now, demanding money, jewelry. His voice is muffled, like I'm underwater. My vision's blurry from hitting my head.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm trying to focus, to understand what he wants. I point weakly towards the bedroom, where I keep some cash. He roughly pulls me up, pushes me ahead of him. I'm stumbling, dizzy. I can feel warm blood trickling down the side of my face. I'm thinking, \"Is this how it ends? In my own home?\"",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's pretty high. Maybe 85?",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. Remember, you survived this. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (Nods, breathing deeply) We get to the bedroom. He's shoving me around, tearing through drawers. I'm standing there, feeling useless, ashamed. He finds the cash box in my closet. I want to fight back, to do something, but I'm frozen. I keep thinking about how disappointed my son would be if he could see me now.",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. You did what you needed to survive.",
    "Client: I know, I know... but it doesn't feel that way. The intruder is stuffing cash and my wife's jewelry into his pockets. I see her wedding ring in his hand and something in me snaps. I lunge at him, trying to grab it. He pushes me hard and I fall again, this time hitting the nightstand. The pain is intense, shooting through my hip.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm angry. Furious, actually. At him, at myself. My hip is throbbing, and I'm lying there on the floor, watching him take everything. I feel so... so powerless.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. Keep going.",
    "Client: He's leaving now, but not before giving me one last kick. I hear him running down the stairs, then the back door slamming. I'm alone again, but the silence feels different now. Threatening. I'm in pain, scared, unsure if he might come back. I drag myself to the phone, dial 911 with shaking hands. My voice is barely a whisper when I tell them what happened.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still up there. Maybe 80?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a moment. Breathe.",
    "Client: (Takes a few deep breaths) I'm lying there on the floor, waiting for the police. Every sound makes me flinch. I'm cold, shivering. I keep replaying it in my mind, thinking of what I should have done differently. I feel... I feel broken. Not just physically, but... like something inside me is damaged.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are valid. Remember, you survived.",
    "Client: Yeah... I did. But it doesn't feel like a victory. The police arrive, then the ambulance. They're asking questions, examining me, but I feel detached from it all. Like I'm watching it happen to someone else. At the hospital, they're patching me up, telling me I'm lucky. Lucky! Ha! I don't feel lucky. I feel... I feel like I've lost something I can't get back.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, as you recall these moments?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix. Anger, shame, fear. Even now, months later, I can feel my heart racing. I'm safe, I know that, but... but part of me is still in that moment, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's completely understandable. You've been very brave today. How would you rate your distress now?",
    "Client: It's come down a bit. Maybe to a 60? I'm... I'm exhausted.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've done excellent work today. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay... yeah, that sounds good. I... I appreciate you listening. It's hard, but... but I think it helps to talk about it.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad you feel that way. Let's focus on some deep breathing exercises now."
