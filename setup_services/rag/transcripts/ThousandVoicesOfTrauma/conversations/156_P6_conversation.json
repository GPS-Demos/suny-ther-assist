    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important. Let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day. Describe what you're seeing and feeling.",
    "Client: I'm... I'm back at the base. It's hot, dusty. I can hear the distant sound of helicopters. The air feels thick with tension. I'm walking towards the mess hall when suddenly there's a loud explosion. My heart starts racing immediately.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 5. It's uncomfortable, but manageable.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: People are shouting, running in all directions. I see smoke rising from one of the buildings. My training kicks in, and I start moving towards the commotion. As I get closer, I can smell... oh god, I can smell burning flesh.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that memory. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My stomach is in knots. My hands are shaking. I feel like I can't breathe properly. It's like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to an 8. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: (taking a deep breath) Okay. As I get closer to the building, I see bodies. Some are moving, crying out for help. Others are... they're so still. I want to help everyone, but I don't know where to start. I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"This isn't real. This can't be happening.\" But it is. And I feel guilty because part of me wants to run away, to not see this. But I know I have to help.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's still at an 8. My heart is pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I start helping the injured, trying to triage. There's so much blood, so much pain. I can hear people screaming, crying. And then... then I see him. My friend, Tom. He's... he's not moving. I rush over, but I know... I know he's gone.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel like I'm going to be sick. My chest is so tight. I can't... I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. This is really intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Remember, you survived this.",
    "Client: (voice shaking) I know, but it feels so real. I can still smell the smoke, feel the heat. I remember feeling so powerless, so angry. Why did this happen? Why couldn't I save Tom?",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those feelings. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I remember the silence after. When the initial chaos died down. It was almost worse than the noise. Just this heavy, oppressive silence. And the weight of what had happened started to sink in.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's come down a bit. Maybe a 7. I still feel shaky, but... but I'm here. I'm not there anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You're here, and you're safe.",
    "Client: (taking a deep breath) Yeah. I'm here. It's over. But... but it still hurts so much.",
    "Therapist: That's completely understandable. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. Sad. But also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved? Like I've let some of it out.",
    "Therapist: That's often how people feel after these exercises. SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5 now. I feel more... grounded, I guess.",
    "Therapist: You did incredibly well. Let's take a few deep breaths together.",
    "Client: (breathing deeply) Okay. That helps. Thank you.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll end here for today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... okay. Like I've faced something I've been avoiding for a long time.",
