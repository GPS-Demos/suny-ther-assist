    "Therapist: Good morning, John. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Oh, hello Dr. Thompson. I'm... well, I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're supposed to dive into some heavy stuff today, and I'm not sure I'm ready for it. My hands are a bit clammy just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Just... give me a moment to collect myself. *deep breath* Okay, I think I can start now.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in my old flat. It's evening, and the lights are dim. I can hear the telly on in the background, some game show, I think. The air feels heavy, like a storm's brewing outside. I'm sitting on the sofa, my hands wrapped around a mug of tea, but it's gone cold. I haven't touched it.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: The door slams. It's her. My ex. She's... she's shouting before she even gets in the room. \"Where's dinner?\" she yells. \"You useless old man, can't even have a meal ready!\" I... I feel my stomach drop. My throat's gone dry.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, John. What's your distress level right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 6, I'd say. My heart's racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Right. *exhales* She storms into the living room. Her face is red, contorted with anger. I can smell alcohol on her breath. She's swaying slightly. \"I work all day,\" she's saying, \"and you can't even do this one thing!\" I try to speak, to explain that I wasn't feeling well, but she cuts me off. \"Excuses, always excuses!\" She knocks the mug out of my hand. Tea splashes across the carpet.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. Ashamed. I want to disappear into the sofa. My chest feels tight, like I can't breathe properly. I'm... I'm shaking. I can feel my hands trembling.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to an 8 now.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here in a safe place. Take a moment to ground yourself if you need to.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... okay. I'm... I'm still there. She's looming over me now. Her words are slurring together, but I can make out the insults. \"Pathetic,\" she's saying. \"Weak.\" Each word feels like a physical blow. I'm shrinking into myself, trying to make myself as small as possible.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. Keep going.",
    "Client: She... she grabs my arm. Her nails dig in. I can feel the pain, sharp and sudden. \"Look at me when I'm talking to you!\" she screams. I force myself to meet her eyes, and I see... I see such hatred there. It's like looking into an abyss. I feel... I feel worthless. Like maybe she's right about everything she's saying.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. God, it feels so real.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, John. Remember, this is a memory. You've survived this.",
    "Client: *shaky breath* Right. Yes. I... I remember now. She's still yelling, but it's becoming a blur. I can hear my own heartbeat in my ears. I'm frozen, can't move, can't speak. Then... then she raises her hand. I flinch, expecting the blow, but it doesn't come. Instead, she grabs a vase from the side table and hurls it at the wall behind me. The crash is deafening. I can feel shards of pottery raining down on me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you experiencing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm trembling all over. My ears are ringing from the crash. I can smell her perfume mixed with alcohol, it's overwhelming. I feel... I feel so small, so helpless. Like a child being scolded. But there's something else too... a spark of anger. Why am I letting her do this to me?",
    "Therapist: That's important. Hold onto that feeling. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still at a 9. But it feels different now.",
    "Therapist: Different how?",
    "Client: It's... it's not just fear anymore. There's anger there too. And... and a bit of sadness. For both of us, really. How did we end up here?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: She... she seems to deflate suddenly. Like all the anger's gone out of her. She slumps onto the sofa next to me, puts her head in her hands. I can hear her sobbing. And I... I don't know what to do. Part of me wants to comfort her, but another part is still terrified, still angry. I just sit there, frozen, listening to her cry.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Confused. Torn. I... I hate seeing her in pain, even after everything. But I'm also... I'm also relieved that the storm has passed, at least for now. And I feel... I feel so, so tired. Like I could sleep for days.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about a 7, I think. The intensity has faded a bit.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, John. Can you stay with the scene a little longer?",
    "Client: Yes, I... I think so. We sit there for what feels like hours. Her sobs gradually quiet down. I can hear the ticking of the clock on the mantle. It's so loud in the silence. Eventually, she stands up, stumbles towards the bedroom without a word. I'm left alone in the wreckage of the living room. Broken pottery, spilled tea, the acrid smell of her anger still hanging in the air.",
    "Therapist: And how do you feel in this moment?",
    "Client: Empty. Drained. But also... also a little stronger, somehow. Like I've weathered a storm. I start to clean up, picking up the larger pieces of the vase. My hands are shaking, but I keep at it. It feels... it feels like taking back a little bit of control.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 5, I think. I'm feeling calmer.",
    "Therapist: You've done an excellent job, John. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Take a few deep breaths.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Thank you, Dr. Thompson. That was... that was intense. But I feel like I understand something now that I didn't before.",
    "Therapist: What's that, John?",
    "Client: That I... that I wasn't as powerless as I thought. Even in that moment, there was a part of me that was strong, that survived.",
    "Therapist: That's a very important insight. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired. Drained. But also... also a bit proud, I suppose. Like I've faced something I've been running from for a long time.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You've shown great courage today. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves before we end the session.",
    "Client: Yes, that sounds good. I... I think I need a moment to just... to just be here, you know?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take all the time you need."
