    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart is still racing, and I feel like I can't catch my breath. The memory of being in that hospital bed, all alone... it's so vivid. I can almost smell the disinfectant and hear the beeping of the machines.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's like... it's like I'm right back there, you know? I keep thinking about how close I came to dying, and how nobody was there. My kids didn't even visit. I just... I felt so abandoned.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. Can you tell me more about that feeling of abandonment?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a physical ache in my chest. I remember lying there, day after day, watching the door and hoping someone would come. But nobody did. I kept thinking, \"Is this how it ends? Am I going to die alone?\" And then I'd get so angry. I'd think, \"I raised those kids. I gave them everything. And now, when I need them most, they're nowhere to be found.\" It's... it's just so painful.",
    "Therapist: I hear how painful that was for you. What thoughts are going through your mind as you recall this?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking that maybe I deserved it. Maybe I wasn't a good enough mother. Or maybe... maybe I'm just not worth loving. And then I feel guilty for thinking that way about my kids. It's all so confusing. I just... I don't know how to make sense of it all.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to have conflicting feelings. How does your body feel as you're sharing this?",
    "Client: My shoulders are so tense, they're practically up to my ears. And my stomach... it's in knots. I feel like I might be sick. It's like my body is reliving all of it, you know? The fear, the loneliness, the anger... it's all there, right under my skin.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to curl up and hide from the world. But another part... I don't know. Maybe I need to feel heard? To know that someone understands how much this hurt me. That it wasn't okay, what happened. That I didn't deserve to be left alone like that.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. How does it feel to express that need?",
    "Client: It's... it's scary. But also, kind of liberating? Like, for so long, I've been trying to pretend it didn't affect me as much as it did. But saying it out loud... it's like I'm finally acknowledging how much it hurt. And that's terrifying, but also... I don't know. Maybe it's a step towards healing?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm noticing that... that maybe I'm stronger than I thought. I survived that experience. I'm here, talking about it. And even though it's painful, I'm facing it. That's... that's something, right? And I'm realizing that maybe... maybe it wasn't my fault. Maybe my kids were just scared and didn't know how to handle it. It doesn't make it okay, but... I don't know. Maybe it means I'm not unlovable after all.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant shift. How does this new perspective feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's weird. Like, there's a part of me that wants to cling to the old beliefs because they're familiar. But this new way of thinking... it feels lighter somehow. Like maybe there's hope. And that's scary too, you know? Because what if I'm wrong? What if I let myself hope and then get hurt again? But... but I think I want to try. To believe that maybe things can be different.",
    "Therapist: That takes courage. What do you think this means for your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I... I think it means I have a lot of work to do. But maybe... maybe that's okay? Maybe it means I'm not stuck. That there's a path forward, even if I can't see the whole thing yet. I think... I think I want to try to reconnect with my kids. Not right away, but... eventually. And I want to work on believing that I'm worthy of love and care. It's going to be hard, but... I think it might be worth it.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful goal. How are you feeling now compared to when we started?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, honestly. But it's a different kind of tired. Before, I felt drained and hopeless. Now, I'm tired, but there's also this little spark of... something. Maybe hope? Or determination? I don't know exactly what to call it, but it feels like maybe, just maybe, things could get better. And that's... that's new for me.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for your openness. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to explore more about how to start believing in my own worth. And maybe... maybe start thinking about how to approach reconnecting with my kids. Is that... is that something we could work on?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll continue this journey together. How do you want to close today's session?",
    "Client: I... I think I just want to sit with this feeling for a moment. This tiny bit of hope. It's fragile, but it's there. And I want to remember that, you know? That even after going through something so painful, there can still be hope. Is it... is it okay if we just sit in silence for a minute before we end?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take that moment together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I'm ready to face the rest of the day now. It won't be easy, but... but I feel a little stronger than I did before.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Take care, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. See you then."
