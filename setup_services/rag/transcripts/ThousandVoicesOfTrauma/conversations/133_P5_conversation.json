    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Farsi. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been thinking about our last session and what you mentioned about imaginal exposure. It's been on my mind all week.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about reliving that horrible accident. It's been years, but thinking about it still makes my heart race. And with everything in the news about police brutality lately, it's bringing up a lot of anxiety. I'm not sure I can handle going through it all again.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your honesty. Imaginal exposure can be challenging, but it's a crucial step in healing.",
    "Client: I understand that, but... I'm scared. What if I panic? What if I can't stop crying? I've worked so hard to keep these memories at bay, and now you're asking me to face them head-on. It feels counterintuitive.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. Let's discuss how we'll approach this together.",
    "Client: Okay, I'm listening. But please understand, this isn't easy for me. My husband has been so supportive, but he doesn't really understand what I'm going through. And at work, I have to maintain this professional facade all the time. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: I hear you. Your strength is admirable. Shall we go over the process?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I need to know exactly what to expect. Will it be like opening Pandora's box? Once we start, will I be able to close it again?",
    "Therapist: It's controlled. We'll go at your pace, and I'll guide you throughout.",
    "Client: That's somewhat reassuring. But what about afterwards? I have responsibilities, a job, a family. I can't afford to fall apart.",
    "Therapist: We'll end with grounding techniques. You won't leave until you feel stable.",
    "Client: Okay, that helps. I suppose I should mention that since we last met, I've been having more nightmares. They're not always about the accident, but they leave me feeling anxious and on edge. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: It's common. Nightmares often increase initially but should improve with treatment.",
    "Client: I see. It's just... sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel normal again. Will this really help me move past the trauma?",
    "Therapist: Many find it very effective. It can significantly reduce PTSD symptoms over time.",
    "Client: I want to believe that. I really do. It's just hard to imagine feeling better when I've struggled for so long. But I trust you, and I'm willing to try. What do I need to do to prepare?",
    "Therapist: Just bring your willingness to engage. Your courage is the most important tool.",
    "Client: Alright. I'll do my best. Can you tell me one more time why this is so important? I need to remind myself why I'm putting myself through this.",
    "Therapist: It helps process the trauma memory, reducing its power over you.",
    "Client: I understand. It's not easy, but I'm ready to take this step. Thank you for your patience with all my questions and concerns.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your commitment is admirable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Let's do this."
