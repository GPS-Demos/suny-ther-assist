    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do. I've been thinking about our last session and the idea of this imaginal exposure thing. It's been making me anxious.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... I've spent so much time trying to avoid thinking about the accident and my divorce. The idea of purposely reliving it feels... terrifying. I mean, what if I can't handle it? What if it makes everything worse? I've been having more nightmares lately just thinking about doing this.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How about we discuss the process?",
    "Client: Yeah, that would be helpful. I mean, I understand the concept, but I'm still struggling to see how deliberately putting myself through that trauma again is going to help. It feels counterintuitive, you know? Like, I've been trying so hard to move on, and now you're asking me to go back there. It's... it's scary.",
    "Therapist: I hear you. The goal is to process the memory, not re-traumatize you.",
    "Client: Process the memory? What does that mean exactly? Because right now, whenever I think about the accident or my ex-wife leaving, it's like I'm right back there. My heart races, I can't breathe, I feel this overwhelming sense of panic. How is intentionally putting myself through that going to help?",
    "Therapist: By facing it in a safe environment, we can reduce its power over you.",
    "Client: I want to believe that, I really do. But it's hard to imagine feeling safe while talking about the worst moments of my life. I mean, I've tried talking about it before, with friends, family, even my ex-wife during our attempts at counseling. It always ends up with me feeling worse, more alone. How will this be different?",
    "Therapist: I'll guide you through it, providing support and coping strategies throughout.",
    "Client: Okay, that's... that's good to know. I appreciate that you'll be there with me. Can you tell me more about these coping strategies? Because honestly, I feel like I've tried everything - deep breathing, distraction, positive thinking. Sometimes they help a little, but often it feels like nothing can stop the flood of emotions and memories once they start.",
    "Therapist: We'll practice grounding techniques and controlled breathing before we begin.",
    "Client: Alright, that sounds helpful. I'm willing to try. But what happens if it becomes too much? What if I start panicking or can't continue? I'm worried about falling apart completely and not being able to put myself back together. This divorce, on top of the accident... it's just been so much to handle.",
    "Therapist: You can stop anytime. We'll go at your pace and take breaks as needed.",
    "Client: That's... that's reassuring. Thank you. I guess I'm just scared of what might come up. There's so much I've been trying not to think about - the pain, the fear, the feeling of losing everything. My marriage, my health, my sense of security... it all fell apart so quickly. How do I face all of that without getting overwhelmed?",
    "Therapist: We'll focus on one aspect at a time, building your resilience gradually.",
    "Client: One aspect at a time... okay, I think I can handle that. It's just, everything feels so interconnected, you know? The accident led to my depression, which strained my marriage, which led to the divorce, which made my depression worse... it's like a vicious cycle. But I trust you. If you think this will help, I'm willing to try. I'm just... I'm tired of feeling this way, of being afraid of my own memories.",
    "Therapist: Your willingness shows strength. Shall we start with some relaxation exercises?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I could definitely use some relaxation right now. My heart's already racing just talking about all of this. But... thank you. For listening, for not pushing too hard, for making me feel like maybe there's hope. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Let's begin. Take a deep breath..."
