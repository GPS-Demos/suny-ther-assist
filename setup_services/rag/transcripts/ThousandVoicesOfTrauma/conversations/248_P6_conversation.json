    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Can you describe the animal attack, starting from the moment you first noticed danger?",
    "Client: Okay... I was on patrol near a village in Afghanistan. It was hot, dusty. I remember the weight of my gear, the sweat on my neck. Suddenly, I heard growling. I turned and saw this huge, mangy dog. Its teeth were bared, foam at its mouth. I froze.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, about a 4. I'm feeling a bit tense, but okay.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue, please.",
    "Client: The dog lunged at me. I tried to back away, but I tripped on a rock. I fell hard, my rifle clattering away. The dog was on me in seconds, snapping at my face. I could smell its rancid breath, feel its claws tearing at my uniform. I screamed for help, but no one was close enough.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe a 6 or 7. My heart's racing, and I feel like I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I managed to get my arm up to protect my throat. The dog sank its teeth into my forearm. The pain was excruciating. I could feel its teeth grinding against bone. I punched at its face with my free hand, but it wouldn't let go. Blood was everywhere. I thought I was going to die there, alone, killed by a rabid dog instead of enemy fire.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm back there. My arm is throbbing, and I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a deep breath. What happened next?",
    "Client: I... I heard shouting. My squad had heard me. The dog was still tearing at my arm when they arrived. Someone fired a shot, and the dog yelped and ran off. I was a mess, covered in blood and dirt. They had to medevac me out. I needed surgery and rabies shots. I still have the scars.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: A little better. Maybe an 8. My chest feels tight, and I'm sweating, but the shaking has stopped.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's take a moment. What do you notice around you right now?",
    "Client: I... I see the blue walls of your office. The plant in the corner. I can hear traffic outside.",
    "Therapist: Good. And your SUDS?",
    "Client: Down to a 6, I think. I still feel on edge, but I'm here, not there.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. How do you feel about what we've done today?",
    "Client: It was intense. Scary. But... I got through it. I didn't think I could talk about it without completely falling apart.",
    "Therapist: You showed incredible strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired. Drained. But also... maybe a little proud? My SUDS is probably a 4 again.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's end here and discuss how to care for yourself after this session."
