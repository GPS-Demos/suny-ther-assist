    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I understand why we're doing this.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and describe the memory.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in the hospital. The lights are so bright, and there's this constant beeping from machines. I can smell disinfectant. The doctor is telling me about the tumor they found. His words are muffled, like I'm underwater. My heart is racing...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: It's about a 6. I can feel my palms getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: Keep going. You're doing well.",
    "Client: The doctor is saying words like \"malignant\" and \"aggressive treatment.\" I feel so alone. My children are far away, and I have no one to hold my hand. The room seems to be spinning a little...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to an 8. My chest feels tight, and I'm having trouble breathing normally.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I remember thinking about my life, all the things I haven't done. The fear was overwhelming. I wanted to run, but I couldn't move. The doctor kept talking, but I couldn't focus on his words anymore...",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's still an 8. My hands are shaking a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I started thinking about my parents, how they died from cancer too. I felt so helpless, like history was repeating itself. The room felt so cold, and I was shivering...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually gone down a bit. Maybe a 7? I'm starting to feel a little calmer as I talk about it.",
    "Therapist: That's good. What else do you remember?",
    "Client: The nurse came in and put her hand on my shoulder. She had kind eyes. It was the first time I felt like someone really saw me as a person, not just a patient. I started crying then...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My SUDS is about a 6. Talking about the nurse made me feel a bit better.",
    "Therapist: That's natural. Continue with what happened next.",
    "Client: They started explaining the treatment options. Chemotherapy, radiation... it all sounded so scary. But I remember thinking, \"I have to fight this. I'm not ready to give up.\" It was like a small flame of hope in all that darkness...",
    "Therapist: And your current SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5 now. I'm feeling more in control as I talk about it.",

    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm surprised. I thought reliving this would be unbearable, but I feel... lighter somehow. Like I'm seeing it from a different perspective now.",
    "Therapist: That's often the case. Shall we end the exposure here?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that's good for today. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You did all the work. Well done."
