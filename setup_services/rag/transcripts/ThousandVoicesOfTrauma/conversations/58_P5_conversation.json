    "Therapist: Welcome, Rajesh. Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm... not sure, to be honest. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of revisiting those painful memories from my divorce and the bullying I experienced... it's overwhelming. I've spent years trying to forget all of that.",
    "Therapist: Your apprehension is understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried that reliving those experiences will set me back. I've worked hard to build my business and create a new life after the divorce. What if this brings back all the pain and anger I've tried to move past?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How do you think facing these memories might help?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe it could help me process things I've been avoiding. But it's scary. The bullying I experienced in school and then the rejection during my divorce - they're connected in my mind. Both made me feel so worthless and alone. I'm not sure I'm ready to face all that again.",
    "Therapist: Your insight is valuable. Shall we discuss how this process can aid healing?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I need to understand why we're doing this. It feels counterintuitive to deliberately bring up painful memories when I've been trying so hard to move on with my life.",
    "Therapist: Exposure helps process trauma, reducing its power over time. How does that align with your goals?",
    "Client: I guess... if it could help me feel less haunted by these experiences, that would be amazing. I'm tired of feeling like I'm not good enough, of second-guessing myself in relationships and at work. If facing these memories head-on could help me move past that, maybe it's worth trying.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. Your courage is commendable. What support do you need during this process?",
    "Client: I think I'll need a lot of reassurance. And maybe some techniques to ground myself if things get too intense? I'm worried about getting lost in the memories and emotions. Also, is it okay if I need to stop or take breaks?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll go at your pace and use grounding techniques. Shall we start with a brief exercise?",
    "Client: Okay, I think I'm ready to try. But can you walk me through what exactly we'll be doing? And how long will this process take? I want to be prepared for what's coming.",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll start with a calm memory, then gradually approach trauma. It's a step-by-step process.",
    "Client: That sounds less daunting. Starting with a calm memory might help me feel more in control. I'm still nervous, but I think I can do this. Thank you for explaining it to me and for being so patient with my questions and concerns.",
    "Therapist: Your willingness to engage is admirable. Remember, you're in control throughout. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I am. I'm scared, but also hopeful that this might help me finally move forward. Let's do this."
