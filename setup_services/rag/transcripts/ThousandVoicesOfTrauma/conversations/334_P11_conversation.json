    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Rahul?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. That memory of my father's outburst... it just felt so real again. I could almost smell the alcohol on his breath, you know? And the sound of glass shattering when he threw that bottle... it's like I was right back there in our old living room.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The fear, I think. I remembered how small and helpless I felt, hiding behind the couch. But also... I noticed something different this time. I realized I was angry too. Not just scared, but furious that he was hurting my mom like that. I've never really acknowledged that anger before.",
    "Therapist: That's an important observation. How do you feel about that anger now?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. Part of me feels guilty for being angry at my dad. He was sick, you know? The alcohol... But another part of me feels like it's okay to be angry. Like maybe I deserve to feel that way after what he put us through. I don't know. It's confusing.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have mixed feelings. What else?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how this affects me now. Like, I've always had trouble trusting people, especially in relationships. And now I'm wondering if that's connected to what I saw between my parents. It's like... I'm afraid of getting close to someone because I'm scared they might hurt me or let me down, just like my dad did to my mom.",
    "Therapist: That's a profound insight. How does making that connection feel?",
    "Client: It's... kind of a relief, actually. Like, maybe there's a reason I am the way I am. But it's also scary. I don't want to be alone forever, you know? I want to be able to trust someone, to have a healthy relationship. But I don't know how to get past this fear.",
    "Therapist: Your awareness is a big step. What else came up for you?",
    "Client: I thought about my drinking. I've been doing better lately, but... during the exposure, I remembered how I used to drink to numb myself, to forget those memories. And I realized I'm still doing that sometimes, just not as much. It's like I'm following in my dad's footsteps, and that terrifies me.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How might this inform your recovery goals?",
    "Client: I think... I need to face these memories head-on instead of trying to numb them. Maybe if I can process this trauma, I won't feel the need to drink as much. And maybe I can start to trust people more, to open up. It's scary, but I want to break this cycle. I don't want to be like my dad.",
    "Therapist: That's a courageous goal. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's tough, really tough. But I think it's necessary. Each time we do this, I feel like I understand myself a little better. And even though it's painful, there's a part of me that feels... I don't know, stronger maybe? Like I'm finally facing this instead of running from it. I want to keep going.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is commendable. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Yeah, I... I'm grateful for this, actually. It's hard, but it feels like I'm finally dealing with something I've been avoiding my whole life. And I'm hopeful, you know? For the first time in a long time, I feel like maybe I can change, maybe I can have a different life than what I saw growing up. It's scary, but... it's also kind of exciting.",
