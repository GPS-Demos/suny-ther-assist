    "Therapist: Alright, Raj, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I understand why we're doing this.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's begin. Close your eyes and describe the night of the home invasion.",
    "Client: Okay... I was in my room, working late on my laptop. It was around 11 PM. The house was quiet, my housemates were already asleep. Suddenly, I heard a loud crash from downstairs. At first, I thought maybe someone had dropped something, but then I heard unfamiliar voices. My heart started racing...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10. I can feel my palms getting a bit sweaty.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue, please.",
    "Client: I... I froze for a moment, unsure what to do. Then I heard heavy footsteps coming up the stairs. I panicked and looked for somewhere to hide. I could hear them trying doorknobs, getting closer to my room. My breathing was so loud, I was sure they'd hear me. I... I can feel my chest tightening now, just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Maybe a 6 now? My heart's beating faster.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Keep going, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Right, okay. So, I hid in my closet, trying to make myself as small as possible. I could hear them enter my room, rummaging through my things. I was terrified they'd find me. I remember the smell of my winter coat pressed against my face, trying not to make a sound. Every noise they made, every drawer they opened, it felt like an eternity. I... I can almost smell that coat now.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's higher now. Maybe an 8? I feel like I'm back there, I can feel the fear in my stomach.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Raj. Take a deep breath. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's... it's intense. They were in my room for what felt like forever. I heard them take my laptop, some other electronics. Then, finally, they left. But I was too scared to come out. I stayed in that closet for hours, shaking, afraid they might come back. When I finally came out, it was dawn. The house was a mess, things strewn everywhere. I felt... violated. Like my safe space had been taken from me.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's come down a bit. Maybe a 7? I feel drained, but also relieved it's over.",
    "Therapist: That's good. How are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: My muscles are tense, especially in my shoulders. I feel exhausted, like I've run a marathon.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've done really well today, Raj.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was hard, but... I think it helped to talk through it like this.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad. We'll end here for today. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... okay. My SUDS is probably down to a 4 again. I feel... I don't know, maybe a little stronger?",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Raj. We'll pick this up next session."
