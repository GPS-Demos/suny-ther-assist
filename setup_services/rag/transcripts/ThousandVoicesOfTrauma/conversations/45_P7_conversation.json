    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and describe the memory of your imprisonment.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in a small, dark room. The walls are concrete, and there's a single lightbulb hanging from the ceiling. It's flickering, making shadows dance on the walls. I can feel the cold seeping through my thin clothes. The air is damp and musty. I'm sitting on a hard metal chair, my hands are tied behind my back. I can hear footsteps echoing in the distance, getting closer and closer...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: The footsteps stop outside the door. I can hear keys jingling, and my heart starts racing. The door creaks open, and a tall figure enters. I can't see their face clearly, but I can smell cigarette smoke. They're carrying something... it looks like a tray. They set it down on a small table in the corner. I'm trying to control my breathing, but I'm so scared. I don't know what they're going to do to me...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The person turns to face me. It's a man, middle-aged, with a stern expression. He doesn't say anything, just stares at me. I feel so small, so helpless. He picks up something from the tray - it's a syringe. My heart is pounding so hard I think it might burst out of my chest. I want to scream, to beg him not to hurt me, but my voice is caught in my throat. He's walking towards me now, the syringe in his hand...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can. This is where it gets really bad. I can feel the panic rising in my chest, just like it did then. My palms are sweating, and I feel dizzy.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe now.",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. He grabs my arm roughly, and I flinch. I can feel the cold metal of the needle against my skin. I'm trying to pull away, but the ropes are too tight. He pushes the needle in, and I feel a burning sensation spreading through my arm. Everything starts to go fuzzy... I'm fighting to stay conscious, but it's like I'm sinking into quicksand. The last thing I see is his face, emotionless, watching me as I slip away...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How do you feel?",
    "Client: I feel... shaky. My heart is racing, and I can feel tears on my cheeks. But... I also feel a strange sense of relief. Like I've finally let out something I've been holding in for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *takes a deep breath* It's strange, but talking about it... it makes it feel less overwhelming. Like I'm looking at it from the outside now, instead of being trapped in it. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. It's a common experience.",
    "Client: I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. But here I am, doing it. It's still painful, still scary, but... I feel stronger. Like maybe I can face this after all.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I couldn't have done this without your support. It's like... for the first time, I can see a light at the end of this dark tunnel. I know I have a long way to go, but I feel hopeful. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: It's a positive sign. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I think I understand now why we're doing this. Facing the memory head-on... it's terrifying, but it's also empowering. I've spent so long running from this, but now I'm standing my ground. It hurts, but it's a good kind of hurt. Like I'm finally starting to heal.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent insight. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel drained, but in a good way. Like I've just run a marathon. My body feels heavy, but my mind feels... lighter? Clearer? It's hard to explain. I'm exhausted, but I also feel a sense of accomplishment. Is it okay to feel proud of myself?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You should be proud.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd say this, but I'm actually looking forward to our next session. Not because I enjoy reliving this trauma, but because I can feel myself getting stronger each time we do this. It's like I'm reclaiming parts of myself that I thought were lost forever.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Well done today."
