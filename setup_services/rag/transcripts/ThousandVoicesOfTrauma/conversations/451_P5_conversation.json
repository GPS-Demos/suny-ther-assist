    "Therapist: Welcome, Priya. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been thinking about this session all week, and I'm not sure what to expect. The idea of reliving my experiences with bullying and discussing human trafficking... it's making me quite anxious.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. Are you ready?",
    "Client: I think so... but could you explain a bit more about what that means? I'm not entirely sure I grasp the concept.",
    "Therapist: Of course. It's a technique to process traumatic memories. We'll revisit them in a safe environment.",
    "Client: That sounds... intense. Will it be like reliving the whole experience again? I'm not sure I can handle that.",
    "Therapist: It may feel intense, but you're in control. We'll go at your pace. How does that sound?",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I'm still nervous, but knowing I have some control helps. Will you be guiding me through it?",
    "Therapist: Yes, I'll be here to support you throughout. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about how I'll react. What if I have a panic attack or break down crying? It's embarrassing, but I'm also concerned about disappointing you if I can't go through with it.",
    "Therapist: Your reactions are normal. There's no judgment here. Your safety is my priority.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I guess I'm also wondering how this will help with my PTSD symptoms. It seems counterintuitive to revisit these painful memories.",
    "Therapist: Great question. Exposure helps process trauma, reducing its power over time. It's brave of you to participate.",
    "Client: Thank you. That makes sense, although it's still a bit scary. I've been struggling with nightmares and flashbacks, especially since starting university. It's been affecting my studies and my relationship. I really hope this helps.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Shall we begin? Remember, we can pause anytime.",
    "Client: Okay, I think I'm ready. Just... please be patient with me if I struggle. This is all new territory for me, and I want to do it right.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great already. Let's start slowly. Close your eyes when you're comfortable.",
    "Client: Alright, my eyes are closed. My heart is racing a bit, but I'm trying to stay calm. What should I do next?",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Picture a safe place. When you're ready, we'll start."
