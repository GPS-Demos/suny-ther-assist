    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure exercise. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the combat situation you experienced?",
    "Client: Okay... I was on patrol in Afghanistan. It was hot, dusty. We were walking through a small village. The streets were narrow, buildings close together. I remember feeling tense, scanning every window, every doorway.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there was a loud explosion. I felt the ground shake. Dust and debris filled the air. I couldn't see clearly, but I heard screaming. My ears were ringing. I instinctively dropped to the ground, my heart racing.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The smell... It was awful. Burning, acrid. I could taste it. As the dust settled, I saw one of my squad members. He was... he was badly injured. There was so much blood. I froze for a second, I couldn't move.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I knew I had to help him, but I was terrified. What if there was another explosion? What if we were being ambushed? But I couldn't leave him there. I crawled over, trying to stay low. My hands were shaking as I tried to assess his injuries.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I called for a medic, my voice cracking. I applied pressure to his wounds, but there was so much blood. I kept talking to him, telling him to hang on, but his eyes were unfocused. I felt so helpless, so scared.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Other squad members arrived. We got him evacuated, but... he didn't make it. I keep replaying it in my mind, wondering if I could have done more, if I had acted faster...",
    "Therapist: Remember, you did your best in an impossible situation.",
    "Client: I know, but it's hard. After that, every patrol felt like a nightmare. I was constantly on edge, expecting the worst. Even now, loud noises make me jump. I feel guilty for surviving when others didn't.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. You've shown incredible strength.",
    "Client: Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel normal again. The memories, the guilt, the fear... it's all so overwhelming. I feel like I brought the war back with me.",
    "Therapist: It's a process, but you're making progress.",
    "Client: I hope so. It's just... hard to see sometimes. Especially when I'm alone at night, and the memories come flooding back. I feel so isolated, like no one can understand what I've been through.",
    "Therapist: You're not alone in this. We're here to support you.",
    "Client: Thank you. It helps to talk about it, even though it's painful. I just want to find a way to live with these experiences without them controlling my life.",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. You're on the right path.",
    "Client: I hope so. Some days are better than others. Today was particularly tough. Coming here, knowing I'd have to relive those moments... it took everything I had just to show up.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted, honestly. Talking about it always drains me. But there's also a small sense of... relief? Like I've let out a breath I've been holding for years.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive sign. Would you like to end here?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that's enough for today. It's a lot to process. But... thank you for listening, for helping me through this.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Take care of yourself."
