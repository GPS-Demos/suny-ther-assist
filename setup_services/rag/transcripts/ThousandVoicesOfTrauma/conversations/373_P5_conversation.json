    "Therapist: Welcome, John. Today, we'll be preparing for an imaginal exposure exercise. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: I'm not really sure what to expect, to be honest. I've been dreading this session a bit. The idea of revisiting my experiences with the hurricane... it's making me pretty anxious. Can you tell me more about what we'll be doing?",
    "Therapist: Of course. It's natural to feel anxious. This exercise helps process trauma memories. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Well, I guess my main concern is... will this make things worse? I've worked hard to try and put those memories behind me. I'm worried that bringing them up again might set me back. And, to be frank, I'm scared of how I might react. What if I completely fall apart?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. This process can be challenging, but it's designed to help, not harm. We'll go at your pace. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's somewhat reassuring. I appreciate that you're not rushing me into this. I suppose I'm just worried about losing control. In my professional life, I always need to be composed and in charge. The idea of letting go of that control, even in a therapy session, is pretty daunting. But I understand this is probably necessary for my recovery, right?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. Facing these memories can reduce their power over you. Remember, you're in control here. Shall we discuss what to expect?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think having a clear idea of what's going to happen might help me feel more prepared. And maybe knowing what to expect will help me maintain some sense of control. So, what exactly will we be doing?",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit the traumatic memory in detail. You'll describe it aloud while I guide you. It may be intense, but I'm here to support you throughout.",
    "Client: Okay, that makes sense. I'm still nervous, but I think I understand the process a bit better now. Will we be doing this for the entire session? And what happens if I start to feel overwhelmed? I'm worried I might have a panic attack or something.",
    "Therapist: We'll do this for about 30-45 minutes. If you feel overwhelmed, we have coping strategies ready. Your safety is my priority. How does this plan sound?",
    "Client: That sounds... manageable, I guess. I appreciate that you have strategies in place if things get too intense. I'm still anxious, but I'm also feeling a bit more prepared now. I think I'm ready to give this a try. Is there anything else I should know or do to prepare myself?",
    "Therapist: Just remember to breathe and stay present. Your courage is commendable. This work is crucial for healing from PTSD. Any other concerns?",
    "Client: Thank you for saying that. I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. One last question - after we do this, what can I expect in terms of how I might feel? Will I be okay to go back to work, or should I plan to take some time for myself?",
    "Therapist: It's different for everyone. You might feel drained or emotional. I suggest taking it easy afterwards. We'll debrief and ensure you're stable before leaving. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: Alright, I think I'm ready. I've cleared my schedule for the rest of the day, just in case. I'm nervous, but also hopeful that this might help. Let's do this. Where do we start?",
    "Therapist: We'll start by getting comfortable. Close your eyes if you'd like. Take a deep breath. When you're ready, begin describing the hurricane experience.",
    "Client: Okay, here goes... It was a Tuesday morning when the evacuation order came through..."
