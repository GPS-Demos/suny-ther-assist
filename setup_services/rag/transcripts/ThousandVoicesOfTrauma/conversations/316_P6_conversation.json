    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to the moment of the animal attack. When you're ready, start describing what's happening.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm at the beach. It's a sunny day, and I can hear the waves. I'm walking along the shoreline when I see something moving in the water. It's... it's a shark fin. My heart starts racing.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 5 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: The shark is getting closer. I'm frozen in place. I can't move my legs. People are shouting, but it sounds muffled. The shark lunges out of the water towards me. I can see its teeth... oh God.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What's happening in your body?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking. I feel nauseous. My chest is so tight, I can barely breathe.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe even a 9.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The shark's teeth... they're tearing into my leg. The pain is excruciating. There's blood everywhere. I'm screaming, but it feels like no sound is coming out. I'm being dragged into the water. I can't... I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's a 10. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. It's normal to feel distressed. You're doing well.",
    "Client: I'm trying to fight, but I'm so weak. The water is filling my lungs. I think I'm going to die. Why isn't anyone helping me?",
    "Therapist: Remember, you survived. You're here now. What happens next?",
    "Client: Someone... someone grabs me. They're pulling me out of the water. I can hear sirens. Everything is blurry. I'm coughing up water and blood.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down. Maybe a 7?",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: I'm on the sand now. Paramedics are working on my leg. The pain is still intense, but I feel... relieved. I'm alive. I can breathe again.",
    "Therapist: You made it through. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Shaken. My heart's still racing, but I feel... I don't know, stronger maybe? Like I faced it again and survived.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. What's your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to a 4 now. I'm surprised it dropped so quickly.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... proud, I guess. I didn't think I could do that.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You did incredibly well."
