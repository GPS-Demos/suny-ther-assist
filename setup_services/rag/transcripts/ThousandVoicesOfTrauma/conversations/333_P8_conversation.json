    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like my whole body is trembling on the inside. The memories... they felt so vivid, so real. I could almost smell the musty air of that basement where they kept us. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Hmm. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But it's mixed with this intense anger too. I'm angry at those people who did this to us, angry at the system that let it happen. And I'm... I'm ashamed. I keep thinking I should have done more to help the other kids, you know?",
    "Therapist: I see. Can you tell me more about that shame?",
    "Client: It's... it's like this heavy weight in my chest. I was one of the older kids there, and I feel like I should have protected the younger ones more. I tried, I really did, but... sometimes I froze. Sometimes I was too scared to act. And now, years later, I can't help but wonder if I could have done more. If I could have saved someone else from going through what I did.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How does your body feel as you're talking about this?",
    "Client: My hands are clammy, and my heart's racing. There's this tightness in my throat, like I can't swallow properly. And my stomach... it's in knots. It's like my body is reliving everything, even though my mind knows I'm safe here.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep hearing their voices. The traffickers, I mean. They'd tell us we were worthless, that no one would ever want us back. And part of me still believes that sometimes. I know it's not true, but... it's hard to shake off. I'm also thinking about the other kids. I wonder where they are now, if they're okay. If they've managed to build a life after all that.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts and feelings compare to when you first started therapy?",
    "Client: Well... they're still intense, but I think I can handle them better now. Before, I'd completely shut down when these memories came up. Now, I can at least talk about them, even if it's hard. And I'm starting to see that what happened wasn't my fault. That's... that's progress, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm realizing that even though these memories are painful, they don't have the same power over me that they used to. I mean, I'm sitting here talking about it without having a full-blown panic attack. That's... that's new. And I'm feeling a bit proud of myself for that, actually. It's like... I'm reclaiming some control, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's significant. How does that sense of control feel?",
    "Client: It feels... empowering. Like I'm not just a victim anymore. I'm a survivor. I'm someone who's faced the worst and is still here, still fighting. It's a strange mix of strength and vulnerability. I feel both fragile and unbreakable at the same time, if that makes any sense.",
    "Therapist: It does. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I think... I need to remind myself that I'm safe now. That those experiences are in the past. Maybe we could do one of those grounding exercises? And... I'd like to talk more about how I can use this newfound strength in my daily life. How I can hold onto this feeling of control even when I'm not in therapy.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's start with a grounding exercise.",
    "Client: Okay, thank you. You know, it's strange. As we're talking, I'm noticing the fear and shame starting to fade a bit. They're still there, but they're not as overwhelming. It's like... by facing these memories head-on, they're losing some of their power over me. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's a common experience. How does that shift feel?",
    "Client: It feels... liberating. Like I'm shedding a heavy coat I've been wearing for years. There's still a long way to go, I know that. But for the first time in a long time, I feel hopeful. Like maybe I can really move past this, you know? Not forget it, but... not let it define me anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What do you want to focus on next?",
    "Client: I think... I want to work on forgiving myself. For not doing more, for the choices I made under impossible circumstances. And maybe... maybe even start thinking about how I can use my experience to help others. Is that something we could explore in our next sessions?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll definitely address that.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. But here I am, doing it. It's still hard, still painful, but... I'm doing it. And that... that feels like a victory.",
    "Therapist: It is. How would you like to close our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to end with a moment of quiet reflection. Just to sit with these new feelings, this sense of progress. And maybe... maybe to send out a silent wish of healing for all the other survivors out there. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take that moment now."
