    "Therapist: Alright, John, let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I understand why we're doing this.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the moment you learned about the divorce.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm sitting in my office, it's late afternoon. The phone rings, and it's Sarah. Her voice is shaky, and she says, \"John, we need to talk.\" My stomach instantly knots up. I can feel my hands getting clammy as I grip the phone tighter.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 6. My heart's starting to race a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Continue with the memory.",
    "Client: Sarah tells me she wants a divorce. The words hit me like a punch to the gut. I feel dizzy, like the room is spinning. I can hear the clock ticking on my desk, each second feels like an eternity. I'm struggling to breathe normally.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to an 8. I can feel my chest tightening.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I ask her why, but I already know. We've been growing apart for years. I hear myself pleading, bargaining. My voice sounds strange, like it's not even mine. I'm pacing around my office now, knocking things off my desk. There's a family photo that falls, and the glass shatters. It feels so symbolic.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) It's a 9 now. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: That's tough. You're very brave. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hang up the phone and just... collapse into my chair. The silence is deafening. I can't believe this is happening. Thirty years of marriage, gone. I feel so alone, so... betrayed. My whole future seems to crumble before my eyes.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: Still a 9. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: I sit there for hours, just staring at the wall. The sun sets, and I don't even notice. I'm replaying every moment of our marriage, wondering where it all went wrong. I feel like a failure. Like I've let down not just Sarah, but our kids, our friends, everyone.",
    "Therapist: How about now?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down a bit. Maybe a 7?",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing it. Continue.",
    "Client: I finally leave the office around midnight. The drive home is a blur. I keep hoping it's all a bad dream, that I'll wake up and everything will be normal. But when I get home, Sarah's car isn't there. Some of her things are missing. It's real. I sit on our bed - our bed - and just... break down.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: Back up to an 8. God, it still hurts so much.",
    "Therapist: I understand. You're doing great. Let's wrap up the exercise.",
    "Client: (Opens eyes, takes deep breaths) That was... intense.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Drained, but... maybe a little lighter? My SUDS is down to a 5.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. We'll process this more next session. Well done, John."
