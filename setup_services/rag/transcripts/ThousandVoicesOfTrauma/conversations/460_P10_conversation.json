    "Therapist: Welcome, Amir. Let's begin today's imaginal exposure session. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit jittery, to be honest. But I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here together. Let's start with your SUDS level.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 6 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath, and when you're ready, describe the memory we've been working on.",
    "Client: (inhales deeply) Alright... I'm 12 years old. It's a warm summer day, and I'm at my grandfather's house. The air smells like jasmine and... and his pipe tobacco. I can hear the wind chimes on the porch. My grandfather, he's... he's sitting in his favorite armchair by the window.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: He looks... frail. Thinner than I remember. His skin is pale, and his hands are shaking slightly as he tries to turn the page of his book. I want to help him, but I'm frozen in the doorway. I can feel my heart racing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I take a step into the room. The floorboard creaks, and my grandfather looks up. His eyes... they're not as bright as they used to be. He smiles at me, but it's weak. He says, \"Amir, my boy. Come sit with me.\" His voice is raspy, and I can hear how much effort it takes for him to speak.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. I'm... I'm scared. I know what's coming, and I don't want it to happen.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's going up. Maybe an 8 now.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) Okay... I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I walk over to him, and... and I can smell the sickness on him. It's... it's awful. I sit on the little stool next to his chair, and he reaches out to pat my hand. His skin feels like paper. He says, \"I'm proud of you, Amir. Always remember that.\" And I... I can't... (voice breaks)",
    "Therapist: Stay with it, Amir. You're doing great.",
    "Client: (sniffles) I can't hold it in anymore. I start crying. I'm trying to be quiet, but I can't stop the tears. My grandfather, he... he just holds my hand tighter. He's not saying anything, but I can feel his love. And it hurts so much because I know... I know it's the last time.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm thinking, \"Please don't go. Please don't leave me.\" But I can't say it out loud. I'm just... sobbing.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Take another deep breath.",
    "Client: (breathes deeply) Okay... My grandfather, he starts coughing. It's a horrible, rattling sound. I want to run away, but I can't leave him. I'm holding his hand so tight, afraid that if I let go, he'll... he'll...",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What do you see and hear?",
    "Client: I see his face contorted in pain. I hear his labored breathing. The room feels so small suddenly, like the walls are closing in. My aunt rushes in. She's saying something, but I can't understand her words. Everything sounds muffled, like I'm underwater.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel?",
    "Client: My whole body is tense. My stomach is in knots. I feel like I might throw up.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) My aunt is trying to pull me away, but I won't let go of his hand. My grandfather... he opens his eyes one last time. He looks right at me, and... and he smiles. Just a little. Then his hand goes limp in mine. I... I start screaming. I can't stop. My aunt is hugging me, but I'm fighting her, trying to get back to him.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Amir. Stay with it.",
    "Client: Everything after that is a blur. There are people everywhere. Someone's on the phone. I'm sitting in the corner of the room, hugging my knees. I can't stop shaking. I keep thinking, \"He's gone. He's really gone.\" And I feel... I feel so alone.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still a 9. Maybe even a 10. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Focus on my voice. You're here, in the present.",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) Okay... okay. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. Can you continue?",
    "Client: Yeah... The next few days are a haze. The funeral... I remember standing by the grave. It's so hot, and the sun is so bright. It doesn't feel right. How can the world be so normal when everything has changed? I'm wearing a suit that's too big for me. My father's hand is on my shoulder, but it feels heavy, not comforting.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in that moment?",
    "Client: I feel... numb. Like I'm not really there. I keep expecting to wake up and find out it was all a bad dream. But it's not. It's real, and I... I don't know how to handle it.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe an 8 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: After the funeral, everyone comes back to our house. There's food everywhere, but I can't eat. People keep trying to talk to me, telling me how sorry they are, but their words don't mean anything. I slip away and go to my room. I sit on my bed and take out the pocket watch my grandfather gave me for my last birthday. I hold it to my ear, listening to the ticking. It's the only sound that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel holding the watch?",
    "Client: I feel... connected to him. But also so, so sad. I miss him so much already. I don't know how to live in a world without him.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: I fall asleep holding the watch. When I wake up, it's dark outside. The house is quiet. I can hear my parents talking in low voices downstairs. I want to go to them, but I can't move. I just lie there, staring at the ceiling, feeling this... this emptiness inside me.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 7. I'm starting to feel drained.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Amir. We're almost done. Can you describe how the memory ends?",
    "Client: I... I eventually get up and go to the window. I look out at the stars, and I remember how my grandfather used to teach me about constellations. I make a promise to myself that I'll never forget him, that I'll make him proud. And I feel... I feel a mix of sadness and determination. Like I know it's going to be hard, but I have to keep going. For him.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent, Amir. Let's start to wrap up. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. But also... I don't know. Maybe a little lighter? Like I've let something out that I've been holding in for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's very common. What's your final SUDS level?",
    "Client: I think... maybe a 5 now.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's take a few deep breaths together to ground ourselves back in the present.",
    "Client: (breathes deeply) Okay. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Well done, Amir. You showed incredible courage today. How do you feel about the session?",
    "Client: It was really hard. But... I think it was good. I haven't let myself remember all those details in a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's an important step. We'll end here for today. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later. You did excellent work.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I appreciate your help.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Amir. We'll continue this work in our next session. Take care of yourself."
