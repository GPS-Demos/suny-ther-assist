    "Therapist: Welcome back, Mr. Singh. Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of reliving that time in prison... it's not something I look forward to. But I understand it's necessary. I've been having more nightmares lately, and I know we need to address this.",
    "Therapist: Your apprehension is understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about losing control. What if I can't handle the memories? What if I break down completely? I've worked hard to build a life after that experience, and I'm scared of undoing all that progress. Plus, as a professional, I'm used to being in control. The idea of being vulnerable like this... it's challenging.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How can I support you today?",
    "Client: I appreciate you asking that. I think I need reassurance that you'll be there to guide me through this. Maybe we could agree on a signal if I need to stop? And... I know this might sound silly, but could you remind me where I am if I seem too caught up in the memory? I've heard stories of people getting lost in their trauma, and that terrifies me.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll use a hand signal to pause. And I'll ground you as needed. Any other questions?",
    "Client: Yes, actually. How long will this exposure session last? And what exactly am I supposed to do? Do I just... start talking about what happened? I'm not sure I even remember all the details clearly. Some parts are vivid, others are hazy. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: We'll aim for about 30-45 minutes. You'll describe the event as if it's happening now. Varied recall is normal. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Okay, I think I'm ready. Or as ready as I'll ever be. It's strange, my heart is already racing, and we haven't even started yet. I can feel my palms getting sweaty. But I trust you, and I want to get better. For my family, and for myself. I'm tired of letting this experience control my life. So yes, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we start with a deep breath?",
    "Client: Yes, that sounds good. *takes a deep breath* Okay. I'm ready to begin. Where should I start? The day I was arrested? Or when I first entered the prison? It's all a bit jumbled in my mind now.",
    "Therapist: Start wherever feels most vivid. What's the first strong image that comes to mind?",
    "Client: The first strong image... It's the sound of the cell door closing behind me for the first time. The loud, metallic clang. It felt so final, like my life as I knew it was over. I remember the cold seeping into my bones, not just from the temperature, but from the realization of where I was. The smell of disinfectant mixed with something less pleasant. And the overwhelming feeling of shame and fear..."
