    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the bullying incident?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in high school. It's lunchtime, and I'm sitting alone at a table in the cafeteria. I can smell the greasy food and hear the chatter of other students. A group of popular girls approaches my table. I feel my heart racing...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: They start making fun of my clothes, calling me \"thrift store girl.\" I try to ignore them, but my hands are shaking. One of them, the leader, Sarah, grabs my backpack and dumps its contents onto the floor. Books, papers, everything scatters. I feel so humiliated...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I want to cry, but I'm holding it back. Everyone's staring at me. Sarah kicks my books across the floor, laughing. I feel so small, so powerless. It's like I can't breathe...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Keep going.",
    "Client: I start picking up my things, my vision blurry with tears. Sarah says, \"Aw, look at the little beggar.\" Her friends laugh. I wish I could disappear. My face is burning with shame...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: A teacher finally notices and comes over. But instead of helping, she just tells us all to quiet down. She doesn't even ask what happened. I feel so angry and betrayed. Why won't anyone help me?",
    "Therapist: That anger is valid. You're safe to express it here.",
    "Client: I gather my things and run out of the cafeteria. I hide in the bathroom stall, sobbing. I can still hear their laughter echoing in my head. I feel so alone, so worthless...",
    "Therapist: You're being very courageous. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. My chest feels tight, and I'm a bit shaky. But also... I feel a little stronger? Like, I survived that moment, and I'm here now, talking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to go back there, but I know it's part of the process. I just... I still feel that shame sometimes, you know? Like I should have done something different.",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. You did nothing wrong.",
    "Client: I know that logically, but emotionally... it's still hard. But I think I understand now how this experience affected me. It made me doubt myself, made me afraid to stand out or draw attention to myself.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation.",
    "Client: Yeah, I can see how it's influenced my choices, even as an adult. Like, always trying to blend in, not speaking up in meetings, that sort of thing. It's like I'm still trying to avoid being targeted.",
    "Therapist: You're making important connections.",
    "Client: I am, aren't I? It feels... empowering, in a way. Like I'm taking back some control by understanding it. I mean, it still hurts to think about, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming as it used to.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, I think. A bit drained, but also like I've accomplished something. It's strange, but I feel a bit proud of myself for facing this memory.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You've done excellent work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I know we're working towards discussing the human trafficking topic, and honestly, that scares me more than this. But going through this process with the bullying memory... it helps me feel more prepared, if that makes sense?",
    "Therapist: It makes perfect sense. We'll take it step by step.",
    "Client: Right, step by step. I think I'm starting to see how this therapy works now. It's tough, but I can feel it helping. I'm nervous about our future sessions, but I also feel... I don't know, maybe hopeful? Like I might actually be able to work through this.",
    "Therapist: That hope is valuable. We'll end here for today."
