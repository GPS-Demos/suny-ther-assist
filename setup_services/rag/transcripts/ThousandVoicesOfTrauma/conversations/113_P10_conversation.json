    "Therapist: Good morning, Mr. Tan. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Ah, good morning, Doctor. I'm... well, I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to dive into some heavy stuff today, and I'm not sure I'm ready for it.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Can you rate your distress on the SUDS scale?",
    "Client: I'd say... maybe a 6? My stomach's in knots.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Let's begin when you're ready. Describe where you are in your memory.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Okay... I'm... I'm in this dingy alleyway. It's late, maybe around midnight. The air is thick with the smell of garbage and something... something sour. I can hear distant traffic, but it's muffled. I'm... I'm hiding behind a dumpster, trying to make myself as small as possible.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see... shadows. Long, stretching shadows from the streetlights. There's graffiti on the walls, but I can't make out what it says. I'm... I'm watching the entrance to the alley. My heart's pounding so hard I think they might hear it.",
    "Therapist: Who might hear it?",
    "Client: The... the traffickers. They're looking for me. I... I overheard them talking about moving some girls across the border. I wasn't supposed to hear that. Now they're after me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's happening in your body right now?",
    "Client: My... my hands are shaking. I can feel sweat trickling down my back. It's cold, but I'm sweating. I'm trying to control my breathing, but it's coming in short gasps.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: (Pause, deep breath) Okay... okay. I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I hear footsteps. They're getting closer. I press myself against the wall, praying they won't see me. The footsteps stop. I hear low voices, speaking in a language I don't understand. My legs are cramping from staying so still, but I don't dare move.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to an 8. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep going if you can.",
    "Client: I... I peek around the dumpster. I see two men. One is tall and thin, the other shorter and muscular. They're both wearing dark clothes. The tall one is smoking, and I can see the red glow of his cigarette. They're looking around, searching. My heart's in my throat.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in that moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about those girls. About how scared they must be. I'm thinking that I should do something, but I'm... I'm too afraid. I feel like a coward.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel afraid in that situation. What happens next?",
    "Client: The men start moving down the alley. They're getting closer to my hiding spot. I'm trying to think of what to do. Should I run? Should I stay hidden? I... I decide to make a break for it. I wait until they pass by, then I bolt.",
    "Therapist: Describe what that feels like.",
    "Client: It's... it's like electricity in my veins. My legs are moving before I even realize it. I'm running faster than I've ever run before. I can hear shouts behind me, footsteps pounding after me. The air is burning in my lungs.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What do you see as you're running?",
    "Client: Flashes of light. Street signs. People's shocked faces as I rush past them. Everything's a blur. I'm dodging cars, leaping over trash cans. I can still hear them behind me, but their voices are getting fainter.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe a 7 now. My heart's racing just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a deep breath. Where do you go?",
    "Client: I... I run to the police station. It's about ten blocks away. By the time I get there, my legs are like jelly. I burst through the doors, gasping for air. The officers look startled. I try to explain what I saw, what I heard, but I can barely get the words out.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in that moment?",
    "Client: Relief... but also terror. What if they followed me here? What if the police don't believe me? What if those girls can't be saved?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. What happens next?",
    "Client: The police... they take me to a small room. They give me water, tell me to calm down. I explain everything I saw and heard. They look serious, start making phone calls. I'm shaking the whole time, keep looking over my shoulder, expecting those men to burst in.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel now?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Drained. But still on high alert. Every sound makes me jump.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about those girls. About what might be happening to them. I feel... I feel guilty for not doing more. For running away instead of trying to help them directly.",
    "Therapist: It's important to remember you did what you could. What happens after you talk to the police?",
    "Client: They... they tell me I did the right thing by coming to them. They say they're sending units to investigate. They ask me if I have somewhere safe to go. I realize I don't. I'm too scared to go home.",
    "Therapist: That must have been frightening. What did you decide to do?",
    "Client: I... I ended up staying with a friend for a few days. I was too paranoid to be alone. I kept thinking I saw those men everywhere I went. I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat. I felt like I was losing my mind.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, recounting this?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. My palms are sweaty, and my heart's still racing. But... but I also feel a sense of... I don't know, maybe pride? That I did something, even if it wasn't enough.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about a 5, I think. Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also... releasing something.",
    "Therapist: You're doing very well. Let's continue. What happened in the days after?",
    "Client: I... I kept in touch with the police. They told me they raided a warehouse based on the information I gave them. They... they found some of the girls. Not all of them, but some. I felt... I felt relieved, but also devastated for the ones they couldn't find.",
    "Therapist: That's a mix of emotions. How did you cope with that?",
    "Client: I... I started drinking more. It was the only way I could sleep without nightmares. I know it wasn't healthy, but I didn't know what else to do. I felt like I was carrying this huge secret, this huge burden.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response to trauma. How did it affect your daily life?",
    "Client: I... I became paranoid. I stopped going out as much. I was always looking over my shoulder, expecting to see those men. I lost touch with friends, stopped doing things I enjoyed. It was like... like the world had become this dangerous, hostile place.",
    "Therapist: That sounds isolating. What helped you get through that time?",
    "Client: Honestly? Not much at first. But then... then I met a support group. Other people who had witnessed or experienced trafficking. Hearing their stories... it made me feel less alone. Less crazy.",
    "Therapist: Support can be crucial. How did that change things for you?",
    "Client: It... it gave me a purpose, I guess. I started volunteering with anti-trafficking organizations. It felt like a way to... to make amends, maybe? To do something positive with this horrible experience.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful way to reclaim control. How do you feel about that decision now?",
    "Client: It's... it's complicated. Some days I feel proud, like I'm making a difference. Other days, it all feels overwhelming, like I'm just reliving the trauma over and over. But overall, I think it's been healing.",
    "Therapist: That's insightful. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 3, I think. Talking about it... it's not easy, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming as it used to.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. How do you feel about your actions that night now?",
    "Client: I... I still wish I could have done more. But I understand now that I did what I could. I was just one person, facing something much bigger than me. I think... I think I'm starting to forgive myself for not being able to save everyone.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. As we wrap up, how are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. Emotionally drained. But also... lighter, somehow. Like I've set down a heavy load I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's often how people feel after these sessions. You've done excellent work today.",
    "Client: Thank you, Doctor. It's... it's not easy, but I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. We'll end here for today. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
