    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's always hard to go back there, you know? Reliving that moment when I saw my father hit my mother... it's like I'm that scared little girl all over again. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel this tightness in my chest.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you this time?",
    "Client: The sound. I never realized how much I remembered the sound of it all. The shouting, the thud when he... when he hit her. And then the silence afterward. It was deafening. I could hear my own heartbeat, and I remember thinking, \"Is this it? Is this how our family falls apart?\" It's funny how your mind goes to these big questions even when you're just a child.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to focus on those sounds today?",
    "Client: It was intense. At first, I wanted to block it out, like I've been doing for years. But then... I don't know, it's like I could finally let myself hear it without completely falling apart. Don't get me wrong, it still hurts, but it's different now. I feel like I'm starting to separate the memory from who I am now, if that makes sense?",
    "Therapist: That's a significant insight, Sarah. How does this connect to your daily life?",
    "Client: Well, I've always been jumpy around loud noises. Even now, at 69, a car backfiring or a door slamming can send me into a panic. But going through this memory, really sitting with it... I'm starting to see that those sounds today aren't the same as back then. They don't mean the same thing. It's like... maybe I can start telling my brain that it's okay, that I'm safe now.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What else?",
    "Client: I've been thinking about my anxiety too. How much of it stems from always waiting for the other shoe to drop, you know? Always being on edge, expecting something bad to happen. Going through this memory, it's like I can see where that started. But I'm also realizing that I'm not that helpless little girl anymore. I have control over my life now, even if I don't always feel like it.",
    "Therapist: How do you think this might help moving forward?",
    "Client: I... I think it might help me be a bit kinder to myself. I've always been so hard on myself for being anxious, for not being able to \"just get over it.\" But now I can see why my brain acts the way it does. It doesn't make the anxiety go away, but it helps me understand it. And maybe... maybe that understanding is the first step to really dealing with it.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent perspective. What's one thing you can do this week to support this new understanding?",
    "Client: Hmm... I think I might try to be more mindful when I get anxious. Instead of just reacting, maybe I can take a moment to remind myself that I'm safe now, that the sounds or situations that scare me aren't the same as what happened back then. It's not going to be easy, but I think it's worth trying.",
    "Therapist: That's a great idea. How are you feeling about continuing with the exposures?",
    "Client: It's still scary, I won't lie. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe hopeful? Like each time we do this, I'm reclaiming a little bit of myself. It's hard work, but I think I'm starting to see why it's important. I want to keep going. I want to see where this leads.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable, Sarah. Is there anything else you'd like to share?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I suppose. For guiding me through this, for helping me see things I couldn't see on my own. It's not easy being vulnerable at my age, especially after spending so long trying to be strong. But I'm grateful for this chance to heal, even if it's later in life. I just hope... I hope it's not too late to find some peace.",
    "Therapist: It's never too late, Sarah. We'll continue this journey together."
