    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the combat experience you mentioned?",
    "Client: Okay... It was during my second tour in Afghanistan. We were on a routine patrol near a small village. The sun was beating down, and the air was thick with dust. I remember feeling tense, always scanning for threats. Suddenly, there was a loud explosion. I felt the ground shake beneath my feet, and then... chaos erupted.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: People were screaming. Smoke was everywhere. I couldn't see clearly, but I heard gunfire. My training kicked in, and I took cover behind a nearby wall. My heart was racing, and I could barely breathe. I saw one of my squad members go down. There was so much blood...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I wanted to help him, but I couldn't move. I was frozen. The gunfire intensified, and I could hear the zip of bullets passing close by. I felt so ashamed. I should have been able to help him, but I was paralyzed with fear. I can still see his face, the pain in his eyes...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. Keep going.",
    "Client: I finally managed to snap out of it and return fire. The firefight felt like it lasted for hours, but it was probably only minutes. When it was over, I rushed to my friend, but it was too late. I keep replaying that moment in my head, wondering if I could have saved him if I had acted sooner. The guilt... it's overwhelming sometimes.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. How do you feel right now?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel like I'm back there. My hands are shaking, and I can almost smell the gunpowder and blood. It's hard to breathe. I feel so guilty and angry at myself. Why couldn't I move? Why didn't I help him sooner?",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel this way. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I know I'm safe, but it feels so real. After the attack, we had to secure the area and wait for backup. I remember looking at the bodies scattered around, both civilians and combatants. The silence after the chaos was deafening. I felt numb, like I was watching everything from outside my body. That feeling... it never really went away.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep describing what you experienced.",
    "Client: The worst part was having to inform his family. I volunteered to do it because I felt responsible. The look on his wife's face when she opened the door... it haunts me. I couldn't find the words to explain. How do you tell someone their husband isn't coming home because you were too scared to act? I've carried that guilt for years.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel emotional. You're processing this well.",
    "Client: Sometimes, I have nightmares about that day. I wake up in a cold sweat, thinking I'm back there. My wife tries to understand, but how can she? How can anyone who wasn't there understand? I feel so isolated, like I'm carrying this burden alone. I know it's affecting my relationship with my family, but I don't know how to let it go.",
    "Therapist: You're not alone. We're here to work through this together.",
    "Client: I've tried to move on, to focus on my job and family, but it's always there in the background. Loud noises make me jump, and crowded places make me anxious. I feel like I'm constantly on edge, waiting for something bad to happen. It's exhausting. I want to be the husband and father my family deserves, but this... this experience keeps holding me back.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. Talking about it brings everything back so vividly. But there's also a small sense of relief. Like maybe, just maybe, by facing this head-on, I can start to heal. It's still painful, and the guilt is still there, but it feels a little less overwhelming. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. That's a positive sign.",
    "Client: I hope so. I want to be able to remember my friend without being consumed by guilt and fear. I want to honor his memory by living the life he can't. But it's so hard. Every time I close my eyes, I see his face. I hear the explosion. I smell the smoke. Will it ever get easier?",
    "Therapist: With time and work, yes. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I hope you're right. I'm tired of feeling this way. Tired of the nightmares, the anxiety, the guilt. I want to be present for my family, to enjoy life again. But it feels like such a long road ahead. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever truly be free from that day. But being here, talking about it... it's a start, right?",
    "Therapist: It's an important step. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Thank you. I know it's not easy, but I'm committed to this process. I want to get better, for myself and for my family. I just hope I have the strength to see it through. There's still so much I haven't talked about, so many details that I've tried to bury. But I'm starting to realize that burying them isn't the answer. It's facing them that will help me heal.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. We'll continue this journey together.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's comforting to know I'm not alone in this. Even though reliving these memories is painful, there's a part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe lighter? Like I'm finally starting to unload this burden I've been carrying for so long. It's scary, but also... hopeful? Is it too soon to feel hopeful?",
    "Therapist: It's never too soon for hope. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think I'm ready to end for today. This session has been intense, but I feel like I've taken a small step forward. I know there's still a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like healing might actually be possible. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable courage today. We'll continue next session."
