    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the workplace incident?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm at my desk, and my supervisor approaches. He starts criticizing my work, but it's not constructive. His voice is getting louder, and I can feel my heart racing. He's leaning over me, pointing at my computer screen, saying I'm incompetent and that I'll never succeed in this field. I... I'm starting to feel overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I can feel my face getting hot. My palms are sweaty, and I'm gripping the edge of my desk. He's still yelling, and now other coworkers are starting to look. I feel so humiliated. I want to disappear. My throat feels tight, and I'm struggling to breathe normally.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I can't seem to form words to defend myself. My mind is blank. He's saying that he regrets hiring me, that I'm a disappointment. I can hear whispers from my coworkers. I feel so small, so worthless. My eyes are starting to tear up, and I'm desperately trying not to cry in front of everyone.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: I... I manage to stammer out an apology, but my voice is shaky. He scoffs and walks away, muttering about incompetence. I'm left there, feeling exposed and vulnerable. My hands are trembling as I try to continue working, but I can't focus. The words on the screen are blurry through my tears. I feel like everyone is still watching me, judging me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I need a moment. This is harder than I thought it would be. I can still hear his words echoing in my head. \"Incompetent,\" \"disappointment,\" \"never succeed.\" It's like they're on repeat. I feel nauseous, and my chest is tight. I want to run away, but I'm frozen in my chair. The rest of the day is a blur. I can barely remember how I got through it.",
    "Therapist: It's okay. Take your time. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I remember packing up at the end of the day. My movements were mechanical. I couldn't look anyone in the eye. As I left the office, I felt this overwhelming sense of shame and failure. It was like a weight pressing down on me. I got to my car and just sat there, unable to drive. I broke down crying, feeling so alone and worthless. It took me a long time to calm down enough to drive home.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this incredibly well. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Reliving that moment is exhausting. But there's also a part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I've faced it head-on for the first time. It still hurts, but maybe not as intensely as before. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You've done excellent work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's strange, but I feel like I understand the incident better now. I can see how his behavior was unprofessional and abusive, rather than a reflection of my worth. It's still painful, but I feel like I have a bit more perspective. Is this part of the healing process?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it is. You're making great progress.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's been hard to talk about this, but I think it's helping. I've been carrying this around for so long, feeling like it was my fault. But now, I'm starting to see that I didn't deserve that treatment. No one does. I still have a lot of anxiety about work situations, but maybe this is a first step towards feeling more confident?",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent insight. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... tired, but also a bit lighter. Like I've put down a heavy backpack I've been carrying. There's still some residual anxiety, and I know we have more work to do, but for the first time in a while, I feel a glimmer of hope. Is it okay if we wrap up for today? I think I need some time to process all of this.",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've done incredible work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I really appreciate your support through this. It means a lot to have someone listen and understand. I was nervous about this session, but I'm glad we did it. I think I'm starting to see a path forward, even if it's still a bit unclear. Is it normal to feel both drained and somewhat empowered after a session like this?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's a common experience. Well done today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm looking forward to our next session, even though I know it might be challenging. I feel like I'm finally starting to confront these memories instead of just trying to avoid them. It's scary, but also... liberating? Is that the right word? Anyway, thank you again for your guidance today. I'll try to practice some of the coping strategies we've discussed before our next meeting."
