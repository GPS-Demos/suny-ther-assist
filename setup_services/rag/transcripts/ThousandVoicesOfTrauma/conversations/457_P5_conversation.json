    "Therapist: Hello, Amir. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Sarah. I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been thinking about it a lot since our last session.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... the idea of reliving those experiences with the cult feels really scary. I've spent so much time trying to forget about it all. I'm worried about what might come up, you know? Like, what if I can't handle it? What if I completely fall apart?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How can I help you feel more at ease?",
    "Client: I don't know... maybe if you could explain again why we're doing this? And what exactly is going to happen? I mean, I know we've talked about it before, but I'm still not sure I fully understand.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Imaginal exposure helps process traumatic memories. We'll revisit your experiences gradually, in a safe environment.",
    "Client: Okay... but won't that just make everything worse? I've been trying so hard to move on and not think about it. Won't this just bring it all back?",
    "Therapist: It may feel difficult initially, but confronting memories reduces their power over time. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: I guess that makes sense... It's just hard to imagine it actually helping. But I trust you, Dr. Sarah. You've helped me a lot so far. Can you tell me more about what exactly we'll be doing?",
    "Therapist: We'll start slow. You'll describe a memory while I guide you. We can pause anytime you need. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That doesn't sound too bad, I suppose. But what if I start to panic? Or if I can't continue? I'm worried I might disappoint you or mess up the therapy somehow.",
    "Therapist: Your safety is my priority. We'll go at your pace, and can stop anytime. There's no failing here. Your efforts are commendable.",
    "Client: Thank you, that's reassuring. I appreciate your patience with me. I know I ask a lot of questions. It's just... this is all so new and scary. But I really do want to get better. I'm tired of feeling haunted by my past all the time.",
    "Therapist: Your questions show commitment to healing. It's natural to feel apprehensive. What else can I clarify for you?",
    "Client: I guess I'm wondering what I might feel during the exercise? And after? Will I be okay to go back to my dorm after our session? I have a big exam coming up next week, and I'm worried this might interfere with my studying.",
    "Therapist: You may experience various emotions during and after. We'll debrief thoroughly. Do you have support at your dorm?",
    "Client: Yeah, my roommate knows I'm in therapy. He's pretty supportive, even though he doesn't know the details. I guess I could let him know I might need some extra support today. Do you think that's a good idea?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great plan. Having support is important. How else can we prepare you for today's session?",
    "Client: Maybe... could we go over some grounding techniques again? Just in case I start feeling overwhelmed? And... I know this might sound silly, but could I bring in a comfort object? I have this small stone I found during a hike last year. It helps me feel calm sometimes.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll review grounding techniques. And please, bring your stone. It's not silly at all. Shall we start?",
    "Client: Okay, I think I'm ready. Or as ready as I'll ever be, I guess. Thank you for being so patient with me, Dr. Sarah. I know this isn't easy, but I'm grateful for your help. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable, Amir. Remember, we're in this together. Shall we begin with a breathing exercise?"
