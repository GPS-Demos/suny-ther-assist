    "Therapist: Welcome back. Today we'll be doing an imaginal exposure exercise related to your workplace trauma. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm a bit nervous, but I know this is important for my healing process.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control. Let's start with your baseline SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10. I'm feeling a little tense just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day. Describe what you see and feel.",
    "Client: I'm in the office... It's early morning, and I'm the first one there. The fluorescent lights are harsh, and there's a faint smell of coffee. I can feel my heart starting to race as I remember what's about to happen.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: My boss walks in. He doesn't even look at me, just barges into his office and slams the door. I can hear him muttering under his breath. My stomach is in knots, and I'm trying to make myself invisible at my desk.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's up to a 6. My palms are getting sweaty, and I'm feeling really anxious.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Suddenly, he bursts out of his office and starts yelling at me. He's saying I messed up a report, but I know I didn't. His face is red, and he's pointing his finger at me. I feel so small, so helpless. It's like I'm a child again, being scolded for something I didn't do.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My heart is pounding, and I feel like I can't breathe. It's like I'm right back there. SUDS is probably an 8 now.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) I remember looking around, hoping someone would come in and stop him, but no one did. I was all alone. I can feel tears welling up in my eyes, but I'm trying so hard not to cry in front of him.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: He keeps berating me, telling me I'm worthless and incompetent. I want to defend myself, but my voice is caught in my throat. I feel so ashamed and angry at the same time. My whole body is trembling.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's a 9. I feel like I'm about to burst.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it.",
    "Client: Finally, he storms out of the office. I'm left there, shaking and trying to catch my breath. I feel so humiliated and angry. I want to scream, but I can't make a sound. It's like all the air has been sucked out of the room.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My SUDS is still at a 9. I'm feeling really overwhelmed. My chest is tight, and I'm having trouble catching my breath.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe slowly.",
    "Client: (Takes several deep breaths) Okay... I'm starting to feel a little calmer. The memory is still vivid, but I'm becoming more aware of where I am now.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 7. I still feel shaky, but the intense panic is subsiding.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Let's continue.",
    "Client: After he left, I just sat there for what felt like hours. I couldn't move. When my coworkers started to arrive, I pretended everything was fine. But inside, I felt broken and ashamed. I kept replaying his words in my head, wondering if maybe he was right about me.",
    "Therapist: And now?",
    "Client: My SUDS is at a 6. I'm feeling sad and angry, but the intense anxiety is fading.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. How do you feel about the exercise?",
    "Client: It was really hard, but I feel... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I survived reliving it.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. Well done today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm exhausted, but I think this helped.",
    "Therapist: Let's end here. Remember to practice self-care."
