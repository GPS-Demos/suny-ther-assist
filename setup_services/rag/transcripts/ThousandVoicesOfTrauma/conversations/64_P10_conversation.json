    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about my brother's death again, and it's just... it's a lot.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in my apartment. It's early morning, maybe around 7 AM. The sun is just starting to peek through the blinds. I'm getting ready for work, making coffee. Everything feels... normal. Ordinary.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: My phone rings. It's... it's my mom. I pick up, expecting our usual morning chat, but her voice is... different. Shaky. She says, \"John, there's been an accident.\" My stomach drops. I can feel it now, that same sinking feeling.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: Um... probably a 6 or 7. It's getting intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going. What do you hear?",
    "Client: I hear my mom's voice cracking as she tells me... tells me that Alex, my brother, he... he didn't make it. There was a car crash. I... I can't breathe. The coffee mug slips from my hand, shatters on the floor. I don't even care.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I slide down against the wall. My legs just give out. I'm sitting there, surrounded by broken ceramic and spilled coffee. I can smell it, bitter and strong. But it's like I'm not really there. Everything's fuzzy, distant.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe 9. God, it feels so real.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here in the present. You're safe. Keep going when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I don't know how long I sit there. Minutes? Hours? My phone keeps ringing. I can't... I can't answer it. I just keep thinking, \"This isn't real. This can't be happening.\" But it is. It is happening.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. So tight. Like I can't get enough air. My hands are shaking. I feel cold, but I'm sweating. It's like... like my body doesn't know what to do with this information.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I finally manage to call my girlfriend. I can barely get the words out. She says she's coming over, but I... I don't want her to see me like this. I'm a mess. I start pacing, trying to clean up the coffee, but my hands won't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Overwhelmed. Lost. It's like... like the world has shifted on its axis, and nothing makes sense anymore. I keep expecting Alex to call, to tell me it's all a mistake. But he doesn't. He never will again.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to process. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8. I can feel the panic rising.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. Remember, you're here in the present.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay. Okay, I'm... I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: My girlfriend arrives. She... she holds me. I break down completely. I've never cried like that before. It's like... like everything I am is pouring out. I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, John. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: We... we sit on the couch. Time feels weird. Stretched out. My phone keeps buzzing with messages, but I can't look at them. Can't face it. My girlfriend makes calls, tells people what happened. I should be doing that, but I... I can't.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking about the last time I saw Alex. We had dinner last week. We made plans to go hiking this weekend. Now... now that'll never happen. I'll never see him again. Never hear his laugh. It's... it's too much.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe a 7 now. My chest hurts.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. Remember to breathe.",
    "Client: I... I finally check my phone. There are so many messages. Missed calls. I see one from Alex from yesterday. Just a stupid meme he sent. I... I break down again. How can he be gone?",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: My parents call again. They're... they're coming to the city. We need to... to make arrangements. God, how is this real? How do we plan a funeral for my little brother? He's only... he was only 23.",
    "Therapist: That's incredibly difficult. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Numb. Angry. Devastated. It's like... like a storm inside me. I want to scream, to break things, to run away. But I'm also so tired. So, so tired.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 6 now. I'm... I'm exhausted.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, John. We're almost done. Can you describe the rest of that day?",
    "Client: It's... it's a blur. My parents arrive. There's a lot of crying, hugging. We start making calls. To the funeral home, to family. It doesn't feel real. Like I'm watching it happen to someone else. I keep expecting to wake up from this nightmare.",
    "Therapist: And how does the day end?",
    "Client: We're... we're all at my apartment. It's late. No one wants to sleep, but we're all exhausted. I lie in bed, staring at the ceiling. I can hear my mom crying in the living room. I... I don't know how to comfort her. I don't know how to comfort myself.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well, John. Let's start to bring you back to the present. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's lower. Maybe a 4 or 5. I'm... I'm drained.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Take a few deep breaths. When you're ready, open your eyes and come back to the room.",
    "Client: *opens eyes* Wow, that... that was intense.",
    "Therapist: You did an excellent job, John. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. Tired, but... maybe a little lighter? It's still painful, but... but I got through it.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's take a few minutes to debrief and then we'll end our session."
