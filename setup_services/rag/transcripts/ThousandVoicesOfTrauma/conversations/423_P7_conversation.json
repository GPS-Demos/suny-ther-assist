    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit anxious, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about my combat experiences, and that always makes me nervous.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'll try to keep that in mind. Where should I start?",
    "Therapist: Begin with the memory we discussed last time.",
    "Client: Okay... It was a hot day in Afghanistan. We were on patrol in a small village. The air was thick with dust, and I remember feeling sweat trickle down my back. Everything seemed quiet, almost too quiet. Then suddenly, there was an explosion. It was so loud, my ears were ringing. I saw my buddy, Tom, go down. There was blood everywhere...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: I... I froze for a second. I couldn't believe what was happening. Then training kicked in, and I rushed to Tom. His leg was... it was gone. I applied a tourniquet, trying to stop the bleeding. My hands were shaking, but I knew I had to stay focused. I could hear gunfire in the background, but it felt distant, like I was in a bubble.",
    "Therapist: That's it. You're handling this bravely.",
    "Client: I called for a medic, screaming into my radio. Tom was losing consciousness. I kept talking to him, telling him to hang on. I was terrified he was going to die right there in my arms. The guilt... the feeling that I should have seen the IED, that I should have protected him... it was overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (voice breaking) I can still smell the blood and gunpowder. I can hear Tom's labored breathing. I... I don't know if I can keep going...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay... The medic finally arrived. We got Tom on a stretcher and carried him to the evacuation point. The whole time, I was on high alert, scanning for more threats. I couldn't let anyone else get hurt. When the helicopter took off with Tom, I felt this mix of relief and dread. I didn't know if he would make it.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Continue.",
    "Client: After Tom was evacuated, we had to secure the area. I was operating on autopilot, but inside, I was a mess. I kept replaying the explosion in my mind, wondering what I could have done differently. The rest of the patrol was a blur. When we finally got back to base, I broke down. I couldn't stop shaking. I felt like I had failed my team, failed Tom.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. You're processing it well.",
    "Client: The days after were tough. I couldn't sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw Tom's face, heard the explosion. I felt guilty for being okay when he was fighting for his life in a hospital. It took weeks before I found out he survived, but lost his leg. I've carried that guilt and fear with me ever since. Even now, talking about it, my heart is racing, and I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable courage today, John.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to talk about, but I think it helps. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever be able to let go of these feelings, to stop reliving that day.",
    "Therapist: It's a process, but you're making progress.",
    "Client: I hope so. I want to be able to think about my time in the service without being overwhelmed by this one terrible day. I want to remember the good times with my buddies, the sense of purpose we had. But right now, it's like this memory overshadows everything else.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. We'll work through it.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's comforting to know I'm not alone in this. Sometimes I feel like nobody else can understand what I'm going through, but talking about it here... it helps. It's still painful, but maybe a little less so each time.",
    "Therapist: That's the goal. You're doing excellent work.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think I need a break now. This session has been intense, but I feel like I've made some progress. Is it okay if we stop here for today?",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've done very well today, John."
