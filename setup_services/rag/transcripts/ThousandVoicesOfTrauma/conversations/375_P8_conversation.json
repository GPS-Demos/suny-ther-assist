    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. It's like I'm right back there, you know? My heart's racing, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's hard to shake off the fear and anxiety that comes with reliving that home invasion.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What specific thoughts are coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: Well, I keep thinking about how vulnerable I felt. How helpless. I remember hearing the glass break downstairs and... and just freezing. I couldn't move. I couldn't breathe. I just kept thinking, \"This is it. This is how I die.\" It's... it's overwhelming to go back to that place mentally.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does your body feel as you recall these memories?",
    "Client: It's like my body's on high alert. My muscles are tense, especially in my shoulders and neck. I feel a bit dizzy, almost lightheaded. And there's this... this heaviness in my stomach. It's like my body remembers the fear even when I try to push it away.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. What emotions are most present for you?",
    "Client: Fear is the strongest, definitely. But there's also this deep sadness. I think... I think it's because I lost my sense of safety that night. And anger too. I'm angry that someone violated my home, my safe space. It's a mix of emotions that's hard to untangle.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when the event first happened?",
    "Client: They're... they're not as intense now, I suppose. When it first happened, I was completely overwhelmed. I couldn't function for days. Now, it's still difficult, but I can at least talk about it without completely breaking down. It's progress, I guess, but it still feels so raw sometimes.",
    "Therapist: I hear you. What's one thing you've learned about yourself through this process?",
    "Client: I've learned that I'm stronger than I thought. I mean, here I am, facing this trauma head-on. It's not easy, and there are days when I want to give up, but I keep coming back. I keep trying. And that's something, isn't it? I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without falling apart completely.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How has this experience changed your view of the world?",
    "Client: It's... it's made me more cautious, that's for sure. I used to think bad things only happened to other people, you know? Now I know that's not true. But it's also made me appreciate the good things more. My family, my friends, the support I've received. I think I value connection more now, because I know how easily it can all be taken away.",
    "Therapist: Mm. What coping strategies have you found most helpful?",
    "Client: Deep breathing helps a lot, especially when I feel the panic rising. And... and writing. I've been keeping a journal, and it helps to get the thoughts out of my head and onto paper. Oh, and talking to my sister. She's been my rock through all of this. Just knowing I'm not alone makes a big difference.",
    "Therapist: That's great. How do you see these experiences shaping your future?",
    "Client: I... I'm not entirely sure yet. Part of me hopes that I can use this experience to help others who've been through similar traumas. Maybe volunteer at a support group or something. But mostly, I just want to get to a place where I can feel safe in my own home again. Where I can sleep through the night without waking up in a cold sweat. That's the future I'm working towards.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. How are you feeling now, after talking about it?",
    "Client: It's... it's a bit of a relief, actually. Like I've let out a breath I didn't know I was holding. I'm still anxious, and I know I'll probably be on edge for the rest of the day, but there's also this sense of... I don't know, accomplishment? Like I've faced the monster under the bed and survived. It's exhausting, but in a good way, if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: It does. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to work more on grounding techniques. Something to help me when I feel the panic rising. And maybe... maybe we could talk about how to start feeling safer at home again? I know it's a process, but I'd like to start taking steps in that direction.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this. It's scary, and it's hard, but I'm starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel. And that means everything.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue this journey together. Take care until next time."
