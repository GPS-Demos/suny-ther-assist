    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the event as if it's happening now?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in the prison cell. It's cold and dark. I can hear the sound of keys jingling outside. My heart is racing. I know he's coming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that memory.",
    "Client: The door opens, and he steps in. He's a guard, but he's not here to protect me. I can smell his cologne, and it makes me feel sick. I want to run, but there's nowhere to go.",
    "Therapist: Keep going. You're safe here.",
    "Client: He's approaching me. I can see the look in his eyes, and I know what's about to happen. I feel so helpless, so small. My body is frozen, but inside I'm screaming.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Continue.",
    "Client: He... he touches me. His hands are rough, and I want to disappear. I close my eyes tightly, wishing I could be anywhere else. The shame and fear are overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I can't breathe. It feels like there's a weight on my chest. I want to fight back, but I'm afraid of what he might do if I resist. The powerlessness is crushing.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: It seems to last forever. When it's finally over, he leaves without a word. I'm left there, feeling broken and violated. I curl up in the corner, trying to make myself as small as possible.",
    "Therapist: You're very strong. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... shaky. My heart is still racing, and I can feel tears in my eyes. But I also feel a strange sense of relief, like I've let out something I've been holding onto for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've shown incredible courage.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to talk about, but I think it helps. Sometimes I worry that I'll never be able to move past this, that it will always define me.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *Inhales deeply* You're right. I am making progress. It's just... sometimes the memories feel so fresh, like it just happened yesterday. But I'm here now, and I'm safe. I'm trying to remind myself of that.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. You're safe now. How do you feel physically?",
    "Client: My muscles are tense, especially in my shoulders and jaw. I notice I'm clenching my fists too. But as I focus on my breathing, I can feel some of that tension starting to release.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep focusing on your breath.",
    "Client: It's helping. I'm starting to feel more grounded. You know, talking about this... it's hard, but it also makes me feel less alone. Like I'm finally sharing this burden I've been carrying by myself for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. You're not alone.",
    "Client: Thank you. I know we've talked about this before, but sometimes I still struggle with feelings of guilt. Like maybe I could have done something differently. Logically, I know it wasn't my fault, but emotionally... it's harder to accept.",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. Keep reminding yourself.",
    "Client: You're right. I need to keep telling myself that. It's a process, I guess. Some days are easier than others. But overall, I think I'm starting to believe it more. It's just... it's such a long journey.",
    "Therapist: You're making great progress. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, in a way. Talking about it is never easy, but each time, it seems to lose a little bit of its power over me. I'm exhausted, but there's also a sense of accomplishment. Like I've faced something difficult and come out the other side.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant achievement. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your support through this. It means a lot to have someone listen without judgment. I know we still have work to do, but I feel like I'm moving in the right direction. It's slow, but it's progress.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: I'm trying to be. It's not always easy, but I'm learning to recognize my strength. This experience... it changed me, but it doesn't define me. I'm more than what happened to me. I'm starting to see that now.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. How are you feeling physically now?",
    "Client: Much calmer. My breathing has slowed down, and the tension in my muscles has eased quite a bit. I feel... present. Like I'm fully here in this room with you, instead of being trapped in that memory.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. You've done very well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I know we're nearing the end of our session, but I wanted to say how much I appreciate this safe space to work through these memories. It's challenging, but I feel like I'm reclaiming parts of myself that I thought were lost.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. You've shown remarkable resilience.",
    "Client: That means a lot to hear. I'm going to try to carry this feeling of accomplishment with me as I go about my week. It's a reminder that I can face difficult things and come out stronger on the other side.",
    "Therapist: That's a great approach. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm ready. Thank you again for your guidance and support. I'm looking forward to our next session, even though I know it won't be easy. But I feel more prepared to face it now.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next time."
