    "Therapist: Good morning, Mr. Rodriguez. Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Buenos d\u00edas, Doctor. I'm not sure I'm ready. To be honest, I'm feeling quite nervous about this. Can you explain more about what we're going to do?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Imaginal exposure involves revisiting your trauma memory in a safe environment. It helps reduce PTSD symptoms over time.",
    "Client: I see. But won't that be very difficult? I've spent years trying to forget what happened during my divorce and the violence I witnessed. The idea of reliving it... it makes my stomach churn.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. It can be challenging, but I'll be here to support you throughout.",
    "Client: I appreciate that, Doctor. But how exactly will this help me? I'm worried it might make things worse.",
    "Therapist: By facing the memory, we can process it and reduce its power over you. It's like exercising a muscle \u2013 initially uncomfortable, but strengthening in the long run.",
    "Client: That makes sense, I suppose. I've always believed in facing challenges head-on in my professional life. I guess this isn't so different. What should I expect during the session?",
    "Therapist: You may experience strong emotions or physical reactions. This is normal and will decrease with time.",
    "Client: Strong emotions I can handle, but physical reactions? What kind of physical reactions are we talking about?",
    "Therapist: You might notice increased heart rate, sweating, or tension. We'll work through these together.",
    "Client: Okay, I understand. I've faced tough negotiations in my career; I can face this too. How long will the session last?",
    "Therapist: We'll start with 30 minutes and adjust as needed. Remember, you're in control throughout.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I admit, I'm still anxious, but I'm also feeling a glimmer of hope. Maybe this will help me finally move past what happened and enjoy my retirement with my wife without these constant shadows from the past.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm ready now. Let's do this. I want to reclaim my peace of mind, for myself and for my family. They've been so patient with me through all of this.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Take a deep breath, and when you're comfortable, start describing the memory."
