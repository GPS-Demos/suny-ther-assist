    "Therapist: Welcome back. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of revisiting those memories... it's overwhelming. I've spent so long trying to push them away, you know? And now you're asking me to bring them back to the surface. It's scary.",
    "Therapist: Your apprehension is understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about losing control. What if I can't handle it? What if I break down completely? And... I'm ashamed. Talking about the abuse, especially as someone who's supposed to be a professional... it feels like I'm admitting weakness. Plus, with my depression, I'm scared this might make everything worse.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. Your feelings are valid. How can I support you today?",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I guess... I need to know that you won't judge me. And that if things get too intense, we can stop. Also, can you explain again why we're doing this? I understand it intellectually, but emotionally, I'm struggling to see the benefit.",
    "Therapist: Of course. This exercise helps process trauma memories. It's challenging but can reduce PTSD symptoms. We'll go at your pace and can pause anytime.",
    "Client: Okay, that helps a bit. But what exactly will happen during the exposure? Will I have to describe everything in detail? The thought of that makes me feel physically ill. And given my cultural background, talking about sexual matters is... well, it's not something we do easily.",
    "Therapist: You'll describe the memory, focusing on sensory details and emotions. We'll start gradually and respect your boundaries.",
    "Client: I see. That sounds less daunting than I imagined. But I'm still worried about how I'll react. What if I have a panic attack? Or what if I dissociate? It's happened before when I've tried to think about these events.",
    "Therapist: Those reactions are normal. We'll use grounding techniques if needed. Your safety is my priority.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I guess I'm also wondering about the long-term effects. Will this really help me move past the trauma? And how will it impact my depression? I'm already struggling with that, and I'm concerned this might make it worse.",
    "Therapist: Research shows this can improve PTSD and depression symptoms. We'll monitor your progress closely.",
    "Client: Alright. I'm still nervous, but I think I understand better now. Is there anything I should do to prepare for the next session when we actually start the exposure?",
    "Therapist: Just take care of yourself. Practice relaxation techniques we've learned. Remember, you're in control.",
    "Client: Okay. I'll try my best. It's strange, you know. Part of me is terrified, but another part feels... I don't know, maybe hopeful? Like maybe this could be a turning point. I've carried this burden for so long, and the idea that there might be a way to lighten it is... well, it's something.",
    "Therapist: That hope is powerful. Your courage is admirable. Shall we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. Thank you for your patience and for explaining everything. I feel a bit more prepared now. Still scared, but... ready to try, I suppose.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and we'll continue next session."
