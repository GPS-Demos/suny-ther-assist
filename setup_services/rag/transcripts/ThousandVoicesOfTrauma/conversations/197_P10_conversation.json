    "Therapist: Welcome, Amira. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a part of me that wants to get this over with, but another part that's terrified of reliving it all. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm ready. Where should I start?",
    "Therapist: Start by describing where you were when you first witnessed the cyber bullying incident.",
    "Client: Okay... I was at home, in my study. It was late afternoon, and I remember the sun was starting to set. I could see the orange glow through the curtains. I was scrolling through my social media feed, just catching up on news and family updates.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happened next?",
    "Client: I saw a post from my granddaughter. She's 15. At first, I thought it was just a normal teenage post, you know? But then I noticed the comments. They were... they were horrible. So cruel and vicious. I felt my heart start to race.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed do you feel right now?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 60? It's starting to feel very real again.",
    "Therapist: Okay, take a deep breath. You're doing well. Continue describing what you saw.",
    "Client: The comments... they were calling her ugly, fat, worthless. Some were threatening her. I couldn't believe what I was reading. My hands were shaking as I scrolled through them. There were so many, and they just kept coming.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What were you thinking?",
    "Client: I... I felt helpless. Angry. Scared for her. I wanted to reach through the screen and protect her somehow. But I couldn't. I felt like I was watching her being attacked, and I couldn't do anything to stop it.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's higher... maybe 75? My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. Remember, you're here in the room with me. You're safe.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... okay. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. What did you do next?",
    "Client: I... I called her mother, my daughter. My voice was shaking. I could barely get the words out. I told her what I saw, and she... she started crying. She didn't know. We felt so powerless.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What's happening in your body?",
    "Client: My hands are clammy. I feel nauseous, like I did that day. It's hard to breathe. I keep seeing those comments in my mind, over and over.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Amira. Keep breathing. What happened after you called your daughter?",
    "Client: We... we decided to go to my granddaughter's house. The whole drive there, I kept imagining what we'd find. Would she be okay? Had she seen the comments? I felt like I was in a nightmare.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, where's your distress now?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. Maybe 85? I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Amira. Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) Okay... I'm trying.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, tell me what happened when you arrived at your granddaughter's house.",
    "Client: We found her in her room. She was... she was curled up on her bed, sobbing. Her phone was on the floor like she'd thrown it. I've never seen her look so small, so broken. It... it broke my heart.",
    "Therapist: What did you do in that moment?",
    "Client: I... I went to her. I held her. She clung to me like she used to when she was little. I could feel her whole body shaking. I wanted to tell her it would be okay, but the words wouldn't come out. I felt so... so useless.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, describing this?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm angry. Furious. How could people be so cruel? She's just a child. I want to protect her, but I don't know how. The internet... it's everywhere. How do I keep her safe?",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel angry. Let's stay with that feeling for a moment.",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) I just... I keep thinking about all the other kids going through this. It's not fair. They don't deserve this. No one does.",
    "Therapist: You're right, they don't. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's still high... maybe 80? But it's different now. I'm more angry than scared.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Anger is a natural response. What happened next?",
    "Client: We... we sat with her for hours. My daughter and I. We talked about what happened, about the comments. My granddaughter... she told us it had been going on for weeks. She was too ashamed to tell anyone. I felt like I'd failed her somehow.",
    "Therapist: What makes you feel like you failed her?",
    "Client: I should have known. I should have seen the signs. I'm supposed to protect her, and I didn't even know she was suffering.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're not responsible for the actions of others. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I guess I feel guilty. And sad. So incredibly sad.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you describe what you did to support your granddaughter after that day?",
    "Client: We... we helped her report the bullies. We got her into therapy. I started spending more time with her, trying to rebuild her confidence. But it was hard. She was so withdrawn, so different from the bubbly girl I knew.",
    "Therapist: How did that make you feel?",
    "Client: Determined. Scared. I was afraid we'd never get her back, but I was determined to try. I started learning about cyber bullying, about how to protect kids online. I wanted to do something, anything, to make sure this didn't happen again.",
    "Therapist: That sounds very proactive. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's lower. Maybe 60? I still feel upset, but talking about what we did to help... it makes me feel a little better.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Can you tell me about any positive changes you've seen in your granddaughter since then?",
    "Client: She's... she's starting to smile more. She's making new friends, ones who are kinder. She's even talking about starting an anti-bullying group at her school. It's like... like she's turning her pain into something positive.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Proud. So incredibly proud. And hopeful. It's like... like we're healing together.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful, Amira. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. Tired, but okay. It's still painful to think about, but I can see how far we've come.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today. How would you rate your distress now?",
    "Client: Maybe a 40? It's much lower now.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's take a few deep breaths together to end the session.",
    "Client: (Takes several deep breaths) Thank you. This was hard, but... I think it helped.",
    "Therapist: You've shown tremendous strength today, Amira. We'll continue to work through this together."
