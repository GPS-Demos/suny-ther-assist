    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not really sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart is still racing, and I feel kind of shaky. The memories of the cyberbullying were so vivid, almost like I was reliving it all over again. I could see those horrible messages flashing across my screen, and it brought back all those feelings of shame and fear.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Anger, I think. No, wait... it's more like a mixture of anger and helplessness. I'm furious at those people who tormented me online, but at the same time, I feel so powerless. It's like I'm back in that moment, reading those messages, and I can't do anything to stop it. My chest feels tight, and my hands are clenched. I just want to scream or punch something, you know?",
    "Therapist: I see. How does this anger relate to your past experiences?",
    "Client: I guess... it reminds me of how I felt during the physical abuse. That same sense of being trapped and unable to defend myself. But with the cyberbullying, it was worse in a way because it felt like there was no escape. Even in my own room, I wasn't safe. The bullies could reach me anywhere through my phone or computer. It's like the whole world became this hostile place.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind as you recall this?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why me?\" Why did they target me? Was there something wrong with me? And then I start to doubt myself, wondering if maybe I deserved it somehow. But then another part of me gets angry at those thoughts because I know deep down that no one deserves that kind of treatment. It's this constant back-and-forth in my head, and it's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts impact you now?",
    "Client: They... they make me hesitant to trust people. Even now, living in shared accommodation, I'm always on edge. I worry that my roommates might turn on me or that I'll somehow provoke them into bullying me. It's affected my studies too. I'm always second-guessing myself, afraid to speak up in class or share my opinions online. It's like I'm constantly waiting for someone to attack or humiliate me.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice in your body as you share this?",
    "Client: My stomach is in knots. I feel nauseous, actually. And there's this heaviness on my chest, like someone's sitting on it. My shoulders are so tense they're practically up to my ears. I just want to curl up into a ball and disappear. It's funny, isn't it? Even though I'm safe here, my body still reacts like I'm in danger.",
    "Therapist: How does this physical response compare to during the bullying?",
    "Client: It's... it's really similar, actually. Back then, I'd feel sick to my stomach every time I heard my phone notification. My heart would race, and I'd break out in a cold sweat before I even read the message. I'd get these awful headaches from the stress and tension. The difference is, back then, the feeling would last for hours or even days. Now, it's intense but it passes more quickly.",
    "Therapist: What helps you feel grounded in the present moment?",
    "Client: Taking deep breaths helps a bit. And... this might sound silly, but sometimes I touch the things around me, like the arm of the chair or my clothes. It reminds me that I'm here, in this room, and not back there. Oh, and looking at you helps too. It reminds me that I'm not alone anymore, that I have support now.",
    "Therapist: That's good. How do you see your progress in dealing with these memories?",
    "Client: Well, I guess I can talk about it now without completely falling apart. That's progress, right? And I'm starting to recognize that what happened wasn't my fault. It's still hard, and sometimes I slip back into blaming myself, but I'm getting better at challenging those thoughts. I'm also learning to set boundaries online and in real life, which feels empowering. It's slow, but I think I'm moving forward.",
    "Therapist: What's one thing you're proud of in your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I'm proud that I'm here, doing this work. It's not easy to face these memories and feelings. There are days when I want to give up, but I keep coming back. I'm proud that I'm fighting for myself, you know? And I'm starting to believe that maybe I am strong, that I can get through this and have a good life. That feels like a big step.",
    "Therapist: Indeed it is. How do you want to care for yourself after today's session?",
    "Client: I think I need some quiet time to process everything. Maybe I'll go for a walk in the park near my place. Being in nature always helps me feel calmer. And I might call my sister later. She's been really supportive, and talking to her helps me feel less alone. Oh, and I'll definitely do some of those grounding exercises we've practiced. They really help when the memories start to overwhelm me.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Any final thoughts before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I guess. For listening and for helping me work through this. It's tough, but I feel like I'm finally starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel. And even though it's painful to revisit these memories, I think it's helping me understand myself better. I'm hopeful that one day, these experiences won't have such a strong hold on me.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue this work next time. Take care."
