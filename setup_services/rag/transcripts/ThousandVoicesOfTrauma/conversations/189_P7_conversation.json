    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the moment you witnessed the violence?",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... I was at my son's house for dinner. It was supposed to be a nice family gathering. We were all sitting around the table when suddenly, my son-in-law burst through the front door. He was drunk and angry. He started yelling at my daughter, accusing her of cheating. I... I froze. I couldn't believe what was happening.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you saw and felt.",
    "Client: My daughter tried to calm him down, but he wouldn't listen. He grabbed her arm and... (voice trembles) I saw him raise his hand. I wanted to jump up and stop him, but I was paralyzed with fear. I heard the slap, saw my daughter stumble backward. My grandchildren were crying. I felt so helpless, so ashamed that I couldn't protect her.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Crying) I keep replaying that moment in my head. The sound of the slap, the look of fear in my daughter's eyes. I should have done something. I'm her mother, I should have protected her.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: After he hit her, everything seemed to happen in slow motion. My son jumped up and tackled his brother-in-law. They were fighting on the floor, knocking over chairs. The kids were screaming. I finally found my voice and started yelling for them to stop. I was terrified someone was going to get seriously hurt.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. How were you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My heart was racing so fast, I thought it might burst out of my chest. My hands were shaking, and I felt sick to my stomach. I wanted to run, to get out of there, but I couldn't leave my family. I felt trapped, like I couldn't breathe.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. You're doing a great job describing it.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) The fight seemed to last forever, but it was probably only a few minutes. My son finally managed to push his brother-in-law out of the house. We could hear him yelling and swearing outside. My daughter was sobbing, holding her face where he had hit her. I went to her, but I didn't know what to say. I felt so useless.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. Keep going.",
    "Client: The police came shortly after. They took statements, asked if we wanted to press charges. My daughter was so scared, so broken. I held her while she cried, but inside, I was falling apart too. I couldn't stop thinking about how I had failed her, how I should have seen the signs, should have done more to protect her from that man.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. How did the night end?",
    "Client: We spent hours talking to the police. My son-in-law was arrested, but my daughter didn't want to press charges. She was afraid of what might happen if she did. We all stayed at my son's house that night. Nobody wanted to be alone. I couldn't sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw it happening all over again. I felt so angry, so guilty, so scared. And I still feel that way now, even though it's been months.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You've done well today.",
    "Client: (Sighs) It's hard to talk about, but... I think it helps. Sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy, like I'll never be able to forget what happened. But being able to talk about it, to really describe it... it's painful, but it feels like I'm finally facing it instead of running away.",
    "Therapist: That's a great observation. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted, emotionally drained. But there's also a small sense of... I don't know, maybe relief? Like I've been carrying this huge weight, and now I've set it down for a moment. It's still there, but it feels a little lighter.",
    "Therapist: That's common after exposure. Well done today."
