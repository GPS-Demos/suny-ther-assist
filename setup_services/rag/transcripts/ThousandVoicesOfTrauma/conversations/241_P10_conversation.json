    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, Dr. Torres. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is terrified. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Yes, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in a dimly lit room. The air is stuffy, and there's a musty smell. I can hear muffled voices outside the door.",
    "Therapist: Good. What time of day is it?",
    "Client: It's night. I can see a sliver of moonlight through a crack in the boarded-up window.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Scared. My heart is racing. I'm sitting on a dirty mattress, hugging my knees to my chest.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you?",
    "Client: About... 70.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: The door... it's opening. A man enters. He's tall, with a scar on his left cheek. Oh God, I can smell the alcohol on his breath.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with it. What does he do?",
    "Client: He... he grabs my arm roughly. Yanks me to my feet. I try to pull away, but his grip is too strong. He's shouting at me in broken English.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 85.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here in my office. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My... my muscles are tense. I feel nauseous. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: He's dragging me out of the room. Down a hallway. There are other girls... women. They look terrified. I catch a glimpse of myself in a cracked mirror. I barely recognize myself.",
    "Therapist: What do you see in that mirror?",
    "Client: I look... hollow. Dark circles under my eyes. My cheekbones are sharp. I've lost so much weight. My hair is matted and dirty.",
    "Therapist: How does seeing yourself like that make you feel?",
    "Client: Angry. Sad. I want to scream, to fight back, but I'm so weak.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's 90 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Maria. Take another deep breath. What happens after you see yourself?",
    "Client: We reach another room. It's brighter here. There's a group of men. They're laughing, drinking. The man with the scar pushes me forward. I stumble.",
    "Therapist: How does your body react?",
    "Client: I'm shaking uncontrollably. My legs feel like they might give out. I taste bile in my throat.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I try to back away, but there's nowhere to go. One of the men approaches me. He reaches out to touch my face. I flinch.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about my family. My children. Will I ever see them again? I feel so helpless, so ashamed.",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault, Maria. How high is your distress now?",
    "Client: It's... it's 95. I can barely breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Feel your feet on the floor. You're here, you're safe.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... okay.",
    "Therapist: When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: The man who touched my face... he's talking to the others. They're haggling, like I'm... like I'm merchandise. I feel sick.",
    "Therapist: What do you want to do in this moment?",
    "Client: I want to run. To fight. But I'm frozen. I can't move.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response to extreme fear. What happens next?",
    "Client: Money changes hands. The man with the scar pushes me towards the new... the new buyer. I stumble again.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel now?",
    "Client: Heavy. Like I'm moving through mud. My head is spinning.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's 100. I can't... I can't do this.",
    "Therapist: You can, Maria. You're doing it right now. Take a deep breath. Feel the chair beneath you.",
    "Client: (Breathing deeply) Okay... okay.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The new man... he grabs my arm. His grip is painful. He starts pulling me towards the door.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Panic. Pure panic. I... I start to struggle. To pull away.",
    "Therapist: What happens when you struggle?",
    "Client: He... he hits me. Hard. Across the face. I taste blood.",
    "Therapist: How do you react?",
    "Client: I... I go limp. The fight leaves me. I let him drag me out of the room.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm praying. Begging God to save me. To let me die.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: Still 100. I feel like I'm reliving it.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here now. You survived. What happens next?",
    "Client: We're outside now. It's cold. I'm shivering. He shoves me into a car.",
    "Therapist: What do you see?",
    "Client: It's dark. The seats are leather. I smell cigarettes.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: Numb. My face is throbbing where he hit me. My arms ache from being grabbed.",
    "Therapist: And emotionally?",
    "Client: Empty. Like... like I'm not even a person anymore.",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly difficult. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to 90.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this. What happens in the car?",
    "Client: We drive. I don't know how long. I'm... I'm trying to memorize turns, street names, anything.",
    "Therapist: That shows your strength, Maria. Even in that moment, you were fighting.",
    "Client: I... I guess so. I never thought of it that way.",
    "Therapist: What happens when the car stops?",
    "Client: We're at a house. It looks normal from the outside. Suburban. There are other houses nearby.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm wondering if I could scream. If anyone would hear me. Help me.",
    "Therapist: Do you try?",
    "Client: No. I'm... I'm too afraid. He threatens me as we walk to the door.",
    "Therapist: What does he say?",
    "Client: He says if I make a sound, he'll hurt my family. He knows where they live.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Terrified. Hopeless. I feel like I've failed them.",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault, Maria. You were protecting them. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's 85 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens inside the house?",
    "Client: He locks me in a small room. There's just a bed and a bucket. The window is boarded up.",
    "Therapist: What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I curl up on the bed. I'm crying silently. I don't want him to hear me.",
    "Therapist: That must have been so lonely and frightening. How long are you there?",
    "Client: I don't know. Days blend together. He comes in sometimes. To... to use me.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope during this time?",
    "Client: I... I try to go somewhere else in my mind. I think about my children. I pray.",
    "Therapist: That shows incredible resilience, Maria. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to 75.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Can you tell me five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: I see... your desk. The painting on the wall. The bookshelf. The plant in the corner. And... and the tissue box.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, four things you can feel.",
    "Client: The chair I'm sitting on. My feet on the floor. The fabric of my shirt. The air conditioning on my skin.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Three things you can hear?",
    "Client: The clock ticking. Traffic outside. My own breathing.",
    "Therapist: Two things you can smell?",
    "Client: Coffee. And... and your air freshener.",
    "Therapist: And one thing you can taste?",
    "Client: The mint from the water you gave me earlier.",
    "Therapist: Well done, Maria. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. But also... lighter, somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's normal after an imaginal exposure. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to 50 now.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How do you feel about what we did today?",
    "Client: It was hard. Really hard. But... I think it helped. I've never talked about it in such detail before.",
    "Therapist: You showed incredible strength today, Maria. How do you plan to take care of yourself for the rest of the day?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'll call my daughter. Maybe go for a walk in the park.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like great ideas. Remember to be kind to yourself. You've done difficult but important work today.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Torres. I... I appreciate your help.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Maria. I'm proud of the work you've done. We'll continue next week. Take care."
