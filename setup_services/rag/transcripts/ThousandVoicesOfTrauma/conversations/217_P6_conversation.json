    "Client: Okay... I'm driving home from work. It's late, around 9 PM. The streets are quiet. I'm tired but looking forward to getting home. As I approach an intersection, I see headlights coming from my right. They're moving fast... too fast. I realize they're not going to stop. My heart starts racing. I try to speed up to avoid them, but... (voice trembles) I'm not quick enough.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 6.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue, please.",
    "Client: The other car slams into my passenger side. The sound is deafening - metal crunching, glass shattering. I'm jerked violently to the left. My head hits the window. Everything's spinning. I can smell gasoline and burning rubber. I'm... I'm so scared. I think I'm going to die.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to an 8. My hands are shaking just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm trapped in the car. My door is jammed. I can hear people shouting outside. Someone's calling for help. I'm in so much pain, but I can't move. My vision is blurry. I see blood on my hands. I'm panicking, thinking about my family, wondering if I'll ever see them again. (starts crying) It's so overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're here with me, safe.",
    "Client: (nods, wiping tears) I hear sirens in the distance. They seem to take forever to arrive. I'm drifting in and out of consciousness. When the paramedics finally reach me, they have to use the jaws of life to get me out. The sound of metal being torn apart is terrifying. They're talking to me, but I can barely understand them. I'm so cold and scared.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's still at a 9. My heart is pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're handling this bravely.",
    "Client: They get me onto a stretcher. The movement causes intense pain. I'm rushed to the hospital, lights flashing. In the ER, everything's a blur of faces and voices. Tests, scans, needles. I keep asking about the other driver, but no one answers. I'm terrified I might have killed someone. The guilt is overwhelming, even though I know now it wasn't my fault.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe a 7 now.",

    "Client: Exhausted, but... lighter somehow. Like I've let go of something heavy.",
