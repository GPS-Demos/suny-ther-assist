    "Therapist: Welcome, Margaret. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Oh, well... I'm a bit on edge, if I'm honest. I know we're going to talk about that awful incident again, and it just makes my stomach churn.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Yes, let's get on with it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I'm walking down Main Street. It's a sunny afternoon, and I've just finished my shift at the library. I can smell freshly baked bread from the bakery on the corner.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear shouting. There's a commotion up ahead. I... oh dear, I see a young man being wrestled to the ground by two police officers. He's struggling, yelling that he didn't do anything wrong.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My heart's racing. I feel... helpless. Scared.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you?",
    "Client: About a 60, I'd say.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath and continue.",
    "Client: The officers are so rough with him. One of them has his knee on the boy's back. I can hear the boy gasping, saying he can't breathe. I... I want to help, but I'm frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: More people are gathering around. Someone starts filming with their phone. The boy is still pleading, his voice getting weaker. I... I can't bear it. I step forward and shout, \"Stop! You're hurting him!\"",
    "Therapist: What happens when you shout?",
    "Client: One of the officers looks up at me. His face... it's so cold, so angry. He yells at me to back off, that it's none of my business. But it is my business! That could be my grandson they're hurting!",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 75. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The officer who yelled at me starts approaching. He's so big, so intimidating. I can smell his sweat, see the veins bulging in his neck. He's shouting that I need to leave or I'll be arrested for interfering.",
    "Therapist: What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I stand my ground. I tell him, \"I'm not leaving. What you're doing is wrong.\" My voice is shaking, but I won't back down. Other people in the crowd start agreeing with me.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Terrified, but... also proud. Like I'm doing the right thing, even though it's scary.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: About 80 now. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* The officer grabs my arm. It hurts. He's twisting it behind my back. I cry out in pain, and that's when everything explodes. The crowd surges forward, people are yelling, pushing...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What do you see?",
    "Client: Chaos. Just... chaos. Bodies pushing against each other. I'm being jostled, nearly knocked over. Someone catches me before I fall. The young man on the ground is forgotten in the melee.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: My heart's pounding. I feel dizzy, like I might faint. The noise is overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply.",
    "Client: *breathes* I... I see a woman being hit with a baton. There's blood. So much shouting. I'm trying to get away, but I'm trapped in the crowd.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's 90. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Focus on my voice. You're safe here. This is a memory.",
    "Client: *nods* I... I see more police arriving. They're in riot gear now. Someone throws a bottle. It shatters near me. I feel the sting of tear gas in my eyes.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm coughing, crying. Someone grabs my hand - it's my neighbor, Tom. He pulls me away from the crowd. We're running down a side street. I can still hear the chaos behind us.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel as you're running?",
    "Client: Relieved, but... guilty. I left that poor boy behind. I couldn't help him.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level now?",
    "Client: About 85. My legs feel weak.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: We stop running a few blocks away. I'm gasping for air. Tom asks if I'm okay, but I can't speak. I just keep seeing that boy's face, hearing his pleas...",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking?",
    "Client: That I should have done more. That I'm a coward for running away.",
    "Therapist: And how does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Ashamed. Angry at myself, at the police, at the whole situation.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still around 80. My stomach's in knots.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here now, safe.",
    "Client: *breathes* I... I see myself sitting on a curb, crying. Tom's trying to comfort me, but I can't stop shaking. I keep thinking about how things escalated so quickly, how powerless I felt.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I ask Tom to take me home. The walk feels like it takes forever. Every siren makes me jump. When I get home, I collapse on the sofa and just... sob.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, in this memory?",
    "Client: Drained. Scared. Like the world isn't safe anymore.",
    "Therapist: And your distress level?",
    "Client: It's down to about 70. I feel... numb.",
    "Therapist: You've done very well. Let's start to bring you back to the present.",
    "Client: *nods* Okay... I'm... I'm here. In your office.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You're safe here. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Drained. But... also a bit relieved, I suppose. Like I've let something out.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've done excellent work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's... it's still hard to talk about.",
    "Therapist: I know. But you're making progress. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves before we end the session.",
    "Client: Alright. *deep breath* I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's focus on five things you can see in this room..."
