    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling shaky. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I'm right back there, you know? In that bank, with the gunmen. I can still hear the screams, smell the fear in the air. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. Can you tell me more about what you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: It's like... my body's on high alert. My palms are sweaty, and I feel this tightness in my chest. I keep seeing flashes of that day - the masked men bursting through the doors, waving their guns around. I remember thinking, \"This is it. I'm going to die here.\" And now, even though I know I'm safe, part of me still feels trapped in that moment.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind as you recall this?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. How I couldn't protect myself or anyone else. There's this voice in my head saying, \"You should have done something. You're weak.\" And then I feel guilty for even thinking that because logically, I know there was nothing I could've done. But the feeling... it's still there.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts make you feel emotionally?",
    "Client: Angry. Scared. Ashamed. It's like a cocktail of emotions swirling inside me. I'm angry at the men who did this, at the unfairness of it all. I'm scared that it could happen again, that I'll never feel truly safe. And I'm ashamed that I couldn't do more, that I just froze. It's... it's exhausting carrying all of this around.",
    "Therapist: You're showing a lot of courage by facing these memories. What's coming up for you as we talk about this?",
    "Client: I... I guess I'm realizing how much this experience has changed me. Before the hostage situation, I was confident, outgoing. Now, I'm always looking over my shoulder, expecting the worst. It's like the world has become this dangerous place overnight. But talking about it... it's hard, but there's a small part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe relieved? Like I'm finally letting some of this out instead of bottling it up.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How does it feel to be sharing this?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of things. Part of me feels vulnerable, exposed. Like I'm ripping off a bandage and exposing a wound that hasn't fully healed. But there's also this sense of... I don't know, maybe release? Like some of the pressure is easing. It's scary, but also... maybe a little bit freeing? I've kept this bottled up for so long, afraid to really look at it. But now that I am, it's like... maybe it doesn't have as much power over me as I thought.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. What do you notice about your body now?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm starting to relax a bit. My breathing is slower, and that tightness in my chest is easing up. I still feel a bit shaky, but it's not as intense. It's like... like I'm coming back to the present, if that makes sense? I'm becoming more aware of the room, of your voice. It's grounding, somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's great. How does this compare to when we started?",
    "Client: It's... it's different. When we started, it was like I was right back in that bank. Everything felt immediate and overwhelming. Now, it's like... like I'm looking at it from a bit of a distance. The memory is still there, still painful, but it doesn't feel like it's happening right now. I feel more... present, I guess. More in control. It's still hard, but... maybe a little more manageable?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful shift. What are your thoughts about this process?",
    "Client: It's... it's tough. Really tough. Part of me wants to run away from these memories, to push them down and pretend they never happened. But another part... I think I'm starting to see why we're doing this. It's like, by facing it head-on, I'm taking some of its power away. It's still scary, still painful, but maybe... maybe I'm stronger than I thought. Maybe I can get through this. It's a lot to process, but I think... I think I'm ready to keep going.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength today. How are you feeling about continuing this work?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm nervous, but also determined. It's like I've opened a door that I can't close now, you know? And as scary as that is, I think I need to walk through it. I want to get better, to not let this experience define me. It's going to be hard work, I know that. But for the first time in a long time, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can do this. I'm tired of feeling trapped by my fear. If this can help me move forward... then I'm willing to keep trying.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful commitment. What support do you need moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need patience. From you, from my family, but mostly from myself. This isn't going to be a quick fix, and I need to remember that it's okay to have setbacks. I also think I need... encouragement, I guess? Reminders that I'm making progress, even when it doesn't feel like it. And maybe... maybe some tools to help me cope when the memories get overwhelming outside of our sessions. I want to learn how to ground myself, how to remind myself that I'm safe now.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent insights. How do you feel about ending our session here?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm okay with that. It's been intense, but also... I don't know, meaningful? I feel drained, but also like I've accomplished something important. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know we have more work to do, but I'm feeling... cautiously optimistic, I guess. Like maybe there's a light at the end of this tunnel after all.",
    "Therapist: You've done remarkable work today. We'll continue next time. Take care."
