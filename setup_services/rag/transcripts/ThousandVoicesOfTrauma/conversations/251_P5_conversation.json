    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do. I've been having more nightmares lately about what happened during my deployment, and then seeing all this news about police brutality... it's bringing up a lot.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you familiar with it?",
    "Client: Not really. Is it like reliving the trauma? Because I'm not sure I can handle that right now.",
    "Therapist: It's controlled recollection. We'll go at your pace. How does that sound?",
    "Client: I'm still nervous, but I trust you. Can you explain more about what we'll be doing exactly? And... will it make things worse before they get better?",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit memories safely. It may be challenging, but it helps reduce PTSD symptoms. What concerns you most?",
    "Client: I'm worried about losing control. Sometimes when I remember things, it feels so real. And with everything going on in the news about police violence, it's like I'm right back there in the war zone. What if I can't handle it?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll start slowly and you're in control. Shall I explain the process?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I want to understand what I'm getting into. And... how will this help with my depression too? It's been really bad lately.",
    "Therapist: Addressing trauma often helps depression. We'll work through memories gradually. How do you feel about that approach?",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's a relief to know we'll take it slow. I've been feeling so overwhelmed lately, both with my memories and just day-to-day life. My husband tries to understand, but it's hard for him. Can you tell me more about what I might experience during this process?",
    "Therapist: You may feel strong emotions. That's normal. We'll practice coping strategies. What helps you feel grounded?",
    "Client: Deep breathing helps sometimes. And holding onto something, like a stress ball. But there are times when nothing seems to work. Will you be there to guide me if I start to panic?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'll be here throughout. We can pause anytime. How does that reassurance feel?",
    "Client: That helps a lot. I'm still scared, but knowing you'll be there makes it easier. I've been avoiding these memories for so long... I guess it's time to face them. Do you really think this will help me get better?",
    "Therapist: Many find it effective. Your courage is admirable. Any other questions before we begin?",
    "Client: Thank you, that means a lot. I do have one more question. After we do this, will I be able to talk about my experiences without feeling so overwhelmed? I want to be able to open up to my husband more, but right now it feels impossible.",
    "Therapist: That's often an outcome. Exposure can reduce emotional intensity. Ready to start?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm nervous, but I'm also ready to try something that might actually help. Can we start with something small today? Just to get a feel for it?",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll start gently. Remember, you're in control. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Okay, yes. Let's do this. I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Thank you for being so patient with me."
