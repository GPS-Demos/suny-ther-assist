    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also kind of blank at the same time. My heart is still pounding, and I feel this tightness in my chest. It's hard to breathe normally.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: I keep seeing flashes of that room... the dingy walls, the smell of cigarettes and cheap perfume. It's like I'm back there again. I feel so small and helpless, just like I did then. My hands are shaking, and I feel nauseous.",
    "Therapist: It sounds overwhelming. Can you tell me more about those feelings of helplessness?",
    "Client: It's... it's like being trapped in a nightmare, but you can't wake up. I remember feeling so confused and scared. I didn't understand what was happening at first. They kept telling me it was just a job, that I should be grateful. But I knew something was wrong. I felt it in my gut, you know? But I couldn't do anything about it. I was just a kid, and they were so much bigger and stronger. I felt like a puppet, like I had no control over my own body or life anymore.",
    "Therapist: That must have been terrifying. How are you coping with these memories now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning in them. Other times, I try to push them away, but they always come back. I've been having more nightmares lately, waking up in cold sweats. During the day, I'm jumpy and on edge. I can't relax, even when I'm at home. It's like I'm always waiting for something bad to happen.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength by facing these memories. What do you think has changed since then?",
    "Client: I... I guess I'm not that helpless little kid anymore. I'm an adult now, and I have more control over my life. But sometimes it doesn't feel that way. It's like part of me is still stuck in that room, still that scared child. I want to move on, to feel normal, but I don't know how. It's frustrating because I know logically that I'm safe now, but my body and mind don't seem to believe it.",
    "Therapist: That disconnect can be challenging. How do you see your future now?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Some days, I feel hopeful. I think about maybe going back to school, getting a job, having a normal life. But other days, it feels impossible. Like I'm too damaged, too different from everyone else. I worry that I'll never be able to have a real relationship or a career. The trauma feels like this massive wall between me and the life I want. And I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to climb over it.",
    "Therapist: Your resilience is evident. What strengths have you discovered in yourself?",
    "Client: I... I never thought about it that way. I guess I am pretty resilient. I mean, I survived something horrible, and I'm still here, still trying to get better. I've learned that I'm stronger than I thought. And maybe more compassionate too. I understand pain in a way I didn't before. Sometimes I think about using my experience to help others, maybe working with other survivors someday. But then I wonder if I'll ever be healed enough to do that.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How does talking about this make you feel now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of things. Part of me feels drained, like I've run a marathon. But there's also a small sense of relief, like I've let out a breath I've been holding for years. It's scary to face these memories, but there's also a tiny voice inside saying maybe, just maybe, talking about it will help. I feel vulnerable, but also a little bit proud that I'm facing this head-on. It's not easy, but I'm doing it.",
    "Therapist: You're showing remarkable courage. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I... I think I need a moment to just breathe. To remind myself that I'm here, in this room, and that I'm safe. Maybe some water? My throat feels dry. And... I know this might sound silly, but could you remind me that this isn't my fault? Sometimes I still struggle with that, even though logically I know it's true.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take all the time you need. And remember, none of this was your fault.",
    "Client: Thank you. That... that means a lot. I'm trying to believe it, to really internalize it. It's a process, I guess. Some days are easier than others. But being here, talking about it... it helps. Even when it's hard, even when it hurts, I feel like I'm slowly reclaiming pieces of myself. It's like I'm gradually coloring in parts of a picture that were blank for so long. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: That's a beautiful metaphor. How does this process of reclaiming feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's bittersweet, I think. There's pain in remembering, in facing what happened. But there's also a strange kind of joy in rediscovering parts of myself I thought were lost forever. It's like I'm getting to know myself all over again. Sometimes I catch glimpses of the person I was before all this happened, and it gives me hope. Maybe I can be whole again, even if I'm put together differently than before.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's your next step?",
    "Client: I... I think I want to keep pushing forward with this therapy. It's hard, but I can feel it helping. Maybe I could try writing about my experiences between sessions? I've always found comfort in words. And... I think I might be ready to join a support group. The idea of connecting with others who've been through similar experiences is scary, but also kind of comforting. I don't want to feel so alone anymore.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like positive steps. How are you feeling as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired, but in a good way, I think. Like I've done something important, even if it was just talking. There's still a heaviness in my chest, but it feels a little lighter than before. I'm nervous about what comes next, but also a little excited. For the first time in a long time, I feel like maybe, just maybe, there's hope for me. Thank you for listening, for helping me navigate through all of this.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredible work today. We'll continue next week."
