    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you start by describing the scene of the natural disaster?",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. It was a sunny day, and I was walking home from class. Suddenly, the ground started shaking. At first, I thought it was just a small tremor, but it kept getting stronger. People around me started panicking, and I could hear screaming...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The buildings were swaying, and I could hear glass shattering. I froze in place, not knowing what to do. A part of me wanted to run, but I couldn't move. The shaking seemed to last forever. I saw a car get crushed by falling debris... Oh god, I hope no one was inside...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I can't... It's too much...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: Okay... I remember the smell of dust and concrete. People were crying and calling for help. I finally managed to move and tried to help an elderly woman who had fallen. But then I saw a building collapsing nearby, and I just... I ran. I feel so guilty about leaving her...",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: I ran until I reached an open area. My heart was pounding, and I couldn't catch my breath. I kept thinking about my family, wondering if they were okay. I tried calling them, but the lines were down. I felt so alone and helpless...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling anxious, my palms are sweaty, and my heart is racing. It's like I'm back there again...",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The aftershocks kept coming. Each time, I thought it was starting all over again. I spent hours in that park, surrounded by strangers who were just as terrified as I was. We shared water and tried to comfort each other, but the fear was overwhelming...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: As night fell, it got colder. We could hear sirens in the distance, but help seemed so far away. I kept thinking about all the people who might be trapped, injured, or worse. The guilt of running away kept gnawing at me. I felt like a coward...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're processing it.",
    "Client: The next morning, when I finally made it home, the city looked like a war zone. Collapsed buildings, broken roads, people wandering around in shock. It took days before I heard from all my family members. The relief was overwhelming, but so was the realization of how many others weren't as lucky...",
    "Therapist: You've done an excellent job. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Reliving it is draining, but... I also feel a bit lighter, like I've let something out that I've been holding in for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. You've made progress today.",
    "Client: Thank you... I didn't think I could get through talking about it in such detail. It's still painful, but maybe... maybe it's getting a little easier to face.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great courage. We'll end here for today."
