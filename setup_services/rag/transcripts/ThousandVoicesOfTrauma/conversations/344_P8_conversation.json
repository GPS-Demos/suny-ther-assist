    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mrs. Thompson?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. It's like I was right back there in that moment, you know? My heart is still racing a bit, and my hands feel clammy. I can almost smell the musty odor of our old living room carpet where it happened.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are coming up for you now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. How I should have done something, anything, to stop him. But I was frozen, just like always. I can still hear the sound of his belt coming off, that awful metallic clinking. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What emotions are you experiencing?",
    "Client: Anger, mostly. At him, but also at myself. I'm frustrated that even after all these years, this memory still has such power over me. There's fear too, a deep, gnawing fear that settles in my stomach. And shame... so much shame.",
    "Therapist: How does that shame feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like a heavy weight on my chest, making it hard to breathe. My shoulders feel hunched, like I'm trying to make myself smaller. I just want to disappear sometimes, you know? It's... it's exhausting carrying this around.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about these feelings now, compared to when it happened?",
    "Client: Well, they're... they're not as intense, I suppose. Back then, the fear was paralyzing. Now, it's more like an echo of that fear. The shame, though... that feels just as strong. I keep thinking about how I let it go on for so long, how I didn't protect my children from seeing it.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts relate to your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I... I guess I can see that I've made some progress. The fear isn't controlling my life like it used to. But this shame... it's like a roadblock. I know logically that it wasn't my fault, but emotionally? That's a different story. It's hard to move forward when part of me still blames myself.",
    "Therapist: What would you say to that part of yourself now?",
    "Client: Oh, that's... that's a tough one. I suppose I'd say... it wasn't your fault. You were doing the best you could in an impossible situation. You survived, and that took incredible strength. But... it's hard to believe that, you know? It feels like empty words sometimes.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to say those words out loud?",
    "Client: It's... strange. Part of me wants to reject them outright. But there's also a tiny part that feels... I don't know, relieved? Like maybe, just maybe, it's okay to be gentler with myself. It's a conflicting feeling, to be honest.",
    "Therapist: What do you think you need to move forward?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to keep facing these memories. As painful as it is, I can feel something shifting. Maybe if I keep confronting them, that little voice of self-compassion will get louder. And I need... I need to forgive myself. That feels impossible right now, but I know it's necessary.",
    "Therapist: How can we work towards that in our sessions?",
    "Client: I think... I think continuing these exposures is important. As difficult as they are, I can see their value now. And maybe... maybe we could work on challenging some of these thoughts I have? The ones that keep the shame alive. I want to believe it wasn't my fault, I really do.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. Emotionally drained. But there's also a glimmer of... hope, I think? Like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this. It's a small feeling, but it's there.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. Shall we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. This was... intense. But thank you. I know it's helping, even if it doesn't always feel like it in the moment.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and we'll continue next week."
