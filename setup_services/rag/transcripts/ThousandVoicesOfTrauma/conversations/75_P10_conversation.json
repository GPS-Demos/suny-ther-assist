    "Therapist: Welcome, Amara. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is terrified. My heart's already racing just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Okay... yes, let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm at the airport. It's bustling with people. The air smells like coffee and cleaning products. I can hear announcements over the speakers, but I can't make out what they're saying.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm boarding the plane. My seat is by the window. As I sit down, I notice how cramped it feels. The woman next to me is wearing too much perfume, and it's making me nauseous.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Anxious. My palms are sweaty, and my heart is pounding.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you?",
    "Client: About a 60.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath and continue.",
    "Client: The plane starts to move. I can feel the vibrations through the floor. We're picking up speed, and suddenly we're in the air. I'm gripping the armrests so tightly my knuckles are white.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking about how high we are. How if something goes wrong, we'll all die. I can't stop imagining the plane falling out of the sky.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Take another deep breath.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Okay... We've been in the air for about an hour. The seatbelt sign turns on, and the plane starts to shake. It's just turbulence, but... oh God, it feels like we're falling.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 80. Maybe higher.",
    "Therapist: Focus on your breathing. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: *breathing audibly* The shaking is getting worse. People are screaming. The oxygen masks drop down. I'm fumbling with mine, my hands are shaking so badly.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What do you see?",
    "Client: Everything's a blur. The plane is tilting. I can see the ground through the window, getting closer and closer. Someone's praying loudly. I can smell something burning.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Amara. Remember that.",
    "Client: There's a deafening noise. Metal tearing. The plane hits the ground, and I'm thrown forward. My head slams into the seat in front of me. Everything goes dark for a moment.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Terrified. I can taste blood in my mouth. I think I bit my tongue.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 95. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you name five things you can see in this room?",
    "Client: Um... your desk, the plant in the corner, the bookshelf, the clock on the wall, and the tissue box.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... I come to, and there's smoke everywhere. People are screaming and crying. I'm still strapped into my seat, but the plane is tilted at an angle. I can smell fuel and something burning.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I unbuckle my seatbelt with shaking hands. I stand up, but my legs are wobbly. I'm coughing from the smoke. I need to get out.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I stumble towards where I think the exit is. There's debris everywhere. I step on something soft and realize it's... it's a person. Oh God, I think they're dead.",
    "Therapist: Stay with me, Amara. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I keep moving. I can see light ahead. It's an opening in the side of the plane. I climb over seats and luggage to get there. As I reach it, I can feel the heat from flames nearby.",
    "Therapist: What happens as you reach the opening?",
    "Client: I... I hesitate for a moment. It's a long drop to the ground. But I can hear the fire getting closer. I take a deep breath and jump.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Overwhelmed. My heart is racing, and I feel like I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still at 95.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Let's take another grounding moment. Can you tell me three things you can hear right now?",
    "Client: The clock ticking, traffic outside, and... and my own breathing.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I hit the ground hard. Pain shoots through my ankle, but I force myself to get up. I can see other survivors stumbling away from the wreckage. The heat from the fire is intense.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I start limping away as fast as I can. I can hear explosions behind me. The air is thick with smoke and the smell of burning fuel. I'm coughing and my eyes are watering.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I keep moving until I'm a safe distance away. I collapse onto the ground. My whole body is shaking. I can hear sirens in the distance.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling at this moment?",
    "Client: Shocked. Numb. I can't believe I survived. But I'm also... guilty. Why did I survive when others didn't?",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after such an event. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 85.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. Let's continue.",
    "Client: Emergency vehicles start arriving. Paramedics are checking people. One comes over to me. They're asking me questions, but I can barely focus. Everything feels surreal.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: They put me on a stretcher and into an ambulance. As we drive away, I can see the plane still burning in the distance. I close my eyes, but I can still see the flames when I do.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Drained. But also... relieved, I guess. That I made it out.",
    "Therapist: And your distress level?",
    "Client: It's down to about 70 now.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's take a moment to breathe deeply together.",
    "Client: *takes several deep breaths*",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, slowly open your eyes and come back to the present moment.",
    "Client: *opens eyes* Wow... that was intense.",
    "Therapist: You did incredibly well, Amara. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. Shaky, but okay. It's strange, but I feel a bit lighter.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've faced a difficult memory head-on. How would you rate your distress now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 50, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's take a few moments to discuss what you experienced.",
    "Client: Okay... it's still vivid, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming as before.",
    "Therapist: That's the goal of these exercises. Each time, it should become a bit easier to process.",
    "Client: I hope so. It's still hard, but... I think I can do this.",
    "Therapist: You absolutely can. You've shown incredible strength today. How about we end here and discuss some self-care strategies for the rest of your day?",
    "Client: That sounds good. Thank you.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Amara. I'm proud of the work you did today."
