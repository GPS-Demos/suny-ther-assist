    "Therapist: Welcome, Rajesh. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I understand why we're doing this.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your baseline SUDS.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10. My stomach feels a bit tight.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and describe the memory.",
    "Client: I'm at home... it's the day my ex-wife told me she wanted a divorce. I can see her standing in our living room, her face is stern. I... I feel my heart starting to race already.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: She's telling me she's not happy, that she hasn't been for years. I'm shocked, I... I didn't see this coming. My hands are shaking, and I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 6. My chest feels tight, and I'm starting to sweat.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I try to speak, but my voice cracks. I ask her why, what I did wrong. She says it's not about me, but I don't believe her. I feel... I feel worthless, like I've failed as a husband.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What else?",
    "Client: I remember sitting down hard on the couch, my legs felt weak. She keeps talking, but her words are blurring together. All I can think is, \"This is it. It's over.\" My whole world is crumbling.",
    "Therapist: SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. My heart is pounding so hard, I can hear it in my ears.",
    "Therapist: That's intense. You're handling it well. Continue.",
    "Client: I... I start to plead with her. Begging her to reconsider, to give us another chance. But her face... it's so cold. She's made up her mind. I feel like I'm drowning, gasping for air.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice in your body?",
    "Client: My throat is tight, and my eyes are burning with tears I'm trying to hold back. I feel... I feel so small, so insignificant.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's still an 8. Maybe... maybe even a 9 now. I feel like I'm right back there, reliving it all over again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it.",
    "Client: She starts packing a bag. I watch her, frozen in place. Every item she puts in the bag feels like another blow. I want to stop her, but I can't move. I can't speak. I'm... I'm paralyzed.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: \"This can't be happening. What will I do without her? Who am I if I'm not her husband?\" I feel... lost. Completely and utterly lost.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's dropped a bit. Maybe a 7 now. I'm still upset, but... talking about it, I feel less overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Keep going.",
    "Client: She finishes packing and turns to me. Her eyes... they're sad, but determined. She says, \"I'm sorry, Rajesh. I hope you can forgive me someday.\" And then... she's gone. The door closes, and I'm alone.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel in that moment?",
    "Client: Empty. Hollow. Like a part of me has been ripped away. I sink to the floor, and for the first time, I let the tears come. I cry until I have nothing left.",
    "Therapist: SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 6. I feel drained, but... talking about it, it doesn't feel as overwhelming as it did before.",
    "Therapist: You've done well. Let's start winding down.",
    "Client: Okay. I... I feel exhausted, but also... maybe a little lighter? Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's common. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm at about a 4 again. My heart rate has slowed down, and I don't feel as tense.",
