    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm feeling pretty nervous already, but I know this is important. Let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day. Describe what you see and feel.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) I'm in the bank. It's a normal day, until... until this guy bursts in with a gun. He's shouting, waving it around. My heart is racing, and I can feel sweat forming on my forehead. The teller next to me lets out a small scream.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Uh, probably a 6. I'm definitely anxious, but I can handle it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: The gunman is forcing everyone to the ground. I can smell the musty carpet as I lie there. My hands are shaking. He keeps yelling about money, but all I can think about is... is how this reminds me of... of the abuse. Being helpless again.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. It's hard to breathe. The memories are... they're mixing together. I'm not just in the bank anymore; I'm back in that room from my childhood. The fear is overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. Maybe even a 9. God, this is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) I can hear sirens outside. The gunman is getting more agitated. He grabs a woman near me as a shield. I want to help her, but I'm frozen. Just like I was frozen as a kid. I feel so ashamed, so weak.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe now. What's happening in your body?",
    "Client: My muscles are so tense. I have this urge to run, but I can't move. My mouth is dry, and I think I might be sick. It's like I'm reliving both traumas at once.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: Still a 9. Maybe even higher. I don't know if I can keep going.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it.",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) The police are negotiating now. Hours pass, but it feels like days. I'm exhausted, terrified. Every time the gunman moves, I flinch. I keep thinking about what might happen, about dying here, about never escaping like I did as a child.",
    "Therapist: And now?",
    "Client: I... I think it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7? The worst part is over, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing it.",
    "Client: Yeah, I... I can feel my body starting to relax a little. The hostage situation is ending. We're being led out by police. I'm shaking, crying, but also relieved. It's over, just like the abuse eventually ended.",
    "Therapist: Final SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5 now. I'm drained, but... I made it through. Both times, I made it through.",
    "Therapist: You did. How do you feel about the exercise?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... kind of proud? It was intense, but I stayed with it. I think... I think I understand both experiences better now.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves before we end."
