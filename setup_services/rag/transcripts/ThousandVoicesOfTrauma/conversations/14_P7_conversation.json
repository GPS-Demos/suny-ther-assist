    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and take a deep breath. When you're ready, describe the home invasion incident.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in my living room, watching TV. It's late, maybe around 11 PM. I hear a noise at the back door, like someone's trying to force it open. My heart starts racing immediately.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: I get up, feeling scared. I'm frozen for a moment, not sure what to do. Then I hear the door burst open. I can't believe this is happening. I'm panicking, looking for a way out or something to defend myself with.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Two men enter. They're wearing masks and dark clothes. One has a gun. I'm terrified, I can barely breathe. They're yelling at me to get down, but I can't move. My legs feel like jelly.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Keep going.",
    "Client: The one with the gun pushes me to the ground. I hit my head on the coffee table. It hurts, but I'm too scared to even react to the pain. They're ransacking the place, throwing things around. I can hear them in the other rooms.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I'm lying there, face down, praying they don't hurt me. I'm thinking about my kids, wondering if I'll ever see them again. The fear is overwhelming. I feel so helpless, so vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. Continue sharing what happened.",
    "Client: After what feels like hours, but was probably only minutes, they come back to the living room. They're arguing about something. I'm afraid they might kill me to leave no witnesses. My whole body is shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're being very courageous. Keep going.",
    "Client: Suddenly, they hear a car outside and panic. They grab what they can and run out the back door. I'm left there, on the floor, too scared to move. I can't believe it's over. I'm alive, but I feel... broken.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel that way. You're doing well.",
    "Client: I don't know how long I stayed there before I could move. When I finally did, I called the police with shaking hands. I couldn't stop crying. Even after they came, I felt so unsafe in my own home. I still do sometimes.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Shaken up. Reliving it brings back a lot of those feelings. The fear, the helplessness. But... I guess it's a bit easier to talk about now.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. Well done today.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's still hard, but I want to get better. I don't want this fear controlling my life anymore. Do you think I'm making progress?",
    "Therapist: Yes, you are. Each session helps.",
    "Client: That's good to hear. Sometimes I worry I'll never feel safe again. Especially at night, every little noise makes me jump. But I'm trying to use the techniques we've discussed.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. Keep practicing those.",
    "Client: I will. It's a struggle, but I'm committed to this. I want to be able to enjoy my home again, to feel secure. It's just... it's a long road, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: It can be, but you're on the right path.",
    "Client: Thank you for saying that. It helps to have someone who understands and guides me through this. Sometimes I feel silly for still being so affected by it, but then I remember what you said about trauma responses being normal.",
    "Therapist: They are. You're responding appropriately.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I'm trying to be patient with myself, but it's not easy. Some days are better than others. Today was tough, reliving it all, but I also feel like I've accomplished something. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. It's a sign of progress.",
    "Client: That's encouraging. I'm exhausted now, but in a way, I feel a bit lighter. Like I've let go of some of the weight I've been carrying. Is there anything specific I should focus on before our next session?",
    "Therapist: Continue with your relaxation exercises daily.",
    "Client: Okay, I can do that. The breathing techniques have been helping, especially when I feel anxious at night. I'll make sure to practice them more consistently. Is there anything else you think might help?",

    "Therapist: You did well. We'll continue next time.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm looking forward to it, even though it's challenging. I appreciate your support and guidance through all of this. See you next week.",
