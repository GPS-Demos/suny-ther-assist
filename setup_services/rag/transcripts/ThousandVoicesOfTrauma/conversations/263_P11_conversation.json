    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, John?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. That memory of the car accident... it just brought everything back so vividly. The screeching tires, the impact, the smell of gasoline... it was like I was right there again.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out most?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. Watching that other car coming towards us and knowing there was nothing I could do. It's... it's overwhelming. And then seeing the aftermath, the injuries... God, it was awful. I keep thinking about how it could have been even worse, you know? What if my kids had been in the car?",
    "Therapist: How does that fear affect you now?",
    "Client: It's... it's crippling sometimes. I avoid driving when I can. When I do drive, I'm constantly on edge, watching every car like it's a potential threat. It's exhausting. And it's not just driving. I feel like I'm always waiting for something terrible to happen, even in everyday situations.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does this connect to your goals?",
    "Client: Well, I want to feel normal again. To be able to drive without panic, to not always be anticipating disaster. But it's hard. Reliving that memory... it makes me wonder if I'll ever get there.",
    "Therapist: What gives you hope?",
    "Client: I... I guess the fact that I got through the exposure today. It was tough, but I did it. And... and I've noticed that each time we do this, it gets a tiny bit easier. The memory doesn't lose its impact, but I feel... I don't know, maybe a little more in control?",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress, John.",
    "Client: Thanks. It doesn't always feel like progress, though. Sometimes I worry that I'm not doing enough, or that I'm not getting better fast enough. And then there's this whole human trafficking topic we're supposed to discuss... I mean, how does that even relate to my car accident?",
    "Therapist: How do you think it might connect?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe it's about feeling powerless? In the accident, I couldn't control what was happening. And with human trafficking, those victims... they're completely at the mercy of others. It's a different kind of trauma, but maybe the feelings of helplessness are similar?",
    "Therapist: Interesting observation. How does that insight feel?",
    "Client: It's... unsettling, but also kind of enlightening. I never thought about trauma that way before. It makes me feel less alone, in a way. Like, maybe the strategies we're using here could help people with all kinds of traumas. But it also makes me sad, thinking about how many people out there are struggling with these feelings.",
    "Therapist: What might help you cope with that sadness?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe focusing on what I can control? Like, I can't undo my accident or stop all human trafficking, but I can work on my own recovery. And maybe someday, when I'm in a better place, I could volunteer or something. Help others who've been through trauma.",
    "Therapist: That sounds empowering. Shall we set a goal around that?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Maybe we could look into some volunteer opportunities for the future? Nothing immediate - I know I need to focus on my own healing first. But having that as a long-term goal... it gives me something positive to work towards.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Better, actually. Still a bit shaken from the exposure, but talking it through like this... it helps put things in perspective. I feel like I understand my reactions a bit more now. It's still scary, but not as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, John. What's next?",
    "Client: I think... I want to try driving a bit more this week. Maybe short trips at first. And I want to practice those breathing exercises we talked about, especially when I start feeling anxious on the road. It's not going to be easy, but I'm starting to believe that I can do this.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a solid plan. Anything else?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For guiding me through this. It's tough, but I'm starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel. I know we have more work to do, especially with this human trafficking topic coming up, but I feel a bit more prepared now. Like I have some tools to face it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work, John. See you next week?",
    "Client: Definitely. Thanks again, Doc. I'll see you then."
