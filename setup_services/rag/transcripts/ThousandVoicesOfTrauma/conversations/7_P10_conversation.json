    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to dive into some heavy stuff today.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 40? My stomach's a bit knotted up.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we can pause anytime. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm at the airport. It's bustling, people everywhere. I'm standing in line at the check-in counter, clutching my passport. The air feels thick with anticipation and... and a hint of fear.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: A man approaches me. He's tall, well-dressed. Says he's from the modeling agency I've been talking to online. He seems friendly, but something feels... off. My heart starts racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's climbing... maybe 55? My palms are getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going. What does the man say?",
    "Client: He... he tells me there's been a change of plans. We need to take a different flight. I hesitate, but he's insistent. Says it's a great opportunity, can't miss it. I... I follow him. God, why did I follow him?",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe now. This is just a memory. What happens as you follow him?",
    "Client: We're walking quickly through the airport. My suitcase feels heavy. We're heading towards a different terminal. I'm trying to keep up, but it's like my feet are made of lead. The noise of the airport fades away, and suddenly it's too quiet.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 70 now. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great. What do you notice around you?",
    "Client: We're... we're in a less crowded area now. There's a small private plane on the tarmac. My stomach drops. This isn't right. I try to turn back, but there are two other men behind us now. I'm trapped.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Panic. Pure panic. My heart's pounding so hard I can hear it. I can't breathe. I want to scream, but no sound comes out. Oh god, I can't do this.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Sarah. Take a moment. Breathe with me. In... and out. You're doing incredibly well.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... okay. I'm here. It's just a memory.",
    "Therapist: That's right. When you're ready, continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: They... they're forcing me onto the plane. I'm trying to resist, but they're too strong. The inside of the plane is dark, musty. There are other girls there, all looking terrified. I'm shoved into a seat. Someone zip-ties my hands. I'm crying now, silently.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's 85. My whole body's shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave, Sarah. Remember, you survived this. You're here now, safe. Can you tell me something you can see in this room right now?",
    "Client: I... I can see the plant on your desk. The green leaves.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, when you're ready, let's go back to the memory. What happens after you're seated?",
    "Client: The plane takes off. I'm dizzy, disoriented. The man from the airport is talking, but I can barely hear him over the engine noise. He's saying something about our new lives, our new jobs. But I know... I know it's all lies.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel in this moment?",
    "Client: Helpless. Completely helpless. And angry. So angry at myself for falling for this. I should have known better.",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault, Sarah. You were deceived by professionals. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The flight seems to last forever. I'm trying to memorize details - what the men look like, any landmarks I can see out the window. But it's all a blur. My mind keeps screaming that this can't be real.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still around 80. My hands are clammy.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. You're safe here. What happens when the plane lands?",
    "Client: We touch down somewhere remote. It's dark now. They hustle us off the plane. There are cars waiting. I'm trying to look for road signs, anything to tell me where we are. But there's nothing. Just darkness and fear.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm numb. It's like I've left my body. I can see myself being pushed into a car, but it doesn't feel real. I'm praying someone will see us, save us. But there's no one.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well, Sarah. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually down to about 70 now. Talking about it... it's hard, but it's like I'm draining some of the power from the memory.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's continue. Where does the car take you?",
    "Client: We drive for what feels like hours. Finally, we stop at a large house. It's isolated, surrounded by trees. They push us inside. It's... it's awful. The smell of sweat and fear. There are other women there, some look like they've been there for a while. They don't make eye contact.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: They separate us. I'm taken to a small room. It's bare, just a mattress on the floor. They lock the door. I... I curl up in the corner, trying to make myself as small as possible. I'm so scared, but I'm also thinking about how to escape. I won't let them break me.",
    "Therapist: You're incredibly strong, Sarah. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. My SUDS is around 60 now. Remembering my determination... it helps.",
    "Therapist: That's great. Let's pause here for a moment. Take a few deep breaths. You've done amazing work today.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Thank you. It's... it's still hard, but it feels different talking about it like this.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible courage. How are you feeling about the session?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted, but... I don't know, maybe a little empowered? Like I'm taking some control back by facing this.",
    "Therapist: That's a great insight. You are taking control. Let's end here for today. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later. You did wonderful work today, Sarah.",
    "Client: Thank you. It means a lot to hear that. I... I think I'm ready to go home and rest now.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take care of yourself, and I'll see you next week."
