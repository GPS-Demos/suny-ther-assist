    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mrs. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. It's like I was right back there in that bank, feeling so helpless and terrified. My heart is still racing a bit, and my hands feel clammy. I can almost smell the gunpowder and hear the screams of the other hostages. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What's the strongest emotion coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... anger? Yes, I'm angry that this happened to me. I was just trying to deposit my pension check, and suddenly my whole world turned upside down. Why did it have to be me? Why that day? I keep thinking about how differently things could have gone if I'd just gone to the bank a little earlier or later.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a knot in my stomach. Tight and hot. And my jaw is clenched. I didn't even realize I was doing that until you asked. It's like my body is still bracing for something bad to happen, even though I know I'm safe here.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind as you notice these sensations?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... I'm thinking that I should be over this by now. It's been months, and I'm still reacting like it just happened yesterday. I feel weak, like I can't control my own emotions. And then I feel guilty for feeling this way because I survived, didn't I? Some people weren't as lucky. I should be grateful, but instead, I'm just... scared all the time.",
    "Therapist: Hmm. How does it feel to share these thoughts?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a bit of a relief. I haven't really talked about this with anyone. My children, they try to understand, but they weren't there. They don't know what it was like. And I don't want to burden them with my fears. But talking about it now, it's like... like I'm not carrying this all by myself anymore.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing as we talk?",
    "Client: I'm noticing that my breathing has slowed down a bit. The knot in my stomach is still there, but it's not as intense. And I'm realizing that... that maybe it's okay to feel this way. That doesn't make me weak, does it? It's just... it's just my mind trying to process what happened.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... comforting, in a way. Like maybe I'm not failing at recovering, I'm just... going through the process. But it's also scary. If this is normal, does that mean I'll always feel this way? Will I ever feel safe in a bank again? Or anywhere, for that matter?",
    "Therapist: What would feeling safe look like to you?",
    "Client: Feeling safe... I suppose it would mean being able to go about my day without constantly looking over my shoulder. To be able to hear a loud noise without jumping out of my skin. To sleep through the night without nightmares. To be able to hug my grandchildren without worrying that something terrible might happen to them too.",
    "Therapist: Mm. How does imagining that feel?",
    "Client: It feels... hopeful. Like maybe there's a light at the end of this very dark tunnel. But it also feels so far away. Like I'm reaching for something I can barely see. I want to get there, I really do. I'm just... I'm so tired of being afraid all the time.",
    "Therapist: What gives you strength in these moments?",
    "Client: My faith, I suppose. And my family, even if I don't always share everything with them. The thought of seeing my grandchildren grow up... that keeps me going. And... and talking like this. Facing these memories head-on, as terrifying as it is. There's a small part of me that feels... I don't know, brave? Is that the right word? For not running away from it anymore.",
    "Therapist: How does acknowledging that bravery feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's strange. Good, but strange. I've never really thought of myself as brave. I've always just done what needed to be done. But you're right, this does take courage, doesn't it? Facing these memories, talking about them... maybe I am braver than I thought. That's... that's actually quite empowering.",
    "Therapist: What do you want to remember from today's session?",
    "Client: I want to remember that it's okay to feel what I'm feeling. That it doesn't make me weak or ungrateful. And that even though it's hard, I'm making progress. I'm facing this head-on, and that takes strength. I want to remember that there's hope, even when it feels far away. And that I'm not alone in this journey.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing, Mrs. Johnson. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but in a good way. Like after a long cry. My body feels lighter, somehow. The fear is still there, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming. And there's this tiny spark of... I don't know, maybe pride? For getting through this session, for facing these memories. It's not easy, but I think... I think I'm on the right path.",
    "Therapist: That's great. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to work on some strategies for when the fear gets overwhelming. Ways to ground myself in the present when the memories start to take over. And maybe... maybe we could talk more about how to share some of this with my family? I'm starting to realize that I don't have to go through this alone.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. We'll pick up there next week. Take care, Mrs. Johnson.",
    "Client: Thank you, doctor. I... I appreciate your help more than I can say. See you next week."
