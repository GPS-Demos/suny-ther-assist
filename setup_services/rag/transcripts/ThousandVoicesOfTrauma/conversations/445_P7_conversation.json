    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the workplace incident?",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. It was a typical Monday morning. I walked into the office, and I could feel the tension immediately. My supervisor, Mr. Johnson, was standing by my desk with a stern look on his face. I knew something was wrong. As I approached, he started berating me in front of everyone about a report I had submitted last week. His voice was so loud, and people were staring. I felt my heart racing, and my palms started to sweat.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: He kept saying things like, \"This is unacceptable,\" and \"I expected better from you.\" I tried to explain that I had followed the guidelines, but he wouldn't listen. He just kept getting louder and angrier. I felt so small, so humiliated. It was like I was a child again, being scolded by my neglectful parents. I wanted to disappear.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: It's hard... I remember feeling frozen, unable to move or speak. My colleagues were all watching, some with pity, others seemed to be enjoying the show. I could feel tears welling up in my eyes, but I refused to let them fall. I didn't want to give Mr. Johnson the satisfaction. But inside, I was crumbling. All those years of trying to prove myself, to be better than my upbringing, felt like they were being washed away in an instant.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this really well. Continue.",
    "Client: The worst part was, I knew I had done a good job on that report. I had stayed late for days, double-checking every detail. But in that moment, I doubted everything. Mr. Johnson's words were cutting deep, reopening old wounds from my childhood. I felt worthless, incompetent, just like my parents always made me feel. The office started to spin, and I thought I might pass out.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure I can continue. It's too much.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're in control here.",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. After what felt like hours but was probably only minutes, Mr. Johnson finally stopped. He demanded I redo the entire report by the end of the day and stormed off. I was left standing there, shaking, trying to hold myself together. My colleagues quickly looked away, pretending to be busy. No one came to check on me. I felt so alone, so exposed. It was like being that neglected child all over again, crying out for help and having no one respond.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. But also, a little relieved. It's like a weight has been lifted, even though it was hard to talk about. I've never really told anyone the full story before. It's always been this dark cloud hanging over me, affecting how I interact with authority figures and colleagues. Reliving it was intense, but I think it might help me start to process it better.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's strange, but I feel like I can see the incident more clearly now. I can recognize that Mr. Johnson's behavior was unprofessional and abusive, and it wasn't my fault. I did good work, and I didn't deserve to be treated that way. It's still painful, but I feel like I have a bit more distance from it now. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. That's a positive sign.",
    "Client: I'm glad to hear that. I think I want to work on setting better boundaries at work and not letting these incidents trigger my past trauma so much. And maybe... maybe I need to address some of the lingering issues from my childhood neglect too. I've always tried to push those feelings aside, but I can see now how they're still affecting me.",
    "Therapist: That's a great insight. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. I feel emotionally drained, but also like I've accomplished something important today. Thank you for guiding me through this. It wasn't easy, but I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: You've made significant progress today. We'll continue next session."
