    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Lee. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the earthquake...",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in my apartment. It's early morning, and I'm getting ready for work. Suddenly, everything starts shaking. The floor beneath me feels like it's moving in waves. I hear a loud rumbling noise, and things start falling off shelves. I'm frozen in place, my heart racing.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 5 out of 10. It's uncomfortable, but manageable.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue...",
    "Client: The shaking gets more intense. I can hear people screaming outside. I try to move towards the doorway, but I'm stumbling. A picture frame falls and shatters near my feet. I'm thinking, \"Is this how I die?\" My chest feels tight, and I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 7 now. My palms are getting sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The building is creaking and groaning. I'm certain it's going to collapse. I manage to get under a table, but I feel so helpless. The shaking seems to go on forever. I'm thinking about my family, wondering if they're safe. My whole body is trembling, and I feel nauseous.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: I understand. You're very brave. Take a deep breath. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... After what feels like an eternity, the shaking stops. But I'm too scared to move. I can hear sirens outside, and people crying. The air is thick with dust. I slowly crawl out from under the table, and I see that my apartment is in shambles. I feel dizzy and disoriented. My hands are shaking so much I can barely dial my phone to check on my sister.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's still an 8. My heart is pounding just talking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I finally get through to my sister. She's okay, but her house is damaged. I feel relieved but also guilty that I'm safe while others might be hurt. I make my way outside, and the scene is chaotic. There are cracks in the street, and some buildings have partially collapsed. I see an injured person being helped by neighbors. I feel overwhelmed and helpless.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down a bit. Maybe a 6? Talking about it is helping, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling drained, but also a bit lighter. It's still scary to think about, but not as overwhelming as before.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You did very well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was tough, but I'm glad we did this.",
    "Therapist: We'll end here for today. Remember to practice your breathing exercises."
