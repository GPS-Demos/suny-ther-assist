    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. Going through that memory of the violence I witnessed in my home country... it's like I was right back there, you know? I could hear the screams, smell the smoke... it felt so real.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The fear. It was paralyzing. I remember hiding behind a wall, praying they wouldn't find us. I keep thinking about the children crying... God, their faces. I felt so helpless, like I should've done something, but I was frozen.",
    "Therapist: How does recalling that helplessness feel now?",
    "Client: It's... it's awful. I feel guilty, angry at myself. But also... I don't know, maybe a little less intense than before? Like, I can recognize now that I was just a student, not a soldier. There wasn't much I could've done.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. How does it relate to your current life?",
    "Client: I guess... well, I've been avoiding crowded places here, always feeling on edge. But maybe I'm safer than I think? It's hard to shake that fear, though. Sometimes I still wake up in a panic, thinking I'm back there.",
    "Therapist: Understandable. How has the exposure work affected those reactions?",
    "Client: It's... it's helping, I think. Talking about it is hard, but... I feel less trapped by the memories. Like, I can acknowledge them without being completely overwhelmed. And I've started using those breathing techniques you taught me when I feel anxious.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What else have you noticed?",
    "Client: Well, I've been able to focus a bit better in my classes. And last week, I actually went to a busy caf\u00e9 with my roommate. I was nervous, but I managed it. That's... that's a big step for me.",
    "Therapist: Indeed it is. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's tough, really tough. But... I want to keep going. I want my life back, you know? I don't want to be controlled by fear anymore. I'm starting to see that it's possible to move forward.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful motivation. Any specific goals for our next session?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe we could work on my fear of loud noises? They still trigger me pretty badly. Oh, and I'd like to try going to the student union building. I've been avoiding it because it's always so busy.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like excellent goals. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... okay. Better than I expected, actually. It's like... facing the memory head-on is hard, but it's also freeing in a way. I feel a bit lighter, if that makes sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. Any final thoughts before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like there's hope. Like maybe I can have a normal life here, you know?",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your courage is commendable. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, definitely. Thank you again."
