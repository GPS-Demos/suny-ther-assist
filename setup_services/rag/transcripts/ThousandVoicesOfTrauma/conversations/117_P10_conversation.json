    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. The idea of revisiting that day with the dog attack... it's making my stomach churn a bit. But I know we need to do this, right?",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Just... give me a moment to take a deep breath.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. When you're ready, start describing the event, using present tense.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm... I'm walking down the street near my apartment. It's a sunny day, warm. I can feel the heat on my skin. I'm thinking about the groceries I need to pick up. Then... then I hear it. This loud, aggressive barking. My heart starts racing immediately.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um... probably a 6? My palms are getting sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: I... I see this massive dog. It's a Rottweiler, I think. Its teeth are bared, and it's growling. God, the sound... it's terrifying. I freeze. I can't move. My legs feel like they're made of lead.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: The dog... it's charging at me. I can hear its nails scraping against the pavement. I want to run, but I can't. My breath is coming in short gasps. I'm panicking. Oh god, it's getting closer...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What happens next?",
    "Client: It... it lunges at me. I feel this sharp, searing pain in my leg. I'm screaming, but it sounds far away, like it's not even me. The dog's jaws are clamped on my calf. I can feel its teeth tearing into my flesh. The pain... it's excruciating.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe even a 9. My heart's pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm... I'm on the ground now. The dog is still attacking. I can smell its breath, feel its weight on me. I'm trying to push it off, but it's so strong. There's blood... so much blood. I can see it staining the sidewalk.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Terrified. Helpless. I... I think I'm going to die. No one's coming to help me. I can hear people shouting, but they sound so far away. The pain is overwhelming. I feel like I'm going to pass out.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: Someone... someone's pulling the dog off me. I hear a man yelling. The dog yelps and runs away. I'm lying there, sobbing. My leg... it's a mess. I can see the torn flesh, the blood pooling. I feel nauseous.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: Still... still high. Maybe an 8 now. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Keep going.",
    "Client: People are crowding around me. Someone's calling an ambulance. I'm in shock, I think. Everything feels surreal. The pain is... it's intense, but also dulled somehow. I'm scared to look at my leg again.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking at this moment?",
    "Client: I... I keep wondering why this happened to me. Why didn't I run? Why couldn't I protect myself? I feel so weak, so vulnerable. And I'm worried... worried about how bad the damage is.",
    "Therapist: Those are normal thoughts. What happens as you wait for help?",
    "Client: A woman is holding my hand. She's telling me it'll be okay, but I don't believe her. I can hear sirens in the distance. My leg is throbbing. Every tiny movement sends waves of pain through me. I'm... I'm crying. I can't stop.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe a 7? My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The paramedics arrive. They're talking to me, but I can barely focus. They're examining my leg, and it hurts so much when they touch it. I'm... I'm scared about what they'll say. They're putting me on a stretcher. The movement... it's agonizing.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Overwhelmed. Scared. In pain. As they're loading me into the ambulance, I catch a glimpse of my leg. It's... it's worse than I thought. I feel sick. I'm worried about permanent damage, about scars...",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens in the ambulance?",
    "Client: They're... they're hooking me up to monitors. Asking me questions. I can barely focus enough to answer. The pain is... it's intense. They're giving me something for it, but it's not helping much. I keep replaying the attack in my head. The dog's teeth, the sound of its growl...",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe a 6 now? The medication is starting to help.",
    "Therapist: Good. What are you thinking about as you arrive at the hospital?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm worried about the extent of the damage. Will I be able to walk normally again? Will I need surgery? And... and I'm scared about the possibility of infection. Dog bites can be dangerous, right? I'm also... I'm feeling angry. At the dog's owner, at myself for not being more careful...",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid concerns and feelings. What happens when you get into the emergency room?",
    "Client: It's... it's chaotic. Bright lights, lots of noise. They're transferring me to a bed. A doctor comes to examine my leg. The pain flares up again when they touch it. They're talking about cleaning the wound, about possible nerve damage. I'm... I'm trying to stay calm, but I'm terrified.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. The adrenaline is wearing off, and the reality of what happened is sinking in. I'm... I'm starting to worry about the long-term effects. Will I be afraid of dogs forever? Will I be able to walk down that street again?",
    "Therapist: Those are natural concerns. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's around a 5 now. I'm still anxious, but the immediate panic has subsided.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm breathing. It... it feels good to be back in the present. My leg... my actual leg... it's aching a bit, but nothing like in the memory.",
    "Therapist: You did very well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. Emotionally and physically. But... but also a little proud? I got through it. I didn't think I could relive that moment in such detail.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You showed great courage. Let's end here for today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It... it was hard, but I think it helped. Can we... can we talk about some coping strategies for when I'm not in session? I'm worried about nightmares tonight.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's discuss that now."
