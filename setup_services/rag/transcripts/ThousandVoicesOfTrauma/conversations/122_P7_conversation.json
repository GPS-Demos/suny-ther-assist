    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Can you describe the memory we're focusing on today?",
    "Client: Okay... It's about a time when I was 12. My parents were fighting again. I remember hiding in my room, trying to block out the sounds.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you see and hear.",
    "Client: I can hear my father yelling. He's accusing my mother of something... I'm not sure what. There's a crash - I think he threw something. My heart is racing, and I'm curled up on my bed, hugging my knees.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I can smell the spices from dinner. We had curry earlier. It's dark outside, and I can see the streetlight through my window. I'm shaking, and I feel so alone.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: My mother is crying now. I want to help her, but I'm too scared to leave my room. I feel so helpless... and angry. Why can't they just stop?",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I hear footsteps coming up the stairs. I'm terrified it's my father, but it's my mother. She comes into my room, her face is tear-stained. She tries to smile at me, but I can see the pain in her eyes.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel in this moment?",
    "Client: I feel... guilty. Like I should have done something to help her. But I also feel relieved that she's okay. My stomach is in knots, and I'm fighting back tears.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: My mother sits on the edge of my bed. She strokes my hair and tells me everything will be okay. But I know it's not true. This will happen again, and again. I feel so powerless.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I want to believe her, but I can't. I'm angry at her for lying, angry at my father for hurting her, angry at myself for not being able to stop it. It's all too much...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) I... I can't do this anymore. It's too painful.",
    "Therapist: You're stronger than you think. Let's stay with it a bit longer.",
    "Client: Okay... My mother leaves the room after a while. I'm alone again. I can hear my parents talking in hushed voices downstairs. The tension in the house is suffocating. I can't sleep. I just lie there, staring at the ceiling, wishing I could disappear.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel drained... and sad. But also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved? Like talking about it is lifting some weight off my shoulders.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. You've done excellent work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was hard, but... I think it helped. Can we stop for now?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves before we end the session."
