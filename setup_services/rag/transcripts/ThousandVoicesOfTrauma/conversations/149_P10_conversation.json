    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Singh. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to be talking about some difficult things today, and I'm not sure I'm ready for it. But I suppose that's why I'm here, right?",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start slowly. Can you tell me about the memory we'll be focusing on?",
    "Client: It's... it's about the night my ex-wife told me she wanted a divorce. I remember it so vividly, even though it was years ago. I can feel my heart racing just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed do you feel right now?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 60. It's not overwhelming, but it's definitely there.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Let's begin. Close your eyes and describe what you see.",
    "Client: I'm in our living room. It's late, maybe 11 PM. The TV is on, but muted. I can see the blue light flickering on the walls. Sarah, my ex-wife, she's sitting on the couch, and I'm in my favorite armchair. The air feels... heavy, like something's about to happen.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: Sarah turns to me and says, \"We need to talk.\" Her voice is so cold, so distant. I can feel my stomach dropping. I knew something was wrong, but I wasn't prepared for what came next.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. My palms are sweating, and I can feel my heart pounding in my chest. I want to run, but I'm frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 75 now. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: She tells me she wants a divorce. Just like that. No emotion, no explanation. I... I can't breathe. I'm trying to speak, but no words come out. I feel like I'm drowning.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I finally manage to ask her why. She starts listing off all these reasons - we've grown apart, she's not happy, she wants different things. But all I can think is, \"Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why didn't you give me a chance to fix things?\"",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I stand up. I'm shaking. I can feel this rage building inside me. I've never felt so angry, so betrayed. I start yelling at her, asking how she could do this to us, to our family.",
    "Therapist: And how does Sarah react?",
    "Client: She just sits there, calm as ever. That makes me even angrier. I... I pick up a vase from the coffee table and throw it against the wall. The crash is so loud, it startles both of us.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's at 90 now. I can feel my hands shaking even now.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. This is just a memory.",
    "Client: Right, right... I... After I throw the vase, I see fear in Sarah's eyes for the first time. And suddenly, I'm horrified at what I've done. I've never been violent before. I start apologizing, but she's already heading for the door.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in that moment?",
    "Client: Shame. Overwhelming shame. And fear. I'm afraid I've become my father - the man who used to hit my mother. I swore I'd never be like him, and yet here I am, losing control.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: Sarah leaves. The door slams shut, and I'm left alone in this suddenly huge, empty house. I sink to the floor, surrounded by the broken pieces of the vase. I can't stop crying. I feel like my whole world has just shattered.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I'm at about an 85. It's still intense, but talking about it... it helps, somehow.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's continue.",
    "Client: I spend the whole night on that floor. I can't bring myself to move. When the sun starts to rise, I finally drag myself to bed. But I can't sleep. I keep replaying everything in my head, wondering where it all went wrong.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking that I've failed. As a husband, as a man. I'm thinking about how I'll have to tell our friends, our families. I'm wondering if I'll ever be happy again. And I'm... I'm so angry at Sarah for giving up on us, but I'm even angrier at myself for not seeing it coming.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 70. Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also releasing something.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going.",
    "Client: The next few days are a blur. I don't eat, I barely sleep. I call in sick to work. I can't face anyone. I keep expecting Sarah to come back, to say it was all a mistake. But she doesn't. Instead, I get served with divorce papers.",
    "Therapist: How do you react to that?",
    "Client: I... I completely break down. It's like getting punched in the gut. I can't breathe. I start hyperventilating. I end up calling my sister, and she comes over. She's the one who convinces me to see a therapist.",
    "Therapist: That was a brave decision. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm at about a 60 now. It's still painful to think about, but it doesn't feel as raw as it did before.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Let's continue.",
    "Client: The next few months are the hardest of my life. I have to learn how to live alone again. How to cook for one, how to fill the silence in the house. I start going to therapy regularly. It helps, but there are still days when I can barely get out of bed.",
    "Therapist: What keeps you going during this time?",
    "Client: My work, oddly enough. It gives me something to focus on, a reason to get up in the morning. And my sister - she checks on me every day. Without her, I'm not sure I would have made it through.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 50 now. It's still there, but it's not overwhelming anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How does the memory end for you?",
    "Client: It... it doesn't really end. It's more like it fades. Slowly, day by day, it gets a little easier. I start to have moments where I don't think about Sarah, where I can imagine a future without her. It's not happiness, not yet, but it's... hope, I guess.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm at about a 40 now. Talking about it like this, it's like I can see it from a distance. It still hurts, but it doesn't control me anymore.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today. Let's take a few deep breaths together.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Thank you. This was... it was hard, but I feel lighter somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's often the case with these exercises. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without falling apart. But here I am. I guess I'm stronger than I thought.",
    "Therapist: You absolutely are. We'll end here for today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Tired, but... okay. Better than I expected, actually. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Remember to be kind to yourself for the rest of the day. We'll discuss this further in our next session."
