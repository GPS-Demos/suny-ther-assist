    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is dreading it. It's like there's a knot in my stomach.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. How would you rate your distress from 0 to 100?",
    "Client: Uh, probably around a 60? Yeah, 60.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Can you close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day?",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Alright... I'm... I'm at the refugee camp. It's hot, so hot. The sun is beating down, and there's this constant hum of voices and... and crying. I can smell sweat and dust.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see... I see rows of tents. They're white, but dirty. People are everywhere, just... existing. My family... we're huddled together near our assigned space. My little sister, Sarah, she's clinging to my mom's leg.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My throat feels tight. My hands are... they're clenched. I can feel my heart racing.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: (Voice shaking) The aid workers are coming. They're bringing water and some food. Everyone's rushing, pushing. I... I remember feeling so angry. Why did we have to fight for basic necessities?",
    "Therapist: Stay with that anger. What does it feel like?",
    "Client: It's... it's like fire in my chest. I want to scream, to push back, but I can't. I have to stay calm for my family.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's higher. Maybe 75?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Remember to breathe. What do you see happening around you?",
    "Client: I see... I see my dad. He's trying to get to the front of the line. He looks so... defeated. It's not like him. He was always so strong, you know? But here... here he's just another desperate face in the crowd.",
    "Therapist: How does seeing your father like that make you feel?",
    "Client: It... it breaks my heart. (Voice cracking) I feel so helpless. I want to do something, anything to make it better, but I can't.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. You're safe here. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: (Deep, shaky breath) Okay... okay. I'm watching my dad. He finally gets some water, but it's not enough for all of us. I can see the pain in his eyes when he realizes this.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he comes back to us. He gives the water to my mom and Sarah first. I remember feeling so thirsty, but I didn't say anything. I couldn't.",
    "Therapist: That must have been very difficult. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel a lump in my throat. My eyes are burning. I want to cry, but I'm trying not to.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to let those emotions out, John. You're in a safe space.",
    "Client: (Soft sob) I... I miss him so much. He was so strong for us, even when everything was falling apart.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. What else do you remember from that day?",
    "Client: As the sun starts to set, I remember this... this eerie calm settling over the camp. The noise dies down, but the tension... it's still there, hanging in the air. I'm sitting outside our tent, and I can hear my parents whispering. They're arguing about what to do next.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind as you hear them?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. I've never heard them like this before. They've always been a united front, you know? But now, they sound lost, desperate. I feel like our family is unraveling.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up there. Maybe 85? My chest feels so tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath with me. In... and out. You're doing really well, John. Can you tell me more about what you're experiencing?",
    "Client: I... I remember getting up and walking a little ways from the tent. The camp stretches out in front of me, this sea of desperation. And I... I feel so small. So insignificant. All these people, all this suffering... and for what?",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What does it make you want to do?",
    "Client: I want to scream. I want to run. But I... I can't. I'm rooted to the spot. I feel this weight on my shoulders, like I'm carrying the whole world. And I... I don't know if I can do it.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory very bravely, John. What happens as you stand there?",
    "Client: I... I see an old man. He's sitting alone, staring off into the distance. And suddenly, I feel this... this connection. Like we're all in this together, you know? It doesn't make it better, but... it's something.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful observation. How does that realization affect you?",
    "Client: It's... it's bittersweet. I feel less alone, but also... it's overwhelming. All this shared pain. I remember walking back to our tent, and my dad... he puts his hand on my shoulder. He doesn't say anything, but I can feel his love, his worry.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a meaningful moment. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. Emotionally, physically... everything hurts. But there's also this... I don't know, this weird sense of relief? Like I've been carrying this for so long, and now... now I'm finally letting it out.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after processing difficult memories. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's come down a bit. Maybe 70? I'm exhausted, but... but I'm here.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well, John. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves. Can you tell me three things you see in this room?",
    "Client: I see... I see the plant in the corner. The blue painting on the wall. And... and your notepad.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, two things you can hear?",
    "Client: The ticking of the clock. And... and my own breathing.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Lastly, one thing you can feel?",
    "Client: The softness of this chair.",
    "Therapist: Great job, John. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. Tired, but... but okay. It's like I've run a marathon or something.",
    "Therapist: That's a good analogy. Processing trauma is hard work. Is there anything else you want to share before we start wrapping up?",
    "Client: I just... I never realized how much I was holding onto. It's like I've been carrying this weight for years, and now... now I can feel it starting to lift. It's scary, but... but also kind of freeing?",
    "Therapist: That's a very insightful observation, John. Processing these memories can be difficult, but it's an important step in healing. How would you rate your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 50, I think. I feel... drained, but also... lighter? If that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: It absolutely does. You've done excellent work today, John. Let's take a few more deep breaths together before we end the session.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Okay... yeah, I think I'm ready to wrap up.",
    "Therapist: Alright. We'll end here for today. Remember to be kind to yourself this week. You've done some challenging but important work.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I appreciate your guidance through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, John. I'll see you next week."
