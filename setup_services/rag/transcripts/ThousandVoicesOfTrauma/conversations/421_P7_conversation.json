    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the scene of police brutality you witnessed?",
    "Client: Okay... I was walking home from work late one night. It was dark, and I heard shouting coming from an alley. I saw two police officers confronting a young man. They were yelling at him, but I couldn't make out what they were saying. The man looked terrified, he had his hands up, but the officers kept advancing...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you saw.",
    "Client: One of the officers suddenly grabbed the man and slammed him against the wall. The other officer started hitting him with a baton. I... I froze. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. The man was crying out in pain, begging them to stop. But they didn't... they just kept hitting him...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What were you feeling?",
    "Client: I felt... horrified. Helpless. My heart was racing, and I couldn't move. I wanted to help, but I was scared they'd turn on me too. I'm Middle Eastern, and with all the stereotypes... I just... I couldn't risk it. But the guilt... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The sound of the baton hitting him... it was sickening. I could hear his bones cracking. Blood was everywhere. I... I started to feel dizzy. I wanted to throw up. But I couldn't look away. It felt like it went on forever, but it was probably only a few minutes.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: Eventually, they stopped. The man was barely conscious. They handcuffed him and dragged him to their car. I... I just stood there, hidden in the shadows. I didn't do anything to help him. I feel like such a coward...",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're not responsible for their actions.",
    "Client: But I should have done something! Anything! Called for help, recorded it on my phone... instead, I just watched. And now, every time I see a police officer, I panic. I can't trust them. I keep reliving that night, wondering what would have happened if it was me instead of that man...",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to feel that way. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... angry. Scared. Guilty. My hands are shaking, and I feel sick to my stomach. It's like I'm back there again, watching it happen. I can't shake this feeling of helplessness...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) It's just... it's not fair. That man didn't deserve that. And I... I feel like I failed him by not doing anything. I keep wondering what happened to him after that night. Did he survive? Is he okay? I'll never know, and that haunts me...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have these thoughts. You're processing the event.",
    "Client: I guess... I just feel so angry at the system. How can people sworn to protect us do something like that? And how many times has this happened without anyone knowing? It makes me feel so unsafe, like I can't trust anyone in authority...",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Let's focus on your breathing for a moment.",
    "Client: (Breathes slowly) It helps a little... but I still feel this heaviness in my chest. Every time I close my eyes, I see that man's face. The terror in his eyes... it's haunting. And the sound of the baton... I can't get it out of my head. It's like it's echoing constantly...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: I... I'm trying. But it's so hard. I feel like I'm suffocating sometimes. Like the guilt and fear are crushing me. I keep thinking about my own experiences with discrimination, and how easily it could have been me in that alley. It makes me feel so vulnerable and alone...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I know I'm safe here, but... out there? I don't feel safe anywhere anymore. I'm always looking over my shoulder, always on edge. I've become so isolated. I barely leave my house except for work. I can't trust anyone, especially authority figures. It's like that night shattered my whole world...",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength by facing this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. But also... maybe a little relieved? Talking about it... it's hard, but it feels like I'm finally letting some of this out. I've kept it bottled up for so long. I still feel the guilt and fear, but maybe... maybe it's not quite as overwhelming as before?",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. Well done for today.",
    "Client: Thank you... I think I need some time to process all of this. It's a lot to take in, and I'm feeling pretty raw right now. But... I think I want to keep working on this. Maybe... maybe it can get better?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll continue next session. Take care."
