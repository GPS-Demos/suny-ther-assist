    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, John?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, to be honest. It's a lot to process. Reliving that moment when Sarah told me she wanted a divorce... it's still so raw, you know? Even though it's been months, it feels like it just happened yesterday. My heart was racing, and I felt this tightness in my chest, just like I did that day.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The look on her face. It was so... final. Like she had already made up her mind, and nothing I could say would change it. I keep seeing that expression, over and over. It's haunting me. And then I think about how alone I feel now, living in that big house by myself. It's like a double whammy, you know? Losing Sarah and then feeling so isolated.",
    "Therapist: How does that isolation connect to your anxiety?",
    "Client: God, it's like fuel to the fire. When I'm alone, my mind just races. I worry about everything - my future, my job, even silly things like whether I remembered to lock the door. It's exhausting. And then I start thinking about Sarah again, and the cycle continues. It's like I can't escape these thoughts.",
    "Therapist: I see. What did you notice about your body during the exposure?",
    "Client: My hands were shaking. I didn't realize it until afterwards, but they were trembling the whole time. And my breathing... it was shallow, like I couldn't get enough air. It's funny, I didn't notice these things when it actually happened. I was too shocked, I guess. But reliving it now, I'm so much more aware of how my body reacts.",
    "Therapist: How does this awareness feel?",
    "Client: It's... uncomfortable, but also kind of empowering? Like, now that I can recognize these reactions, maybe I can start to manage them better. Is that crazy?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. Can you elaborate?",
    "Client: Well, I'm thinking that if I can catch myself when my hands start shaking or my breathing gets shallow, maybe I can use some of those grounding techniques we've talked about. You know, focus on my breath, or name five things I can see. It might help me stay more present instead of getting lost in the anxiety.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent insight. How else might this help?",
    "Client: I suppose... it could help me in other situations too. Like, when I'm at work and feeling overwhelmed, or when I'm home alone and start to panic. If I can recognize the physical signs earlier, maybe I can intervene before the anxiety gets out of control. It's like... early detection, I guess?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. How do you feel about your progress?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard to see sometimes. Some days I feel like I'm right back where I started. But then I have moments like this, where I can actually see a way forward. It's not easy, reliving these memories. But I'm starting to understand why we're doing it. It's like... exposure therapy for my emotions, if that makes sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. What's your takeaway from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. Facing these memories is tough, but I'm doing it. And maybe, just maybe, by facing them head-on, I can start to loosen their grip on me. It's a long road, but I feel like I'm finally moving forward instead of being stuck in that moment when Sarah left.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How will you carry this forward?",
    "Client: I want to practice being more aware of my body's reactions. Maybe I can keep a journal, noting when I feel anxious and what physical symptoms I notice. And I'll try to use those grounding techniques more often. It's not going to be easy, but... I'm ready to put in the work. I want to get better, not just for myself, but to show that I can overcome this.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: I... I think that's enough for today. This session has given me a lot to think about. I'm exhausted, but in a good way, if that makes sense? Like I've done something important, even if it was difficult. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like there's hope.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today, John. We'll continue next week."
