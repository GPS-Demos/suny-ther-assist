    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's like I'm right back there, you know? The memory of my ex-wife telling me she wanted a divorce... it's so vivid. I can feel this tightness in my chest, and my hands are a bit clammy.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep hearing her words echoing in my head. \"I don't love you anymore.\" It's... it's like a punch to the gut, even now. I'm thinking about how I failed, how I wasn't good enough. And then I remember all the times I was bullied in school, and it's like... it's all connected somehow. Like I've never been good enough for anyone.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does your body feel as you're experiencing these thoughts?",
    "Client: My shoulders are tense, and I feel this heaviness in my stomach. It's like I'm carrying this weight that I can't shake off. My throat feels tight too, like I'm trying to hold back tears. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are coming up for you?",
    "Client: Sadness, definitely. A deep, aching sadness. But there's anger too, you know? I'm angry at her for giving up on us, angry at myself for not being able to make it work. And then there's this... shame. Like I'm back in school, being laughed at by the other kids. It's all mixed up together.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when the divorce first happened?",
    "Client: They're... they're not as intense now, I guess. When it first happened, I felt like I couldn't breathe. Now it's more like... a dull ache. But bringing it up in these sessions, it sometimes feels fresh again. Like I'm reliving it, but I'm also... I don't know, observing it? Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it does. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm noticing that... well, as painful as this is, I'm able to sit with it more than I used to. Before, I'd do anything to avoid thinking about the divorce or the bullying. Now, it's still hard, but I can... I can look at it. And I'm realizing that maybe... maybe it wasn't all my fault. The divorce, I mean. And the bullying definitely wasn't my fault. It's like... I'm seeing things a bit differently.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. How does that realization feel?",
    "Client: It feels... liberating, in a way. But also scary. Because if it wasn't all my fault, then... then I have to accept that sometimes bad things just happen. And that's a hard pill to swallow. But it also means that maybe I'm not as... broken as I thought I was. It's confusing, but also kind of hopeful?",
    "Therapist: Can you tell me more about that hope?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... if I'm not fundamentally flawed, then maybe I can heal from this. Maybe I can have healthy relationships in the future. I've been so afraid of getting close to anyone since the divorce, always expecting to be rejected or hurt. But if I can start to see that I'm not destined to fail... maybe I can start to open up again. It's terrifying, but also... exciting?",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about your progress in therapy?",
    "Client: It's... it's been hard, really hard. But I think I'm making progress. These sessions, they're like... they're like lancing a wound. It hurts, but it's also letting out all this stuff that's been festering inside me. And I'm starting to see patterns, you know? How the bullying affected my self-esteem, how that played into my marriage and the divorce. It's all connected, and understanding that... it's helping me make sense of things.",
    "Therapist: What do you think is the next step in your healing journey?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to work on forgiving myself. For the marriage ending, for letting the bullies affect me so much. And maybe... maybe even start to forgive my ex-wife and those bullies. Not for them, but for me. Because holding onto all this anger and hurt, it's... it's exhausting. And I want to move forward, you know? I want to be able to trust again, to maybe even find love again someday. But first, I need to... I need to make peace with my past.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you feel about ending our session here today?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but in a good way? Like I've done some hard work. And I'm... I'm grateful. For this space, for your guidance. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm on the right path. Thank you.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue next week."
