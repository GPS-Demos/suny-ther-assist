    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's begin. Close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in my childhood home. It's the day of the earthquake. I can feel the ground starting to shake beneath my feet. The walls are trembling, and I hear the sound of glass breaking. My heart is racing, and I'm frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably about a 6 out of 10. I can feel my palms getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: The shaking is getting stronger. I'm trying to move, but I can't. I see my mom rushing towards me, but she looks terrified. The bookshelf next to me starts to topple over. I'm so scared, I can't even scream.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's going up. Maybe an 8 now. My chest feels tight, and I'm having trouble breathing.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: The bookshelf crashes down, missing me by inches. My mom grabs me and pulls me under the doorframe. I can hear my dad yelling from another room, but I can't make out what he's saying. The noise is deafening - creaking, crashing, people screaming outside.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm right back there. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're here with me, safe.",
    "Client: I'm trying... The shaking finally stops, but now there's dust everywhere. I can barely see. My mom is holding me so tight it hurts. I hear sirens in the distance. I'm crying, but I can't stop shaking. I keep thinking it's going to start again at any moment.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's still high, maybe 8.5. My heart is pounding, but I'm starting to remember I'm here with you.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: We stumble outside. Our street looks completely different. There are cracks in the road, fallen trees, broken windows everywhere. I see our neighbors crying and hugging each other. I feel so small and helpless. I just want everything to go back to normal.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7 now. I'm feeling sad more than scared.",
    "Therapist: That's natural. Continue.",
    "Client: We spend the night in a shelter. I can't sleep. Every little noise makes me jump. I keep replaying the earthquake in my mind. I'm worried about our house, my toys, our cat. I don't know when we'll be able to go home.",
