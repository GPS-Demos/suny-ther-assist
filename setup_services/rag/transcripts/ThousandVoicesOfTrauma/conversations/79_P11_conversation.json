    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving that memory of my ex-husband's violent outburst... it's like I was right back there in our kitchen, feeling so small and helpless. My heart's still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most about the experience?",
    "Client: The sound of his voice. It was so... cold. I'd forgotten how menacing he could sound. And the way my body just froze, like I couldn't move even if I wanted to. It's funny, I always thought I was weak for not fighting back, but now I realize it was just my body trying to protect me.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. How does it feel to recognize that now?",
    "Client: It's... liberating, I guess. But also sad. I spent so many years blaming myself for not standing up to him. Now I see it wasn't my fault. I was just trying to survive.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it connect to your recovery goals?",
    "Client: Well, I've been working on forgiving myself, right? This helps. It's like... maybe I can finally start letting go of some of that guilt I've been carrying around. But it's hard. Part of me still feels like I should have done more.",
    "Therapist: I hear that struggle. What would you say to a friend who felt that way?",
    "Client: Oh, I'd tell her it wasn't her fault at all! That she did the best she could in a terrible situation. I'd... oh. I see what you did there. I guess I need to be kinder to myself, huh?",
    "Therapist: That's a great observation. How might you practice that self-compassion?",
    "Client: I suppose I could... maybe write myself a letter? From the perspective of a supportive friend. Or... I don't know, maybe when those guilty thoughts come up, I could try to challenge them. Remind myself that I was just trying to survive.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent ideas. How do you feel about continuing with the exposures?",
    "Client: It's tough, I won't lie. But... I think it's helping. Each time, I feel a little stronger, a little more in control. It's like... I'm finally facing the monster under the bed and realizing it can't hurt me anymore. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What's giving you the strength to keep going?",
    "Client: I guess... I'm tired of letting the past control me. I want to enjoy my retirement, maybe even start dating again someday. And... I want to be a strong example for my grandkids. Show them that it's never too late to heal and grow.",
    "Therapist: That's really inspiring, Sarah. How can we build on this progress?",
    "Client: Well, I think I need to keep challenging those negative thoughts. And maybe... maybe it's time I start talking to my kids about what happened. They were so young then, and I've always tried to protect them from the truth. But I think they deserve to know, and maybe it'll help me feel less... alone in all this.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a big step. How do you feel about that idea?",
    "Client: Scared, honestly. But also... hopeful? Like maybe by opening up, I can finally close this chapter of my life. And who knows, maybe it'll bring us closer as a family.",
    "Therapist: That's a courageous perspective. What's your next small step?",
    "Client: I think... I'll start by journaling about it. Plan out what I want to say, how I want to approach it. And maybe we can practice it here, in our sessions? I think I'd feel more confident if I could run it by you first.",
    "Therapist: That's a great plan. Is there anything else you want to discuss today?",
    "Client: No, I think that's enough for now. This session was... intense. But good. I feel drained, but also... lighter? Like I've put down a heavy bag I've been carrying for years. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Sarah. You've done incredible work today. Take care of yourself this week."
