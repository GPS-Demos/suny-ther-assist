    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Can you describe the home invasion incident?",
    "Client: Okay... It was late at night, around 2 AM. I was working on some designs in my home office when I heard a loud crash from downstairs. At first, I thought maybe I'd left a window open and something fell, but then I heard footsteps. My heart started racing immediately.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: I froze for a moment, not sure what to do. Then I heard multiple voices, male voices, speaking in hushed tones. I realized there were intruders in my house. I felt a wave of panic wash over me. I thought about my wife, who was asleep in our bedroom, and I felt this overwhelming need to protect her.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I quietly got up from my chair and crept to the door of my office. My hands were shaking so badly I could barely turn the doorknob. I was terrified they'd hear me. As I opened the door, I could see shadows moving at the bottom of the stairs. I felt like I couldn't breathe.",
    "Therapist: That's it. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I knew I had to get to my wife, but to do that, I'd have to pass the top of the stairs where they might see me. I started inching along the hallway, pressing myself against the wall. Every creak of the floorboards felt like an explosion in my ears. I was sweating profusely, and my heart was pounding so hard I was sure they could hear it.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: As I passed the top of the stairs, I glanced down and saw them. Three men, all dressed in black, rifling through our belongings. One of them looked up suddenly, and for a split second, our eyes met. I felt like my blood turned to ice. He shouted something, and I just... I panicked.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I ran to our bedroom, slammed the door shut, and locked it. My wife woke up, startled and confused. I could hear the men thundering up the stairs. I grabbed my phone and dialed 911 with trembling fingers. My wife was asking what was happening, and I was trying to explain while talking to the operator. The men were banging on our door, shouting threats. I thought... I thought we were going to die.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job. Continue.",
    "Client: We huddled in the corner of the room, holding each other. The banging on the door was getting more violent. I could hear wood splintering. My wife was crying, and I felt so helpless. I kept thinking about all the things I should have done differently. Why didn't I have better security? Why didn't I confront them? I felt like such a coward.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're recounting this memory. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Just as I thought the door was about to give way, we heard sirens. The banging stopped abruptly, and we could hear the men cursing and running back down the stairs. There was the sound of breaking glass \u2013 I think they jumped out a window. A few moments later, the police were shouting outside our house. I've never felt such intense relief in my life.",
    "Therapist: You've done very well. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Reliving that night is exhausting. I can still feel the fear and helplessness. But... I also feel a bit lighter, like I've let out something that's been bottled up inside me for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You've shown great courage.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to talk about, but I think it's getting easier each time. I just wish I could shake this feeling of vulnerability. Ever since that night, I've felt like my home isn't safe anymore. We've installed a security system and reinforced the doors, but I still wake up at every little noise.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. Sometimes I feel silly for being so affected by this. I mean, physically, we weren't harmed. But mentally... it's like a weight I carry around all the time. I keep replaying that moment when I met the intruder's eyes. What if he had been armed? What if the police hadn't arrived in time?",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have these thoughts. Let's explore them.",
    "Client: Okay. I guess the worst part is feeling like I failed to protect my family. I'm supposed to be the man of the house, you know? But in that moment, I was paralyzed with fear. I couldn't confront them, I couldn't fight them off. All I could do was run and hide. What kind of man does that make me?",
    "Therapist: You made decisions to keep your family safe. That's important.",
    "Client: I suppose you're right. It's just hard to see it that way sometimes. The logical part of me knows that confronting armed intruders would have been foolish and dangerous. But there's this other part of me that feels like a failure. Like I should have done more, been braver, stronger.",
    "Therapist: Your safety was paramount. You acted wisely.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm trying to see it that way. It's a process, I guess. Some days are better than others. I'm grateful that my wife and I are safe, but I can't help wondering how long it will take before I feel truly secure in my own home again. Will I ever be able to sleep through the night without waking up in a cold sweat?",
    "Therapist: With time and work, things will improve. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I hope so. This therapy is helping, even though it's difficult to relive these memories. It's like... by facing them head-on, they're losing some of their power over me. But it's a slow process. Sometimes I feel like I'm not making any progress at all.",
    "Therapist: You are progressing. Each session is a step forward.",
    "Client: You're right. I need to remember that. It's just... the aftermath of the invasion has affected so many aspects of my life. My work has suffered because I can't concentrate. I'm always on edge, always expecting something bad to happen. It's exhausting. But being here, talking about it... it does help. Even if it's painful in the moment.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent insight. Shall we conclude for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. This session has been intense, but I feel like we've made some progress. Thank you for your guidance and support. I'm looking forward to our next session, even though I know it won't be easy.",
    "Therapist: You've done well today. We'll continue next time."
