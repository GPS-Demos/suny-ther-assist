    "Therapist: Welcome back. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm... not sure. To be honest, I'm a bit nervous. I've been thinking about it since our last session, and I'm worried about how I'll react. You know, at my age, I thought I'd left all this behind me. But here we are, digging it all up again. It's unsettling.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... I've spent years trying to forget that hostage situation. The idea of deliberately reliving it feels counterintuitive. What if it makes things worse? What if I can't handle it? I'm not as young as I used to be, and my nerves aren't what they were.",
    "Therapist: I understand. How do you think this might help?",
    "Client: I suppose... if I face it head-on, maybe it won't have such a hold on me anymore? But it's scary. That day... it changed everything. My family doesn't even know the full extent of what happened. I've never told anyone all the details.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. What questions do you have about the process?",
    "Client: How long will we spend on this? Will you stop if it becomes too much? And... will I have to share everything, even the parts I've never spoken about?",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. You're in control. What else?",
    "Client: I... I'm worried about how I'll feel afterwards. Will I be able to function normally? I have responsibilities at home, and even though I only work part-time now, I can't afford to be... incapacitated.",
    "Therapist: That's a valid concern. How can we address it?",
    "Client: Maybe... could we schedule these sessions for when I have a day off afterwards? And perhaps you could give me some strategies for grounding myself if things get overwhelming?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll work together to ensure you feel safe and supported.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate that. It's... it's not easy, you know? At my age, with my background, seeking help wasn't something we did. But after the divorce, and moving in with my children... I realized I needed to address this. For them, if not for myself.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. Yes. Let's do this. I'm still nervous, but I trust you. And I want to get better. I want to be free of this weight I've been carrying for so long. It's time.",
    "Therapist: I'm here with you. Let's start slowly..."
