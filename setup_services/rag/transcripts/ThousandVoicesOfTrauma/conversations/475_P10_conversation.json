    "Therapist: Welcome, Jake. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Uh, I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to dive into some heavy stuff today.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Right, um... I'd say about a 4 out of 10 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. When you're ready, close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Alright... I'm there. It's hot, really hot. The sun's beating down on us. I can feel sweat trickling down my back under my gear. We're on patrol, moving through this small village. Everything's quiet, too quiet.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see... dusty streets. Low buildings, mostly tan-colored. There are clothes hanging out to dry, but no people around. It's eerie. My squad is spread out, we're all on high alert.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My heart's racing a bit. My hands are sweaty on my rifle. I'm scanning everything, trying to spot any movement.",
    "Therapist: Stay present in that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: We're approaching an intersection. Jenkins is on point. He signals us to hold up. There's... there's a car parked at the corner. It doesn't look right. I've got this knot in my stomach.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to a 6, I think.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Jenkins is moving closer to the car. I want to tell him to stop, but I can't... I can't get the words out. Everything's moving in slow motion. Then... oh God... there's a flash. A deafening boom. I'm thrown back.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) I... I can't see. There's dust everywhere. My ears are ringing. I'm on the ground, trying to get up. I can taste blood in my mouth. I'm yelling for Jenkins, for anyone.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What do you see as the dust clears?",
    "Client: It's... it's chaos. There's debris everywhere. I see someone down... it's Miller. He's not moving. I crawl towards him, dragging my rifle. I can hear shouting, but it sounds far away.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. Angry. Confused. My SUDS is probably an 8 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Jake. Remember, you're here in the room with me.",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, okay. (takes a shaky breath) I reach Miller. He's breathing, but there's blood... so much blood. I'm calling for a medic, trying to remember my training. I'm putting pressure on his wound, but my hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"This can't be happening. We were just talking this morning. He showed me pictures of his kid.\" I'm... I'm scared he's going to die right here.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: The medic arrives. He's working on Miller. I'm still holding pressure, my hands are covered in blood. I can hear more explosions in the distance. Someone's yelling orders, but I can barely focus.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still at an 8. Maybe even a 9.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Remember to breathe.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay... The dust is settling more. I can see the extent of the damage now. The car is just... gone. There's a crater where it was. And Jenkins... (voice breaks) I can see parts of him. He didn't... he didn't make it.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel upset. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I feel like I'm going to be sick. The smell... it's overwhelming. Burnt metal, explosives, blood. I've never smelled anything like it. I want to run, but I can't leave Miller.",
    "Therapist: What do you do?",
    "Client: I stay. I help the medic stabilize Miller. We get him on a stretcher. I'm moving on autopilot. My hands won't stop shaking. I keep looking for more threats, expecting another explosion.",
    "Therapist: How long does this go on?",
    "Client: It feels like hours, but it's probably only minutes. The medevac arrives. As they're loading Miller, I finally look down at myself. I'm covered in dust and blood. I realize some of it might be mine, but I can't feel anything.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Jake. Keep going.",
    "Client: After the medevac leaves, we secure the area. I'm numb. I'm going through the motions, but it's like I'm watching myself from outside my body. We find... we find what's left of Jenkins. I help put him in a body bag. I can't stop thinking about how I should have said something, should have warned him.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you couldn't have known.",
    "Client: (nods slowly) I know, but... it's hard. The rest of the day is a blur. Debriefings, more patrols. I keep expecting another attack. Every car, every corner... it all looks like a threat now.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, thinking back on this?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Sad. Angry. My SUDS is down to maybe a 6 or 7.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've been through a lot.",
    "Client: Yeah... When we finally get back to base, I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see Jenkins. I see Miller's blood on my hands. I keep hearing that explosion.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with those feelings?",
    "Client: I don't, not really. I throw myself into work. I volunteer for extra patrols. Anything to keep busy, to not think about it. But it's always there, in the back of my mind.",
    "Therapist: What about now? How are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. My heart's still racing a bit, but not as bad. My SUDS is probably down to a 5 now.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well, Jake. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: Okay... (takes a deep breath) I can feel the chair beneath me. I can hear the clock ticking. I'm here, in your office. It's... it's over.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You're safe here. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. Tired, but okay. My SUDS is down to a 3 or 4.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's talk about what you experienced.",
    "Client: Yeah... it's still hard to talk about, but... it feels a little less overwhelming now. Like I can look at it without being completely consumed by it.",
    "Therapist: That's the goal. You did really well today, Jake.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's... it's tough, but I think it's helping. I feel like I can breathe a little easier.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. We'll end here for today. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later.",
    "Client: I will. Thanks, doc. Same time next week?",
    "Therapist: Yes, I'll see you then. Take care, Jake."
