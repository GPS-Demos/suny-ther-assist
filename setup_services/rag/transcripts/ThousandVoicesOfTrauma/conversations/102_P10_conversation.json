    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Hernandez. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a lot on my mind. The idea of revisiting the earthquake... it's daunting. But I know we need to do this work.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0-100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 40. My stomach's a bit tight, but I'm here, you know?",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I'm in my office. It's a normal Tuesday afternoon. The sun is streaming through the blinds, creating stripes on my desk. I can smell the coffee from the break room. Everything seems so ordinary, so calm. Then... then it starts.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: The ground... it starts to shake. Gently at first, like a truck passing by. But it doesn't stop. It gets stronger. My coffee mug starts to rattle on the desk. I... I freeze. I can't move.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Terror. Pure terror. My heart is racing. I can hear it pounding in my ears. I... I can't breathe. The shaking is getting worse. Books are falling off shelves. There's a crashing sound from somewhere in the building.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're safe here. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 70. God, it feels so real.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. The shaking is intense now. I finally snap out of my freeze and dive under my desk. The lights are flickering. I can hear people screaming in the hallway. There's a deafening roar, like the whole world is being torn apart.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm going to die. This is it. I'll never see my kids again. I... I regret not calling my ex-wife to apologize for our last fight. The guilt, the fear... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: The building is groaning. Pieces of the ceiling are falling. Dust is everywhere. I can barely breathe. I'm curled up under the desk, my arms over my head. I'm praying, begging for it to stop. But it just keeps going.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your body?",
    "Client: I'm shaking. My muscles are so tense it hurts. I feel nauseous. There's this... this acrid taste in my mouth. Fear. It tastes like fear.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's 85 now. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Remember, you survived this. You're here now, safe.",
    "Client: Right... right. I... I hear a loud crack. Part of the wall collapses. There's debris everywhere. The air is thick with dust. I can't see clearly. I'm coughing, struggling to breathe. And then... finally... the shaking starts to subside.",
    "Therapist: What happens as the shaking stops?",
    "Client: It's... it's eerily quiet for a moment. Just the sound of settling debris. Then I hear moans, cries for help. I'm... I'm afraid to move. What if there's an aftershock? But I know I need to get out.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel in that moment?",
    "Client: Terrified, but... also grateful. I'm alive. I slowly crawl out from under the desk. My legs are shaky. I... I see blood on my hands. I must have cut myself on something. The office is unrecognizable. It's like a war zone.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I make my way to the door. It's jammed. I have to force it open. The hallway is chaos. People are stumbling around, dazed. Some are injured. I... I want to help, but I also want to run. I feel... I feel guilty about that.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have conflicting feelings in a crisis. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I help a colleague who's trapped under a fallen bookcase. We make our way to the stairwell. It's dark, the emergency lights are flickering. We stumble down the stairs, holding onto each other. I can hear sirens outside.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 60. Reliving it is hard, but... I know I'm here, safe.",
    "Therapist: You're doing excellent work. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: We... we finally make it outside. The street is... it's like something out of a movie. Buildings are damaged, some have collapsed. There's dust and smoke everywhere. People are crying, hugging each other. I... I see an older woman, she reminds me of my mother. She's alone, looking lost. I go to her, try to comfort her.",
    "Therapist: That was a compassionate action. How did that make you feel?",
    "Client: It... it helped. Helping her gave me a purpose. It took me out of my own fear for a moment. But then... then I see the bodies. People who didn't make it out. And the guilt hits me again. Why did I survive when they didn't?",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. Remember, it's not your fault.",
    "Client: I know that now, but then... it was overwhelming. I... I sit down on the curb. My legs give out. I'm shaking uncontrollably. Someone puts a blanket around my shoulders. I... I can't stop staring at the rubble of my office building.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking as you look at the building?",
    "Client: I... I keep replaying it in my mind. What if I had left work early? What if I had been in a different part of the building? It's... it's a loop of 'what ifs'. And then... then I think of my family. I need to call them, let them know I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: How does thinking about your family affect you?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of relief and worry. Relief that I can call them, that I'm alive to do so. But worry too. What if something happened to them? The city is in chaos. I... I fumble for my phone. My hands are shaking so much I can barely dial.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 50. Talking about it, it's helping. It's still intense, but... I feel more in control.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's continue.",
    "Client: I... I finally get through to my daughter. She's crying, relieved to hear my voice. She tells me she and her brother are okay. They're at their mother's house. I... I feel this wave of relief wash over me. But then... then I think of all the people around me who might not be so lucky.",
    "Therapist: How do you handle those conflicting emotions?",
    "Client: It's... it's difficult. I feel guilty for feeling relieved. I look around at the devastation, at the people still searching for loved ones. I... I want to help, but I also want to run to my family. I feel torn.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction in such an extraordinary situation.",
    "Client: I... I end up staying. Helping where I can. Moving rubble, comforting others. As the hours pass, the reality sets in. Our city will never be the same. I... I realize I'll never feel as safe as I did before. The world feels... fragile.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization impact you?",
    "Client: It's... it's profound. Scary. But also... it makes me appreciate things more. Life feels more precious. I... I remember looking up at the sky as night falls. The stars are so bright without the city lights. It's beautiful, but... haunting.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. Emotionally exhausted. But... there's also a sense of relief. Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's often how people feel after processing trauma. Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to about 30 now. I... I feel more at peace with what happened.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: Thank you. It... it helps to talk about it. To really face it. I... I think I understand now why this is important.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay. I... I appreciate your guidance through this. It wasn't easy, but... I think it was necessary.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today, Mr. Hernandez. How about we end here and discuss how you're feeling?"
