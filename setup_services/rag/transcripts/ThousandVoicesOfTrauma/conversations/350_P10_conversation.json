    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're in control. Can you describe where you are in the memory?",
    "Client: I... I'm at the airport. It's bustling with people, but I feel so alone. My hands are sweaty, and my heart's racing. I can smell the coffee from the nearby caf\u00e9, but it's making me nauseous.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What's happening now?",
    "Client: I'm boarding the plane. The narrow aisle feels suffocating. I can hear the hum of the engines starting up. My chest feels tight, and I'm struggling to breathe normally.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling?",
    "Client: About... about 70. It's intense.",
    "Therapist: Okay, take a deep breath. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: I've found my seat. The leather feels cold against my skin. The safety demonstration is starting, but I can barely focus. My mind keeps jumping to worst-case scenarios. I... I think I'm going to be sick.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What's happening in your body?",
    "Client: My stomach is in knots. I can feel sweat trickling down my back. The plane starts moving, and I grip the armrests so hard my knuckles turn white. I want to scream, but I can't make a sound.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: We're taking off now. The acceleration pushes me back into my seat. I can hear a baby crying a few rows behind me. It's... it's making me think of my own child at home. What if I never see them again? Oh god, I can't do this...",
    "Therapist: You can do this. You're safe here. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I'm trying to distract myself by looking out the window. The ground is getting smaller. Buildings look like toys. But then we hit some turbulence, and my heart feels like it's going to explode. I close my eyes tightly.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's 85. Maybe higher. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Focus on your breath. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... okay. We're at cruising altitude now. The seatbelt sign turns off, but I can't bring myself to unbuckle. The flight attendant offers me a drink, but I shake my head. My mouth is too dry to speak.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep describing what's happening.",
    "Client: I... I need to use the restroom, but I'm terrified to move. What if getting up somehow throws the plane off balance? It's irrational, I know, but I can't shake the fear. I'm trapped in my seat, my bladder aching.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: Hours pass, or maybe it's just minutes. Time feels distorted. Every little noise makes me flinch. The person next to me is sleeping peacefully, and I envy them. How can they be so calm?",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about my late wife. How she always held my hand during flights. I miss her so much. The grief hits me like a wave, mixing with the fear. I feel so overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: Allow yourself to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud bang. The plane shudders violently. Oxygen masks drop from the ceiling. People are screaming. I'm frozen in terror. This is it. This is how I die.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here with me. You're safe. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's 95. I can barely think straight.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Ground yourself in the present moment.",
    "Client: *shaky breath* The plane is diving. I can see the ocean getting closer through the window. My life flashes before my eyes. I think of my family, my unfinished business. The regret is overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're doing great.",
    "Client: There's a deafening crash. Water rushes in. It's so cold. I'm fumbling with my seatbelt, but my fingers won't cooperate. People are pushing past me. I can't breathe. The water is rising. I'm going to drown. I'm... I'm...",
    "Therapist: You're here. You're safe. Take a moment to breathe.",
    "Client: *gasping* I... I made it out somehow. I'm in the water, clinging to a piece of debris. The salt stings my eyes. I can see others around me, some moving, some... not. The plane is sinking nearby. The shock is setting in.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Numb. Scared. Guilty for surviving. My whole body aches. I'm so cold. I keep thinking about the people who didn't make it out. Their faces haunt me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: Hours pass. The sun is setting. I'm so thirsty. My lips are cracked and bleeding. I drift in and out of consciousness. I hallucinate my wife calling out to me. Part of me wants to let go and join her.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 80 now. I'm exhausted.",
    "Therapist: Keep going. You're almost through it.",
    "Client: I hear... I hear a helicopter. At first, I think I'm imagining it. But then I see the searchlight. They've found us. I want to cry, but I'm too dehydrated. As they pull me from the water, I feel a mix of relief and crushing guilt.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to be rescued?",
    "Client: Overwhelming. I'm grateful, but... but I can't stop thinking about those who didn't make it. The medical team is checking me over, wrapping me in blankets. I'm shivering uncontrollably. Everything hurts.",
    "Therapist: You've made it through. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Emotionally and physically. There's relief, but also this deep sadness. And fear. Will I ever be able to fly again? How do I move on from this?",
    "Therapist: Those are all normal reactions. You've done incredibly well today. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Look around the room and name five things you can see.",
    "Client: I see... the clock on the wall. Your degrees hanging up. The plant in the corner. The box of tissues. And... and my own hands, still shaking a little.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, take a deep breath. How are you feeling right now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I feel... exhausted. But also... I don't know. Maybe a little stronger? Like I faced something I've been avoiding for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. You should be proud of yourself. Let's talk about how you can care for yourself for the rest of the day.",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to rest. Maybe call my daughter. And... could we schedule another session soon? I feel like there's more to process.",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll set that up before you leave. Remember, what you did today took immense courage. How are you feeling about the work we did?",
    "Client: It was hard. Really hard. But... I think it was necessary. I've been carrying this for so long. It feels like... like maybe I've taken a step towards healing.",
    "Therapist: That's a great insight. We'll continue to work through this together. For now, focus on self-care. You've done important work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I appreciate your guidance through this. It means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Remember, you're the one doing the hard work. I'm here to support you. Let's wrap up for today and schedule our next session."
