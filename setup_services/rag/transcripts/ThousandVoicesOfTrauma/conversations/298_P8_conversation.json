    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is both racing and blank at the same time. The memories were so vivid, you know? I could almost smell the gunpowder and feel the heat of the sun on my skin. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. Even though I know I'm safe here, my heart is pounding like I'm back there. It's... it's like my body doesn't understand that it's over.",
    "Therapist: Where do you feel that fear in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's in my chest. It feels tight, like I can't breathe properly. And my hands are shaking. I keep clenching and unclenching them, trying to make it stop. It's... it's frustrating, you know? I shouldn't be feeling this way anymore. It was so long ago.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are accompanying these physical sensations?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"I'm not safe. It could happen again.\" Which is ridiculous, I know. I'm an old woman now, far from any combat zone. But... but the fear feels so real. And then I feel guilty. So many didn't make it back, and here I am, still scared after all these years.",
    "Therapist: How does this guilt manifest for you?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a weight on my shoulders. I feel like I should be stronger, you know? Like I'm letting down those who didn't survive by still being affected by this. And... and I worry that I'm weak, that maybe I didn't deserve to make it back if I can't handle the memories.",
    "Therapist: What do you think your younger self would say to you now?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. I've never thought about it like that. I guess... maybe she'd be proud that I'm still here, still fighting? But then again, she might be disappointed that I haven't moved past this. It's... it's complicated.",
    "Therapist: How does imagining her perspective change things for you?",
    "Client: It's... it's strange. On one hand, I feel a surge of compassion for her - for me, I guess. We went through so much. But on the other hand, I feel this... this disconnect. Like I can't reconcile who I was then with who I am now. It's unsettling.",
    "Therapist: What's the most challenging part of this experience for you?",
    "Client: The... the loss of control, I think. During the exercise, and even now, I feel like I'm at the mercy of these memories and emotions. It's... it's terrifying. In combat, control meant survival. And now, I feel like I'm losing that grip on control all over again.",
    "Therapist: How does this loss of control compare to your everyday life?",
    "Client: It's... it's much more intense here. In my day-to-day life, I've built routines and structures to help me feel in control. But here, in these sessions, it's like all those defenses come crumbling down. It's raw and it's real and it's... it's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: What strengths do you draw on to face this challenge?",
    "Client: I... I suppose my resilience. The fact that I've survived this long, that I'm here trying to work through it. And... and maybe my sense of duty. I owe it to myself, and to those who didn't make it, to keep pushing forward, to try and heal.",
    "Therapist: How does that sense of duty serve you in this process?",
    "Client: It's... it's a double-edged sword, really. On one hand, it gives me the strength to keep coming back, to face these memories. But on the other, it sometimes feels like another burden. Like I have to get better, not just for myself, but for everyone else too. It's... it's a lot of pressure.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to release some of that pressure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure I know how. It's been a part of me for so long. The idea of letting go of that sense of duty is... it's scary. Like I might lose a part of myself. But... but maybe it would also be freeing? I don't know. It's hard to imagine.",
    "Therapist: How do you think that might impact your healing journey?",
    "Client: I... I think it might make it easier, in some ways. If I could focus on healing for myself, not for some abstract sense of duty or for others... maybe I wouldn't be so hard on myself when it's difficult. But it's... it's also terrifying. What if I let go and then I can't push through anymore?",
    "Therapist: What would pushing through look like for you?",
    "Client: I... I guess it would mean continuing to face these memories, these emotions, even when it's hard. To keep coming back here, to keep trying to understand and process what happened. But... but maybe it could also mean being gentler with myself? Accepting that it's okay to struggle sometimes?",
    "Therapist: How does that idea of self-compassion sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... it's uncomfortable, to be honest. I'm not used to being gentle with myself. It feels... indulgent, somehow. But I can see how it might be helpful. If I could treat myself with the same kindness I'd offer to a fellow soldier... maybe that would make this process easier.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you could take towards that self-compassion?",
    "Client: I... I suppose I could try to acknowledge when I'm having a hard time, instead of just pushing through. Maybe... maybe tell myself it's okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes. It sounds so simple when I say it out loud, but it feels monumental.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to consider that step?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of emotions. There's a part of me that feels hopeful, like maybe this could be a turning point. But there's also fear. What if I can't do it? What if I'm not strong enough to change how I think about myself? It's... it's daunting.",
    "Therapist: What might help you feel more confident in taking that step?",
    "Client: I... I think maybe reminding myself of other challenges I've overcome. If I could survive combat, surely I can learn to be a little kinder to myself, right? And... and maybe talking about it here, in our sessions. Having someone to check in with, to help me stay accountable.",
    "Therapist: How can we best support that in our future sessions?",
    "Client: I... I think it would help if you could remind me to practice self-compassion. Maybe we could start each session by identifying one thing I've done well, or one moment where I was kind to myself? And... and maybe we could explore more ways to incorporate self-compassion into my coping strategies.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. These sessions always drain me. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful? Like maybe there's a way forward that doesn't involve constantly battling myself. It's a strange feeling, but not an unpleasant one.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to explore more about this idea of self-compassion. Maybe we could look at specific situations where I struggle with it, and work on strategies to be kinder to myself? And... and maybe we could revisit some of the memories we've worked on, but try to approach them with more self-compassion?",
    "Therapist: That's a great direction. We'll start there next time. How will you take care of yourself until then?",
    "Client: I... I think I'll try to be more aware of my self-talk. Maybe catch myself when I'm being overly critical and try to reframe it. And... and I think I'll call my daughter tonight. Connecting with family always helps ground me after these sessions. Thank you for today. It was hard, but... but I think it was important.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
