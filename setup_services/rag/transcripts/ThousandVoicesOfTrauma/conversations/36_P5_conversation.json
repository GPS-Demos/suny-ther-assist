    "Therapist: Welcome, Samira. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I know we've talked about doing this imaginal exposure thing, but I'm not sure I'm ready. The idea of reliving that dog attack... it makes my heart race just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... ever since that Rottweiler attacked me in the park, I've been having these awful nightmares. I can't even walk past a dog without feeling panicked. I'm worried that talking about it in detail will make everything worse. What if I can't handle it?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How about we discuss the purpose?",
    "Client: Okay, I guess that might help. I mean, I trust you, but I'm still scared. It's been affecting my work, my relationships... I can't even take my kids to the park anymore. I feel like I'm letting everyone down, especially my husband. He's been so patient, but I can see the strain it's putting on our marriage.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your honesty. Shall we explore how this exercise can help?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I want to get better, for myself and my family. I'm tired of feeling trapped by this fear. It's like the attack is happening over and over in my mind, and I can't escape it. If this can help me move past that, I'm willing to try. But... what exactly will we be doing?",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit the memory gradually, in a safe environment. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That sounds... intense. But I guess if it's gradual, maybe I can handle it. Will you be there the whole time? I'm worried I might have a panic attack or something. And what if I can't remember everything clearly? Some parts of that day are still a blur.",
    "Therapist: I'll be here throughout. Your safety is my priority. Any other concerns?",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I guess I'm also worried about how I'll feel afterwards. Will this make my nightmares worse? And how long will it take before I start feeling better? I know recovery isn't linear, but I'm hoping for some light at the end of this tunnel.",
    "Therapist: It's a process, but many find relief. Shall we set some expectations?",
    "Client: Yes, please. That would be really helpful. I want to know what I'm getting into. And... I guess I should tell you that I've been using alcohol to help me sleep lately. I know it's not healthy, but it's the only way I can get through the night without waking up in a cold sweat. Will that affect this process?",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. Let's address it in our treatment plan.",
    "Client: Okay, that's a relief. I was worried you'd be disappointed in me. So, what should I expect during this imaginal exposure? Will I have to close my eyes? Talk about every detail? I'm not sure I can do that without breaking down.",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. Your comfort is essential. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm still scared, but I'm also hopeful. This is the first time I've felt like there might be a way out of this nightmare. Thank you for being so patient with me. I know I ask a lot of questions, but it helps me feel more in control. Okay, let's do this. I'm as ready as I'll ever be.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Let's start slowly and gently."
