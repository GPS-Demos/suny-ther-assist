    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like my whole body is buzzing. I can still see the hospital room so clearly in my mind, you know? The beeping of the machines, the smell of disinfectant... it's all there. I didn't expect it to feel so real again.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: It's a mix of things. There's this overwhelming sense of fear, like I'm right back there, waiting for the doctor to come in with my test results. I can feel my heart racing, just like it did then. But there's also this... I don't know, almost a feeling of anger? I'm angry that I had to go through that, that my life changed so suddenly. And then there's guilt because I know others have it worse, and I should be grateful I survived, but...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have complex feelings.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess so. It's just... when I think about that day, I remember feeling so alone. Even though my husband was there, it was like I was in a bubble, separate from everyone else. I kept thinking, \"This can't be happening to me.\" I was supposed to be finishing my degree, not fighting for my life in a hospital bed. It felt so unfair, you know?",
    "Therapist: How do those memories affect you now?",
    "Client: They... they still have a lot of power over me. Sometimes, I'll smell something that reminds me of the hospital, and it's like I'm right back there. I find myself avoiding medical check-ups, even routine ones, because I'm terrified of hearing bad news again. And I think... I think it's affected my relationships too. I push people away sometimes because I'm scared of losing them or being a burden. It's like I'm stuck in that moment, always waiting for the other shoe to drop.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice in your body right now?",
    "Client: My shoulders are really tense, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's hard to take a deep breath. My hands are a bit clammy too. It's like my body is preparing for something bad to happen, even though I know I'm safe here. Oh, and I just realized I've been clenching my jaw this whole time.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to breathe. What else do you observe?",
    "Client: As I'm focusing on my breath, I'm noticing that the tightness in my chest is starting to ease a little. But there's still this heaviness, like a weight on my shoulders. And I'm aware of this lump in my throat, like I want to cry but I'm holding it back. It's strange, but I also feel a bit lighter, like talking about it is releasing some of the pressure I've been carrying around.",
    "Therapist: How does sharing this experience make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's both terrifying and relieving. Part of me wants to run away and never think about this again. But another part feels like I'm finally acknowledging what happened, you know? Like I'm validating my own experience. It's scary to be this vulnerable, but there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe empowerment? Like I'm facing this head-on instead of trying to push it away all the time.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant realization.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess it is. I've spent so long trying to pretend I was fine, that it didn't affect me. But the truth is, it changed everything. My perspective on life, my priorities, even the way I interact with people. I think I've been so focused on the negative impact that I haven't really considered how it might have made me stronger in some ways. Maybe... maybe there's a way to integrate this experience into my life without letting it control me?",
    "Therapist: How might that look for you?",
    "Client: I'm not entirely sure, but... maybe it means being more open with my loved ones about what I'm going through. Maybe it's about finding a balance between acknowledging the trauma and not letting it define me. I think I want to work on not avoiding medical care, taking it step by step. And perhaps... perhaps I can use this experience to be more empathetic towards others who are struggling. It's a lot to think about, but for the first time in a while, I feel like there might be a way forward.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but in a good way? Like after a really intense workout. There's this sense of accomplishment mixed with exhaustion. My body feels a bit more relaxed now, and my mind feels clearer. It's like I've put down a heavy bag I've been carrying for years. I know I have a long way to go, but right now, I feel a glimmer of hope. And that's... that's something I haven't felt in a long time.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. We'll continue to work through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I appreciate your guidance through this. It's not easy, but I think I'm starting to see that facing these memories might be the key to moving forward. I'm nervous about what comes next, but I also feel a bit more prepared to face it. Is it normal to feel both scared and motivated at the same time?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. It's a common experience in this process.",
    "Client: That's reassuring to hear. I guess I'm learning that healing isn't linear. There are moments when I feel strong and ready to tackle everything, and then times when I feel like I'm right back in that hospital bed. But maybe that's okay? Maybe it's all part of the journey. I'm just... I'm grateful to have a space where I can explore all of this without judgment. It makes the scary parts a little less overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage. How would you like to proceed?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to keep working on this. Maybe we could explore some strategies for managing those moments when the memories feel overwhelming? And I'd like to work on rebuilding some of the connections I've pushed away. It's scary, but I'm starting to see that I don't have to go through this alone. Is that something we can focus on in our next sessions?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll work on that together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm feeling a mix of exhaustion and hope right now. It's like I've climbed a mountain, and even though I'm tired, the view from up here is giving me a new perspective. I know there's still a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I might actually be able to make it. Is it okay if we wrap up for today? I think I need some time to process everything we've talked about.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take care, and we'll continue next time.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your support more than I can say. I'll see you next session."
