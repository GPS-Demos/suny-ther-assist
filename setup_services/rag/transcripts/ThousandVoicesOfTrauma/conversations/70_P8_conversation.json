    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I'm right back there in that hospital room, you know? The smell of disinfectant, the beeping machines... It's all so vivid.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... a deep sadness. It's like I'm mourning for that little boy I was, lying there in that hospital bed, not understanding why this was happening to me.",
    "Therapist: I see. Can you tell me more about that sadness?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. I remember feeling so alone, even though my parents were there. They looked so worried, and I felt like I had to be strong for them. But inside, I was terrified. I keep thinking about how unfair it all was. I was just a kid, you know? I should've been out playing with my friends, not fighting for my life.",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly difficult. What thoughts are going through your mind now?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... why me? Why did I have to go through that? And then I feel guilty for even asking that because I survived, and I know others didn't. It's like... I'm grateful, but also angry and sad at the same time. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: There's no right or wrong way to feel. How does your body feel as you're processing these emotions?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, like there's a weight on it. My hands are clammy, and I notice I'm clenching my jaw. It's like my body is still bracing for bad news, even though I know I'm safe now.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. What do you notice about these physical sensations?",
    "Client: They're... they're familiar. It's the same way I felt back then, waiting for test results or when the doctors would come in with serious faces. I guess my body still remembers, even after all these years. It's strange how vivid it all is, even now.",
    "Therapist: How do these memories connect to your experiences today?",
    "Client: I... I think they're why I'm always so anxious about my health. Every little ache or pain sends me into a panic. And hospitals... I can barely step foot in one without feeling like I'm going to have a breakdown. It's affecting my life, my relationships. My wife... she tries to understand, but I can see it's hard on her too.",
    "Therapist: I hear you. How does revisiting this memory make you feel about your recovery journey?",
    "Client: It's... it's tough. Part of me feels like I should be over this by now. I'm a grown man, for goodness sake. But another part of me recognizes how deeply this affected me. I guess... I guess I'm realizing that recovery isn't linear. Some days are better than others, and that's okay.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm noticing that... despite how difficult this is, I'm actually able to talk about it now. A few months ago, I couldn't even think about this without having a panic attack. So maybe... maybe I am making progress, even if it doesn't always feel like it.",
    "Therapist: Mm. How does that realization sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually quite comforting. It gives me hope, you know? Like maybe one day, I'll be able to think about this without feeling so overwhelmed. Don't get me wrong, it's still hard. But I feel like I'm starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful metaphor. Can you elaborate on that?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... for so long, I've been stuck in this dark tunnel of fear and anxiety. Every time I thought about my illness or stepped into a hospital, it was like the walls were closing in on me. But now, through these sessions and facing these memories head-on, it's like I'm slowly inching towards an exit. The light's still faint, and sometimes I feel like I'm moving backwards, but at least now I know there's a way out.",
    "Therapist: How does this perspective impact your daily life?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to change things. I'm not as quick to panic over every little health concern anymore. I'm trying to be more open with my wife about what I'm feeling instead of bottling it all up. And I've even managed to go to a routine check-up without having a full-blown anxiety attack. They're small steps, but they feel significant.",
    "Therapist: Those are indeed significant steps. What's coming up for you as you reflect on this progress?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... proud, I think. And grateful. Proud that I'm facing this head-on instead of running away from it like I have for so many years. And grateful for the support I have - my wife, this therapy. It's not easy, and some days I still feel like that scared little boy in the hospital bed. But I'm starting to see myself as a survivor, not just a victim. It's a subtle shift, but it feels important.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful shift. How do you want to carry this forward?",
    "Client: I want to... I want to keep pushing forward, even when it's hard. I want to be able to talk about my experience without it controlling me. Maybe... maybe even use it to help others someday. I don't know if I'll ever be completely 'over it', but I want to get to a place where it doesn't dictate my life anymore. Where I can go to a hospital if I need to without feeling like I'm going to fall apart. Where I can fully enjoy life without this constant shadow of fear.",
    "Therapist: Those are meaningful goals. How are you feeling now, as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've done something really hard but important. There's still a lot of work to do, but for the first time in a long time, I feel like it's actually possible to heal from this. Thank you... for guiding me through this. It means more than I can express.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your courage is admirable. Shall we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. This has been intense, but valuable. I'm looking forward to our next session, even though I know it won't be easy. But I'm ready to keep working on this. Thank you again.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next time."
