    "Therapist: Welcome, Amir. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about the plane crash again, and it's making my stomach churn a little.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to work through this together. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Just give me a second to take a deep breath.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. When you're ready, close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm... I'm at the airport. It's busy, people rushing everywhere. I can smell coffee from a nearby cafe. My hands are a bit clammy as I grip my boarding pass.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 4 or 5.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: I'm boarding the plane now. The narrow aisle, the overhead compartments... I find my seat by the window. My heart's beating a bit faster as I buckle up.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: The plane starts to move. I can feel the vibrations. We're taking off and... oh god, my ears are popping. I hate this part.",
    "Therapist: Focus on your breathing. What happens next?",
    "Client: We're in the air now. It's... it's bumpy. Really bumpy. The seatbelt sign is still on. I'm gripping the armrests so tight my knuckles are white.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe a 7?",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: There's... there's a loud bang. People are gasping. The plane lurches to one side. I can hear the engines... they don't sound right. My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What do you see?",
    "Client: Oxygen masks drop down. There's a high-pitched alarm. People are screaming. I'm fumbling with my mask, my hands are shaking so bad.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Amir. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: The plane is diving. I can see the ground getting closer through the window. Oh god, we're going to crash. We're going to die. I can't breathe. I can't...",
    "Therapist: Amir, you're safe. Take a deep breath. What's happening around you?",
    "Client: I... I... The flight attendants are shouting instructions. Someone next to me is praying. I can smell something burning. The plane is shaking violently.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. Maybe higher. I feel like I'm going to be sick.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you survived this. Keep going.",
    "Client: We're... we're hitting the ground. The impact is... it's like nothing I've ever felt. My body slams against the seat. There's a deafening crunch of metal. Luggage is flying everywhere.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What do you feel?",
    "Client: Pain. So much pain. My head hurts. I think my arm might be broken. The smoke... it's getting thicker. I can barely see.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. Keep describing what you remember.",
    "Client: I'm... I'm unbuckling my seatbelt. It's stuck. I'm panicking. Finally, it releases. I'm stumbling out of my seat. People are pushing, shoving. I can hear crying, screaming.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm following the emergency lights. The aisle feels so long. I can feel heat... fire somewhere behind us. I'm gasping for air. Finally, I reach the emergency exit.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm sliding down the emergency chute. It's so steep. I hit the ground hard. My legs buckle. I'm crawling away from the plane. The heat... I can feel it on my back.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8? My heart's pounding just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: Chaos. Absolute chaos. People running, crying. The plane... it's engulfed in flames. The smoke is so thick. I can taste it. I can't stop coughing.",
    "Therapist: Focus on your breathing. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm being led away by someone. A paramedic, I think. They're asking me questions, but I can barely focus. My ears are ringing. I keep looking back at the plane.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Numb. Shocked. I can't believe I survived. But also... guilty? Why me? Why did I make it when others...",
    "Therapist: It's normal to have those feelings. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: I'm at a makeshift triage area. There are so many injured people. The sound of sirens is everywhere. Someone's wrapping a blanket around me. I'm shivering, but I don't feel cold.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep replaying the crash in my head. The sounds, the impact. I'm wondering about the other passengers. Did they all make it out? I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: That's a natural response. What happens after that?",
    "Client: It's all a blur. I remember being in an ambulance. The hospital. Bright lights. Doctors asking questions. I keep expecting to wake up, like it's all a bad dream.",

    "Client: It's come down. Maybe a 5 or 6?",
    "Therapist: That's good. Let's take a few deep breaths together. You did really well today.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's... it's still hard, but I think it's getting a little easier each time.",
    "Therapist: That's the goal. How are you feeling about ending the session?",
    "Client: I'm okay. A bit shaky, but I think I'll be alright.",
    "Therapist: Remember to use your coping strategies if you need them. We'll debrief next time. You should be proud of yourself, Amir.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I appreciate your help.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
