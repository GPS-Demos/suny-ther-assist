    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the hostage situation?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in the library at my university. It's late, around 9 PM. I'm studying for my exams when suddenly I hear shouting. There's a man with a gun, waving it around. He's yelling at everyone to get down on the ground. My heart starts racing, and I can feel my palms getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I drop to the floor, hiding behind a bookshelf. I can hear people crying softly around me. The man is still shouting, demanding that someone call the police. He says he wants to negotiate. I'm trembling, trying not to make any noise. I keep thinking about my parents, wondering if I'll ever see them again.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: It's so hard... I feel like I can't breathe. The gunman is pacing back and forth. I can hear his footsteps getting closer to where I'm hiding. My whole body is tense, and I'm fighting the urge to run. But I know that could be dangerous. I'm frozen in place, terrified that he'll find me.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Hours pass, but it feels like days. My legs are cramping from staying in the same position for so long. I'm so thirsty, but I'm afraid to move. The air feels thick and stuffy. I can smell the sweat and fear in the room. Suddenly, there's a loud bang - I think it's a gunshot. People start screaming. I'm shaking uncontrollably now.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can continue. This is too much.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here with me.",
    "Client: Okay... After the gunshot, everything becomes chaotic. There's more shouting, and I hear heavy footsteps. I think it's the police. There's a struggle, more shouting, and then silence. I'm still hiding, afraid to move. Then I hear someone say, \"It's over. You're safe now.\" But I can't stop shaking. I don't feel safe at all.",
    "Therapist: You've done an excellent job. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel drained and shaky. My heart is still racing, and I feel like I might cry. But... I also feel a bit relieved, like a weight has been lifted off my chest.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've shown great courage.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still so vivid in my mind. The fear, the uncertainty... I can still feel it. But talking about it... it's helping somehow. It's like I'm starting to separate myself from the memory, even if just a little bit.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: I guess I am, a little. It's just... after this, and the sexual abuse... sometimes I feel like I'll never feel truly safe again. Like danger is always lurking around the corner.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to feel that way. We'll work on that.",
    "Client: I hope so. I want to feel normal again. To be able to go to the library or be alone without constantly looking over my shoulder. To trust people again. It's exhausting being on high alert all the time.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. We'll take it one step at a time.",
    "Client: Thank you. I know it's a long process, but I'm grateful for your help. Sometimes I wonder what my life would be like if these things hadn't happened to me. Would I be a different person? Would I be happier?",
    "Therapist: Those are natural questions. We'll explore them together.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's comforting to know I'm not alone in this journey. Even though reliving these memories is painful, I think I'm starting to see the value in facing them head-on. It's like... by talking about it, I'm slowly taking back control.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. You're making progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think I'm ready to end for today. This session was intense, but I feel a bit lighter. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it's completely normal. You've done well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm looking forward to our next session, even though I know it won't be easy. But I feel like I'm finally moving forward instead of being stuck in the past.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive outlook. We'll continue next time."
