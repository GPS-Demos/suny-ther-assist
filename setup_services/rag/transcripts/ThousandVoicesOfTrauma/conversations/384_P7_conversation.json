    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure exercise. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the refugee experience you mentioned?",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. It was 1975, and I was 19. We had to flee our village in Vietnam as the war was ending. The journey was terrifying. We were crammed into a small fishing boat with dozens of other people. The smell of sweat and fear was overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: The boat was so unstable. Every wave made me think we'd capsize. I remember holding onto my little sister, trying to keep her calm. But inside, I was panicking. The sound of the engine sputtering terrified me. What if it stopped? We'd be stranded in the middle of the ocean.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that memory. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I can feel the rough wood of the boat beneath me. My legs were cramping from sitting in the same position for hours. The salt spray kept hitting my face. I was so thirsty, but we had very little water. I remember the look of desperation on everyone's faces. We were all thinking the same thing - will we survive this?",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: As night fell, it got worse. The darkness was oppressive. I couldn't see anything beyond the boat. Every sound made me jump. I kept imagining sea monsters or enemy ships finding us. I felt so helpless, so small in the vast ocean.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (voice shaking) I... I don't know if I can continue. It's too much.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay... As dawn broke, I saw land in the distance. I felt a surge of hope, but also fear. What if they turned us away? What if this new place was worse? As we got closer, I saw people on the shore. I didn't know if they were there to help us or harm us.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job staying with the memory.",
    "Client: When we finally reached the shore, my legs were so weak I could barely stand. The relief of being on solid ground was overwhelming. But then the reality hit me - we were in a strange country, with nothing but the clothes on our backs. I felt lost, scared, and so far from home.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. My heart is racing, and I feel a bit shaky. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a bit proud? I've never been able to talk about this in such detail before.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant achievement. How would you like to proceed?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to continue, if that's okay. There's more to the story, and it feels important to share it.",
    "Therapist: Of course. When you're ready, please continue.",
    "Client: After we landed, we were taken to a refugee camp. The conditions were terrible - overcrowded, unsanitary, and we had very little food. But what struck me most was the uncertainty. We had no idea how long we'd be there or what would happen to us. Every day was a struggle to maintain hope.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Keep going.",
    "Client: In the camp, I tried to stay strong for my sister. I'd tell her stories at night to distract her from the noises and the fear. But inside, I was terrified. I missed our parents, our home. I felt guilty for feeling relieved that we had escaped, when so many others hadn't.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have conflicting emotions. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Months passed, and finally, we got news that we'd be relocated to the United States. I remember feeling a mix of excitement and dread. We were leaving behind everything familiar, heading to a place where we didn't speak the language or understand the culture.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling as you recall this?",
    "Client: It's strange. I feel sadness for what we lost, but also gratitude for the opportunities we gained. The journey was traumatic, but it also shaped who I am. I'm realizing now how much strength it took to get through it all.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. You've shown remarkable resilience.",
    "Client: Thank you. I've never really allowed myself to feel proud of surviving that experience before. It's always been this dark cloud in my past. But talking about it like this... it's helping me see it differently.",
    "Therapist: That's an important shift. How do you feel about ending our session here?",
    "Client: I think that would be good. This has been intense, but also... freeing, in a way. I feel like I've taken a step towards really processing this experience.",
    "Therapist: You've made significant progress today. We'll continue working through this in our next session."
