    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the animal attack incident?",
    "Client: Okay... I was hiking alone in the mountains near my hometown. It was a beautiful day, clear skies, and I felt so peaceful. I remember the smell of pine trees and the crunch of leaves under my feet. Suddenly, I heard a growl behind me. When I turned around, I saw a mountain lion crouched and ready to pounce. My heart started racing, and I couldn't move.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The mountain lion leaped towards me, and I instinctively raised my arms to protect my face. I felt its claws dig into my forearm, and the pain was excruciating. I screamed, but there was no one around to hear me. I thought I was going to die right there in the forest.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you remember?",
    "Client: I remember the weight of the animal on top of me, pushing me to the ground. Its hot breath on my face, the smell of its fur... I was terrified. I managed to grab a nearby rock and hit the mountain lion on the head. It seemed stunned for a moment, which gave me a chance to scramble away.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: As I ran, I could hear it behind me. My arm was bleeding, and I was in so much pain. I spotted a group of hikers in the distance and started screaming for help. The mountain lion stopped chasing me when it saw the other people. I collapsed when I reached the hikers, crying and shaking uncontrollably.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: One of the hikers was a nurse, and she immediately started treating my wounds. I was in shock, I couldn't stop shaking. They called for emergency services, but it felt like an eternity before help arrived. The whole time, I kept thinking the mountain lion would come back and finish what it started.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I... I feel scared, even though I know I'm safe here. My heart is racing, and my palms are sweaty. It's like I'm back there again, feeling helpless and terrified.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) It's hard to talk about this. Every time I think about it, I feel like I can't breathe. I have nightmares about being chased, about feeling those claws again. Sometimes, I wake up in a cold sweat, thinking I'm still in that forest.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for facing this. Keep going.",
    "Client: After the attack, I couldn't go hiking anymore. I used to love nature, but now I'm terrified of it. I can't even walk in a park without constantly looking over my shoulder. I feel like I've lost a part of myself, you know? Like that mountain lion didn't just attack my body, it took away my peace of mind.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to feel that way. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I've tried to go back to hiking, but I panic every time. My friends don't understand why I can't just \"get over it.\" They think I'm being dramatic, but they weren't there. They didn't feel what I felt. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever be able to enjoy nature again without this fear consuming me.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Continue sharing.",
    "Client: The scars on my arm are a constant reminder of what happened. Every time I look at them, I'm right back in that moment. I've started wearing long sleeves all the time, even in hot weather, just to avoid seeing them or having others ask about them. It's like I can't escape this experience, no matter how hard I try.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How does talking about this make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard, but also somewhat relieving. I've never really talked about it in this much detail before. My heart is still racing, and I feel a bit shaky, but there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe release? Like I'm finally letting out something I've been holding in for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. Keep going.",
    "Client: I think what scares me the most is how quickly everything changed. One moment I was enjoying a peaceful hike, and the next, I was fighting for my life. It makes me feel like danger could be lurking around any corner. I've become hyper-vigilant, always on edge, always expecting the worst to happen. It's exhausting living like this.",
    "Therapist: You're very courageous. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling drained, but also a bit lighter. Talking about it is difficult, but I think it's helping. I still feel anxious, but it's not as overwhelming as when we started. Is... is this normal? To feel this way after talking about it?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it's completely normal. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think I need a moment to catch my breath. This has been intense, but I'm glad I'm doing this. I want to get better, to not let this experience control my life anymore. It's just... it's a long and difficult journey.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. You're making excellent progress.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay, I think I'm ready to continue. There's something else I haven't really talked about before. After the attack, I started having these intrusive thoughts. Not just about the mountain lion, but about other dangerous animals too. I've become obsessed with reading about animal attacks, constantly checking the news for any incidents. It's like I'm trying to prepare myself, but it's just feeding my anxiety.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. You're doing well addressing it.",
    "Client: I guess I'm afraid of being caught off guard again. But this obsession is taking over my life. I can't enjoy movies or TV shows with animals in them anymore. I've even had panic attacks in pet stores. It's like my brain can't distinguish between a house cat and that mountain lion anymore. Everything feels threatening.",
    "Therapist: Your awareness is a positive step. Keep going.",
    "Client: I've lost friendships over this. People get frustrated when I refuse to go to the zoo or won't pet their dogs. They think I'm overreacting, but they don't understand how real this fear is for me. Sometimes I feel so alone in this struggle. Like no one really gets what I'm going through.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. You're not alone here.",
    "Client: Thank you. It means a lot to hear that. I want to get better, I really do. I want to be able to enjoy nature again, to not flinch every time I see an animal. But it feels like such a long road ahead. Do you think I'll ever fully recover from this?",
    "Therapist: Recovery is possible. You're making great progress.",
    "Client: I hope so. It's just hard to imagine right now. Every time I think I'm making progress, something triggers me and I feel like I'm back at square one. But being here, talking about it like this... it gives me a glimmer of hope. Maybe with time and more sessions like this, I can start to heal.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive outlook. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... tired, but also somewhat relieved. It's like I've been carrying this heavy weight for so long, and now I'm finally starting to put it down. I'm still anxious, but it feels more manageable now. Thank you for listening and for guiding me through this. I know we still have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can overcome this.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellently today. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. This session has been intense, but also really helpful. I feel drained, but also like I've accomplished something important. Is it okay if we end here for today?",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've made great progress. Take care."
