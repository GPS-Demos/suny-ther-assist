    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's strange, you know? Going back to that moment in the refugee camp when I had that medical emergency. I can still hear the commotion, the panic in people's voices. It's like I'm there again, feeling so helpless and scared.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The smell. I hadn't remembered that before, but now it's so vivid. The antiseptic smell mixed with sweat and fear. It brings back that feeling of being trapped, of not knowing if I'd make it. And the faces of the other refugees, looking at me with such concern... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: How did reliving that memory feel different today?",
    "Client: Well, um, it's still difficult, but... I noticed I could breathe through it better this time. I kept reminding myself that I'm here now, safe. It's progress, I suppose, but it's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: That is progress. How does this connect to your day-to-day experiences?",
    "Client: I... I think it explains why I've been so anxious about my health lately. Every little ache or pain sends me into a panic, thinking I'm back in that vulnerable state. And I've been pushing my family away when they try to help. I'm scared of being a burden, just like I felt then.",
    "Therapist: I see. What have you learned from this process?",
    "Client: That... that I'm stronger than I thought. I survived that, and I'm surviving this too. But also that it's okay to ask for help. The people in the camp helped me, and now my family wants to help. Maybe I should let them.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How might you apply this moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'll try to be more open with my family about what I'm going through. And maybe... maybe I'll consider talking to my doctor about my anxiety. It's time I stopped letting this control me.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How are you feeling about continuing with the therapy?",
    "Client: It's hard, really hard. But I'm starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel, you know? I want to keep going. I want my life back.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is admirable. What's one thing you'll focus on this week?",
    "Client: I... I think I'll try to have an honest conversation with my husband about my fears. He's been so patient, and I've been pushing him away. It's time to let him in.",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. How can you prepare for that conversation?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I could write down what I want to say first? That might help me organize my thoughts and not get too overwhelmed. And I'll choose a quiet time when we're both relaxed.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a solid plan. Any final thoughts on today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm grateful, actually. It's painful, but I feel like I'm finally starting to understand myself better. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel hopeful.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. We'll continue next week. Take care."
