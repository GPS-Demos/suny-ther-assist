    "Therapist: Welcome, Fatima. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is screaming to run away. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: I guess so. Yeah, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm at the park. It's a sunny afternoon, and I decided to take a walk after work. The grass is really green, and there are kids playing on the swings nearby.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm walking along the path, and I see this big dog up ahead. It's not on a leash, which makes me a bit nervous. But I keep walking, thinking it'll be fine.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: A little tense. My heart's starting to beat faster.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you?",
    "Client: Maybe... 40?",
    "Therapist: Okay. Keep going. What happens as you get closer to the dog?",
    "Client: The dog... it starts growling. I freeze, not sure what to do. Then suddenly, it lunges at me. I can see its teeth, hear its angry barks. I... I try to back away, but I trip and fall.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you experiencing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. My heart's pounding so hard I can hear it. I can feel the rough pavement against my hands where I've fallen. The dog's getting closer, and I can't move.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 75, maybe 80.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: *takes a shaky breath* Okay... okay.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: The dog... it's on me. I feel its weight, its hot breath. Its teeth sink into my arm, and I scream. The pain is sharp, intense. I'm crying, begging for help.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I can smell the dog's fur. It's this musty, damp smell. And there's... there's blood. I see it on my arm, feel it trickling down. I'm so scared, I think I might die.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's really high. Like 90.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *breathes deeply* It helps a little, but I still feel so scared.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Continue with what happens.",
    "Client: Someone... someone's shouting. The dog's owner, I think. He's running towards us, yelling at the dog. The dog finally lets go, and I curl up into a ball, sobbing.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: Relief, but also anger. Why wasn't the dog on a leash? Why didn't the owner come sooner? My arm hurts so much, and I'm shaking all over.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 85?",
    "Therapist: Okay. Keep going. What happens after the dog lets go?",
    "Client: The owner's apologizing, asking if I'm okay. But I can barely hear him over the ringing in my ears. Someone else comes over - a woman. She's saying something about calling an ambulance.",
    "Therapist: What are you aware of physically?",
    "Client: My arm's throbbing. I feel dizzy, like I might pass out. My clothes are torn and dirty. I'm still on the ground, and I can feel the warmth of the sun on my back.",
    "Therapist: And emotionally?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in shock, I think. Scared, angry, confused. It all happened so fast.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's coming down a bit. Maybe 75 now?",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: The ambulance arrives. The paramedics are talking to me, but I'm having trouble focusing. They help me onto a stretcher. I remember looking up at the sky as they wheeled me to the ambulance, thinking how strange it was that such a beautiful day could turn so horrible.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, in this moment?",
    "Client: Overwhelmed. Vulnerable. I keep replaying the attack in my mind, wondering if I could have done something differently.",
    "Therapist: Remember, it wasn't your fault. How's your distress?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 70 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue with what happens in the ambulance.",
    "Client: They're cleaning my wounds. It stings, and I wince. The paramedic is trying to distract me, asking about my job, my family. But I can't stop staring at my arm, at the torn flesh.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking about how this will affect my work. I'm self-employed, what if I can't use my arm properly? And... and I'm worried about going outside again. What if it happens again?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 65 now.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're processing this well. What happens when you reach the hospital?",
    "Client: It's all a blur of activity. Nurses, doctors, forms to fill out. They take me for x-rays, clean the wounds more thoroughly. The doctor tells me I'll need stitches and might have some nerve damage.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel hearing that?",
    "Client: Scared. Angry. I keep thinking about how unfair it all is. I was just taking a walk, and now my whole life might change.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to process. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 60.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's continue. What happens after they treat your wounds?",
    "Client: They... they give me some painkillers and antibiotics. A police officer comes to take my statement. I'm exhausted, but I try to remember every detail. The officer is kind, but I feel so drained.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling as you give your statement?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel violated. Like my sense of safety has been shattered. But also... also a bit stronger? Like I survived something terrible.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How's your distress?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 50 now.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens when you're discharged?",
    "Client: My friend comes to pick me up. I'm so grateful to see a familiar face. She helps me into the car, and as we drive home, I start crying. It's like everything hits me at once.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about how lucky I am that it wasn't worse. But I'm also scared about the future. Will I ever feel safe walking in the park again?",
    "Therapist: Those are understandable concerns. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 45.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Let's continue with what happens when you get home.",
    "Client: My friend helps me inside. I'm exhausted, but I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see the dog lunging at me. I toss and turn all night.",
    "Therapist: That must have been difficult. How do you feel the next morning?",
    "Client: Sore. Tired. My arm aches, and the bandages remind me of what happened. I... I don't want to leave the house.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 40.",
    "Therapist: You've done an excellent job processing this. How are you feeling now, back in the present moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm surprised. It was hard to go through it all again, but I feel... lighter somehow? Like I've faced it head-on.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm stronger than I realized. It still scares me, but maybe... maybe I can work through this.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 30.",
    "Therapist: Excellent work today, Fatima. You've shown incredible courage.",
    "Client: Thank you. It wasn't easy, but... I'm glad we did this.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself. We'll end here for today. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Tired, but... hopeful. I think I'm ready to go home and rest now.",
    "Therapist: That's perfectly normal. Take care of yourself, and we'll continue in our next session."
