    "Therapist: Welcome. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. There's a knot in my stomach. Part of me wants to dive in, but another part is screaming to run away. It's like I'm standing on the edge of a cliff, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I suppose we should. *deep breath* Okay, I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see the cold, gray walls of the cell. It's so small, barely enough room to lie down. The air is stale, and there's this constant, muffled sound of... of other prisoners, I think. God, it's suffocating.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's happening now?",
    "Client: They've just thrown me in here. My hands are shaking, and I can't stop pacing. It's like... like my skin is crawling. I keep thinking, \"This can't be real. This can't be happening.\" But it is. It's so real.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 7. My heart's racing.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I sit on the floor. It's cold and damp. I can hear footsteps coming down the corridor, and each time, I tense up. Will they come for me? What will they do? The uncertainty is... it's unbearable.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: There's... there's a small window, high up. I can see a sliver of sky. It's the only thing keeping me sane. I focus on that tiny patch of blue, trying to remember what freedom feels like. But then... then I hear screaming from somewhere in the building, and I'm jolted back to this nightmare.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My muscles are so tense. I'm... I'm shaking. I wrap my arms around myself, trying to feel some warmth, some comfort. But it's useless. I've never felt so alone, so... so helpless.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe an 8 now. I... I don't know if I can...",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a deep breath. What's happening next?",
    "Client: I... I start to lose track of time. Days blur together. The only markers are when they slide food through the slot in the door. It's barely edible, but I force myself to eat. I have to stay strong. I have to survive this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Sometimes, I hear them interrogating other prisoners. The questions, the threats... it's terrifying. I try to prepare myself for when it's my turn, but how can you prepare for something like that? I... I start talking to myself, just to hear a friendly voice. Is this what going mad feels like?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What else?",
    "Client: I... I start to have these vivid dreams of home. Of my family, my friends. But when I wake up, the reality hits me even harder. The contrast is... it's devastating. I curl up in the corner, trying to make myself as small as possible. Maybe if I'm small enough, I'll just... disappear.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe a 9. I can feel my hands getting clammy just talking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Remember, you're here now, you're safe. Continue.",
    "Client: One day... one day they come for me. The door opens, and two guards grab me. I try to resist, but I'm so weak from lack of food and exercise. They drag me down the corridor, and all I can think is, \"This is it. This is where I break.\"",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: They... they take me to this room. It's bright, so bright it hurts my eyes after the darkness of my cell. There's a table, a chair. And... and instruments. I don't want to look at them, but I can't help it. My mind starts racing, imagining what they'll do to me.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Terror. Pure, unadulterated terror. My legs are shaking so badly I can barely stand. They... they strap me to the chair. I can feel the cold metal against my skin. I'm trying to be brave, but inside, I'm screaming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 10. I don't think I can...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here now, you're safe.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... okay. The interrogator comes in. He's... he's so calm, so matter-of-fact. It's chilling. He starts asking questions, but I can barely focus on what he's saying. All I can think about is what's coming next.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I try to stay silent. I focus on that patch of sky I could see from my cell. I try to transport myself there, to be anywhere but here. But then... then the pain starts. And it's... it's beyond anything I could have imagined.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: *pause* I... I can still feel it sometimes. The way my body jerked, the way I screamed until my throat was raw. I wanted to give them what they wanted, just to make it stop. But I couldn't. I wouldn't.",
    "Therapist: You showed incredible strength. How do you feel now, remembering this?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. But also... I feel a strange sort of pride. I survived. They tried to break me, but they couldn't. I'm still here.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You survived. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down. Maybe a 7 now. I feel drained, but... but also like I've faced something I've been running from for a long time.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. How do you feel about ending here?",
    "Client: I think... I think that's good. It's a lot to process, but I feel... lighter, somehow. Like I've set down a heavy burden I've been carrying for years.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later. We'll continue next session.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I never thought I'd be able to talk about this. But I'm glad I did.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable courage. Take care of yourself this week."
