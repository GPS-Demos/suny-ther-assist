    "Therapist: Good morning, Mr. Chen. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Morning, Dr. Singh. I'm... well, I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we've been working towards this, but now that we're here, I'm not sure I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you willing to try?",
    "Client: I suppose so. It's just... these memories, they're not easy to face.",
    "Therapist: I know. Let's start slow. Close your eyes if you're comfortable. Take us to the beginning of that day.",
    "Client: Alright... (deep breath) It's early morning. The air is thick with humidity. I can smell the damp earth and... something else. Something acrid.",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see... our camp. Tents, equipment scattered around. It's still dark, but there's a faint glow on the horizon. The others are just starting to stir.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Tense. There's this knot in my stomach. I didn't sleep well... none of us did. We knew something was coming.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you?",
    "Client: About a 40... maybe 45.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (inhales shakily) Right... I'm checking my gear. My hands are trembling slightly as I adjust my vest. The weight of it is... comforting, in a way. It's like armor.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: There's a sudden commotion. Shouts from the perimeter. My heart starts racing. I grab my rifle and... (voice wavers) God, I can hear the first shots.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're doing well. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe 60?",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: We're scrambling to defensive positions. The air is filled with dust and the smell of gunpowder. I can barely see through it all, but I hear... screaming. Both our guys and... and the others.",
    "Therapist: Focus on your breathing. What do you do?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm firing. My hands are steady now, operating on instinct. But inside, I'm terrified. Every explosion makes me flinch. I see a young soldier\u2014one of ours\u2014go down. There's so much blood...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... (voice breaks) I feel sick. Guilty. I couldn't save him.",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. Stay present. What's happening around you?",
    "Client: The fighting is intensifying. We're being pushed back. I can hear our commander yelling orders, but it's all a blur. I'm moving, firing, reloading. It's like I'm on autopilot.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. Maybe 75.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. Remember, you're here, you're safe.",
    "Client: (takes several deep breaths) Okay... okay. I'm... I'm still there. The sun is up now, but the air is thick with smoke. We've managed to hold our position, but at a cost. There are bodies... everywhere.",
    "Therapist: Stay with the memory. What are you doing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm helping the wounded. My hands are covered in blood. There's a young man, barely more than a boy, with a chest wound. I'm trying to stop the bleeding, but... (voice cracks) I can see the life fading from his eyes.",
    "Therapist: This is difficult. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Helpless. Angry. Scared. It's all mixed up.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's up there. 85, maybe 90.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here now, you're safe.",
    "Client: (nods, takes a shaky breath) The fighting has died down. We're securing the area, checking for survivors. The smell... God, the smell of death is overwhelming. I feel numb, moving mechanically.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: We... we start gathering our dead. Each face I see... it's someone I knew. Laughed with. Shared meals with. Now they're just... gone. And I'm still here. Why am I still here?",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel survivor's guilt. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... hollow. Drained. Like a part of me died there too.",
    "Therapist: And your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually lower now. Maybe 70? I just feel... empty.",
    "Therapist: That's common. Can you bring yourself back to the present?",
    "Client: (opens eyes slowly) Yeah... I'm here. I'm... I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: Well done. That was intense. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Drained. But... maybe a little lighter? Like I've set down a heavy weight, even if just for a moment.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves. Can you name five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: (looks around) Your desk... the bookshelf... the plant in the corner... the clock on the wall... and the painting of the mountains.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Now, four things you can touch?",
    "Client: The armrest of this chair... my shirt... my watch... and the carpet under my feet.",
    "Therapist: Good. Three things you can hear?",
    "Client: The ticking of the clock... traffic outside... and the hum of the air conditioner.",
    "Therapist: Very good. Two things you can smell?",
    "Client: Coffee... and maybe some kind of air freshener?",
    "Therapist: Last one. One thing you can taste?",
    "Client: Just... the lingering taste of my morning tea.",
    "Therapist: Excellent job. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Better. More... present. The memories feel less overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Remember, each time we do this, it gets a little easier. You're building resilience.",
    "Client: I hope so. It's... it's still hard. But I think I understand now why we're doing this.",
    "Therapist: That's right. It's about processing these memories, not being controlled by them. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we end today's session?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm okay for now. This was... intense. But I feel like I've taken a step forward.",
    "Therapist: You absolutely have. I'm proud of the work you've done today. Remember to use the grounding techniques we practiced if you feel overwhelmed later.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you, Dr. Singh. I... I appreciate your guidance through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Mr. Chen. Take care of yourself, and I'll see you next week."
