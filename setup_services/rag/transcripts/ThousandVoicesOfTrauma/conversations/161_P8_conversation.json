    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken up, to be honest. It's like I was right back there, you know? The screeching tires, the crunch of metal... I can still hear it all so vividly. My heart's racing, and I feel this tightness in my chest. It's hard to shake off the fear and panic that came rushing back.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Anxiety, definitely. It's like a wave washing over me. I keep thinking about how close I came to... to not making it. And then my mind jumps to the earthquake I survived years ago, and it's like both traumas are intertwining. I feel so vulnerable, like at any moment something terrible could happen again.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How does that vulnerability feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a heaviness in my stomach. My shoulders are tense, and I notice I'm holding my breath a lot. I feel jittery, like I need to be ready to react at a moment's notice. It's exhausting, really. I wish I could just relax, but my body won't let me.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts are going through your mind as you experience these sensations?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why me? Why does this keep happening?\" It feels so unfair. And then I feel guilty for feeling that way because I know others have been through worse. But I can't shake this feeling that I'm somehow cursed or doomed. Like I'm always going to be waiting for the next disaster to strike. It makes me want to isolate myself even more, you know? Stay home where it's safe.",
    "Therapist: How does that desire to isolate connect to your overall experience with trauma?",
    "Client: I guess... it's become my go-to coping mechanism. After the earthquake, I struggled to trust that buildings were safe. Now, after the car accident, I'm terrified of driving or even being a passenger. It's like my world keeps getting smaller and smaller. I know it's not healthy, but it feels like the only way to stay safe. The depression doesn't help either. It's like this vicious cycle of fear and withdrawal.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. What do you notice about your emotions now, compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: Hmm... I think I feel a bit calmer now, actually. Talking about it, putting it into words... it helps somehow. The anxiety is still there, but it's not as overwhelming. It's like I can see it more clearly now, if that makes sense. I'm still shaky, but I feel... I don't know, maybe a tiny bit more in control? Like I'm observing my reactions rather than just being swept away by them.",
    "Therapist: That's an interesting observation. How might you use this awareness moving forward?",
    "Client: Well, I suppose... maybe I could try to remember this feeling when I start to panic in everyday situations. Like, instead of immediately isolating myself, I could try to pause and put my feelings into words, even if it's just in my head. And maybe... maybe I could try to challenge some of those thoughts about being cursed or doomed. I know rationally that's not true, but in the moment it feels so real. But if I can step back and observe like this, maybe I can start to question those thoughts more.",
    "Therapist: Mm. What else comes to mind as you think about applying this awareness?",
    "Client: I'm realizing that... maybe I don't have to face everything all at once. Like, I've been so focused on the big picture - never driving again, never feeling safe - that I've overlooked the small steps. Maybe I could start by just sitting in a parked car for a few minutes, or taking a short walk outside my house. And with the depression, maybe I could reach out to a friend, even if it's just a text message. It still feels daunting, but... I don't know, maybe a bit more manageable?",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to consider these possibilities?",
    "Client: It's... a mix of emotions, really. There's a glimmer of hope, which is nice. I haven't felt that in a while. But there's also fear. What if I try and fail? What if I have a panic attack in public? But then I also feel a bit proud of myself for even considering these steps. It's like... for the first time in a long while, I can imagine a future where I'm not completely controlled by my trauma. It's scary, but also... exciting? Is that weird to say?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. What do you make of this mix of emotions?",
    "Client: I think... maybe it's a sign of progress? Like, the fact that I can feel hope alongside the fear, that I can even entertain the idea of challenging myself... that seems like a step forward. And talking about it like this, I'm realizing how much the trauma and depression have taken from me. I miss the person I used to be, you know? The one who could enjoy life, take risks, connect with others. I want to find my way back to that person, or at least a new version of them. It won't be easy, but... maybe it's possible.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How would you like to build on this in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to explore more concrete steps I can take. Maybe we could work on a plan for gradual exposure, both for the car accident trauma and for getting out more in general? And I'd like to dive deeper into how my experiences with the earthquake and the car accident are connected. I feel like understanding that link might help me process both traumas better. Also, if it's okay, I think I'd like to try the imaginal exposure again. It was tough, but I can see how it's helping me face these memories instead of avoiding them.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've done some hard but necessary work. I'm a bit anxious about what's to come, but there's also this underlying sense of... I don't know, maybe determination? Like I've taken a small step forward today, and I want to keep that momentum going. Thank you for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone who really listens and understands.",
