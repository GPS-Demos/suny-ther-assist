    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Chen?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. My heart is still racing a bit. It's like I'm back there, you know? Seeing my husband in the hospital bed, so frail and pale. I can almost smell the disinfectant and hear the beeping of the machines. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Guilt. Overwhelming guilt. I keep thinking I should have done more. Maybe if I had noticed the symptoms earlier, or if I had pushed him to see the doctor sooner... (voice breaks) Maybe he'd still be here.",
    "Therapist: It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden. What else comes up for you?",
    "Client: Anger, I suppose. At myself, at the doctors, at the world. It's not fair. We were supposed to have more time together. We had plans for our retirement, you know? Travel, spend time with our grandchildren. Now it's all... gone. And I'm left here, alone, trying to make sense of it all.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a hot knot in my stomach. My jaw is clenched, and my hands are shaking a little. I want to scream sometimes, but I don't. I just... hold it all in. It's not proper to show such emotions, you know? In our culture, we're supposed to be... stoic, I guess.",
    "Therapist: What do you think would happen if you let those emotions out?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me is afraid I might not be able to stop if I start. Like a dam breaking. And then what? Who would take care of me? My children have their own lives. They can't be burdened with their emotional wreck of a mother. (pauses) But sometimes... sometimes I think it might be a relief. To just... let go.",
    "Therapist: How does the idea of letting go make you feel?",
    "Client: Scared. Relieved. Guilty. It's all mixed up. I feel like I should be stronger, you know? Like I should be able to handle this better. My husband was always the strong one. He'd know what to do. (sighs) I miss him so much. It's like there's this... this hole in my chest that nothing can fill.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly painful. What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Part of me wants comfort, but another part feels like I don't deserve it. Like I should suffer because I couldn't save him. (voice trembles) I keep replaying those last few days in my mind. The things I said, the things I didn't say. I wish I had told him I loved him more. I wish... I wish I had been a better wife.",
    "Therapist: It sounds like you're being very hard on yourself. How might your husband respond to that?",
    "Client: (laughs softly through tears) Oh, he'd tell me I'm being silly. He always said I worried too much. He'd probably say, \"Mei, my love, you did everything you could. It was my time.\" (pauses) But it's hard to believe that. It's easier to blame myself, in a way. Because if it's my fault, then maybe I could have changed it. And that feels... safer, somehow, than accepting that sometimes terrible things just happen and we can't control them.",
    "Therapist: That's a profound insight. How does it feel to recognize that?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. Part of me feels a little lighter, like maybe I don't have to carry all this guilt. But another part is terrified. If I can't control everything, how do I keep my family safe? How do I prevent more loss? (takes a deep breath) I guess... I guess I'm realizing how vulnerable we all are. And that's scary.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to accept that vulnerability?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe it would mean living more in the present? Appreciating what I have now, instead of always worrying about what might happen. (sighs) It's hard, though. After losing him, I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop. Always expecting the worst.",
    "Therapist: How might your life be different if you could let go of some of that fear?",
    "Client: I... I think I might be able to enjoy my grandchildren more. To really be present with them, instead of always worrying. Maybe I could start doing some of the things my husband and I had planned. Not all of them, of course, but... some. (pauses) I think he'd want that for me. He always said life was for living.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a beautiful way to honor his memory. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: A little drained, to be honest. But also... lighter, somehow. Like maybe there's a way forward that I couldn't see before. It's still scary, and I still miss him terribly. But maybe... maybe I can find a way to keep living, to keep loving. For both of us.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's one small step you could take in that direction?",
    "Client: I... I think I might call my daughter tonight. Maybe ask if I could take the grandkids to the park this weekend. My husband always loved doing that. It might be nice to... to continue that tradition. To share stories about him with them.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a wonderful idea. How does it feel to consider that?",
    "Client: A little scary, but... good. Like I'm doing something he'd be proud of. Like maybe I can find a way to keep him with me, even though he's gone. (takes a deep breath) Thank you for... for helping me see this. It's still hard, but... maybe there's hope.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength today. How would you like to close our session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to take a moment to just breathe. To sit with this feeling of... possibility. It's been so long since I've felt anything but grief. This feels... different. Not easy, but... maybe like the start of something. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take a few deep breaths together."
