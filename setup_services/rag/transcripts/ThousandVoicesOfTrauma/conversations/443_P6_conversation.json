    "Therapist: Alright, Mr. Ahmadi, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I understand why we're doing this.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's begin. Close your eyes and recall the accident. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm in my car, driving home from work. It's late, around 9 PM. The streets are quiet, but I can see headlights approaching in my rearview mirror. They're getting closer... too close. I grip the steering wheel tighter, my heart starting to race.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue, please.",
    "Client: The car behind me is speeding up. I can hear the engine revving. Suddenly, there's a loud crash. My body jerks forward, then slams back into the seat. The airbag deploys, hitting my face. I can taste blood in my mouth. Everything's spinning...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Maybe a 6 or 7.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm trying to open my eyes, but they're stinging. There's smoke or dust in the air. I can hear someone shouting outside. My door is being yanked open. A man's voice asks if I'm okay, but I can't respond. My chest hurts so much. I'm scared I might be dying...",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: I nod at the man, but I can't speak. Sirens are getting louder. I'm shivering, but I feel hot at the same time. The paramedics arrive. They're asking me questions, shining lights in my eyes. I want to tell them about the other driver, but I can't form the words. I feel so helpless...",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: Still at an 8. My heart's pounding just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: They're moving me onto a stretcher. The movement sends sharp pains through my body. I can hear them talking about possible internal bleeding. I'm terrified. What if I don't make it? What about my wife? My children? I try to speak, but only a groan comes out...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down a bit. Maybe a 7? Talking about it... it's helping somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's continue.",
    "Client: I'm in the ambulance now. The paramedic is talking to me, trying to keep me awake. I can feel every bump in the road. My thoughts are getting fuzzy. I'm fighting to stay conscious. I keep thinking about my family, wondering if I'll ever see them again...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually down to a 6. I'm surprised.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Keep going, you're doing well."
