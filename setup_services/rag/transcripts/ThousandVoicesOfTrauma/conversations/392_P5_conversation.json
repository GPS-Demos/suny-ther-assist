    "Therapist: Welcome back. Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm honestly quite nervous. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of reliving my experience with my partner's illness... it's overwhelming. I'm not sure I can handle it.",
    "Therapist: Your apprehension is understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I've worked so hard to push those memories away. The thought of bringing them back to the surface terrifies me. What if I fall apart? What if I can't stop crying? I'm worried it might set me back in my progress.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How do you think revisiting might help?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. I guess maybe it could help me process what happened? But it feels counterintuitive. I've been trying to move forward, not look back.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. Processing is key. What questions do you have about the process?",
    "Client: How long will it take? Will I have to do this multiple times? And what happens if I get too overwhelmed and can't continue?",
    "Therapist: Great questions. Let's address each one. First...",
    "Client: (interrupting) I'm sorry, but before you continue, can I just say how scared I am? My heart is racing just thinking about it. I trust you, but this feels like a huge step.",
    "Therapist: Your fear is valid. Remember, you're in control. Shall we continue?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I appreciate your patience. I want to understand how this will help me in the long run.",
    "Therapist: It'll help by allowing you to process the trauma. What do you hope to gain?",
    "Client: I suppose I hope to feel less haunted by the memories. To be able to think about my partner without feeling that crushing anxiety. Maybe even to honor their memory without falling apart.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent goals. How can I support you during this process?",
    "Client: Could you... could you maybe hold space for me if I need to pause? And remind me that I'm safe here? I think that would help a lot.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'll be here every step. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm still scared, but I'm also... hopeful? Is that strange?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a positive sign. Shall we start?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do this. I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Thank you for guiding me through this."
