    "Therapist: Hello, Mrs. Johnson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I suppose. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares about the accident lately.",
    "Therapist: I understand. We'll address that. Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. Are you familiar with this?",
    "Client: Not really. I've heard you mention it before, but I'm not sure what it involves. Is it going to be difficult?",
    "Therapist: It can be challenging, but it's a crucial step in your recovery. Shall I explain more?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I want to understand what I'm getting into.",
    "Therapist: Imaginal exposure involves revisiting the traumatic memory in a safe environment. We'll go through it step-by-step.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) That sounds... scary. I've been trying so hard not to think about the accident. Won't this make things worse?",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel apprehensive. How do you think confronting the memory might help?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe it could help me process what happened? But I'm worried about falling apart or losing control.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. Remember, you're in control here. We can pause anytime. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's a little reassuring. But what if I can't handle it? What if I freeze up or start panicking?",
    "Therapist: I'll be here to guide and support you. We'll go at your pace. What else might help you feel more comfortable?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe if we had a signal or a word I could use if I need to stop? And perhaps having some water nearby?",
    "Therapist: Excellent suggestions. We'll use \"pause\" as our signal word. I'll get you some water now.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate that. Can you tell me more about what exactly we'll be doing?",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll start with you describing the accident, focusing on sensory details. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It sounds intense. Will I have to close my eyes? I'm not sure I can do that without feeling panicked.",
    "Therapist: You can keep your eyes open if you prefer. What matters is that you feel safe. Any other concerns?",
    "Client: I'm worried about getting too emotional. What if I start crying and can't stop?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Emotions are part of the process. We'll work through them together. How does that reassurance feel?",
    "Client: It helps a little. I'm still nervous, but I think I'm ready to try. This will help me get better, right?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it's a proven method for reducing PTSD symptoms. Your courage is admirable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Okay. I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Let's do this. But please, remind me that I can stop if it gets too overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Remember, you're in control. Let's start whenever you're comfortable."
