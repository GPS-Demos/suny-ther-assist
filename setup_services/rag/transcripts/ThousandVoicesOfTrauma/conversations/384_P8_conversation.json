    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's like my body is buzzing, you know? My hands are a bit shaky, and I can feel my heart racing. The memory feels so vivid, like I was right back there in that moment. I can still smell the musty odor of that basement where we hid.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: It's a jumble, really. I keep thinking about how young and scared I was. We had to leave everything behind so quickly. I remember clutching my little doll, the only thing I managed to grab. And then... (voice breaks) I'm thinking about my parents and how terrified they looked. They tried to hide it, but I could see it in their eyes.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. What emotions are you experiencing?",
    "Client: Sadness, definitely. A deep, aching sadness for that little girl I was and for my family. But there's also... I don't know, maybe anger? Anger that we had to go through that, that anyone has to experience something like that. And guilt, too. I survived, I'm here now, but so many others weren't as fortunate.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when you first arrived as a refugee?",
    "Client: Oh, they're... they're different now. Back then, everything was raw and immediate. I was in survival mode, you know? Now, it's like I can step back and see the bigger picture. The fear isn't as overwhelming, but the sadness feels deeper somehow. And I think I'm allowing myself to feel the anger now, which I couldn't do then. It wasn't safe to be angry when we were just trying to stay alive.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice in your body as you talk about this?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, like there's a weight pressing down on it. And my throat... it's constricted, making it hard to swallow. But you know what's strange? My legs feel restless, like they want to run. I guess that's the old flight response kicking in, even after all these years.",
    "Therapist: How does revisiting this memory impact your view of yourself?",
    "Client: (long pause) That's... that's a tough one. Part of me feels proud, I suppose. Proud that I survived, that I've built a life despite everything. But there's also this nagging feeling of... I don't know, maybe unworthiness? Like, why did I get to have this life when others didn't? And sometimes I wonder if I'm still that scared little girl inside, just pretending to be a strong adult.",
    "Therapist: What would you say to that little girl now?",
    "Client: (tears up) Oh, I... I'd tell her she's so brave. That it's okay to be scared, but that she's stronger than she knows. I'd tell her that one day, she'll have a home again, and people who love her. And that... that it's not her fault. None of it was her fault. (starts crying)",
    "Therapist: Take your time. It's okay to feel these emotions.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Thank you. It's just... it's overwhelming sometimes. I've spent so long trying to push these memories away, and now facing them head-on... it's like opening floodgates. But I think... I think it's necessary. It hurts, but it also feels like I'm finally acknowledging that little girl's experiences.",
    "Therapist: How does this process relate to your chronic pain?",
    "Client: It's interesting you ask that. I've noticed that when we do these exercises, my pain levels spike for a while. It's like my body is remembering too, you know? But afterwards, once I've processed things a bit, the pain often eases. It's as if by facing the emotional pain, I'm somehow addressing the physical pain too. They're connected in ways I don't fully understand yet.",
    "Therapist: What do you think you need right now?",
    "Client: Honestly? I think I just need to sit with these feelings for a bit. To let myself feel them without trying to push them away or rationalize them. And maybe... maybe I need to be a little kinder to myself. To acknowledge that what I went through was real and significant, and that it's okay that it still affects me.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a compassionate approach. How can you practice that self-kindness?",
    "Client: I suppose I could... maybe write a letter to my younger self? Or spend some time each day just sitting quietly and allowing myself to feel whatever comes up, without judgment. And perhaps I need to share more with my family. They know about our past, of course, but I've always tried to shield them from the worst of it. Maybe opening up would help me feel less alone with these memories.",
    "Therapist: Those are thoughtful ideas. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired, but in a good way, if that makes sense? Like I've done some hard but necessary work. There's a heaviness, but also a sense of... I don't know, maybe relief? Like I've set down a burden I've been carrying for a long time. It's not gone, but it feels a little lighter.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant shift. What do you want to remember from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I want to remember that it's okay to feel all of these emotions. That they're part of my story, but they don't define me. And that by facing them, I'm not reliving the trauma, I'm processing it. I'm giving that little girl the support and understanding she needed back then. And maybe, just maybe, I'm one step closer to finding peace with my past.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing so openly. How would you like to close our session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to take a few deep breaths together, if that's okay. Just to ground myself before I leave. And maybe... could you remind me of that grounding exercise we practiced last time? I have a feeling I might need it later.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's do that now."
