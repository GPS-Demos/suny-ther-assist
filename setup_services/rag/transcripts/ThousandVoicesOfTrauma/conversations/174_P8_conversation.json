    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. That memory of being in that cell... it's so vivid now. I can almost smell the damp concrete and feel the cold seeping into my bones. My heart is still pounding a bit.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I think. No, not just fear... terror. It's like I'm that scared little boy again, huddled in the corner of that cell. I keep telling myself I'm safe now, but my body doesn't seem to believe it. My hands are shaking, see? And there's this tightness in my chest that won't go away.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts are accompanying these physical sensations?",
    "Client: I keep hearing the guard's footsteps echoing down the corridor. In my head, I mean. It's silly, isn't it? I'm a grown man now, but those footsteps... they still make me want to curl up and disappear. I'm thinking... what if I never really escaped? What if I'm still that powerless child, just pretending to be an adult?",
    "Therapist: How does that thought make you feel?",
    "Client: Angry. So angry. At the guards, at the system that allowed it to happen, but mostly at myself. Why couldn't I have been stronger? Why did I let it affect me so much? I've spent my whole life trying to prove I'm not that weak, scared kid anymore. But maybe... maybe I am.",
    "Therapist: What do you mean by \"weak\"?",
    "Client: I mean... unable to protect myself. Vulnerable. I've built this whole persona of being tough and independent, you know? But when I remember that cell, it all falls apart. I feel exposed, like everyone can see right through me to that terrified child inside. And I hate it. I hate feeling this way.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you express this anger?",
    "Client: It's... intense. My jaw is clenched so tight it hurts. My fists are balled up. There's this heat in my chest, like a furnace. But at the same time, I feel... drained. Like I could sleep for a week. It's exhausting, carrying all this around.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Part of me wants to run away, to forget all of this. But another part... I think I need to feel safe. To know that it's okay to be that scared kid sometimes. That it doesn't make me weak or less of a man. Is that... is that stupid?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. How might you provide that safety for yourself?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. I've never really thought about it before. Maybe... maybe acknowledging that the fear is real, but that I'm not in danger anymore? Reminding myself that I've survived, that I'm stronger now? It's hard, though. It feels like admitting defeat somehow.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to you to accept those feelings?",
    "Client: It's scary to think about. Like opening Pandora's box, you know? If I let myself feel all of this, will I ever be able to close it again? But... maybe it would be a relief too. To not have to pretend all the time. To just... be. With all the mess and the pain and the fear. And maybe... maybe that's what real strength is?",
    "Therapist: How does that idea sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... uncomfortable. But also kind of liberating? Like, maybe I don't have to have it all together all the time. Maybe it's okay to still be affected by what happened. I've spent so long running from these feelings, trying to prove I'm over it. But I'm not, am I? And... maybe that's okay.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you say that?",
    "Client: A mix of things. There's still fear there, definitely. But also... hope? Like maybe I can find a way to live with this, instead of constantly fighting it. And... gratitude, I guess. For this space to explore all of this. It's terrifying, but also... necessary. I think I needed this, even if I didn't want it.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's daunting. The thought of diving deeper into these memories... it scares me. But I also feel... determined? Like I've opened a door that I can't close now, and I need to see what's on the other side. It won't be easy, but... I think it might be worth it. To finally face this head-on, you know?",
    "Therapist: What support do you need moving forward?",
    "Client: I... I'm not used to asking for support. It's always been just me, you know? But I think... maybe I need to learn how. To reach out when things get tough. To remind myself that I'm not alone in this anymore. And to be patient with myself. This isn't going to change overnight, is it?",
    "Therapist: How does that realization feel?",
    "Client: It's a mix of frustration and relief, to be honest. Frustrated that there's no quick fix, that this is going to be a long process. But also relieved that I don't have to have all the answers right now. That it's okay to take it one step at a time. It's... it's a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: What's your main takeaway from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's that it's okay to not be okay sometimes. That facing these memories doesn't make me weak, it makes me brave. And that maybe, just maybe, I can find a way to integrate this part of my past into who I am now, without letting it define me. It's scary, but... I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. How would you like to close our session?",
    "Client: I... I think I need a moment to just breathe. To sit with all of this. It's been intense, you know? But good intense, if that makes sense. Like... like I've taken a step towards something important. Can we just... can we just sit in silence for a minute? Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take that moment together."
