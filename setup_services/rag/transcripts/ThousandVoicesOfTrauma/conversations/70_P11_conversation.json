    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's not easy revisiting that time when I was diagnosed with cancer. The memory of sitting in that sterile doctor's office, hearing those words... it's like I was right back there again. My heart's still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most about reliving that experience?",
    "Client: The overwhelming fear, I think. It was like this dark cloud suddenly enveloped everything. I remember thinking about my wife, our kids... wondering if I'd see them grow up. And then there was this intense anger, you know? Like, why me? I've always taken care of myself, and yet...",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. Harder than I expected, actually. I found myself tensing up, my palms got sweaty. But, um, it wasn't as bad as I feared it might be. I mean, I got through it, right?",
    "Therapist: Indeed, you did. How does that realization sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... kind of empowering, I guess. I mean, I've been avoiding thinking about that day for so long. Always pushed it away when it came up. But facing it head-on like this... it's tough, but I feel like I'm taking back some control, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How might this relate to your recovery goals?",
    "Client: Well, I've been wanting to feel more in control of my emotions, especially my anxiety. This experience... it's showing me that I can face these difficult memories and come out the other side. Maybe if I can do this, I can handle other challenging situations better too?",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent connection. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm realizing that... well, even though the memory is painful, it doesn't have the same grip on me that it used to. Like, I can think about it without feeling completely overwhelmed. Is that... is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Many find that with exposure. How does this change feel to you?",
    "Client: It feels... liberating, I suppose. Like I'm not constantly walking on eggshells around my own memories anymore. But it's also a bit confusing. I've been so used to avoiding these thoughts that it's strange to confront them directly.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. What strategies helped you get through today's session?",
    "Client: I tried to remind myself that I was safe here, in the present. And I focused on my breathing when things got really intense. Oh, and I kept reminding myself that the memory couldn't hurt me now. That helped a lot, actually.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent coping strategies. How might you apply them moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I could use them when I start feeling anxious in daily life. Like, if I'm at a doctor's appointment and start getting panicky, I could use those breathing techniques. And maybe I could try reminding myself that I'm safe in other stressful situations too.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a solid plan. How are you feeling about continuing with the therapy?",
    "Client: I'm... cautiously optimistic, I think. It's not easy, and part of me is dreading having to face more difficult memories. But I can see how it might be helpful. And, well, I want to get better. For myself and for my family. So I'm willing to keep pushing forward, even when it's tough.",

I think it's worth it.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. We'll continue this work next time.",
    "Client: Alright, thank you. I'll... I'll see you next week then."
