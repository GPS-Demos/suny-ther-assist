    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like my whole body is vibrating. The memory of being in that cell, it's so vivid now. I can almost smell the damp concrete and feel the cold seeping into my bones. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But it's mixed with this intense sense of helplessness. When I was in there, I felt so small, so insignificant. Like I was nothing more than a number, a piece of property. It's bringing back all these feelings of worthlessness that I've struggled with for years.",
    "Therapist: How does that fear and helplessness show up in your body?",
    "Client: My heart is racing, and my palms are sweaty. There's this tightness in my chest, like I can't get enough air. And my shoulders... they're so tense, like I'm bracing for something. It's as if my body is still trapped in that moment, even though I know I'm safe here.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are accompanying these sensations?",
    "Client: I keep hearing the guard's voice in my head, telling me I'm worthless, that I'll never amount to anything. And part of me... part of me still believes it. I'm thinking, \"Maybe he was right. Look at where I am now.\" It's like I'm still carrying that prison with me, even after all these years.",
    "Therapist: How does that belief impact you today?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a weight I can't shake off. Every time I try to move forward in life, to build something meaningful, that voice creeps back in. It makes me doubt myself, question my decisions. I've sabotaged relationships, job opportunities... It's like I'm still serving a sentence, but now it's one I've imposed on myself.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about that pattern?",
    "Client: I... I guess I've never really thought about it that way before. It's like I've internalized that guard's voice, made it my own. I'm still letting him control me, even though I'm no longer behind those bars. It's frustrating to realize how much power I've given to that memory, to that voice.",
    "Therapist: What might it be like to challenge that voice?",
    "Client: Challenging it? That's... that's a scary thought. It's been with me for so long, it's almost comfortable in its familiarity. But at the same time, I'm tired of it. I'm tired of feeling small and worthless. Maybe... maybe it's time to start talking back to that voice, to remind myself that I'm not that helpless person anymore.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to consider that possibility?",
    "Client: It's both terrifying and... and oddly liberating. Like I'm standing on the edge of something big. There's a part of me that wants to cling to the old beliefs because they're safe, known. But there's another part that's yearning to break free, to see what I could become without that constant self-doubt holding me back.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you could take?",
    "Client: I... I think maybe I could start by challenging one negative thought each day. Like, when I hear that voice telling me I'm worthless, I could try to counter it with something positive about myself. It sounds simple, but it feels monumental. Just the idea of it makes my heart race, but in a different way... like excitement mixed with fear.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... it's uncomfortable, but in a good way, I think. Like I'm stretching a muscle I haven't used in years. There's this glimmer of hope that maybe, just maybe, I can rewrite this narrative I've been living with. It's scary, but it also feels like the first real step towards freedom that I've taken since leaving that cell.",
    "Therapist: What support might you need?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'll need a lot of patience with myself. This isn't going to be an overnight change. And maybe... maybe I could use some help identifying those positive things about myself. It's been so long since I've looked for them. Would that be something we could work on in our sessions?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What else comes to mind?",
    "Client: I'm realizing that I've been isolating myself a lot. Maybe reconnecting with some old friends or family could help. Having people around who see me differently than I see myself... that could be powerful. And maybe... maybe finding a support group for others who've been through similar experiences. I've always been hesitant about that, but now I'm thinking it might be helpful to not feel so alone in this.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about today's session?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but in a good way. Like I've just finished a long, hard workout. There's pain, but also a sense of accomplishment. I came in dreading reliving that memory, but now I feel like I've gained some new perspective on it. It's still painful, but it feels less overwhelming. Like maybe, just maybe, I can start to see beyond it.",
    "Therapist: That's great insight. We'll pick up here next time.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I'm actually looking forward to it. That's not something I thought I'd ever say about these sessions. But I feel like I'm starting to see a path forward, even if it's just a faint outline right now. It's more than I had before, and that feels... it feels good."
