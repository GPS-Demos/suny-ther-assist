    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like my whole body is vibrating, but not in a good way. The memory of that day in the office, when my coworker cornered me in the break room and started mocking my accent... it's so vivid now. I can almost smell the coffee brewing and hear the hum of the fluorescent lights. My heart is racing, and I feel this tightness in my chest.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt in that moment. Like, I'm an adult, you know? I should've been able to stand up for myself, but I just froze. And then I start wondering if maybe they were right... maybe I don't belong here. Maybe my accent really is too thick, and I'm not cut out for this job. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you share these thoughts?",
    "Client: It's... it's weird. My hands are clammy, and there's this knot in my stomach. I feel hot and cold at the same time, like I'm feverish. And my shoulders are so tense, like I'm bracing for another attack. It's like my body is stuck in that moment, even though I know I'm safe here.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are you experiencing?",
    "Client: I'm angry. So, so angry. But not just at my coworker. I'm angry at myself for not speaking up, for letting it happen. And I'm... I'm scared. Scared that it could happen again, that I'll never feel truly safe at work. There's this deep sadness too, you know? Like, I've worked so hard to get where I am, and it feels like it could all be taken away because of someone else's prejudice.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when the event first happened?",
    "Client: They're... they're intense, but different. When it first happened, I was just numb. I couldn't process anything. Now, it's like I'm feeling everything at once. It's overwhelming, but also... I don't know, maybe clearer? Like I'm finally allowing myself to really experience it instead of pushing it down.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about that shift?",
    "Client: I... I guess it feels like progress? It hurts, but it's like I'm finally acknowledging what happened instead of pretending it didn't affect me. And there's a small part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe proud? That I can face this memory now without completely falling apart. It's hard, but I'm doing it.",
    "Therapist: How does this experience relate to your overall recovery journey?",
    "Client: It's... it's like I'm reclaiming my story, bit by bit. Each time we do this, it gets a little easier to look at the memory without being consumed by it. I'm starting to see that what happened wasn't my fault, that I didn't deserve it. And I'm learning that I'm stronger than I thought. It's slow, and sometimes it feels like I'm taking two steps forward and one step back, but... I think I'm moving in the right direction.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you reflect on that progress?",
    "Client: I feel... hopeful, I think. Like maybe I can get through this and come out stronger on the other side. But there's also this fear, you know? What if I can't keep it up? What if I hit a wall and can't move forward anymore? And there's still so much anger and hurt. It's like... it's like I'm carrying this heavy weight, and I'm slowly learning how to put it down, but I'm scared of what happens when I do. Will I know who I am without it?",
    "Therapist: How would you like to address those concerns moving forward?",
    "Client: I... I think I want to keep pushing through. Maybe we could work on some strategies for dealing with the anger? And... and maybe some ways to feel more confident at work? I want to believe in myself again, to feel like I belong. And I want to be prepared if something like this ever happens again. I don't want to freeze up. I want to be able to stand up for myself.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. Emotionally drained. But also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been holding onto for too long. It's scary, but also kind of freeing. I'm nervous about what comes next, but I think I'm ready to face it.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to work on building my confidence. Maybe we could practice some scenarios? Like, role-playing how I could respond if someone at work says something inappropriate. And... and maybe we could talk more about why I freeze up in those moments. I want to understand that better so I can change it.",
    "Therapist: That's a great idea. We'll start there next time. How do you want to care for yourself for the rest of the day?",
    "Client: I think I need some quiet time. Maybe I'll take a long bath when I get home, or go for a walk in the park. Something to help me process everything we've talked about. And... and I think I'll call my partner. I've been keeping a lot of this bottled up, and maybe it's time I shared some of it with them. Is that... is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. That sounds like a healthy way to process. How are you feeling about ending our session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. A bit raw, but okay. Thank you for guiding me through this. It's hard, but I think it's helping. I'm looking forward to our next session, even though I know it'll be challenging. I feel like I'm finally starting to move forward.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
