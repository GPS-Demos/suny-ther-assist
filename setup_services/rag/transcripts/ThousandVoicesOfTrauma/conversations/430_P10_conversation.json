    "Therapist: Good afternoon, Mr. Patel. How are you feeling today as we begin our imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit uneasy, Dr. Chen. There's this knot in my stomach, you know? Part of me wants to just get up and leave, but I know I need to do this.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: I'd say about... 60? Maybe 65?",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Remember, we're here together. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I... I think I'm ready. (takes a deep breath) I'm back there, in that dark room. The air is thick, musty. I can barely breathe. There are other children around me, huddled together. We're all so scared. I'm only 10 years old, but I feel like I've aged decades in just a few days.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see... I see dirty mattresses on the floor. The windows are boarded up, but a sliver of light comes through a crack. It's enough to see the fear in everyone's eyes. There's a girl next to me, she can't be more than 8. She's crying silently.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. My palms are sweaty. I feel like I can't get enough air. It's like... like I'm back there, suffocating.",
    "Therapist: Take a slow, deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (inhales shakily) Okay. I... I hear footsteps coming down the hallway. Heavy boots. Everyone tenses up. We know what's coming. The door creaks open, and this man... this monster... he's standing there. He's scanning the room, deciding who to take next.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: Please don't pick me. Please don't pick me. But... but also, don't take her. Don't take the little girl. I... I want to protect her, but I'm so terrified.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 80 now. God, this is hard.",
    "Therapist: I know. You're very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: He... he points at me. \"You. Come here.\" His voice is gruff, emotionless. I feel like I'm going to throw up. My legs won't move. The little girl grabs my hand, but I have to let go. I stand up, my whole body shaking.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What happens next?",
    "Client: He grabs my arm, his fingers digging into my skin. It hurts. He drags me out of the room. I can hear the others whimpering behind me. The hallway is long and dark. There are other doors, other rooms. I wonder how many children are trapped here.",
    "Therapist: Focus on your breathing. You're doing great.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) We reach another room. It's brighter here, but that almost makes it worse. I can see everything clearly. There's a bed, a camera set up. My stomach lurches. I know what's about to happen, and I can't stop it.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here with me. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I... I can't. I can't do this. It's too much. (starts breathing rapidly)",
    "Therapist: Let's pause for a moment. Focus on my voice. You're in my office, it's 2023. You're safe.",
    "Client: (takes several deep breaths) Okay... okay. I'm here. I'm safe. But God, it feels so real.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're very courageous. Do you want to continue?",
    "Client: Yes. I need to. (swallows hard) The man, he... he tells me to undress. His eyes are cold, empty. I'm shaking so hard I can barely move. He gets impatient, starts pulling at my clothes. I feel so helpless, so small.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Shame. Disgust. Anger. I want to fight back, but I'm frozen. I close my eyes, try to imagine I'm somewhere else. Anywhere else.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The room smells like cigarettes and cheap cologne. There's a fan whirring in the corner. I focus on that sound, trying to block out everything else. But I can't. I can't escape what's happening.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's 95. Maybe higher. I feel like I'm going to pass out.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: (breathes deeply) Okay. I'm... I'm still here. The man, he... he does things to me. Things no child should ever experience. I feel like I'm outside my body, watching it happen to someone else. But the pain... the pain reminds me it's real.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: It feels like it lasts forever. But finally, it's over. He tosses my clothes at me, tells me to get dressed. I can barely move. Everything hurts. I'm crying, but no sound comes out. He grabs me again, drags me back to the room with the others.",
    "Therapist: What happens when you return?",
    "Client: The other children look at me. They know. Some look away, others with pity. The little girl from before, she scoots closer to me. She doesn't say anything, just holds my hand. I want to comfort her, tell her it'll be okay. But I can't lie.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel in that moment?",
    "Client: Broken. Dirty. But also... angry. So angry. I want to hurt them, the men who do this. I want to save all of us. But I'm just a child. I'm powerless.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are valid. You're doing great. SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. 90, maybe? My heart is pounding.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (breathes slowly) I... I curl up in the corner. My body aches. I'm so tired, but I'm afraid to sleep. Afraid of what might happen. The little girl is still holding my hand. I squeeze it gently. We're all we have in this hell.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Days pass. Or maybe weeks. It's hard to tell. We're given little food, barely enough water. Sometimes I hear screams from other rooms. Sometimes it's my own screams. I try to stay strong for the younger ones, but inside, I'm falling apart.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel a mix of things. Sadness, for the child I was. Anger, at the monsters who did this. And... and a strange sense of pride, that I survived. That I'm here now, facing this.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. You've shown immense courage. SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 75 now. Still high, but... I feel like I can breathe a bit easier.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Let's start bringing you back to the present.",
    "Client: (nods) Okay. I... I see myself now, as an adult. I'm looking at that scared little boy. I want to tell him it gets better. That he survives this. That one day, he'll be free.",
    "Therapist: That's powerful. How does it feel to give that message to your younger self?",
    "Client: It's... it's bittersweet. I wish I could have known then that there was hope. But I'm proud of how far I've come.",
    "Therapist: You should be. You've shown incredible resilience. Let's take a few deep breaths together.",
    "Client: (breathes deeply) Thank you, Dr. Chen. This was... it was tough. But I feel like I've taken a step forward.",
    "Therapist: You absolutely have. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. Emotionally exhausted. But also... lighter, somehow. Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience after imaginal exposure. Final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: I'd say... about 40 now. Still some anxiety, but much better than before.",
    "Therapist: Excellent progress. Let's spend some time debriefing and processing what you experienced today.",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be helpful. I... I never thought I'd be able to talk about this. To face it head-on like this.",
    "Therapist: You've shown tremendous courage. We'll work through this together, at your pace.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Chen. I... I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can start to heal from this.",
    "Therapist: That's the goal, Mr. Patel. And you're well on your way. Let's discuss how you're feeling now and plan for self-care after this intense session."
