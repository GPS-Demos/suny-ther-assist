    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit. That memory of the earthquake... it's like I was right back there, you know? I can still hear the rumbling, feel the ground moving beneath my feet. It's... it's intense.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: Right now, I'm... I'm feeling this overwhelming sense of helplessness. Like, during the earthquake, I couldn't do anything to stop it or protect myself. And now, even though I know I'm safe, there's this... this lingering fear that I'm not in control. It's... it's frustrating, you know?",
    "Therapist: I see. Can you tell me more about that feeling of helplessness?",
    "Client: Yeah, it's... it's like being trapped in a nightmare, but you can't wake up. During the earthquake, I remember thinking, \"This is it. This is how I die.\" And now, even though it's over, that feeling of impending doom just... it just sticks with me. It's like I'm constantly waiting for the next disaster to strike. I can't relax, can't let my guard down. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: How does this relate to your past experiences?",
    "Client: I... I guess it reminds me of how I felt during my divorce. That same lack of control, the feeling that everything was falling apart and I couldn't do anything to stop it. It's like... it's like the earthquake brought all those old feelings back to the surface. And now, I'm struggling to keep it all together, for my family's sake.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you noticing?",
    "Client: My... my hands are clammy, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's hard to take a deep breath. And my stomach... it's in knots. It's like my body's still in fight-or-flight mode, even though the danger's long passed. I keep catching myself clenching my jaw, too.",
    "Therapist: How do these sensations affect you?",
    "Client: They... they make it hard to focus on anything else. It's like my body's constantly on high alert, and it's draining. I find myself avoiding situations that might trigger these feelings, which... which I know isn't healthy. But it's just so overwhelming sometimes.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"What if it happens again?\" And not just earthquakes, but any disaster. I worry about my family, about not being able to protect them. And then I feel guilty for being so anxious all the time. I should be stronger than this, you know? I'm a professional, I should have it together. But I feel like I'm falling apart.",
    "Therapist: How does this impact your daily life?",
    "Client: It's... it's affecting everything. My work, my relationships. I'm having trouble sleeping, always waking up in a cold sweat. I'm irritable with my family, which makes me feel even worse. And I'm... I'm struggling to enjoy things I used to love. It's like this constant cloud of anxiety is following me everywhere.",
    "Therapist: What do you think this experience is teaching you?",
    "Client: I... I hadn't really thought about it that way. I guess... maybe it's teaching me that I'm stronger than I thought? I mean, I survived the earthquake, and I'm here, trying to work through it. And maybe... maybe it's showing me the importance of connection? During the quake, strangers came together to help each other. That was... that was pretty powerful.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually kind of comforting. Like, maybe I'm not as alone in this as I thought. And maybe... maybe there's hope that I can get through this, you know? It's still scary, and overwhelming, but... but maybe I can learn to cope with it better.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on next?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to work on some coping strategies. Maybe ways to ground myself when I start feeling anxious? And... and maybe explore how I can rebuild my sense of safety and control. I want to be able to enjoy life again, without constantly worrying about the next disaster.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling a bit lighter, actually. Still anxious, but... but like maybe there's a way forward. Talking about it, really diving into those feelings... it's hard, but I think it's helping. I'm... I'm grateful for this space to work through it all.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad you're feeling that way. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think that would be good. This session was intense, but... but in a good way, I think. I feel like I've made some progress, even if it's just in understanding my feelings better. Thank you for guiding me through this. I'm... I'm looking forward to our next session, to keep working on this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next time."
