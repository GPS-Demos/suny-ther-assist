    "Therapist: Welcome, John. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling a bit jittery, to be honest. But I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath, and when you're ready, describe the cyber bullying incident.",
    "Client: Alright... *deep breath* I'm sitting at my desk at home, it's late evening. The room is dim, just the glow from my computer screen. I've just finished a long day of work, and I'm scrolling through social media to unwind. Suddenly, I see a notification. Someone's tagged me in a post.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: My heart starts racing a bit. I'm... curious, but also apprehensive. I click on the notification, and... oh god. It's a photo of me from a recent work event, but it's been edited. They've... they've made me look ridiculous. Added clown makeup, distorted my features. The caption is cruel, mocking my presentation skills and calling me incompetent.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 6, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take another deep breath. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I can't look away. I'm scrolling through the comments, and they're all laughing. Colleagues, people I thought were friends. Some are even adding their own insults. I feel sick to my stomach, my palms are sweating. I want to respond, to defend myself, but I'm paralyzed.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking, \"How could they do this? What did I do to deserve this?\" I feel so exposed, so humiliated. It's like everyone can see my deepest insecurities laid bare. I'm wondering if there's any truth to what they're saying. Maybe I am incompetent. Maybe I don't deserve my position.",
    "Therapist: Remember, these are just thoughts. They're not facts. Keep going.",
    "Client: Right, right... *deep breath* I close the tab, but I can't stop thinking about it. I check my phone compulsively, dreading more notifications. I can't sleep that night. Every time I close my eyes, I see that distorted image of myself, hear the echoes of their laughter.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: *takes a deep breath* Okay... okay. The next day, I can barely face going to work. I feel like everyone's seen it, like they're all judging me. I'm constantly on edge, checking over my shoulder. In meetings, I stumble over my words, second-guessing everything I say. I feel like a fraud, like I don't belong there anymore.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I start withdrawing. I skip lunch, eat at my desk to avoid people. I stop contributing in meetings unless I absolutely have to. I'm constantly worried about what people are saying behind my back. It's... it's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel during this time?",
    "Client: Tense. So tense. My shoulders are up to my ears, I have a constant headache. My stomach's in knots. I'm not sleeping well, having nightmares about being laughed at, being chased.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. This is really intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I start to isolate myself more. I cancel plans with friends, ignore messages. I'm too afraid of what they might be thinking, what they might say. My partner notices, tries to talk to me about it, but I push them away too. I feel so alone, so... worthless.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why me? What did I do to deserve this?\" And then... then I start thinking maybe I do deserve it. Maybe I'm not good enough, not smart enough. Maybe everyone's just been humoring me all this time. I feel like a fraud, like any moment someone's going to expose me for the imposter I am.",
    "Therapist: Remember, these are just thoughts, not facts. How does your body feel?",
    "Client: Heavy. So heavy. It's like there's this weight on my chest, making it hard to breathe. My throat feels tight, like I'm constantly on the verge of tears. I'm exhausted all the time, but I can't sleep. When I do, I have these vivid nightmares of being chased, of falling, of being trapped.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still at a 9. This is really hard to talk about.",
    "Therapist: I know it's difficult, but you're doing great. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves again.",
    "Client: *takes a deep breath* Okay... okay. As the days go by, it doesn't get easier. I'm constantly checking social media, looking for more attacks, more mockery. I can't focus on work, I'm making mistakes. My boss notices, asks if everything's okay. I lie, say I'm fine, but inside I'm falling apart.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel in that moment with your boss?",
    "Client: Scared. Terrified. Like any moment they're going to see through me, realize I'm not capable of doing my job. My heart's racing, I'm sweating. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I start having panic attacks. The first one hits me in the middle of a meeting. My heart's pounding, I can't catch my breath. I excuse myself, rush to the bathroom. I'm shaking, crying. I feel like I'm dying. It takes me an hour to calm down enough to leave the stall.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 10. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, John. Take a deep breath. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: *takes several deep breaths* Okay... okay. After that, I call in sick for a few days. I can't face going back. I spend the days in bed, curtains drawn. I can't eat, can't sleep. I keep replaying that initial post in my mind, imagining what people are saying about me. I feel so alone, so... broken.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How does your body feel during this time?",
    "Client: Weak. So weak. I've lost weight, my clothes are hanging off me. I'm pale, dark circles under my eyes. I can barely recognize myself in the mirror. And that just makes it worse, because it feels like they were right about me all along.",
    "Therapist: Remember, what they said isn't true. These are just thoughts. What happens next?",
    "Client: My partner... they're really worried. They try to talk to me, but I push them away. I'm afraid they'll see how weak I am, how pathetic. I'm afraid they'll leave me too. But pushing them away hurts so much. I feel so alone, so isolated.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"I'm not good enough. I'm a failure. Everyone would be better off without me.\" It's... it's scary how dark my thoughts get. I start to wonder if... if it would be better if I wasn't here anymore.",
    "Therapist: I hear you're in a lot of pain. Remember, these are just thoughts. You're safe here. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still at a 10. This is really intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well, John. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves again.",
    "Client: *takes several deep breaths* Okay... okay. It's my partner who finally convinces me to seek help. They find me one night, crying in the bathroom. They hold me, tell me they love me, that we'll get through this together. It's... it's the first time I've felt a glimmer of hope in weeks.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a powerful moment. How did you feel?",
    "Client: Relieved. So relieved. But also scared. Scared to hope, scared to believe things could get better. But also... grateful. So grateful to not be alone anymore.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. We're almost done. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. But also... I don't know. Maybe a little lighter? Like talking about it has lifted some of the weight.",
    "Therapist: That's good to hear. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down to a 7, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress, John. You've done incredibly well today. Let's take a few more deep breaths together before we end the session.",
    "Client: *takes several deep breaths* Thank you. This was hard, but... I think it was important.",
    "Therapist: It absolutely was. You've shown tremendous courage today. We'll continue to work through this together."
