    "Therapist: Welcome, Priya. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit nervous, to be honest. I know we're going to be talking about some heavy stuff today.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in my dorm room. It's late, maybe around 11 PM. I'm scrolling through my phone, looking at job listings. I'm so desperate to find a way to pay for next semester's tuition.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I see this ad... it promises quick money for \"companionship.\" I know it sounds sketchy, but I'm so stressed about money. I... I click on it.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Um, maybe a 40? I'm feeling a bit anxious remembering this.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... So, I fill out this form. They ask for my name, age, photos... I hesitate, but I do it anyway. My heart's racing a bit as I hit submit.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens after you submit the form?",
    "Client: Almost immediately, I get a message. It's from someone calling themselves \"Alex.\" They say they can offer me a job that'll solve all my money problems. I'm... I'm both excited and scared.",
    "Therapist: How's your anxiety level now?",
    "Client: It's creeping up... maybe a 55?",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Priya. Remember, you're safe here. What does Alex say next?",
    "Client: They... they start asking me personal questions. About my family, my schedule, if I have a boyfriend. It feels invasive, but I answer anyway. I'm so focused on the promise of money.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Ashamed. Stupid. I should have known better, but I was so desperate.",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault, Priya. You were in a difficult situation. What happens next?",
    "Client: Alex suggests we meet in person. They say they have a \"business opportunity\" for me. I agree to meet at a caf\u00e9 near campus the next day. I'm nervous, but also hopeful.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 70. My palms are getting sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... I'm at the caf\u00e9 now. It's busy, lots of students around. I'm sitting at a table, constantly checking my phone. Then... then this man approaches. He's older, maybe in his 40s. He introduces himself as Alex.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about him?",
    "Client: He's... he's well-dressed. Expensive watch, nice shoes. He smiles, but it doesn't reach his eyes. Something about him makes me uneasy.",
    "Therapist: Trust those instincts. What happens as you talk?",
    "Client: He starts telling me about this \"exclusive club\" where I could make a lot of money. Just dancing, he says. But... but then he mentions \"private sessions\" with wealthy clients. My stomach drops. I realize what this really is.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, Priya?",
    "Client: I feel sick. Scared. My anxiety is probably at an 85 now. I... I want to leave, but I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: You're doing so well. Remember, you got through this. You're safe now.",
    "Client: Right... okay. So, Alex keeps talking, painting this picture of luxury and easy money. But I can see through it now. I'm thinking of all the trafficking stories I've heard. I... I start to panic.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I stand up suddenly. My chair scrapes loudly. I stammer something about needing to go. Alex grabs my wrist, tells me to think about it. His grip is tight. I'm terrified.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you feel in your body?",
    "Client: My heart's pounding. I can barely breathe. I feel like everyone in the caf\u00e9 is staring, but no one's helping. I... I yank my arm away and run. I don't stop until I'm back in my dorm room.",
    "Therapist: You showed incredible strength. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Shaken. Relieved. But also... angry. At Alex, at myself for falling for it. My anxiety's still high, maybe 90.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. Take a few deep breaths with me.",
    "Client: *breathing deeply* Okay... I'm calming down a bit.",
    "Therapist: What do you do once you're back in your room?",
    "Client: I lock the door. I'm shaking. I delete the app, block Alex's number. I curl up on my bed and cry. I feel so stupid, so vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: You weren't stupid, Priya. You were targeted. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down. Maybe 75? I'm starting to feel safer.",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you do in the following days?",
    "Client: I... I don't tell anyone at first. I'm too ashamed. But after a few days, I confide in my roommate. She convinces me to report it to campus security. They take it seriously, warn other students.",
    "Therapist: That was brave of you. How does it feel to have taken that step?",
    "Client: It's a mix of emotions. Relief, but also fear. What if Alex retaliates? But mostly... I feel stronger. Like I've taken back some control.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Where are you on the distress scale now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 60. Talking about it... it helps, you know?",
    "Therapist: I'm glad it's helping. Let's take a moment to acknowledge how far you've come.",
    "Client: Yeah... I guess I have come a long way. I'm still scared sometimes, but I'm also proud of myself for getting out of that situation.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You've shown incredible resilience. How are you feeling overall now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. Tired, but in a good way? Like I've processed something important. My anxiety's down to maybe a 40 now.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress, Priya. Is there anything else you want to share about this experience?",
    "Client: I think... I think I've covered the main parts. It's still hard to talk about, but it doesn't overwhelm me like it used to.",
    "Therapist: You've done amazing work today. How about we start wrapping up?",
    "Client: Yeah, that sounds good. I feel... lighter, I guess? Like I've let go of some of the weight I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's often how people feel after processing trauma. You should be proud of yourself. Let's end with some grounding exercises.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you... for listening, for helping me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Priya. You did the hard work here. We'll continue to build on this progress in our future sessions."
