    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is buzzing, you know? My hands are shaky, and I can feel my heart racing. That memory... it felt so real, like I was right back there in that room, trapped and helpless.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how powerless I felt. It's like... even though I know I'm safe here, part of me is still stuck in that moment. I can't shake the feeling that something bad is about to happen. And I'm angry, too. Angry at the person who did this, angry at myself for not being able to stop it.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's hot. Like a fire in my chest. My jaw is clenched, and I want to punch something. But at the same time, I feel this overwhelming sadness. It's like the anger and sadness are fighting inside me, and I don't know which one is going to win.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about that internal conflict?",
    "Client: It's exhausting. I feel drained, like I've run a marathon. And confused. Part of me wants to curl up and cry, while another part wants to scream and break things. I don't know how to reconcile these feelings. It's like I'm at war with myself.",
    "Therapist: How does this compare to how you felt during the actual event?",
    "Client: During the event, I felt... numb. Like I had left my body. But now, it's like all those emotions I couldn't feel then are crashing over me. It's overwhelming. I'm feeling everything at once, and it's so intense. I almost wish I could go back to feeling nothing.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you say that?",
    "Client: Guilt, I guess. I feel guilty for wishing I could be numb again. Like I'm not strong enough to handle these emotions. And I'm scared. What if I can't ever feel normal again? What if I'm always going to be this mess of conflicting emotions?",
    "Therapist: How do those fears impact you?",
    "Client: They make me want to isolate myself. I'm afraid of burdening others with my problems. And... I'm embarrassed. I feel like I should be over this by now. It's been years, but it still feels so fresh. I worry that people will think I'm weak or damaged if they knew how much I'm still struggling.",
    "Therapist: What do you think about that belief?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Part of me knows it's not rational. I wouldn't judge someone else for struggling with trauma. But it's hard to extend that same compassion to myself. I keep thinking that I should be stronger, that I should have moved on by now. But then I remember how intense that memory was during the exposure, and I realize how deep this wound goes.",
    "Therapist: How does acknowledging that depth affect you?",
    "Client: It's... oddly comforting, in a way. Like, maybe it's okay that I'm still struggling because this was a big deal. But it's also scary. I worry that if I really let myself feel the full impact of what happened, I might fall apart completely. And yet, part of me feels... I don't know, maybe hopeful? Like maybe by facing this head-on, I can finally start to heal.",
    "Therapist: What does that hope feel like?",
    "Client: It's... fragile. Like a tiny spark in all this darkness. But it's there. It feels warm, like a small light in my chest. I want to protect it, nurture it. Maybe... maybe this process, as difficult as it is, is actually helping me. I'm terrified, but I also feel like I'm finally facing something I've been running from for years.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. I feel a mix of pride and fear. Pride that I'm finally confronting this, that I'm not running away anymore. But fear of what might come next. It's like I've opened Pandora's box, and I'm not sure I can handle what comes out. But at the same time, there's a sense of... I don't know, maybe relief? Like I've been carrying this heavy secret for so long, and now I'm finally setting it down.",
    "Therapist: What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to feel grounded. Everything feels so intense and overwhelming. I need to remind myself that I'm here, in this room, safe. And... I think I need reassurance. That it's okay to feel all of these conflicting emotions, that it's part of the healing process. And maybe... maybe I need to hear that I'm doing okay, that facing this is brave.",
    "Therapist: You are doing incredibly well. What else?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to be patient with myself. This isn't going to be a quick or easy process, is it? I need to remember that healing takes time, and that it's okay to have setbacks. And maybe... maybe I need to start being kinder to myself. To treat myself with the same compassion I'd offer a friend going through this.",
    "Therapist: How can you practice that self-compassion?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe I could start by acknowledging my feelings without judging them. Like, instead of getting frustrated when I feel anxious or sad, I could just say, \"It's okay to feel this way.\" And maybe I could do some self-care activities, like taking walks or reading books that make me feel good. I think I also need to work on not isolating myself so much. Maybe I could reach out to a friend when I'm struggling, instead of trying to handle everything on my own.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. Emotionally drained. But there's also this strange sense of... I don't know, maybe accomplishment? Like I've done something really difficult but important. I'm still shaky, and part of me is dreading having to do this again. But another part of me feels like I've taken a step forward, even if it's a small one. It's a weird mix of exhaustion and hope.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to work more on grounding techniques. Something to help me when the memories feel overwhelming. And maybe we could talk more about how to manage the anxiety that comes up between sessions? Sometimes I feel like I'm doing okay during our talks, but then I struggle a lot when I'm on my own.",
    "Therapist: That's a great idea. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm pretty wiped out. But... thank you. This was hard, but I think it was important. I'm... I'm glad I'm doing this, even though it's scary.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Take care of yourself.",
