    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. My heart's still racing, and I feel a bit shaky. Remembering that day when I found out about my brother's death... it's like I'm right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: It's like a flood of emotions. Sadness, anger, guilt... They're all mixing together. I can still hear the phone ringing in my head, and my wife's voice telling me the news. I remember feeling like the world had stopped spinning.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you noticing?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, like there's a weight pressing down on it. My hands are clammy, and there's this knot in my stomach. It's strange, but I can even smell the coffee I was drinking when I got the call. It's like all my senses are heightened.",
    "Therapist: How does this compare to when it first happened?",
    "Client: It's... it's not as intense as it was then, but it's close. Back then, I felt like I couldn't breathe. Now, it's more like I'm watching it happen from a distance, but the emotions are still so raw. I keep thinking about all the things left unsaid between us, all the time we lost when he was in that cult.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep wondering if I could have done more to help him. If I had tried harder to reach out, maybe he wouldn't have gotten so deep into that cult. Maybe he'd still be alive. And then I feel angry - at myself, at the cult leaders, even at him for being so gullible. It's a mess of conflicting thoughts.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts and feelings affect you now?",
    "Client: They... they make me hesitant to get close to people. I'm always worried about losing someone else. And I find myself being overly protective of my own kids, almost to the point of smothering them. I know it's not healthy, but I can't seem to shake this fear.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about how you're coping with these memories now?",
    "Client: Well, I... I guess I'm able to talk about it more openly now. Before, I would have shut down completely. And while it still hurts, I can recognize that the pain isn't as all-consuming as it once was. It's like... like I'm starting to see it as a part of my story rather than something that defines me entirely.",
    "Therapist: That's an important observation. How does that feel?",
    "Client: It feels... liberating, in a way. But also a bit scary. It's like I'm letting go of something, and I'm not sure what comes next. There's a part of me that feels guilty for not being as overwhelmed by the grief anymore. Like I'm somehow betraying my brother's memory by moving forward.",
    "Therapist: Can you tell me more about that guilt?",
    "Client: It's... it's like I think I should be perpetually mourning. That if I start to heal or move on, it means I didn't love him enough. Logically, I know that's not true, but emotionally, it's hard to shake. I keep thinking about all the milestones he's missing - my kids growing up, family gatherings. It feels wrong to enjoy these moments without him.",
    "Therapist: How do you think your brother would feel about your healing?",
    "Client: I... I've never really thought about it that way. I suppose... he'd want me to be happy. He was always the one pushing me to live life to the fullest. It's just... it's hard to reconcile that with the way he died, trapped in that cult mentality.",
    "Therapist: What would moving forward look like for you?",
    "Client: I'm not entirely sure. I guess... being able to remember him without this overwhelming sense of loss and guilt. Being able to talk about him and smile at the good memories. Maybe even using my experience to help others who've lost loved ones to cults. But it feels like such a long road ahead.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to consider that possibility?",
    "Client: It's... bittersweet. There's a glimmer of hope there, but also fear. Fear that I might forget him if I'm not constantly grieving. Fear that I might be pulled back into that dark place if I let my guard down. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, purpose maybe? Like maybe something good can come from all this pain.",
    "Therapist: What strengths have you discovered in yourself through this process?",
    "Client: I... I guess I've realized I'm more resilient than I thought. There were days I didn't think I'd survive this grief, but here I am. And I've become more empathetic, I think. I find myself reaching out to others who are struggling, trying to be the support I wish I'd had. It's like... like I'm slowly finding a way to honor my brother's memory by helping others.",
    "Therapist: How does recognizing these strengths impact you?",
    "Client: It's... empowering, in a way. It makes me feel like I'm not just a victim of circumstance, but someone who can grow from this experience. It doesn't erase the pain or the loss, but it gives it meaning. And that... that feels important. Like maybe I can find a way to keep my brother's spirit alive through my actions, rather than just my grief.",
    "Therapist: What's one thing you'd like to focus on moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to work on balancing remembrance with living in the present. Finding a way to honor my brother's memory without letting it overshadow my life now. Maybe... maybe even reaching out to some of his old friends, sharing stories, creating some kind of positive legacy. It's scary to think about, but also... exciting, in a way I haven't felt in a long time.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a meaningful goal. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, honestly. But it's a different kind of tired. Not the heavy, oppressive exhaustion I'm used to, but more... I don't know, like I've done something important. There's still sadness there, and probably always will be, but it feels... manageable. Like I can carry it without being crushed by it. Is that... is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Everyone's experience is unique. What matters is how you feel about your progress.",
    "Client: I suppose you're right. It's just... it's been such a long journey. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever truly be \"okay.\" But moments like this, where I can talk about it without falling apart, they give me hope. It's like... like I'm slowly reclaiming pieces of myself that I thought were lost forever.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What would you like to take away from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I want to remember this feeling. This sense that healing is possible, even if it's slow and painful. And maybe... maybe start thinking about ways to honor my brother that focus on life and growth, rather than just loss. It's scary, but also... exciting. Like I'm standing on the edge of something new, something hopeful.",
    "Therapist: That's a beautiful intention. How would you like to close our session today?",
    "Client: I... I think I'd like to take a moment of silence. To thank my brother, in a way, for the strength I've found through this process. And to acknowledge that while the pain of losing him will always be a part of me, it doesn't have to define me. Is that... is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take that moment now.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I feel lighter somehow. Like I've taken a step forward, even if it's a small one. I know there's still a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I can see a path ahead. It's not clear or straight, but it's there. And that... that means everything.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. We'll continue this journey next week."
