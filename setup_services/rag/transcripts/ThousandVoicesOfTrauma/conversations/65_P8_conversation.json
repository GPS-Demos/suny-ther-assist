    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. My heart's still racing a bit. It felt so real, you know? Like I was right back there in that moment when those guys broke into our house. I can still hear the sound of glass shattering and my mom's scream. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, definitely fear. But also... anger? Yeah, I'm angry. Why did this have to happen to us? We didn't do anything wrong. We were just sleeping in our own home, and suddenly our safety was shattered. It's not fair.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like... a tightness in my chest. My fists are clenched, and I feel this heat rising up my neck. I want to punch something, but I also feel helpless. It's frustrating because I couldn't do anything then, and I can't change what happened now.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how vulnerable we were. How vulnerable I still feel sometimes. What if it happens again? What if next time, someone gets hurt? And then I feel guilty because... because part of me is glad I wasn't the one who confronted them. Is that selfish of me?",
    "Therapist: It's a normal reaction. How does that guilt manifest for you?",
    "Client: It's like this heavy weight in my stomach. I feel like I should have done more, you know? I was the man of the house, but I just froze. I couldn't protect my family. And now, even years later, I still feel like I'm not... not strong enough or brave enough.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your experiences with bullying?",
    "Client: Oh man, I... I hadn't even thought about that. But yeah, it's similar, isn't it? That same feeling of helplessness, of being targeted for no reason. With the bullies at school, I felt like I couldn't fight back. And during the home invasion, it was the same paralysis. It's like... like I'm always the victim, never the hero.",
    "Therapist: What do you mean by \"hero\"?",
    "Client: I guess... someone who takes action, who protects others. In movies, there's always that brave person who saves the day. But in real life, when these things happened to me, I just... shut down. I couldn't move, couldn't think. And now I'm left wondering if I'll ever be able to stand up for myself or others.",
    "Therapist: How does that belief affect your daily life?",
    "Client: It affects everything, honestly. I'm always on edge, always waiting for the next bad thing to happen. I have trouble trusting people because I'm afraid they'll hurt me somehow. And in relationships... well, that's partly why I'm single. I'm afraid I won't be able to protect my partner if something happens. It's easier to just be alone.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to you to feel capable of protecting yourself and others?",
    "Client: It would... it would change everything. I'd feel more confident, more at ease in the world. Maybe I could finally move out of my parents' house, start living my own life. I wouldn't constantly be looking over my shoulder or jumping at every little noise. And maybe... maybe I could start to see myself as someone worthy of love and respect.",
    "Therapist: How do you think you might work towards feeling more capable?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. I guess maybe learning some self-defense could help? Not that I want to fight anyone, but just knowing I could protect myself might make me feel more secure. And maybe... maybe talking about these experiences more, like we're doing now. It's hard, but it also feels like I'm facing my fears instead of running from them.",
    "Therapist: That's a great insight. What else comes to mind?",
    "Client: Well, I've been thinking... maybe I need to redefine what being \"strong\" means. Like, maybe it's not about being fearless or always knowing what to do in a crisis. Maybe it's about facing your fears, admitting when you're struggling, and asking for help when you need it. That's kind of what I'm doing here, right?",
    "Therapist: How does that feel, to think about strength differently?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually kind of liberating. Like a weight lifting off my shoulders. I've been so hard on myself for so long, beating myself up for not being this perfect, fearless person. But maybe I've been stronger than I thought all along. I mean, I survived the bullying, I survived the home invasion, and I'm here now, facing these memories head-on. That takes strength, doesn't it?",
    "Therapist: What do you think?",
    "Client: Yeah, it does. It really does. I'm starting to see that now. It doesn't erase what happened or make it okay, but... but maybe I can start giving myself some credit. Maybe I can start believing that I'm not weak or cowardly, just human. And maybe... maybe that's enough.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, I guess? Still a bit shaky from reliving those memories, but also... hopeful? Like maybe I'm not doomed to always feel this way. There's still a lot to work through, but for the first time in a long time, I feel like maybe I can actually get better. Like maybe I can learn to feel safe and strong, even with everything that's happened.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to explore more about this idea of redefining strength. Maybe look at some specific situations where I felt weak or helpless, and see if we can find the strength in those moments. And maybe... maybe start talking about some practical steps I can take to feel more secure in my daily life. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll pick up there next time. How are you feeling about ending for today?",
    "Client: I'm okay. A bit drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense? Like I've done some hard but important work. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know it's not easy, but... I think it's helping. I'm looking forward to our next session.",
