    "Therapist: Welcome, Aisha. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to do this, but another part is terrified. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably around 60? My hands are a bit shaky.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we're here to process this together. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that night of the home invasion. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I'm in my bedroom. It's late, maybe around 2 AM. I'm studying for my finals, and the house is quiet. Too quiet. I can hear the faint hum of my laptop fan and... and... oh god, there's a sound downstairs.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What's happening now?",
    "Client: My heart... it's starting to race. I'm frozen, listening. There's another noise, like something scraping against a wall. I'm telling myself it's nothing, but deep down, I know something's wrong.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My palms are sweaty. I can feel my heart pounding in my chest. It's hard to breathe.",
    "Therapist: Remember to take deep breaths. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I slowly get up from my desk. My legs feel wobbly. I'm debating whether to investigate or hide. Then I hear it - heavy footsteps on the stairs. Oh god, they're coming up!",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's probably 80. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Keep going. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I'm panicking. I look around my room for something to defend myself with. There's nothing useful. I grab my phone, but my hands are shaking so much I can barely hold it. I'm trying to dial 911, but I keep mistyping.",
    "Therapist: Focus on those sensations in your hands. What else are you aware of?",
    "Client: The footsteps are getting closer. I can hear heavy breathing outside my door. My whole body is trembling. I feel so helpless, so vulnerable. It's like... like during the earthquake, when I couldn't do anything but wait for it to be over.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you survived this. What happens as the intruder approaches?",
    "Client: The doorknob starts to turn. I'm holding my breath, praying they'll go away. But the door opens, and... and... there's a man. He's tall, wearing dark clothes and a mask. I can see his eyes in the dim light from my desk lamp. They look... cold. Ruthless.",
    "Therapist: What do you do in that moment?",
    "Client: I... I scream. It's like all the terror just explodes out of me. I throw my phone at him, but it misses. He's coming towards me, and I'm backing away, but there's nowhere to go. I'm cornered.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe now. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's 95. I can barely breathe.",
    "Therapist: Let's take a moment. Focus on my voice. You're here in the office, not in that room. Can you name three things you see right now?",
    "Client: I... I see the plant in the corner. Your degrees on the wall. And... and the clock.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, when you're ready, let's continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he grabs me. His hands are rough, and I can smell alcohol on his breath. I'm struggling, kicking, trying to break free. But he's so much stronger. I feel so powerless, just like during the tsunami when the water was pulling me under.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with those feelings. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking this is it. I'm going to die. No one's coming to save me. I feel so alone, so scared. It's like the world is collapsing around me, just like when the ground shook during the earthquake.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you survived. You're here now. What happens next?",
    "Client: He's... he's dragging me towards the bed. I'm fighting with everything I have, but it's not enough. Suddenly, there's a loud crash downstairs. He freezes, and I seize the moment. I knee him as hard as I can and break free.",
    "Therapist: Good. You found strength in that moment. What do you do?",
    "Client: I run. I don't even think, I just run. Down the stairs, nearly falling. My heart is pounding so hard I think it might burst. I can hear him behind me, but I don't look back. I'm out the front door, into the street, screaming for help.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's happening around you?",
    "Client: Lights are coming on in the neighboring houses. I hear doors opening. My neighbor, Mr. Johnson, he's running towards me. The intruder... he's gone. I collapse on the sidewalk, sobbing uncontrollably.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe now. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 75 now. My heart is still racing, but I feel... I feel relieved.",
    "Therapist: You did an excellent job. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaky. But also... I don't know, maybe a little proud? I fought back. I got away.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You showed incredible strength. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves. Can you tell me five things you can see in this room?",
    "Client: Yes... I see the plant, your degrees, the clock, the bookshelf, and the window.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, four things you can touch.",
    "Client: The armrest of the chair, my jeans, my necklace, and the tissue box.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Three things you can hear?",
    "Client: The ticking of the clock, traffic outside, and the hum of the air conditioner.",
    "Therapist: Great. Two things you can smell?",
    "Client: Your coffee and the lavender air freshener.",
    "Therapist: And finally, one thing you can taste?",
    "Client: The mint from the gum I was chewing earlier.",
    "Therapist: Well done. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Better. More... here. Present. My SUDS is probably down to about 50 now.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. You did incredibly well today, Aisha. How do you feel about the session?",
    "Client: It was really hard, but... I feel like I faced something I've been avoiding for a long time. It's like... like I'm starting to take back control.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. You showed great courage today. Remember, each time we do this, it gets a little easier. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we end?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm okay for now. Thank you for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone here while I face these memories.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Aisha. I'm here to support you. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later. We'll continue to work through this together. Same time next week?",
    "Client: Yes, I'll be here. Thank you again.",
    "Therapist: Take care, Aisha. You did great work today."
