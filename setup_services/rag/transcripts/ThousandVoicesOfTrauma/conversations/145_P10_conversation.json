    "Therapist: Welcome, Amara. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is terrified. It's like my body knows what's coming and it's already tensing up.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Okay. Yes, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see... I see the compound. It's early morning, the sun's barely up. The air is thick, humid. I can smell damp earth and... and incense. Always that sickly-sweet incense.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm walking to the main hall for morning prayers. My feet are bare, cool on the packed dirt. I can hear chanting in the distance. My stomach is in knots because I... I know what's coming.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 40? It's building.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Keep going. What happens as you approach the hall?",
    "Client: The chanting gets louder. I can see people filing in, all in white robes. I'm... I'm shaking. I don't want to go in, but I have to. If I don't... (voice trembles)",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Amara. Stay with it. What do you see inside?",
    "Client: It's dim, lit only by candles. The air is thick with incense smoke. I see him... the leader. He's at the front, arms raised. His eyes... they're wild, almost glowing in the candlelight. Oh god... (breathing quickens)",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 70. My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: Focus on your breathing. You're doing great. What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he starts speaking. His voice is low at first, but it's building. He's talking about purification, about sacrifice. I know what's coming. I want to run, but I can't move. My feet feel like lead.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What do you see and hear?",
    "Client: He's shouting now. People are swaying, some are crying. Then he points... he points at me. Says I've been chosen. Two men grab my arms. I'm struggling, screaming, but no one helps. They drag me to the front.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now, Amara. Remember, this is a memory. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's 90. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Feel your feet on the floor. You're here, in my office.",
    "Client: (Gasping) Okay... okay. I'm here. I'm safe. (Deep breaths)",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: They... they push me down on my knees in front of him. He has a stick in his hand. Says it's for my own good, to drive out the evil. I'm begging, pleading. But then the first blow comes. It's like fire across my back. I scream, but the chanting drowns it out. Another blow, and another. I can feel my skin breaking. The pain... it's everywhere. I can smell blood. My blood.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well, Amara. Stay with it. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I see faces in the crowd. Some look away, some are crying. But no one stops it. The blows keep coming. I'm not screaming anymore, just whimpering. My vision is blurry. I taste blood in my mouth. I think I've bitten my tongue.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still at 90. My back is burning, even now.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you survived this. You're here now, safe. What happens next?",
    "Client: It stops. Suddenly. I'm on the floor, barely conscious. I hear him say something about being cleansed. People are filing out. No one helps me. I'm just... left there. In pain. Alone.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel angry. And sad. And so, so tired. My distress... it's down to about 60 now.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Can you tell me more about what you're feeling?",
    "Client: I'm angry that no one helped. That they all just watched. I'm sad for that version of me, so scared and alone. And I'm tired... tired of carrying this memory.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. You're processing this trauma. What happened after they left you there?",
    "Client: I... I don't know how long I lay there. Eventually, I managed to crawl to my room. I remember the pain with every movement. I was afraid to go to the infirmary, afraid they'd say I deserved it. So I just... suffered alone.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to talk about this now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. But also... I don't know. Maybe a little freeing? Like I'm finally acknowledging what happened.",
    "Therapist: That's a big step, Amara. How would you rate your distress now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 40. I feel drained, but... okay.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today. How do you feel about ending the session here?",
    "Client: I think... I think that's good. I'm exhausted, but I also feel like I've accomplished something. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You've shown immense courage. We'll work on processing this more in our next session.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I never thought I'd be able to talk about this.",
    "Therapist: You're making great progress. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later. I'm proud of you, Amara.",
    "Client: (Soft smile) Thank you. I'll see you next week."
