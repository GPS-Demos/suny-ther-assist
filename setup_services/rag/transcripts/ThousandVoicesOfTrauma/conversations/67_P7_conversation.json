    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and take a deep breath. When you're ready, describe the combat experience you mentioned.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in Afghanistan. It's hot, dusty. We're on patrol in a small village. The air feels thick with tension. I can hear my heart pounding in my ears.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: We turn a corner, and suddenly there's gunfire. It's coming from everywhere. I see my buddy next to me go down. There's blood... so much blood. I'm frozen for a second, can't move.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can do this. It's too much.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: Okay... I snap out of it and take cover behind a low wall. The gunfire is deafening. I'm returning fire, but I can't see the enemy. My hands are shaking so much I can barely hold my weapon.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I see more of my team getting hit. I want to help them, but I can't move. I'm paralyzed with fear. The smell of gunpowder and blood is overwhelming. I feel like I'm going to throw up.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I hear someone shouting for a medic. It's my best friend. He's been hit badly. I know I need to get to him, but I'm terrified. What if I get shot too? I feel like such a coward.",
    "Therapist: You're not a coward. This is a normal reaction.",
    "Client: I finally gather the courage to run to him. Bullets are whizzing past my head. I reach him, and he's barely conscious. There's so much blood. I'm trying to stop the bleeding, but it won't stop. His eyes are pleading with me to save him.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm calling for help, but no one can reach us. The firefight is too intense. I'm holding him, telling him he'll be okay, but I know he won't be. I can feel him slipping away. I've never felt so helpless in my life.",
    "Therapist: It's painful, but you're doing great. Stay with it.",
    "Client: He takes his last breath in my arms. I can't believe it. I'm crying, screaming for help, but it's too late. The gunfire is still going on around us, but all I can focus on is my friend's lifeless body.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Keep going.",
    "Client: I don't know how long I sat there with him. Eventually, the shooting stops. Our reinforcements arrive, but it's too late for so many. I'm covered in blood and dust. I feel numb, like this isn't real.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Reliving that moment... it's like I'm right back there. My heart is racing, and I feel sick to my stomach. But... I also feel a strange sense of relief. Like I've finally let some of it out.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You've done excellently.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I could talk about this. It's always been locked away. But now that I have... it's still painful, but it feels less overwhelming. Like I can start to process it.",
    "Therapist: You've taken a big step today. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's scary, but I think I need to. I've carried this for so long... maybe it's time to start letting it go. I know it won't be easy, but if it helps me move forward, I'm willing to try.",
    "Therapist: That's a courageous decision. We'll take it step by step.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your guidance through this. It means a lot to have someone listen without judgment. I've always felt so alone with these memories.",
    "Therapist: You're not alone anymore. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: That means more than you know. For the first time in years, I feel a glimmer of hope. Like maybe I can learn to live with this instead of letting it control me.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent perspective. Shall we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that's enough for now. It's been intense, but I'm glad we did this. Thank you for your support.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Take care of yourself this week."
