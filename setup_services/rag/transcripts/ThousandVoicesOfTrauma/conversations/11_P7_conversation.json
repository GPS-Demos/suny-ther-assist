    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the home invasion, starting from the moment you first realized something was wrong?",
    "Client: Okay... I was in my living room, reading a book. It was late evening, around 9 PM. I heard a strange noise coming from the kitchen. At first, I thought it might be the cat, but then I remembered I don't have a cat anymore. My heart started racing...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: I got up slowly, trying not to make any noise. As I approached the kitchen, I heard shuffling sounds. I felt frozen, like I couldn't move. Then I saw a shadow move across the floor. I wanted to scream, but no sound came out.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I felt so helpless. My body was shaking, and I couldn't think straight. I saw a man's figure in the darkness. He was tall, wearing dark clothes. I could smell something unfamiliar - maybe alcohol or cigarettes. I wanted to run, but my legs wouldn't move.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Keep going.",
    "Client: He turned and saw me. His eyes... they were so cold. He started walking towards me, and I finally found my voice. I screamed as loud as I could, hoping the neighbors would hear. But he was faster. He grabbed me, and his hand was over my mouth. I couldn't breathe. I thought I was going to die right there in my own home.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I tried to fight back, but he was so strong. I felt like a child again, helpless and alone. Just like when my parents... (voice breaks) I'm sorry, I can't...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (after a moment) Okay... I managed to bite his hand, and he let go for a second. I ran towards the front door, but I tripped on the rug. I hit my head on the coffee table. Everything was spinning, and I could taste blood in my mouth.",
    "Therapist: You're very courageous. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I crawled towards the door, my vision blurry. I could hear him cursing behind me. I reached for the doorknob, my hands shaking so badly I could barely grip it. Just as I opened the door, I felt his hand on my ankle, pulling me back.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Terrified. My heart is racing just like it did that night. I can almost feel his grip on me. But... I also feel angry. Why did this happen to me? Haven't I been through enough already?",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those feelings. Keep going.",
    "Client: I kicked back as hard as I could and heard him grunt. I scrambled to my feet and ran out the door, screaming for help. I ran to my neighbor's house, pounding on their door. I could hear him behind me, but then there were lights turning on in other houses. He must have gotten scared because I heard footsteps running away.",
    "Therapist: You showed incredible strength. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Drained. Shaky. But also... I don't know, maybe a little proud? I fought back. I survived. I didn't just freeze like I did when I was a child. It's still hard to believe sometimes.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still difficult to talk about, but it feels a little easier each time. I just wish I could feel safe in my own home again.",
    "Therapist: That's a valid concern. We'll work on that.",
    "Client: I've been thinking about getting a security system, but part of me is afraid it'll just remind me of what happened. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: It's a common reaction. We can discuss coping strategies.",
    "Client: I'd like that. Sometimes I feel like I'm making progress, and other times it's like I'm right back in that moment. Will it ever get easier?",
    "Therapist: With time and work, yes. You're doing well.",
    "Client: I hope so. I'm tired of feeling afraid all the time. I want to reclaim my life, you know? But it's hard when every little noise makes me jump.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We'll address those reactions.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm willing to keep trying. It's just... sometimes it feels like too much. Like I'll never be the same person I was before.",
    "Therapist: Change is part of healing. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I suppose you're right. It's just hard to see sometimes. But talking about it like this, even though it's difficult, does help a little. It makes it feel less like this big, scary secret I'm carrying around.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive perspective. Shall we continue?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I can. Where were we? Oh, right. After I got to my neighbor's house...",
    "Therapist: Take your time. You're doing great."
