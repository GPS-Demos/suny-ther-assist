    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's always intense to go back there, you know? My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel a little lightheaded. But, um, I think I managed to stay more present this time compared to our previous sessions.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What stood out to you this time?",
    "Client: Well, I noticed that I could recall more details about the moments right before the crash. The way the plane suddenly dropped, the overhead bins flying open, and the oxygen masks deploying... It's all so vivid now. I remember feeling this overwhelming sense of panic, thinking, \"This is it. We're not going to make it.\" But what really struck me was how quickly everything happened. It felt like an eternity in the moment, but looking back, it was probably just a matter of seconds.",
    "Therapist: How did revisiting those memories feel today?",
    "Client: It was... difficult, but different. I felt the fear and anxiety creeping up, but I was able to remind myself that I was safe here in your office. I used those grounding techniques we practiced, focusing on my breathing and the feeling of the chair beneath me. It helped me stay more connected to the present, even as I was recalling those terrifying moments.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent use of your coping skills. How does this compare to your day-to-day experiences?",
    "Client: You know, it's interesting. I've noticed that I'm starting to feel a bit more in control when I encounter triggers in my daily life. Like the other day, I heard a loud noise that sounded like an engine, and usually that would send me into a full-blown panic attack. But this time, I was able to use some of the breathing exercises we've practiced. It didn't completely eliminate my anxiety, but I felt like I could manage it better.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. What do you make of these changes?",
    "Client: I guess... I'm starting to believe that maybe I can handle these memories and feelings. It's like, by facing them head-on in our sessions, they're losing some of their power over me. Don't get me wrong, it's still scary and uncomfortable, but I'm beginning to see a light at the end of the tunnel, if that makes sense?",
    "Therapist: It absolutely does. How does this progress align with your goals?",
    "Client: Well, my main goal has always been to feel 'normal' again, to not let this experience control my life. And I think I'm starting to see glimpses of that. I'm not there yet, but these small victories, like being able to use coping skills in real-life situations, they give me hope. I want to be able to fly again someday, to not let this fear dictate where I can and can't go.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's been most helpful in this process?",
    "Client: I think... facing the memories directly has been crucial. As terrifying as it is, there's something empowering about not running away from it anymore. And having a safe space to process everything afterwards, like we're doing now, helps me make sense of it all. The coping strategies have been lifesavers too. They make me feel like I have tools to deal with the anxiety when it comes up.",
    "Therapist: Excellent insights. How can we build on this moving forward?",
    "Client: I want to keep pushing myself, both in our sessions and in my daily life. Maybe we could work on some of the more challenging aspects of the memory that I've been avoiding? And I'd like to try exposing myself to more airplane-related stimuli outside of our sessions. I'm nervous about it, but I think I'm ready to take that next step.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a solid plan. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I might actually get through this. It's scary and exhausting, but also kind of exciting to feel like I'm making progress. I'm grateful for your guidance through all of this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work. How would you like to end today's session?",
    "Client: I think I'd like to do a quick grounding exercise if that's okay. Just to help me transition back into the rest of my day. And maybe we could recap the main things we want to focus on for next time?"
