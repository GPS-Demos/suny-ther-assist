    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart is still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. That memory of the hostage situation... it's so vivid, you know? I could almost smell the dust and sweat in the air again.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out most to you this time?",
    "Client: The silence. It's weird, but in between the shouting and chaos, there were these moments of complete silence. And those were almost scarier, you know? Like, the anticipation of what might happen next was unbearable. I kept thinking about my family back home, wondering if I'd ever see them again.",
    "Therapist: How did reliving that feel different today?",
    "Client: It's... it's still hard, but I noticed I could breathe through it better this time. I used that grounding technique we practiced, focusing on the chair beneath me. It helped me stay present, even when the memories felt overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How does this connect to your day-to-day experiences?",
    "Client: I think... I'm starting to see how my hypervigilance ties into those moments of silence I mentioned. Like, even now, in safe situations, I'm always on edge, waiting for the other shoe to drop. It's exhausting, but I'm beginning to recognize the pattern.",
    "Therapist: Insightful observation. What else?",
    "Client: Well, I've noticed I'm less reactive to sudden noises lately. Remember how I used to jump at every little sound? It's getting better. I mean, I still feel tense sometimes, but I'm not immediately thrown into panic mode like before.",
    "Therapist: That's significant improvement. How do you feel about your progress?",
    "Client: It's... encouraging, I guess? But also frustrating. Like, I'm proud of how far I've come, but there's still so much work to do. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel truly \"normal\" again.",
    "Therapist: Normal can mean different things. What would \"normal\" look like for you?",
    "Client: Hm... I suppose it would mean feeling safe in my own skin again. Being able to enjoy time with my family without constantly scanning for threats. Maybe even sleeping through the night without nightmares. Just... peace, I guess.",
    "Therapist: Those are great goals. How might today's session contribute to that?",
    "Client: I think... maybe by facing these memories head-on, I'm taking away some of their power? It's like, the more I confront them, the less control they have over me. It's tough, but I can see how it might lead to that sense of peace eventually.",
    "Therapist: Excellent insight. What's your takeaway from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. And that even though this process is painful, it's worth it. I'm not just a victim of my past anymore; I'm actively working to reclaim my life. That feels... empowering, in a way.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How will you carry this forward?",
    "Client: I want to keep practicing those grounding techniques, maybe try using them in everyday situations when I feel anxious. And... I think I might try talking to my partner more about my experiences. They've been so supportive, and I feel ready to open up a bit more.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a solid plan. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. This isn't easy, but I feel like I'm finally making progress. It's like I can see a light at the end of the tunnel, even if it's still far away. I'm... I'm grateful for this process, as difficult as it is.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work. We'll continue next week?",
    "Client: Definitely. I'll be here."
