    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mrs. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. It's like I'm right back there, you know? The earthquake... it's so vivid in my mind. I can still hear the rumbling, feel the ground shaking beneath my feet. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: My heart is racing, and I feel this tightness in my chest. It's like... like I can't catch my breath. I keep seeing flashes of buildings crumbling, people screaming. And there's this... this intense feeling of helplessness washing over me. I couldn't do anything to stop it, to help anyone. I just... I just stood there, frozen.",
    "Therapist: How does that helplessness feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a weight pressing down on me. My shoulders feel heavy, and my stomach is in knots. I feel small, insignificant. Like nothing I do matters in the face of such destruction. And there's this... this guilt. Why did I survive when others didn't? I keep thinking about the families that were torn apart, homes destroyed. It's... it's just too much sometimes.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why couldn't I do more?\" And then I feel angry at myself for being so useless. But then... then I remember how terrified I was. I couldn't even move. And that makes me feel weak, you know? Like I should have been stronger. I wonder if... if I'll ever feel safe again. Every little tremor, every loud noise... it all takes me right back there.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when it first happened?",
    "Client: They're... they're not as intense as they were right after it happened. Back then, I could barely function. I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat. Everything felt... dangerous. Now, it's more... it's more like a constant unease. Like I'm always waiting for the next disaster to strike. But... but I guess I can manage day-to-day life better now. It's just... it's exhausting, always being on edge like this.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your ability to sit with these feelings now?",
    "Client: I... I suppose it's a bit easier now. I mean, I'm still shaken, but... but I'm here, talking about it. That's something, right? Before, I couldn't even think about it without having a full-blown panic attack. Now, it's... it's uncomfortable, but I can breathe through it. I'm noticing that... that the feelings come in waves. They're intense, but then they subside a bit.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a bit encouraging. I mean, it's still hard, but... but maybe I'm stronger than I thought. Maybe I am making progress, even if it doesn't always feel like it. It's like... like I'm slowly regaining some control. Not over what happened, but... but over how I respond to it. That feels... that feels good, in a way.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm noticing that... that as we talk, my body is starting to relax a bit. The tightness in my chest is easing up. And I'm... I'm remembering some of the good things too. The way people came together after the disaster, helping each other. It doesn't erase the trauma, but... but it reminds me that there's still good in the world. That even in the darkest moments, there's hope.",
    "Therapist: How does remembering that affect you?",
    "Client: It... it gives me a sense of warmth, almost. Like a small light in the darkness. It doesn't take away the pain or the fear, but... but it makes it feel less overwhelming. I remember the kindness of strangers, the resilience of my community. It makes me feel... connected, I guess. Less alone in this. And it... it makes me want to be part of that goodness, you know? To help others the way people helped us.",
    "Therapist: What does that desire mean to you?",
    "Client: It means... it means that maybe I can turn this awful experience into something meaningful. That I'm not just a victim, but... but a survivor who can make a difference. It's like... like finding a purpose in the pain, if that makes sense. I want to be there for others who've been through similar traumas. To show them that... that it's possible to keep going, to find strength even when everything feels hopeless.",
    "Therapist: How does this shift your perspective?",
    "Client: It's... it's like seeing a new path forward. I've been so focused on the pain and the fear, but... but maybe there's more to my story. Maybe I can use my experience to help others, to make a positive impact. It doesn't erase what happened, but... but it gives it a new meaning. I feel... I feel a glimmer of hope. Like maybe, just maybe, I can grow from this instead of being defined by it.",
    "Therapist: What's that hope feel like?",
    "Client: It feels... it feels like a warm, gentle light inside me. Like a deep breath after being underwater for so long. It's not... it's not erasing the pain or the fear, but it's... it's giving me strength to face them. I feel... I feel more grounded, more connected to myself and to the world around me. It's like... like I'm starting to see beyond the trauma, to imagine a future where I'm not just surviving, but... but thriving, in a way.",
    "Therapist: How might you carry this feeling forward?",
    "Client: I think... I think I want to start small. Maybe... maybe reach out to local support groups for disaster survivors. Share my story, listen to others. And... and maybe look into volunteering with disaster relief organizations. I can't stop earthquakes from happening, but... but maybe I can help people rebuild, both physically and emotionally. It's scary to think about putting myself out there, but... but it also feels right, you know? Like this is how I take my power back.",
    "Therapist: What does taking your power back mean to you?",
    "Client: Taking my power back... it means not letting the trauma control every aspect of my life anymore. It's... it's about making conscious choices to move forward, to help others, to find meaning. It doesn't mean forgetting or pretending it didn't happen. It's more like... like integrating the experience into who I am now, and choosing how it shapes me. It's scary, but... but also empowering. Like I'm writing my own story instead of just being a character in it.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about our session today?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've done some hard but important work. I came in feeling overwhelmed by the memories, but now... now I feel like I've gained some perspective. It's still painful, still scary, but... but I also feel a sense of accomplishment. Like I've faced something difficult and come out the other side. And I feel... I feel grateful, for this space to process everything. It's not easy, but... but I think it's helping me heal.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. We'll continue next week.",
    "Client: Thank you, doctor. I... I'm looking forward to it. It's tough, but... but I think I'm starting to see a way forward. See you next week."
