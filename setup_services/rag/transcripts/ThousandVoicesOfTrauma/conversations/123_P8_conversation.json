    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, John?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart's still racing, and I feel... shaky. That memory of being bullied at work, it just... it brought everything back so vividly.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: It's like I'm right back there, you know? I can feel the knot in my stomach, the tightness in my chest. I keep hearing their laughter, those cruel jokes about my age. God, I was so humiliated.",
    "Therapist: You're describing intense physical sensations. Can you tell me more about that?",
    "Client: Yeah, it's... it's like my body's on high alert. My palms are sweaty, and I feel this tension in my shoulders. It's hard to sit still. I keep wanting to look over my shoulder, like I'm expecting someone to sneak up on me.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking about how powerless I felt. How I should've stood up for myself, but I just... froze. And then I think about how it affected my work, my confidence. I started doubting myself, you know? Wondering if maybe they were right, if I was too old, too slow.",
    "Therapist: How does reflecting on that make you feel now?",
    "Client: It makes me angry. Not just at them, but at myself. I'm frustrated that I let it affect me so much. I mean, I'm 71 now, and it still haunts me. I... I think that's part of why I turned to drinking back then. It was easier than facing those feelings.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. How does your body feel as you express that anger?",
    "Client: It's... it's strange. I feel this heat rising in my chest, but also... a kind of release? Like some of the tension is easing. I didn't realize how much I'd been holding onto.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm remembering other things too. Not just the bad stuff, but... the people who supported me. My late wife, she was always there for me. And I... I did eventually report the bullying. It took a lot of courage, but I did it.",
    "Therapist: How does remembering that make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's bittersweet. I'm proud of myself for speaking up, but I wish I'd done it sooner. And thinking about my wife... it makes me miss her, but also grateful for the support she gave me.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you reflect on that support?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much I've isolated myself since she passed. I've been so focused on the pain of the past that I... I've been pushing people away. Maybe... maybe it's time I started reaching out again.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea sit with you?",
    "Client: It's scary, to be honest. But also... hopeful? I'm tired of feeling alone, of letting the past control me. I want to feel connected again, to feel... worthy of connection.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like an important realization. What do you think might be a first step?",
    "Client: I... I think maybe I could start small. There's a community center near me that offers activities for seniors. I've always been curious about their art classes. Maybe... maybe I could check that out?",
    "Therapist: How does thinking about that possibility make you feel?",
    "Client: Nervous, definitely. But also... excited? It's been a long time since I've felt excited about something new. It's... it's nice.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, somehow. Like I've put down a heavy load I didn't even realize I was carrying. I'm exhausted, but it's a good kind of exhausted, you know? Like I've done something important.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing your experience, John. How would you like to close our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to sit with this feeling for a moment. To really let it sink in that I've taken a step forward. And maybe... maybe make a plan for checking out that community center this week. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take a moment to do that."
