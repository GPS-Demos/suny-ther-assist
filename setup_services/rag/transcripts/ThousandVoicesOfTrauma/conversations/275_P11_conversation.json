    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, John?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's always tough to go back there, you know? Reliving that earthquake... the chaos, the fear. It's like I can still feel the ground trembling beneath my feet. And then, with everything that's been happening lately with police brutality... it just adds another layer of anxiety. It's like I can't escape the feeling of being unsafe, whether it's from nature or from people who are supposed to protect us.",
    "Therapist: That sounds overwhelming. What stood out most to you today?",
    "Client: The sounds, I think. The rumbling of the earth, people screaming, buildings cracking... And then my mind kept shifting to the sounds of protests, police sirens. It's like my brain is mixing these traumatic experiences together. I found myself thinking, \"Where can I go to be safe?\" It's exhausting, always feeling on edge.",
    "Therapist: How did your body react during the exposure?",
    "Client: My heart was racing, palms sweating. I felt this tightness in my chest, like I couldn't breathe properly. It's funny, I'm sitting here in a safe office, but my body reacts like I'm right back in that moment of danger. And even now, talking about it, I can feel some of those sensations creeping back.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. How do you feel you handled it today?",
    "Client: I... I think I did okay. Better than last time, maybe? I managed to stay with the memory longer without trying to push it away. But it's still so hard. There's this part of me that wants to run from these feelings, to just forget it all happened. But I know that's not the answer. I'm trying to remind myself that facing this is part of healing.",
    "Therapist: You're showing real courage. How does this connect to your daily life?",
    "Client: It's everywhere, really. I'm constantly on alert, checking for exits in buildings, flinching at loud noises. And now, with all the news about police brutality, I find myself being extra cautious around law enforcement, even though I've never had a direct negative experience. It's like my brain is taking all these threats and lumping them together. I worry about my kids, about my wife... about whether I can keep them safe in a world that feels so unpredictable.",
    "Therapist: That's a heavy burden. What helps you cope?",
    "Client: Talking here helps, honestly. And... I've been trying those grounding techniques you taught me. Sometimes when I feel overwhelmed, I'll focus on naming things I can see, touch, hear. It doesn't always work, but when it does, it's like... it's like I can breathe again. And my wife, she's been incredibly supportive. Just having someone who understands and doesn't judge when I'm having a tough day... it means everything.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. What's one thing you've learned about yourself through this process?",
    "Client: I think... I'm stronger than I realized. There are days when I didn't think I could face these memories, but I did. And each time, it gets a little easier. Don't get me wrong, it's still incredibly difficult, but I'm starting to believe that maybe, just maybe, I can get through this. That these experiences don't have to define the rest of my life.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you want to use that moving forward?",
    "Client: I want to keep pushing, you know? Keep facing these memories, keep working on managing my reactions. I want to be able to take my kids to crowded places without constantly being on edge. I want to be able to watch the news without spiraling into anxiety. I know it's a long road, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I might actually get there. And that... that gives me hope.",
    "Therapist: Your progress is commendable. What's your focus for this week?",
    "Client: I think I want to try using those grounding techniques more consistently. Maybe set reminders on my phone to check in with myself throughout the day. And... I've been thinking about talking to my older son about some of what I'm going through. Not everything, but... I think it might help him understand why Dad's been a bit on edge lately. Is that... do you think that's a good idea?",
    "Therapist: It could be beneficial. Let's discuss how to approach that conversation.",
    "Client: Yeah, I'd appreciate that. I want to be honest with him, but I don't want to burden him, you know? He's only 12, and I don't want him to start worrying about earthquakes or feeling unsafe around police. But at the same time, I think he's noticed that something's up with me, and I don't want him to think it's his fault or anything. It's a tricky balance.",
    "Therapist: That's thoughtful. How do you envision the conversation?",
    "Client: I'm thinking of keeping it simple. Maybe explain that Dad went through some scary stuff and sometimes it makes me worried or jumpy. I could tell him about the therapy, how I'm working on feeling better. And most importantly, I want him to know it's not his job to fix me or worry about me. I just want him to understand and feel like he can talk to me if he has any questions or concerns. Does that sound okay?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great approach. Anything else you want to discuss today?",
    "Client: I think that covers the main things. I just... I want to say thank you. I know I still have a long way to go, but I feel like I'm finally making progress. There are moments now where I can imagine a future where I'm not controlled by this fear and anxiety. And that... that means everything to me. I'm grateful for your guidance through all of this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work, John. I'm here to support you. See you next week?",
    "Client: Absolutely. Thank you again. See you next week."
