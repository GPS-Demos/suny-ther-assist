    "Therapist: Welcome, Priya. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit anxious, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about some heavy stuff today.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Just give me a moment to take a deep breath.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. When you're ready, close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in my parents' house. It's late afternoon, and I can hear my mom in the kitchen. The smell of spices is in the air... probably dinner. I'm sitting on the couch, scrolling through my phone, trying to distract myself. My boyfriend, Raj, is supposed to come over soon. I'm... I'm dreading it.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, maybe a 4? I'm feeling tense, but it's manageable.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what happens next.",
    "Client: I hear a car pull up outside. My heart starts racing a bit. I know it's Raj. He... he always drives too fast, and I can hear the tires screeching a little as he parks. The front door opens, and I can hear him talking to my dad. They're laughing about something... cricket, probably.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm conflicted. Part of me is relieved that he seems to be in a good mood, but another part is... scared? No, anxious. Yeah, anxious. Because I never know when his mood might change.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: Raj comes into the living room. He's smiling, but there's something... off about it. His eyes are a bit too wide, his movements a bit too jerky. I know he's been drinking. Not enough to be obviously drunk, but enough to make him unpredictable. He sits next to me on the couch, puts his arm around me. It feels heavy, like a trap.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's going up. Maybe a 6?",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Right, okay... He leans in close, whispers in my ear, \"Why haven't you been answering my texts?\" His breath smells like beer. I try to lean away, but his arm tightens around me. I stammer something about being busy with coursework, but he's not listening. He grabs my phone from my hand, starts scrolling through it. I feel... I feel so violated, but I don't say anything. I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Priya. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: My mom calls from the kitchen, asking if Raj is staying for dinner. He answers for me, saying yes, of course. His voice is all charm and politeness. I feel sick to my stomach. The contrast between how he acts with my family and how he is with me when we're alone... it's jarring. I want to scream, to tell them what he's really like, but I can't. I'm so ashamed.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Focus on your breathing. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... okay. I'm... I'm still there, on the couch. Raj is flipping through channels on the TV like nothing's wrong. But his other hand is on my thigh, gripping too tight. I know there'll be bruises later. I want to get up, to leave, but I'm terrified of making a scene. What if my parents blame me? What if they don't believe me?",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Priya. This is just a memory.",
    "Client: Right... right. Um, dinner gets called. We go to the table. Everything looks normal on the surface. We're eating, talking about mundane things. But under the table, Raj's foot is pressing down on mine. Hard. A warning. I barely taste the food. I'm just trying to get through the meal without breaking down.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm angry. So angry. At Raj, at myself for not speaking up, at my parents for not noticing. My SUDS is probably a 9 now. I want to scream, to flip the table, to do something!",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel angry. Let yourself experience that emotion.",
    "Client: After dinner, Raj says he has to leave. He kisses me goodbye, all gentle and loving in front of my parents. But his eyes... they're cold. He whispers, \"We'll talk later,\" and I know it's a threat. As soon as he's gone, I rush to my room and lock the door. I curl up on my bed and just... sob. I feel so alone, so trapped.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well, Priya. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8? I can feel my heart pounding, even now.",
    "Therapist: Take a few deep breaths. Remember, you're here in the present, safe in this room.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... I'm calming down a bit. In the memory, I'm still on my bed. My phone keeps buzzing with texts from Raj. I don't look at them. I know they'll be a mix of apologies and accusations. I feel so conflicted. Part of me wants to forgive him, to believe it'll be different next time. But another part knows it won't be. I'm scared of what he might do if I try to leave him.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I... I remember looking at myself in the mirror. There are no visible marks, but I feel... broken. Like there's a weight crushing me. I think about all the times at uni when people have asked if I'm okay, and I've lied. Said everything's fine. I wonder what would happen if I told the truth. Would anyone believe me? Would they blame me for staying with him?",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7? I feel drained, but also... I don't know. There's a spark of something. Anger, maybe? Or determination?",
    "Therapist: That's good, Priya. Let's start to bring you back to the present.",
    "Client: Okay... As I'm coming back, I'm realizing something. This... this isn't okay. What Raj is doing, how he's making me feel... it's not right. I deserve better. I'm scared, but... but I think I need to do something about this.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. But also kind of... relieved? Like saying it out loud, even just in my head, has lifted some of the weight. My SUDS is probably down to a 5 now.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today, Priya. This was a challenging session, but you showed great courage.",
    "Client: Thank you. It... it wasn't easy. But I think it was important. I've been avoiding thinking about this for so long, but now... now I can't ignore it anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. We'll work together on what comes next. For now, let's focus on grounding you back in the present.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm... I'm here. In your office. It's... it's over.",
    "Therapist: Yes, you're safe here. Take a moment to look around, notice five things you can see.",
    "Client: I see... your bookshelf. The plant in the corner. My bag on the floor. The clock on the wall. And... and the box of tissues on the table.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, four things you can touch.",
    "Client: The softness of this chair. My hair against my neck. The smoothness of my watch. And... the roughness of my jeans.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Three things you can hear?",
    "Client: I hear... the ticking of the clock. Traffic outside. And... my own breathing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Two things you can smell?",
    "Client: I smell... your air freshener, I think it's lavender. And... my perfume on my wrist.",
    "Therapist: Perfect. Lastly, one thing you can taste?",
    "Client: I can taste... the mint from the water you gave me earlier.",
    "Therapist: Well done, Priya. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. Tired, but... more present. More... here.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to a 3 now. I feel... drained, but also... I don't know. Like something's shifted.",
    "Therapist: That's normal after a session like this. We've made important progress today. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we end?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm good for now. This was a lot to process. But... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Priya. Remember, the strength to get through this came from you. We'll continue to work on this in our next session. For now, be kind to yourself. You've done difficult, important work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I'll try to remember that.",
    "Therapist: Good. Take care, Priya. I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: See you next week. Thank you again."
