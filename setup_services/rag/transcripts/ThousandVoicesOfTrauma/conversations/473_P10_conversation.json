    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm honestly a bit on edge. I know we're going to dive into some heavy stuff today, and part of me wants to just bolt out of here. But I also know this is important. It's just... it's a lot, you know?",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's start with a SUDS rating. Where are you now?",
    "Client: Uh, probably around a 5 or 6. My stomach's in knots.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess so. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes. Take us to that day.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Alright. I'm... I'm in the school hallway. It's loud, kids everywhere. I can smell the musty lockers and someone's tuna sandwich. My backpack feels heavy on my shoulders. I'm walking to class, trying not to make eye contact with anyone.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear them before I see them. Jake and his friends. They're laughing, but it's not a friendly sound. My heart starts racing. I want to turn around, but I can't. I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Panic. Pure panic. My palms are sweating, and I can feel my shirt sticking to my back. I'm desperately looking for a teacher, anyone who might help.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe a 7?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Exhales slowly) Jake shoves me into the lockers. The metal is cold against my face. He's saying something, but I can barely hear it over the blood rushing in my ears. Then... then I see movement out of the corner of my eye.",
    "Therapist: What do you see?",
    "Client: It's... oh god. It's two other kids fighting. One of them slams the other into a water fountain. There's blood. So much blood. Everyone's screaming now.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. You're observing, but you're safe.",
    "Client: I can't... I can't breathe. The hallway feels like it's closing in. Jake and his friends are laughing, pointing at the fight. I'm pressed against the lockers, trying to become invisible.",
    "Therapist: Focus on your breathing. In and out. What's happening around you?",
    "Client: Teachers are running towards the fight. Kids are scattering. I'm still frozen. I can hear the kid who got hurt crying. It's a horrible sound, like a wounded animal.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. Maybe an 8 or 9. My chest hurts.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're here, in my office. You're safe.",
    "Client: (Nods, breathing heavily) Jake turns back to me. He's grinning, like he's enjoying all this chaos. He says, \"See that? That could be you.\" I feel sick. I want to run, but my legs won't move.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in that moment?",
    "Client: That I'm weak. That I'm a coward for not helping that kid. That maybe Jake's right, maybe I deserve this.",
    "Therapist: Those are the thoughts you had then. Are they true?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. No, I guess not. But it felt so real then.",
    "Therapist: Continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: The principal's voice comes over the PA system. Everyone needs to get to class immediately. Jake gives me one last shove and walks away. I'm left there, shaking, trying not to throw up.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Drained. Angry. Ashamed. It's like I'm right back there, you know? I can still smell the blood.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's coming down a bit. Maybe a 6 now.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're processing this. What do you do after Jake leaves?",
    "Client: I... I slide down to the floor. My legs give out. I'm sitting there, watching as they take the injured kid away on a stretcher. There's blood on the floor. Someone's trying to clean it up, but it's spreading.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that image. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Helpless. So damn helpless. And scared. What if Jake does that to me next time? What if no one helps me either?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid fears. How does your body feel?",
    "Client: Tense. My shoulders are up to my ears. My stomach's in knots. I feel like I might be sick.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Ground yourself.",
    "Client: (Inhales deeply) Okay. I'm... I'm still in the hallway. A teacher finally notices me. She helps me up, asks if I'm okay. I can't speak. I just nod.",
    "Therapist: What happens then?",
    "Client: She walks me to class. I'm late, but she explains to my teacher. Everyone's staring at me. I feel so exposed, like they can all see right through me.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Small. Insignificant. Like I don't matter. God, I hated feeling like that.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hovering around a 5. It's not as intense, but it's still there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: I sit at my desk, but I can't focus. The rest of the day is a blur. I keep replaying everything in my head. The sound of the kid hitting the water fountain. Jake's threat. The blood on the floor.",
    "Therapist: What do you wish you had done differently?",
    "Client: I wish... I wish I had been braver. Stood up to Jake. Helped that other kid. But I was so scared.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. You were a child in a dangerous situation.",
    "Client: I know that now, but... it still haunts me, you know? I still feel like a coward sometimes.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are valid. How does recounting this affect you now?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. But also, I feel like I'm seeing it from a different perspective. Like, I can see how young and vulnerable I was.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent insight. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 4 now. I feel... drained, but also somewhat relieved.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. How do you feel about ending the exposure here?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think that's good. It's a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: Indeed. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we wrap up.",
    "Client: (Breathes deeply) Okay. I'm... I'm back in the present. In your office. It feels... safer.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. You've shown great courage today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted, honestly. But also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I faced something I've been running from for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. We'll continue to work through this. You did well today, John.",
    "Client: Thanks. It wasn't easy, but... I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: We'll end here for today. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later.",
    "Client: I will. Thanks, doc. Same time next week?",
    "Therapist: Yes, see you then. Take care, John."
