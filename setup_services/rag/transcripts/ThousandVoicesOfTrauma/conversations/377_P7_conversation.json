    "Therapist: Welcome back. Are you ready to continue our imaginal exposure work today?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay. I'll try my best. So, I'm back in that room where we were held hostage. The air feels so thick and stuffy. I can hear muffled voices outside, but I can't make out what they're saying. My heart is racing, and I'm trying to stay as still as possible.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: There's a man pacing back and forth near the door. He's holding a gun, and every time he moves, I flinch. I'm sitting on the floor, my back against the wall. My legs are starting to cramp, but I'm too scared to move. I keep thinking about my family, wondering if I'll ever see them again.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: It's so hard. I feel like I can't breathe. The fear is overwhelming. I want to cry, but I'm afraid any noise will make the man angry. I'm trying to make myself as small as possible, hoping he won't notice me. But then he looks at me, and I freeze. His eyes are so cold...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I can't... I don't want to remember his eyes. They were so empty, like there was no humanity left in him. It reminds me of how my parents used to look at me when I was a child - like I didn't matter, like I was nothing. I feel so small and helpless, just like back then.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I'm shaking now. In the hostage situation and in this memory. I feel like that scared child again, wanting someone to notice me, to help me. But no one ever did. In that room, I was surrounded by people, but I felt so alone. Just like when I was growing up. No one saw me, no one cared.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: The man with the gun starts yelling at someone. I can't understand what he's saying, but his voice is so angry. It reminds me of my father's voice when he would come home drunk. I want to cover my ears, but I'm too afraid to move. I'm just sitting there, feeling like I might disappear at any moment.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with it.",
    "Client: Hours pass, or maybe it's just minutes. Time feels distorted. My body aches from sitting in the same position for so long. I'm so thirsty, but I'm too scared to ask for water. I keep thinking about all the times I was ignored as a child, how I learned to stay quiet and not ask for anything. And now, in this hostage situation, those same instincts are keeping me alive.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. Continue.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud noise outside. The man with the gun looks panicked. He starts shouting at us, telling us to get up. My legs are numb, and I stumble as I try to stand. He points the gun at me, and for a moment, I think this is it. This is how I die. But then there's more commotion, and police burst into the room. It's over so quickly, but I feel like I'm moving in slow motion.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Reliving that moment is exhausting. But there's also a sense of relief, like I've let go of something I've been holding onto for so long. It's strange, but talking about the hostage situation has made me realize how much it connects to my childhood experiences of neglect. I never saw that connection before.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. Well done today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was hard, but I think it's helping. Can we talk more about this connection in our next session?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll explore that further next time."
