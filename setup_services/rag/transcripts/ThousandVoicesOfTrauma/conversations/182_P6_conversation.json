    "Therapist: Welcome back. Today we'll focus on the hostage situation you experienced. Are you ready to begin the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Let's start with your SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 4 right now. Just thinking about it makes my stomach tighten a bit.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and describe the scene as vividly as you can.",
    "Client: I'm at the bank. It's a busy day, and I'm waiting in line. Suddenly, there's shouting. A man with a gun bursts in, waving it around. People start screaming. I... I freeze. My heart is pounding so hard I can hear it in my ears.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 6. I can feel my palms getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Keep going.",
    "Client: The gunman is yelling at everyone to get down. I drop to the floor, my legs feel weak. The cold tile against my cheek... I can smell the cleaning products they use. Someone near me is crying softly. I want to comfort them, but I'm too scared to move.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My SUDS is probably an 8. I feel like I can't breathe properly. It's like there's a weight on my chest.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: The police arrive. There's a standoff. Hours pass. My legs are cramping from staying still so long. I keep thinking about my family, wondering if I'll see them again. The gunman is getting more agitated. He starts picking people at random, threatening them. I... I think he's going to choose me next.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel dizzy, like I might pass out. My heart is racing so fast.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you survived this. You're here now, safe.",
    "Client: Right. Okay. Um... suddenly, there's a loud bang. The SWAT team bursts in. Everything happens so fast. People are screaming, running. I can't move. Someone grabs me, pulls me up. It's an officer. They're leading me out, but my legs won't work properly. I stumble...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I think my SUDS is coming down a bit. Maybe a 7? I still feel shaky, but knowing it's over... it helps.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this well. What happened after you got out?",
    "Client: They took us to a nearby building. Gave us blankets, water. I remember feeling so cold, even though it was summer. A paramedic checked me over. I couldn't stop shaking. All I wanted was to see my family.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5, I think. I feel drained, but also... relieved? Like I've let something go.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. How are you feeling physically?",

    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Let's end the exposure here. How do you feel overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... okay. Better than I expected, actually. It was hard, but... I did it.",
    "Therapist: Yes, you did. I'm proud of you. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves before we wrap up."
