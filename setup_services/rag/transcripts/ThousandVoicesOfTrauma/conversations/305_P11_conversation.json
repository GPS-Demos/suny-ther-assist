    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. Reliving that moment in the hospital, when the doctor told me about my diagnosis... it's like I was right back there, you know? I could almost smell the antiseptic and hear the beeping of the machines. My heart's still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The fear. It was so... paralyzing. I remember thinking, \"This can't be happening to me.\" I'm only 50, I have so much left to do. And then I thought about my studies, my future... everything just seemed to crumble in that moment. It's like I could see my whole life changing before my eyes.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to revisit that memory now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. But, um, maybe not as overwhelming as I expected? I mean, I'm here, I'm safe. I'm not in that hospital room anymore. It's strange, but I feel like I can look at it a bit more objectively now. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I... I realize how much that moment has affected me. Like, even now, I get so anxious about any health issue. And I've been pushing people away, afraid to get close because... what if it happens again, you know? But going through it again, I can see that I survived. I'm still here.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How might this relate to your recovery?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe I don't have to be so afraid all the time? I mean, I know my health is still a concern, but perhaps I don't need to let it control every aspect of my life. I've been using substances to numb myself, to escape these memories, but... maybe I can face them instead?",
    "Therapist: That's a great observation. What else?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much I've isolated myself. I left my husband to live alone, thinking it would be easier. But reliving that memory, I remember how much I wanted someone there with me. Maybe... maybe it's time to let people in again?",
    "Therapist: How does that idea feel to you?",
    "Client: Scary, but... good? I miss connection. I miss feeling like I have a future to look forward to. Going back to school was a step, but I've been so focused on just getting through each day. Maybe I can start thinking about what I want my life to look like beyond just surviving.",
    "Therapist: That's a big step. What might help you move in that direction?",
    "Client: I think... maybe talking to my husband? And perhaps reaching out to some friends I've lost touch with. Oh, and definitely continuing with therapy and working on my substance use. I can see now how much I've been using it as a crutch.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like great goals. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... hopeful? Like maybe there's a way forward that I couldn't see before. It's still scary, and I know I have a lot of work to do, but... I feel like I can breathe a little easier.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful progress. What's one small step you can take this week?",
    "Client: I think... I'll call my husband. Just to talk, no pressure. And maybe look into some support groups for people who've gone through similar health scares. I don't want to feel so alone anymore.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How do you feel about continuing these exposures?",
    "Client: It's tough, but... I can see the value now. I want to keep going. I want to reclaim my life from this fear. It won't be easy, but I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. We'll continue next session. Well done today."
