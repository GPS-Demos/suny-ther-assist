    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. Today we'll start imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm honestly quite nervous about it. I've heard about exposure therapy, but I'm not entirely sure what to expect. The idea of revisiting my trauma... it's scary. I've been trying so hard to push those memories away, you know? The thought of deliberately bringing them up makes my stomach churn.",
    "Therapist: Your nervousness is understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried that reliving the experience might be too overwhelming. What if I can't handle it? Or what if it makes things worse instead of better? I've been struggling with nightmares and flashbacks already, and I'm scared this might intensify them. Plus, I'm not sure I can talk about it without completely breaking down.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. Let's address them together. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: I guess my main question is, how exactly does this help? I mean, I understand the concept of facing fears, but how does deliberately revisiting traumatic memories actually improve things? And what happens if I start panicking during the session? Will you be able to help me calm down?",
    "Therapist: Great questions. Exposure helps by processing memories safely. We'll go at your pace and I'll support you throughout.",
    "Client: Okay, that makes sense. I appreciate that we'll go at my pace. It's just... the idea of voluntarily thinking about my illness, about all those scary moments in the hospital, it's daunting. I've spent so much energy trying to avoid those thoughts. But I trust you, and if you think this will help, I'm willing to try. Can you tell me a bit more about what I might experience during the session?",
    "Therapist: You may feel strong emotions or physical sensations. This is normal. We'll work through them together.",
    "Client: I see. I'm glad you'll be there to help me through it. I'm still nervous, but knowing what to expect helps. I suppose it's natural to feel some anxiety about this. Do you think it will get easier with time? And how many sessions of this do you think we'll need to do?",
    "Therapist: It often gets easier with practice. The number of sessions varies, but we'll assess progress regularly.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I'm trying to remind myself that this is a process and it won't all happen at once. I'm committed to getting better, even if it's challenging. I just hope I can be brave enough to face these memories. Is there anything I can do to prepare myself for our next session?",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is admirable. For preparation, practice self-care and remember our coping strategies.",
    "Client: Thank you, that's helpful advice. I'll make sure to use those relaxation techniques we've been working on. I'm still nervous, but I feel more prepared now. I appreciate your patience in explaining all of this to me. It means a lot to have your support through this process.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. Remember, we're in this together. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm ready. I'm scared, but I know this is important for my recovery. Thank you for guiding me through this. Let's do it."
