    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's like I'm right back there, you know? The memory of that police brutality incident... it's so vivid. I can still hear the shouting, the sirens. My heart's racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What physical sensations are you noticing?",
    "Client: My hands are trembling slightly. There's this tightness in my chest, like I can't get a full breath. And I feel... hot. Like my face is flushed. It's as if my body's reliving that moment of fear and helplessness.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"Why didn't I do something?\" I was just frozen, watching it happen. And then there's this voice saying, \"You're weak. You should have intervened.\" It's... it's overwhelming. I feel guilty, angry at myself, and scared all at once.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts and feelings compare to when the incident first happened?",
    "Client: They're... they're intense, but not as paralyzing as before. Back then, I couldn't even talk about it without breaking down. Now, it's still painful, but I can... I can put it into words. It's like I'm observing the memory from a slight distance, if that makes sense?",
    "Therapist: That's an interesting observation. Can you tell me more about that distance?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... I'm remembering the event, but I'm also aware that I'm here, in this room, safe. Before, the memory would completely consume me. Now, there's a part of me that knows it's in the past. It's still upsetting, but I feel... I don't know, maybe a bit more in control?",
    "Therapist: How does this sense of control feel to you?",
    "Client: It's... it's new. And a bit strange, to be honest. I've spent so long feeling powerless about this. To feel like I have even a little bit of control... it's both scary and empowering. Like, maybe I can actually work through this, you know?",
    "Therapist: What do you make of that possibility?",
    "Client: I... I want to believe in it. Part of me is hopeful, thinking maybe I can move past this. But there's also this fear. What if I can't? What if I'm stuck with these feelings forever? It's like I'm standing on the edge of something, and I'm not sure if I should step forward or back.",
    "Therapist: Mm. How does your body feel as you consider these options?",
    "Client: I notice my breathing has slowed down a bit. The tightness in my chest is still there, but it's not as constricting. My hands... they've stopped shaking. It's like my body is telling me it's okay to take that step forward, even if my mind is still uncertain.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are coming up for you now?",
    "Client: It's a mix. There's still fear and anger, but also... a glimmer of hope? And sadness, definitely sadness. I'm mourning for the person I was before this happened, for the sense of safety I lost. But there's also this tiny spark of determination. Like maybe, just maybe, I can reclaim some of what I've lost.",
    "Therapist: How does acknowledging these emotions feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a bit of a relief. For so long, I've tried to push these feelings away. Naming them, it's like... it's like I'm finally facing them head-on. It's scary, but also... liberating? Like I'm not running anymore.",
    "Therapist: What do you think this means for your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I think... I think it means I'm making progress, even if it doesn't always feel like it. It's like I'm slowly peeling back layers of this trauma. Each layer hurts, but underneath, there's a bit more of myself that I'm rediscovering. It's painful, but also... necessary, I suppose.",
    "Therapist: How does this realization sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... it's a lot to take in. Part of me feels proud that I've come this far. Another part is terrified of what other emotions and memories might surface. But overall, I feel... I feel like I'm on the right path. It's not easy, but it feels right, you know?",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to explore more about this sense of control we talked about. Maybe look at ways I can apply it in my daily life? And... and maybe delve deeper into that incident. I feel like there's more there that I need to process.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling as we wrap up today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but in a good way? Like I've done some hard work. There's still a lot of emotions swirling around, but I feel... I feel a bit lighter. Like I've set down a small piece of the burden I've been carrying. It's a small step, but it feels significant.",
