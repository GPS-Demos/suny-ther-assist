    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Can you describe the medical trauma you experienced?",
    "Client: Okay, I'll try. It was about two years ago. I was at the hospital for a routine check-up, but something went wrong. I remember lying on the examination table, and suddenly, I couldn't breathe. The doctor looked panicked, which made me even more scared. I felt like I was drowning, gasping for air. The room started to spin, and I could hear people shouting, but it all seemed far away. I thought I was going to die right there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: Everything happened so fast. Nurses rushed in, and they were speaking rapidly in English. I couldn't understand everything they were saying, and it made me feel even more isolated and terrified. I remember thinking about my parents, how they were waiting outside and had no idea what was happening. The doctor was inserting something into my throat, and I felt this intense pressure and pain. I wanted to scream, but I couldn't make a sound.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: It's hard to describe the fear I felt. It was like being trapped in my own body, unable to communicate or breathe. I could see the fear in the medical staff's eyes, which only intensified my panic. I remember thinking about all the things I hadn't done in my life, all the regrets. It was like my whole life was flashing before my eyes. The pain in my chest was unbearable, and I was convinced I was having a heart attack.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: As they were working on me, I caught a glimpse of my reflection in a nearby monitor. I looked pale, almost lifeless. It was surreal, like I was watching it happen to someone else. I could hear the beeping of machines getting faster and louder. Then, I heard someone mention something about my race, asking if certain medications might affect me differently because I'm Latino. It felt like they were experimenting on me, not treating me as a person but as a case study. That made me feel even more vulnerable and scared.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Eventually, they managed to stabilize me. I found out later that I had an severe allergic reaction to a contrast dye they used. But the fear didn't go away when I could breathe again. I felt violated, helpless, and angry. Angry at the doctors for not being prepared, angry at myself for not knowing about the allergy, angry at the system that made me feel like my ethnicity was a complication rather than just part of who I am. Since then, I've been terrified of hospitals and doctors. I avoid check-ups, which I know is dangerous, but I can't shake the fear that it might happen again.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Talking about it makes my heart race. I can feel my palms getting sweaty, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's like I'm back there, feeling helpless and scared. But at the same time, there's a part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe a little relieved? Like finally letting out a breath I've been holding for two years. It's overwhelming, but I think I needed to face this memory head-on.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard, but I want to get better. I don't want to live in fear anymore. I know rationally that what happened was a rare occurrence, but emotionally, it's like I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop. And the racial aspect of it... it's opened my eyes to how differently people of color can be treated in healthcare settings. It's not just about the medical trauma anymore; it's also about feeling like I have to be extra vigilant because of who I am.",
    "Therapist: Your awareness is a strength. Keep going.",
    "Client: I think that's why I've been struggling so much with going back to any medical facility. It's not just the fear of another medical emergency; it's the fear of being seen as different, of not receiving the same level of care or understanding. I worry that if something goes wrong again, my background might be seen as a complication rather than just a part of my identity. It's exhausting, always feeling like I have to be my own advocate in a system that should be there to help everyone equally.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great insight. How else has this affected you?",
    "Client: It's affected every aspect of my life. My work has suffered because I'm always on edge, expecting something to go wrong. I've pushed away friends and potential partners because I'm afraid of them seeing me as weak or damaged. And living with my parents again... it's comforting in some ways, but it also makes me feel like I've regressed, like I'm not the successful professional I worked so hard to become. I'm constantly torn between wanting their support and feeling ashamed that I need it. This experience has shaken my confidence in ways I never expected.",
    "Therapist: Your honesty is commendable. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I really want to move past this, to reclaim my life. I miss the person I used to be - confident, independent, unafraid. But I also know that person didn't understand the complexities of what it means to be a Latin American in the healthcare system. It's like I'm trying to find a new version of myself that incorporates this traumatic experience and the awareness it's brought, without being defined by it. It's a difficult balance to strike.",
    "Therapist: That's a profound realization. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I think that's what scares me the most about this whole process. I know I need to face these fears to overcome them, but I'm afraid of what I might discover about myself in the process. Will I ever feel truly safe again? Can I learn to trust doctors and the medical system? And how do I reconcile my identity with the treatment I received? These are the questions that keep me up at night, that make me hesitant to fully engage in this therapy sometimes. But I'm here, and I'm trying, because I know I can't keep living like this.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is admirable. Shall we continue?"
