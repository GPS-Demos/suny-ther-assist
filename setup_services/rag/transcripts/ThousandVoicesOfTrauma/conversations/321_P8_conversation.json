    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I'm right back there, you know? I can still hear the wind howling outside, the trees creaking... it's so vivid. I keep seeing the water rising, inching closer to our front door. I feel... helpless, I guess. Just like I did then.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... what if it happens again? What if next time, we're not so lucky? I know it's been years since that hurricane, but every time there's a storm, I feel this... this dread in the pit of my stomach. It's like I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop. And then with this recent break-in... it's just... it's too much. I don't feel safe anywhere anymore.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does your body feel as you're talking about this?",
    "Client: Tense. Very tense. My shoulders are all bunched up, and I've got this knot in my stomach. It's hard to take a deep breath. I... I didn't even realize how tight I was holding myself until you asked. It's like my body's getting ready to run or fight, even though there's nothing to run from right now.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are you experiencing?",
    "Client: Fear, definitely. A lot of fear. But also... anger? Yeah, I'm angry. Angry that this happened to us, angry that I can't seem to get past it. And there's this... overwhelming sadness too. We lost so much in that flood - photos, heirlooms, things that can't be replaced. Sometimes I feel guilty for being so upset about material things when we made it out alive, but... those things were our history, you know?",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when the event was actually happening?",
    "Client: During the hurricane, it was pure terror. I didn't have time to feel anything else. But now... now it's more complex. The fear is still there, but it's mixed with all these other emotions. It's like... like I'm grieving. Not just for what we lost, but for the sense of security I used to have. I used to feel safe in our home, in our neighborhood. Now, between the hurricane and the break-in, I'm always on edge.",
    "Therapist: Mm. What's the hardest part for you right now?",
    "Client: The hardest part... I think it's the feeling of vulnerability. I've always prided myself on being strong, on being able to handle whatever life throws at me. But these experiences... they've shaken that confidence. I feel exposed, like at any moment something terrible could happen and I won't be able to protect myself or my family. It's... it's exhausting, living like this.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with these feelings day-to-day?",
    "Client: I try to stay busy. I volunteer at the community center, I spend time with my grandkids. But it's always there, you know? This undercurrent of anxiety. I check the locks constantly, I'm always watching the weather. My poor husband... he's so patient, but I know it's hard on him too. Sometimes I feel like I'm not the same person I used to be, and that scares me more than anything.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about how you're feeling now compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: You know, I... I actually feel a bit lighter. Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also a relief. Like I'm not carrying this burden all by myself anymore. My breathing's a bit easier, I think. The knot in my stomach is still there, but it's not as tight. It's strange... reliving these memories is painful, but there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe control? Like by facing it head-on, I'm taking some of its power away.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful observation. How does that feel?",
    "Client: It feels... hopeful, I suppose. Like maybe I'm not doomed to feel this way forever. Don't get me wrong, I'm still scared. The idea of going through another imaginal exposure makes me nervous. But there's a part of me that's... curious? Maybe even a little excited to see what else I might discover about myself through this process. Is that strange?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to dive deeper into the home invasion. We've talked a lot about the hurricane, but the break-in is more recent and in some ways, it feels more... personal? Like nature is one thing, but knowing someone deliberately violated our home... that's brought up a whole different set of fears and anxieties. If that's okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll explore that next time. How are you feeling about ending for today?",
    "Client: I'm okay. A bit drained, if I'm honest, but in a good way? Like after a good cry or a hard workout. I appreciate your patience with me, Dr. Thompson. This isn't easy, but... I think it's helping. Thank you.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Mrs. Johnson. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
