    "Therapist: Welcome, James. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a lot on my mind. With everything going on in the news lately about police brutality, it's been bringing up some difficult memories.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0-100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 40. I'm tense, but I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm walking home from work. It's late, maybe 9 PM. The streetlights are on, casting long shadows. I can hear traffic in the distance, but this side street is quiet. I'm... I'm thinking about dinner, what I'll make when I get home. Then I hear footsteps behind me, fast. Before I can turn, someone grabs my arm. It's... it's a police officer.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you see, hear, feel?",
    "Client: His grip is tight. I can feel the rough fabric of his uniform against my skin. He's shouting something, but I can't make it out at first. My heart is racing. I try to turn, to explain, but he pushes me against a wall. The bricks are cold and rough against my cheek. I can smell his aftershave, something sharp and chemical.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: He's... he's patting me down, roughly. I try to speak, to ask what's happening, but he tells me to shut up. His voice is angry, aggressive. I can feel panic rising in my chest. I'm thinking about my wife, wondering if I'll make it home. The officer is saying something about a suspect description, but I know I haven't done anything wrong.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My muscles are tense, especially in my shoulders and back. I'm breathing fast, almost hyperventilating. I can feel sweat forming on my forehead and under my arms. My mouth is dry. I... I want to run, but I'm frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 70.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... The officer spins me around. His face is close to mine, and I can see the anger in his eyes. He's white, probably in his 40s, with a crew cut. He's shouting about resisting arrest, but I haven't moved. I try to explain, to show my ID, but he grabs my wrist when I reach for my pocket. The pain is sharp, sudden. I gasp, and he takes that as defiance. Before I can blink, I'm on the ground. The pavement is rough against my cheek, and I can taste blood in my mouth.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: I... I can't breathe. His knee is on my back, pressing down hard. I'm trying to stay calm, to explain, but words won't come. All I can manage are gasps and pleas. \"Please,\" I say, \"I can't breathe.\" But he doesn't listen. I hear the click of handcuffs, feel the cold metal bite into my wrists. The world is spinning. I'm thinking about my son, how I promised to help with his homework. Will I see him again? The fear is overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 85. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Remember, you're safe here. Let's continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in the back of the police car now. The seat is hard plastic, uncomfortable. My wrists are aching from the handcuffs. I can hear radio chatter, but it's all a blur. We're driving, and I'm trying to recognize the streets, to figure out where we're going. But my vision is blurry with tears. I'm thinking about my job, my family. Will they fire me? What will my wife think? The shame and fear are crushing.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The car stops. We're at the station. The officer roughly pulls me out of the car. I stumble, my legs weak. Inside, the fluorescent lights are harsh. The smell of disinfectant is strong. Other officers are staring, some with curiosity, others with indifference. I'm led to a holding cell. The door clangs shut behind me, and the sound echoes in my head. I sit on the cold metal bench, my head in my hands. The reality of the situation hits me hard. I start to sob, quietly at first, then uncontrollably.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I... I feel overwhelmed. My chest is tight. It's like I'm back there again.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here in the present. Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's at 90. This is really intense.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Let's continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in the cell for what feels like hours. My mind is racing, replaying the events over and over. I'm angry, scared, confused. Finally, another officer comes. He's older, calmer. He starts asking questions, and I explain what happened. I can see the doubt in his eyes at first, but as I talk, something changes. He listens, really listens. After a while, he leaves and comes back with my personal belongings. There's been a mistake, he says. The description was wrong. I'm free to go.",
    "Therapist: How does that moment feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of relief and rage. My hands are shaking as I collect my things. The older officer apologizes, but it feels hollow. As I walk out of the station, the cool night air hits me, and I take a deep breath. But I don't feel free. I feel violated, humiliated. The walk home is a blur. When I get there, my wife is frantic. She's been calling everywhere. When she sees me, she bursts into tears. I hold her, but I feel numb. I can't bring myself to tell her what happened, not yet. I just say I got held up at work. But inside, I'm screaming.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well. Let's take a moment. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I'm drained. Reliving that... it's exhausting. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe relief? Like I've finally let some of it out.",
    "Therapist: That's very common. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 60. Still high, but not as intense as before.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that difficult experience. You showed great courage. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay... yeah, that sounds good. I... I appreciate you listening. It's the first time I've really talked about it in detail.",
    "Therapist: You did exceptionally well. How about we practice some deep breathing exercises?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I could use that right now.",
    "Therapist: Alright, let's begin. Inhale slowly through your nose..."
