    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is spinning. The memory feels so vivid now, like I'm right back there in the moment. I can still hear the wind howling and feel the panic rising in my chest. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's like this cold knot in my stomach. I keep thinking about how helpless I felt during the hurricane, trapped in my apartment with the water rising. And then... then my mind jumps to other times I've felt trapped and scared, and it all just mixes together.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. Can you tell me more about that mixture of feelings?",
    "Client: It's like... the fear from the hurricane is amplifying memories of the abuse. I remember feeling so small and powerless then, just like I did when the storm hit. There's this voice in my head saying, \"You can't protect yourself. You're weak.\" And I know it's not true, but in the moment, it feels so real.",
    "Therapist: I hear you. What do you notice in your body as you're talking about this?",
    "Client: My heart is racing, and my hands are shaky. I feel tense all over, like I'm bracing for impact. There's this tightness in my chest, making it hard to breathe deeply. It's like my body is stuck in that moment of panic.",
    "Therapist: And as you notice these sensations, what thoughts are coming up?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why can't I just get over this?\" Part of me feels angry at myself for still being affected by these memories. But there's also this small voice reminding me that I survived, that I'm stronger than I think. It's confusing, like I'm at war with myself.",
    "Therapist: That internal conflict sounds challenging. How does it feel to share these thoughts?",
    "Client: It's... oddly relieving, actually. Like I'm finally letting out something I've been holding in for so long. But it's also scary, you know? Admitting these feelings makes them feel more real somehow. I'm worried that if I let myself really feel all of this, I might fall apart.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to you if you did \"fall apart\"?",
    "Client: I guess... I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to put myself back together. That I'd be overwhelmed by all these emotions and memories and just... lose control. But talking about it now, I'm realizing that maybe that's not giving myself enough credit. I've been through so much already, and I'm still here, still fighting.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... comforting, in a way. Like maybe I don't have to be so afraid of my own feelings. But it's also daunting. If I accept that I'm strong enough to face this, then I have to actually do the work, you know? No more hiding or pretending I'm fine when I'm not.",
    "Therapist: And how do you feel about that prospect?",
    "Client: Nervous, but... hopeful, I think. For the first time in a while, I feel like maybe there's a light at the end of this tunnel. Like maybe I can learn to live with these memories without them controlling me. It's scary, but also exciting in a way.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant shift. What do you think has led to this change?",
    "Client: I think... it's partly just being here, talking about it openly. For so long, I've kept all of this bottled up inside, afraid to even look at it. But facing it head-on in these sessions, it's like... I'm starting to see myself as a survivor rather than a victim. And that feels powerful.",
    "Therapist: That's a profound insight. How might this new perspective influence your daily life?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I'll be a little kinder to myself when I have bad days. Instead of getting frustrated or trying to push the feelings away, I could try to acknowledge them and remember that they're part of my journey. And maybe I'll feel more confident in other areas of my life too, knowing that I'm tackling something this big.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like positive changes. Is there anything else you'd like to explore about today's experience?",
    "Client: I think... I'm just feeling grateful right now. For this space to process everything, for the support. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm finally moving forward instead of being stuck. And that's... that's really something.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. How would you like to close our session today?",
    "Client: I think I'd like to take a moment to just breathe and ground myself. Maybe remind myself that I'm safe here and now, and that I have the strength to keep working through this. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's do that together."
