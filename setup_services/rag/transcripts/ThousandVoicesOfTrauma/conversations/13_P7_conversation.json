    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Singh. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about my illness again, and it's not easy.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's just... every time I think about being in that hospital bed, my heart starts racing.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Okay... I remember the day I was admitted. The pain in my chest was unbearable. I thought I was having a heart attack. Everything happened so fast. The ambulance, the sirens, the rush into the emergency room... It was all a blur.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that memory. You're safe now.",
    "Client: The doctors were shouting orders, nurses were rushing around. I felt so helpless, like I was watching everything happen to me from outside my body. They hooked me up to so many machines, the beeping was constant. I... I was terrified.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I remember thinking about my life, all the things I hadn't done. I was alone, no family there. The doctor came in and told me I had a severe infection that had spread to my bloodstream. They said... they said I might not make it through the night.",
    "Therapist: That must have been terrifying. You're very brave for sharing this.",
    "Client: It was. I've never felt so scared and alone. The night was the worst. The pain, the fever, the constant checks by the nurses. I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about my life, my regrets. I wished I had reconnected with my estranged son. I... I didn't want to die alone.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel emotional. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I'm sorry. It's just so vivid. I can almost smell the antiseptic, feel the cold hospital sheets. The next few days were a blur of tests, medications, and fear. Every time a doctor came in, I thought they were going to tell me it was over.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: After a week, they told me I was improving. But I still felt so weak, so vulnerable. I had never felt my mortality so acutely before. It changed me. I started thinking about all the time I'd wasted, the relationships I'd neglected. The loneliness in that hospital room was overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Keep going.",
    "Client: When I was finally discharged, I felt like a different person. The world seemed both more precious and more frightening. I was afraid of getting sick again, of being alone. That's when... that's when I started drinking more. I thought it would help me forget, help me sleep without nightmares about being back in that hospital bed.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained, but also a bit lighter. Talking about it is hard, but I know it's necessary. I just wish I could shake this fear of getting sick again, of ending up back in that hospital.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable courage today. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I hope so. I don't want to live in fear anymore. I want to make amends, maybe even reach out to my son. But it's so hard to take that first step.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive goal. We'll take it one step at a time.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. This process is difficult, but I'm starting to see why it's important. I just hope I can keep facing these memories without falling apart.",
    "Therapist: You're stronger than you realize. We'll end here for today.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you for your support. I'll try to carry this strength with me until our next session.",
    "Therapist: Take care, Mr. Singh. See you next week."
