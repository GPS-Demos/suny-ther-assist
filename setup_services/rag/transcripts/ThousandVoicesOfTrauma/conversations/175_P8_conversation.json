    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. The memory of the airplane crash... it's so vivid. I can still hear the screeching of metal, feel the violent shaking. My heart's pounding just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's like I'm right back there, you know? I can feel this tightness in my chest, and my palms are sweaty. It's... it's overwhelming. I keep thinking about how close I came to dying. How fragile life is.",
    "Therapist: I hear you. Where in your body do you feel that fear most strongly?",
    "Client: It's... it's in my chest. Like a heavy weight pressing down on me. And my stomach feels like it's in knots. I'm also feeling really jittery, like I need to move or do something. It's hard to sit still.",
    "Therapist: How do these physical sensations compare to what you felt during the actual event?",
    "Client: They're... they're similar, but not as intense. During the crash, it was like my whole body was on fire with adrenaline. Now, it's more like... like echoes of that feeling. Still uncomfortable, but I know I'm safe here. It's just... hard to shake off.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind as you sit with these feelings?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"Why me?\" Why did I survive when others didn't? There's this guilt, you know? And then I feel angry at myself for feeling guilty. I should be grateful I'm alive, right? But then I remember the faces of the people who didn't make it, and... it's just a mess of emotions.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have conflicting emotions. How do you make sense of them?",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can make sense of them. It's like a storm inside me. One moment I'm relieved to be alive, the next I'm terrified it could happen again. Then I feel guilty for being afraid when I should be living life to the fullest. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: How does reliving this memory impact your day-to-day life?",
    "Client: It's... it's always there, in the background. Sometimes I'll hear a loud noise and I'm right back in that moment. I've been avoiding flying, obviously. But it's more than that. I find myself hesitating to make plans for the future, like... like I'm waiting for something bad to happen. It's affecting my relationship too. My partner doesn't really understand why I can't just \"get over it.\"",
    "Therapist: That sounds challenging. What helps you cope with these feelings?",
    "Client: Honestly? Sometimes I turn to alcohol. I know it's not healthy, but it numbs the fear, you know? Other times, I try to distract myself with work or exercise. But it's like... it's always there, waiting for a quiet moment to resurface.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about using those coping mechanisms?",
    "Client: I... I'm not proud of it. Especially the drinking. I know it's a problem, but it feels like the only thing that gives me a break from the constant anxiety. The work and exercise, those are better, I guess. But even then, it feels like I'm just running away from my feelings instead of dealing with them.",
    "Therapist: What would dealing with them look like to you?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. I guess being able to think about the crash without feeling like I'm going to fall apart. Being able to fly again someday. Not feeling guilty for surviving. Just... being able to live my life without this constant shadow hanging over me.",
    "Therapist: Those are important goals. How do you think this therapy is helping towards that?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. Really hard. Reliving the memory is painful, but... I think it's helping. It's like... each time we do this, it gets a tiny bit easier to face. The fear is still there, but it's not as overwhelming. And talking about it... it helps me make sense of my thoughts and feelings. I just... I want to feel normal again, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a common desire. What does \"normal\" mean to you?",
    "Client: Normal... I guess it means not being afraid all the time. Being able to enjoy life without constantly looking over my shoulder. Being able to make plans for the future without this nagging fear that it could all be taken away in an instant. And... and being able to honor the memory of those who didn't survive without feeling crushed by guilt. Just... living, I suppose. Really living, not just surviving.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful vision. How do you feel about working towards that?",
    "Client: It's... it's scary, to be honest. But also... hopeful? Like, for the first time since the crash, I can see a path forward. It's not going to be easy, I know that. But being able to talk about it like this, to face the memory... it makes me think that maybe, just maybe, I can get through this. That I can honor the lives lost by living my own life fully. It's terrifying, but... also exciting, in a way. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What's your next step?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to be more open with my partner about what I'm going through. And maybe... maybe look into some support groups for survivors of similar experiences. And definitely work on finding healthier ways to cope than drinking. It's going to be tough, but... I think I'm ready to try. This therapy, as hard as it is, is showing me that I can face these memories and come out the other side. It's not easy, but... it's worth it. I want my life back.",
    "Therapist: That's a great plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. Emotionally drained. But also... lighter? Like I've set down a heavy burden, even if just for a moment. There's still fear and sadness, but also a glimmer of hope. It's a strange mix, but... it feels like progress. For the first time in a long while, I feel like I might actually be okay someday. Not today, not tomorrow, but... someday. And that's... that's something to hold onto.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. Shall we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. This was intense, but... valuable. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know we have more work to do, but I'm feeling... cautiously optimistic. Is it okay if we take a moment before I leave? Just to... ground myself a bit?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take all the time you need."
