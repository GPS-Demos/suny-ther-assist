    "Therapist: Welcome, James. How are you feeling about our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: Uh, to be honest, I'm a bit on edge. This whole thing about revisiting the cyber bullying... it's not exactly something I'm looking forward to, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to help you process this. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I guess so. Yeah, let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What's happening?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm sitting in my dorm room. It's late, maybe around midnight. I'm scrolling through my social media, and suddenly I see this post. It's... it's a picture of me from a party last weekend. But it's been edited, you know? They've put some really nasty text over it, calling me names, saying I'm a... (voice breaks) saying I'm a loser who doesn't belong here.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... God, I feel sick to my stomach. My heart's racing. I can't believe someone would do this. I'm trying to figure out who posted it, but it's from an anonymous account.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'd say... maybe an 80? It's pretty intense.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I start reading the comments. People are laughing, adding their own insults. Someone I thought was my friend is in there too, agreeing with them. I feel so betrayed, so alone. My hands are shaking as I scroll through it all.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay present in that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... why me? What did I do to deserve this? I start doubting myself, wondering if maybe they're right. Maybe I don't belong here. Maybe I am just a... (pauses, takes a shaky breath) just a loser from Africa who should go back home.",
    "Therapist: I hear the pain in your voice. Remember, you're safe now. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's up there. Maybe 90 now.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. Ground yourself in the present. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I shut my laptop. I can't look at it anymore. But I can't stop thinking about it either. I'm pacing around my room, feeling trapped. I want to call my mom, but it's the middle of the night back home. I feel so alone, man.",
    "Therapist: You're not alone now. I'm here with you. What physical sensations are you experiencing?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. It's hard to breathe. My hands are clammy, and I feel hot all over. I'm... I'm starting to cry, but I'm trying to be quiet so my roommate doesn't hear me.",
    "Therapist: Allow yourself to feel those emotions. They're valid. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... maybe I should just drop out. Go back home. I don't fit in here. Everyone probably thinks I'm a joke. God, I miss my family. I miss my little brother who passed away last year. He would've known what to say to make me feel better.",
    "Therapist: I can hear how overwhelming this is. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still pretty high. Maybe 85?",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, James. Stay with it. What happens as the night goes on?",
    "Client: I can't sleep. I keep checking my phone, seeing more and more comments. Each one feels like a punch to the gut. I'm worried about going to class tomorrow, facing everyone. What if they're all laughing at me behind my back?",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly stressful. What do you do to cope with these feelings?",
    "Client: I... I try to distract myself. I put on some music from back home, but it just makes me more homesick. I end up just lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, feeling like my whole world is falling apart.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. How are you feeling right now, in this moment?",
    "Client: It's... it's tough, man. My heart's still racing a bit. But I guess... I guess I feel a little better talking about it?",
    "Therapist: That's good. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: Maybe down to a 75? It's still there, but not as intense.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. Let's continue. What happens the next morning?",
    "Client: I... I don't want to get out of bed. I feel sick, like I might throw up. My roommate asks if I'm okay, but I just mumble something and pretend to be asleep. I'm dreading going to class, facing everyone.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What do you decide to do?",
    "Client: I... I force myself to get up. My legs feel shaky as I get dressed. I keep my head down as I walk to class, afraid to make eye contact with anyone. I feel like everyone's staring at me, judging me.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to be in class?",
    "Client: It's... it's awful. I can't concentrate. I keep thinking I hear people whispering, laughing. My professor asks me a question and I... I freeze up. Can't even speak. I feel so stupid, so exposed.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's back up. Maybe 85 again.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here. What happens after class?",
    "Client: I... I practically run back to my dorm. I skip my other classes. I can't face anyone else. I check my phone and there are more comments, more posts. It's like it's never-ending. I feel so... so powerless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, James. How are you coping with these feelings?",
    "Client: I... I don't know how to cope. I feel lost. I end up just lying in bed, wishing I could disappear. I think about my little brother again, how he always knew how to make me laugh. God, I miss him so much.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to miss him. How does thinking about your brother make you feel in this moment?",
    "Client: It's... it's bittersweet, you know? I feel sad, but also... I don't know, a little stronger? Like, he wouldn't want me to give up.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful thought. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down a bit. Maybe 70?",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I decide to reach out to my RA. I'm scared, but I know I need help. My hands are shaking as I knock on his door. When he answers, I just... I just break down crying.",
    "Therapist: That took a lot of courage. How does your RA respond?",
    "Client: He's... he's actually really supportive. He listens, doesn't judge me. He tells me about resources on campus, like counseling services. For the first time since this all started, I feel like maybe... maybe I'm not alone.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant moment. How does it make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a relief, you know? Like a weight's been lifted. I'm still scared, still hurt, but I feel like maybe I can get through this.",
    "Therapist: You're showing real strength. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's lower. Maybe 60? I still feel anxious, but not as overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. Let's continue. What steps do you take next?",
    "Client: I... I decide to take my RA's advice. I make an appointment with the campus counseling center. I'm nervous, but I know I need help. I also... I also decide to call my mom. It's hard, but I tell her what's been going on.",
    "Therapist: How does your mom react?",
    "Client: She's... she's upset that I'm hurting, but she's so supportive. She tells me how proud she is of me for seeking help. She reminds me of how strong I am, how I've already overcome so much. It... it makes me cry, but in a good way, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a powerful conversation. How do you feel after talking to her?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel loved. Supported. Still scared about everything, but like... like I have a foundation to stand on. Like maybe I can face this.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant shift. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to maybe a 50? Still there, but not consuming me like before.",
    "Therapist: You've made great progress, James. How are you feeling about the memory now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still painful. But I feel like I can look at it without being overwhelmed. Like... like it's a part of my story, but it doesn't define me.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Let's start wrapping up. Take a few deep breaths.",
    "Client: (Takes deep breaths) Okay... I'm feeling a bit more grounded now.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today, James. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired, emotionally drained. But also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I've faced this thing and I'm still here.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant achievement. Any final thoughts before we end?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. I know it's not over, but I feel like I can handle it better now.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable courage and resilience. We'll continue to work through this together."
