    "Therapist: Good morning, Mr. Johnson. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Morning, doc. I'm... I'm not sure how to feel, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is scared to death. My hands are already shaking a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to help you process this at your own pace. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Let's... let's give it a shot.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see the warehouse. It's dark, musty. The air feels heavy, like it's pressing down on me. I can smell motor oil and something... something rotten.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear footsteps. Heavy boots on concrete. My heart's racing now, just like it did then. I... I want to run, but I'm tied to this chair. The ropes are digging into my wrists.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 60, I'd say. My palms are sweating.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Remember to breathe. What do you see now?",
    "Client: The door creaks open. A man walks in. He's tall, wearing a dark jacket. I can't... I can't see his face clearly. But his voice... God, I'll never forget that voice.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What does he say?",
    "Client: He... he says, \"Time to earn your keep, old man.\" I feel sick. I know what's coming. I try to plead, but my mouth is so dry. I can barely speak.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's getting harder. My chest feels tight. I... I don't know if I can...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Can you tell me what you see around you in this room?",
    "Client: I... I see the chair I'm sitting in. The painting on the wall. Your desk. I... I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Good. Do you want to continue?",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, I think so. Just... give me a moment.",
    "Therapist: Of course. When you're ready, take us back to that warehouse.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back there. The man, he's untying me. But I know it's not to let me go. My legs are weak. I can barely stand. He grabs my arm, his fingers digging in so hard I think they'll leave bruises.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: He's... he's dragging me towards a door. I can hear voices on the other side. Other men. Laughing, talking. I'm terrified. I know what they want me to do. I... I can't...",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Mr. Johnson. Remember, this is just a memory. How high is your distress now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 75. My heart's pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. In through your nose, out through your mouth. Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The door opens. The light is so bright it hurts my eyes. There are... there are maybe five or six men in the room. They all turn to look at me. One of them, a big guy with a scar on his cheek, he grins. Says, \"Fresh meat, boys.\"",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Shame. Anger. Fear. It's all mixed up. I want to fight, but I know I can't. I'm too old, too weak. They'll... they'll hurt me worse if I try.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: They... they make me... God, I can't say it. It's too...",
    "Therapist: It's okay. Take your time. Remember, you're in control here.",
    "Client: They make me strip. I can feel their eyes on me. I'm shaking, trying not to cry. One of them, he throws something at me. It's... it's a dress. A woman's dress. They laugh when I put it on. I've never felt so humiliated.",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly difficult. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm angry. So angry. At them, at myself for not being stronger. My fists are clenched. I want to hit something.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel angry. Can you tell me more about what's happening?",
    "Client: They're... they're touching me. Making comments about my body. I close my eyes, try to shut it out. But I can still hear them, feel their hands. I... I think I'm going to be sick.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Do you need a moment?",
    "Client: No... no, I want to keep going. I need to get through this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: They... they take turns. Using me. It hurts. I try to disconnect, to think about something else. Anything else. But I can't escape it. The pain, the smell, the sound of their grunts and laughs.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How high is your distress now?",
    "Client: It's... it's at 90. Maybe higher. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Let's take a moment. Focus on my voice. You're here, in my office. You're safe. No one can hurt you here.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm... I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, tell me what happens next.",
    "Client: It goes on for... I don't know how long. Hours, maybe. By the end, I'm... I'm broken. Physically, emotionally. They drag me back to that room with the chair. Tie me up again. The man from before, he comes in. He says, \"Good job, old man. You're a natural.\" I... I throw up then. Can't help it.",
    "Therapist: That's an understandable reaction. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. But also... I don't know. There's a part of me that feels... relieved? To have finally said it out loud.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. You've shown incredible strength today. How would you rate your distress now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 60 again. I feel wrung out, but... lighter, somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You've done excellent work today. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves before we end the session. Can you tell me five things you can see in this room?",
    "Client: I see... your desk. The clock on the wall. The bookshelf. The plant in the corner. And... and my own hands. They're not shaking as much now.",
    "Therapist: Very good. Now, four things you can touch?",
    "Client: The armrests of this chair. My shirt. The fabric of my pants. And... and my wedding ring.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Three things you can hear?",
    "Client: The ticking of the clock. Traffic outside. And... my own breathing. It's steadier now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Two things you can smell?",
    "Client: Coffee... from your mug, I think. And... some kind of air freshener? Pine, maybe?",
    "Therapist: Good. And finally, one thing you can taste?",
    "Client: Just... just the dryness in my mouth. I could use some water.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Here you go. You've done incredibly well today, Mr. Johnson. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. Really tired. But also... I don't know. There's a part of me that feels stronger. Like I've faced something I've been running from for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a very positive perspective. You should be proud of yourself. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we end the session?",
    "Client: No, I... I think I'm good. Thank you, doc. This wasn't easy, but... I think it was important.",
    "Therapist: It absolutely was. Remember to be kind to yourself this week. We'll continue this work in our next session. Take care, Mr. Johnson.",
    "Client: Thank you. I will. See you next week, doc."
