    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your baseline SUDS.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10. My heart's beating a little faster than usual.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that moment.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) I'm there. I'm in the small, dark room. The walls feel like they're closing in on me. I can smell the musty air and hear the echoes of footsteps outside. My hands are shaking, and I'm trying to make myself as small as possible in the corner.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. My palms are getting sweaty, and I feel a tightness in my chest.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I hear the guard's voice. He's shouting something, but I can't make out the words. The metal door creaks open, and a sliver of light cuts through the darkness. I'm terrified of what might happen next. My whole body is tense, and I'm holding my breath without realizing it.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's an 8 now. My heart is pounding so hard I can hear it in my ears. I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Inhales shakily) The guard steps into the room. His face is blurry, but I can see his uniform. He's carrying something... I think it's a tray of food. But I'm so scared he might hurt me instead. I press myself harder against the wall, wishing I could disappear.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Still at an 8. My legs feel weak, like they might give out. I have this overwhelming urge to run, but there's nowhere to go.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: The guard puts the tray down and leaves without a word. The door slams shut, and I'm alone again. But I can't relax. I'm shaking all over, and my mind is racing with thoughts of what might happen next time someone comes in. I feel so helpless and alone.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's dropped to a 7. The immediate fear is subsiding, but there's this lingering dread in the pit of my stomach.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. Continue.",
    "Client: I slowly move towards the tray. The food looks unappetizing, but I'm so hungry. As I eat, I can't stop thinking about my family, wondering if they know where I am or if they're looking for me. Tears start rolling down my cheeks, and I feel a mix of sadness and anger.",
    "Therapist: How would you rate your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6. The fear is less intense, but the sadness is overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're processing it well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I finish eating and return to my corner. Time seems to stand still in here. I try to distract myself by counting the bricks on the wall or humming quietly, but my mind keeps circling back to the fear of what might happen next. My body feels exhausted from being constantly on edge.",
    "Therapist: And your current SUDS?",
    "Client: It's at a 5 now. I feel drained, both emotionally and physically.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You're doing well.",
    "Client: As the hours pass, I start to feel numb. It's like my emotions have shut down to protect me. I'm still scared, but it's more of a dull, constant ache rather than the sharp terror from before. I drift in and out of a restless sleep, jerking awake at every small noise.",
    "Therapist: How about your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 4. The numbness has taken over, but there's still an undercurrent of anxiety.",
    "Therapist: You've done an excellent job. Let's start wrapping up.",
    "Client: (Opens eyes, takes a deep breath) That was intense. I didn't realize how vivid those memories still were.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm okay. Tired, but also a bit relieved. My SUDS is back to about a 3. It feels good to have talked through it.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great courage today. Well done."
