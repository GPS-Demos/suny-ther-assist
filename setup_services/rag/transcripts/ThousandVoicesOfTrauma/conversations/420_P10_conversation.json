    "Therapist: Welcome, Amir. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is dreading it. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: Uh, probably around 40. It's there, but not overwhelming yet.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we're here to process this together. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm at the park near our house. It's a sunny afternoon, and I can hear kids playing in the distance. I'm walking my dog, Max, along the path. The trees are casting long shadows, and there's a cool breeze.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: We're approaching the bend in the path, near the old oak tree. Max is sniffing around, tail wagging. Then... then I hear it. A low growl. My heart starts racing.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Fear. Confusion. I... I freeze for a second, trying to locate where the sound is coming from. Max starts barking, and I see it \u2013 a large dog, maybe a Rottweiler, emerging from the bushes.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 60. My palms are getting sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Take a deep breath. What happens next?",
    "Client: The dog... it's snarling, foam at its mouth. I try to back away slowly, but Max is barking like crazy. I'm telling Max to be quiet, but he won't listen. The Rottweiler lunges forward, and I... I panic.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I yank Max's leash, trying to pull him behind me. But it's too late. The Rottweiler is on us in seconds. I can smell its hot breath, hear its teeth snapping.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're safe here. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 75 now. My heart is pounding.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're safe here in the room with me.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm... I'm trying to calm down.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: The Rottweiler... it's attacking Max. There's snarling, yelping, a blur of fur and teeth. I'm screaming, trying to pull Max away, but the Rottweiler is so strong. I... I can see blood on Max's fur.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Terrified. Helpless. I... I don't know what to do. I'm yelling for help, but no one's around. I grab a stick from the ground and start hitting the Rottweiler, but it's not letting go.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's 85. I can feel my hands shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, this is a memory. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Right... right. I'm... I'm here. It's just a memory.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I hear someone shouting. A man is running towards us. He's got a water bottle, and he's spraying the Rottweiler. It's startled, backs off for a moment. I grab Max and pull him close. He's whimpering, bleeding from his neck.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: Relieved, but still terrified. My hands are covered in Max's blood. The Rottweiler is circling us, still growling. The man is on his phone, calling for help.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I can't believe this is happening. I'm worried about Max, angry at the Rottweiler's owner, wherever they are. I feel so helpless, like I couldn't protect Max.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's still around 80. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great. What happens next?",
    "Client: We... we hear sirens. The animal control van pulls up. Two officers get out, approach carefully. They've got catch poles. The Rottweiler tries to run, but they manage to catch it. I'm still holding Max, trying to comfort him.",
    "Therapist: How does Max respond?",
    "Client: He's... he's shaking. Whimpering. I can feel his warm blood on my shirt. An ambulance arrives, and the paramedics come to check on us. They say Max needs to go to the vet immediately.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling as this is happening?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in shock. Everything feels surreal. I'm worried sick about Max, but also relieved that help is here. I keep replaying the attack in my mind, wondering if I could have done something differently.",
    "Therapist: That's a natural response. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 70. I'm still tense, but the immediate danger is over in the memory.",
    "Therapist: Good. Take a moment to breathe. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm trying to relax my shoulders.",
    "Therapist: When you're ready, continue with what happens next.",
    "Client: I... I ride with Max to the emergency vet. The whole way there, I'm talking to him, trying to keep him calm. But I'm a mess inside. I keep seeing the Rottweiler's teeth, hearing the snarls and yelps.",
    "Therapist: How do you manage your own emotions during this time?",
    "Client: I... I try to focus on Max. On what needs to be done. But my hands won't stop shaking. I feel like I'm going to throw up. The adrenaline is wearing off, and I'm starting to feel the scratches on my arms from the fight.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens at the vet?",
    "Client: They rush Max into surgery. I have to wait in the lobby. It feels like forever. I call my wife, try to explain what happened, but I keep choking up. The waiting is almost worse than the attack itself.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind as you wait?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking about how quickly it all happened. How one moment we were just on a normal walk, and the next... chaos. I'm angry at the Rottweiler's owner, wherever they are. I'm scared Max might not make it. I feel guilty, like I should have done more.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 65. The memory of the attack is still vivid, but talking about it is helping a bit.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a deep breath. What happens next?",
    "Client: After what feels like hours, the vet comes out. She says Max is going to be okay. He needed a lot of stitches, and he'll have to wear a cone for a while, but he'll recover. I... I break down crying when I hear this.",
    "Therapist: Allow yourself to feel that relief. How does your body respond?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a wave washing over me. My legs feel weak. I sit down hard in one of the chairs. I'm still shaking, but it's different now. Like my body is releasing all the tension it's been holding.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. How do you feel about Max's recovery?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm so relieved. Grateful. But also... I don't know. Scared? Like, what if it happens again? I don't know if I'll ever feel safe walking him again.",
    "Therapist: Those are understandable concerns. We'll work on addressing them. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 50. I'm feeling drained, but also... lighter? Like talking about it has helped release some of the pressure.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You've done excellent work today. Let's start winding down. Take a few deep breaths.",
    "Client: Okay... *deep breath* It feels good to breathe deeply.",
    "Therapist: Good. As we finish, what are your thoughts on today's session?",
    "Client: It was... intense. Harder than I expected. But also... I don't know. Helpful? Like, it's the first time I've really talked through the whole thing in detail.",
    "Therapist: That's a big step. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired. Emotionally drained. But also... maybe a little proud? Like, I faced this memory head-on instead of avoiding it.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You've shown great courage today. What's your final SUDS level?",
    "Client: I'd say... maybe 30? I'm feeling calmer now.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Remember, it's normal to feel drained after a session like this. Be kind to yourself for the rest of the day.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you... for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Amir. We'll continue to work on this in our next session. For now, focus on self-care and remember the coping strategies we've discussed.",
    "Client: Okay. I... I think I can do that.",
    "Therapist: Great. I'll see you next week. Take care."
