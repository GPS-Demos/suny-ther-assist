    "Therapist: Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. To be honest, I'm a bit nervous. I've been avoiding thinking about my combat experiences for so long. The idea of deliberately bringing them up is unsettling.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried that reliving those moments might be too intense. What if I can't handle it? What if it makes my depression worse? I've worked hard to keep these memories at bay, and now you're asking me to face them head-on. It's... it's frightening.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How do you think this might help?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe it could help me process what happened? I've heard that avoiding trauma can make things worse in the long run. But it's hard to imagine how revisiting those painful memories could be beneficial. I mean, I've spent years trying to forget.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. Avoidance often reinforces fear. This exercise aims to reduce that.",
    "Client: I see. But how exactly does it work? What am I supposed to do during this imaginal exposure?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount your experience in detail, as if it's happening now.",
    "Client: In detail? That sounds... intense. Will I be able to stop if it becomes too much? And what about afterwards? I'm worried about how I'll feel once we're done. Will I be able to function normally?",
    "Therapist: Yes, you can pause anytime. We'll debrief after and ensure you're grounded.",
    "Client: Okay, that's somewhat reassuring. I appreciate your support, really. It's just... this is a big step for me. I've never talked about my experiences in such detail before. Not even with my wife. I'm afraid of what might come up, what emotions might surface.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. This process can significantly reduce PTSD symptoms.",
    "Client: Thank you. I want to believe that. I'm tired of living with this weight, you know? The nightmares, the anxiety, the depression... if this can help, I'm willing to try. But I'm still scared.",
    "Therapist: That's natural. Your bravery in facing this is commendable.",
    "Client: Thank you. I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Can you walk me through what exactly will happen during this session? What should I expect?",
    "Therapist: We'll start slowly. You'll describe a specific event, focusing on sensory details.",
    "Client: Sensory details? Like what I saw, heard, and felt? That's... that's going to be tough. Some of those memories are so vivid, it's like they happened yesterday. But others are fragmented, almost like a bad dream. How do I handle that?",
    "Therapist: Share what you remember. Gaps are normal. We'll work through it together.",
    "Client: Alright. And what about after the session? How do I cope with any lingering emotions or memories that might come up?",
    "Therapist: We'll practice grounding techniques. I'll provide coping strategies for between sessions.",
    "Client: Okay. I appreciate that. This is a lot to take in, but I'm trying to stay optimistic. I want to get better, for myself and for my family. They've been so patient with me through all of this.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is inspiring. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm ready. Let's do this. I just hope... I hope this really does help in the long run. It's not going to be easy, but if it can make a difference, it'll be worth it.",
    "Therapist: Your resilience is remarkable. We'll take it step by step."
