    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I understand why we're doing this.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's begin. Close your eyes and describe the memory.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in the refugee camp. It's hot, dusty. I can smell sweat and hear children crying. I'm seven years old, sitting outside our tent...",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, about a 4 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue.",
    "Client: My stomach is growling. We haven't eaten properly in days. I see my mother talking to some aid workers, pleading for more food. Her voice is shaking...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My heart's beating faster. I feel... helpless. Just like I did back then.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Keep going.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's shouting. Men with guns are entering the camp. Everyone's panicking, running. I can't find my mother. I'm terrified...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. I feel like I'm there again.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Continue if you can.",
    "Client: I'm hiding under a truck. I can hear gunshots, screaming. The dust is choking me. I'm shaking, praying for my mother to find me...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling physically right now?",
    "Client: My hands are sweating. My chest feels tight. I... I don't know if I can continue.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's a 9. I feel overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're here with me. You're safe.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay. I... I see my mother. She's frantically searching for me. I want to call out, but I'm afraid the men with guns will hear me...",
    "Therapist: And now?",
    "Client: The fear is... it's intense. But seeing my mother... it's a mix of relief and terror.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: Still a 9, but... it feels different somehow.",
    "Therapist: How so?",
    "Client: It's like... I know I survived this. We both did.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You did survive. Keep going.",
    "Client: My mother spots me. Her eyes are wide with fear and relief. She's gesturing for me to stay quiet. The gunmen are leaving...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",

    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 7.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: My mother rushes to me. She holds me tight, crying. I can feel her heart pounding. We're both trembling...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 5. I feel sad, but also... safe?",
    "Therapist: That's progress. You're doing great.",
    "Client: We stay there for a while, just holding each other. The camp is quieter now. I can hear people crying softly...",
    "Therapist: How do you feel as the memory ends?",
    "Client: Drained. But also... I don't know. Maybe a little stronger?",
    "Therapist: Final SUDS?",
    "Client: It's back down to a 4.",
    "Therapist: Well done, James. You've shown incredible strength today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was hard, but... I think it helped.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now that we've finished?",

    "Therapist: That's a common experience. You've taken a big step today.",
    "Client: I have, haven't I? It's strange... the memory is still painful, but it feels less... overwhelming now.",
    "Therapist: That's often the goal of these exercises. You've done excellent work today, James."
