    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit anxious, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about some difficult things, and I'm not sure I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel anxious. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate that. It's just... thinking about what happened, it brings back so many memories I've tried to push away for years.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Take your time.",
    "Client: Okay. Well, I guess I should start with the day I realized I was trapped. I was working at this factory, and I thought it was a legitimate job. But then they took our passports and told us we couldn't leave. I remember feeling so scared and confused.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The supervisors were always yelling at us, calling us names, threatening us. One day, I saw them beating another worker who had tried to escape. I felt so helpless. I wanted to help him, but I was terrified they'd do the same to me.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I can still hear the screams sometimes. The worst part was feeling like I had no control over my life anymore. I kept thinking about my family back home, wondering if I'd ever see them again.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're doing well.",
    "Client: It's hard to describe the constant fear. Every day, I woke up not knowing if I'd make it through. The work was backbreaking, and we barely got any food or rest. I lost so much weight, I hardly recognized myself.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this.",
    "Client: There was this one night... I'm sorry, it's hard to talk about this part.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. Remember, you're in control here.",
    "Client: One night, they came and took some of the younger workers. We never saw them again. I couldn't sleep after that, always wondering if I'd be next. The guilt of not being able to help them still haunts me.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel emotional. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I started planning my escape then. It took months of careful observation and gathering information. I was terrified of getting caught, but the thought of staying there was even worse.",
    "Therapist: You showed incredible strength.",
    "Client: When I finally managed to escape, I ran for what felt like hours. I was sure they were right behind me. Even when I reached a police station, I couldn't stop shaking. I didn't know who to trust anymore.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. Keep going if you can.",
    "Client: The aftermath was almost as hard as being there. I had nightmares every night. I couldn't hold down a job because I was always looking over my shoulder. It took years before I could trust anyone again.",
    "Therapist: You've come so far. I'm proud of you.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard sometimes. Certain sounds or smells can take me right back there. But I'm learning to cope better. Talking about it like this... it's painful, but I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: You're making great progress.",
    "Client: I just want to be able to live without this constant fear. To be the husband and father my family deserves. Sometimes I feel like I'll never be free of what happened.",
    "Therapist: It's a process, but you're doing well.",
    "Client: I know. It's just... some days are harder than others. But I'm committed to this therapy. I want to reclaim my life, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. Shall we continue?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm ready to go a bit deeper. There's more I need to talk about, even though it's difficult.",
    "Therapist: I'm here to support you. Go ahead when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay. So, there was this one supervisor who was particularly cruel..."
