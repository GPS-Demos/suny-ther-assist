    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Johnson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I suppose. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been thinking about it all week, and I'm not sure I'm ready for this.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Can you tell me more?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... the idea of revisiting those memories, especially the sexual abuse... it's terrifying. And then there's the racial trauma on top of that. It feels like opening two painful wounds at once. I'm worried I might fall apart.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Your courage is admirable.",
    "Client: Thank you, but I don't feel courageous at all. I feel scared and vulnerable. It's hard enough dealing with these issues day-to-day, let alone deliberately focusing on them. And... I'm not sure how to say this, but... given our differences in gender and race, I'm worried you might not fully understand my experiences.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are important. How can I support you?",
    "Client: I appreciate you asking. I think I need reassurance that this process will actually help, and that you'll be there to guide me through it. Also, maybe some explanation about how this imaginal exposure thing works? I'm still not quite sure what to expect.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Shall I explain the process?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think that would help ease some of my anxiety. And maybe you could tell me how this specifically addresses both the sexual abuse and racial trauma? I'm having trouble seeing how one approach can handle both issues.",
    "Therapist: Certainly. Imaginal exposure helps process traumatic memories safely.",
    "Client: Process them? What does that mean exactly? And how can reliving those awful experiences be safe? I've spent years trying to forget them.",
    "Therapist: It allows you to confront memories without actual danger.",
    "Client: I see. But won't that just make me feel worse? I'm worried about being overwhelmed by emotions or flashbacks. And how does this help with the ongoing racial trauma I experience?",
    "Therapist: It can be intense, but I'll guide you throughout.",
    "Client: Okay... I think I'm starting to understand a little better. But I'm still nervous. What if I can't handle it? What if I break down or have a panic attack during the session?",
    "Therapist: That's normal. We'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: Alright. I appreciate your patience with all my questions. I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Can you walk me through what exactly we'll be doing today?",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit a memory gradually. You're in control.",
    "Client: Okay. That doesn't sound quite as scary as I imagined. When you say I'm in control, does that mean I can stop if it becomes too much? And how do we choose which memory to focus on?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You can pause anytime. Which memory feels manageable?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. They all feel pretty overwhelming. Maybe... maybe we could start with a less intense experience of racial discrimination? I'm not ready to dive into the sexual abuse yet, if that's okay.",
    "Therapist: That's perfectly fine. Your choice is respected.",
    "Client: Thank you. I really appreciate your understanding. I think I'm ready to try this now. It won't be easy, but I trust you'll help me through it. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Your bravery is commendable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, let's begin. I'm still nervous, but I'm also hopeful that this might help me move forward. Thank you for your guidance and support."
