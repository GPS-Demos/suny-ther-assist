    "Therapist: Welcome, Amir. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure exercise today?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with your baseline SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10. My stomach feels a bit tight.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day at the cult compound.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Alright... I'm there. The sun is beating down, and I can smell the dust in the air. I see the leader approaching me, his eyes intense and focused.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue.",
    "Client: He's telling me that I've been chosen for a special mission. My heart starts racing, and I feel my palms getting sweaty. I... I don't want to do this, but I feel like I can't say no.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 6. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The leader takes me to a small room. There are others there, all looking nervous. He starts talking about sacrifice and loyalty. I feel sick to my stomach. The walls seem to be closing in...",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's an 8 now. I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *inhales shakily* He... he's handing out cups. Telling us it's time to prove our devotion. I'm shaking. I don't want to drink it, but everyone else is...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I raise the cup to my lips. The smell is awful. I'm about to drink when suddenly there's a commotion outside. People shouting, running...",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually dropped to a 7. The chaos is almost a relief.",
    "Therapist: Interesting. What do you notice about that?",
    "Client: I... I guess the interruption felt like hope. Like maybe I wouldn't have to go through with it.",
    "Therapist: Keep going.",
    "Client: The door bursts open. It's the police. They're yelling, telling us to put the cups down. I drop mine immediately, feeling a mix of relief and terror.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's back up to an 8. My heart's pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: Everything's a blur. We're being led out. I see some people crying, others look angry. I just feel... numb. Like I'm watching it all happen to someone else.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel?",
    "Client: Heavy. My legs feel like lead. And I'm cold, even though it was a hot day.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: Still an 8. I... I can't believe how close I came to...",
    "Therapist: It's okay. You're safe now.",
    "Client: *voice breaking* I know, but... God, what if they hadn't come? What if I had actually drunk it?",
    "Therapist: Those are normal thoughts. What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 9. I feel overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You survived this.",
    "Client: *breathes deeply* You're right. I did survive. I... I got out.",
    "Therapist: That's right. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: The panic is starting to subside a bit. My SUDS is back to about a 7.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's start to bring you back to the present.",
    "Client: *opens eyes slowly* That was... intense. But I made it through.",
    "Therapist: You did very well. How do you feel?",
    "Client: Drained, but... also a bit proud? My SUDS is down to a 5 now.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's talk about what you've learned."
