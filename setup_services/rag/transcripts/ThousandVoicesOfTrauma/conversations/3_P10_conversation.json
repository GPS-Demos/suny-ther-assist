    "Therapist: Welcome back. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I... I think so. There's a part of me that's dreading this, but I know it's important. I've been feeling a mix of anxiety and determination all day.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. How distressed are you feeling right now, on a scale of 0 to 100?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 60. My stomach's in knots.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we'll go at your pace. When you're ready, close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: *Takes a deep breath* Alright. I'm... I'm standing outside the compound. It's early evening, the sun's just starting to set. There's a chill in the air, and I can smell woodsmoke. I'm... I'm supposed to be heading inside for the evening gathering, but something feels off today.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: I see the main building. It's this big, weathered barn that's been converted. The windows are glowing with warm light, but it doesn't feel inviting. There are people trickling in, all wearing those white robes we had to wear for ceremonies. God, I hated those things.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My heart's racing. I can feel my palms getting sweaty. It's like... like I know something bad is going to happen, but I can't stop it.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I force myself to walk towards the building. As I get closer, I can hear chanting inside. It's low at first, but it's getting louder. I reach for the door handle, and it's ice cold. I hesitate, but I know I have to go in. I... I don't have a choice.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 75. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: I know it is. You're very brave. Take another deep breath. What do you see when you open the door?",
    "Client: The room is packed. Everyone's facing the front, where the leader is standing on a raised platform. The air is thick with incense, and it's making me feel dizzy. I... I see an empty spot near the back and I try to slip in quietly, but someone grabs my arm.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What happens?",
    "Client: It's one of the senior members. They're glaring at me, whispering harshly that I'm late. I mumble an apology, but they're not listening. They're dragging me towards the front. Oh god, I don't want to go up there.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Remember, this is just a memory. Can you describe what you're feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. My legs feel like lead. I want to run, but I can't. Everyone's staring at me now. The leader's eyes... they're so cold. He's smiling, but it doesn't reach his eyes. He's calling me forward, saying it's time for me to prove my dedication.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's 90. This is when it happened. This is when I saw...",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. If it gets too intense, we can pause. Do you want to continue?",
    "Client: *voice shaking* Yes. I... I need to get through this. The leader, he's holding something behind his back. As I get closer, I can see it's a knife. My heart's pounding so hard I can barely hear anything else. He's saying something about sacrifice, about proving our faith. And then... oh god, then he brings out a cage. There's a rabbit inside. It's so small, so innocent. I... I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor. You're here, you're safe.",
    "Client: *takes a shaky breath* The leader, he's handing me the knife. He's telling me that to prove my faith, I need to... to sacrifice the rabbit. Everyone's watching, chanting. The rabbit is trembling. I... I can't do it. I won't do it. But then I see movement behind the leader. There's a curtain, and behind it... I can see people. They're tied up. And I realize... if I don't do this, it won't be the rabbit. It'll be them. It'll be me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's 95. I feel like I'm going to be sick.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here in this room. You're safe. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I take the knife. My hands are shaking so badly. The leader is smiling, praising me. But all I can hear is the rabbit's frantic breathing. I close my eyes. I can't look. I feel the knife cut through... *voice breaks* I hear the rabbit's final cry. And then there's cheering. So much cheering. I open my eyes, and there's blood on my hands. I've never felt so horrified, so ashamed in my life.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're here, you're safe. It's just a memory.",
    "Client: *crying softly* I... I killed an innocent creature. I became part of their madness. How could I do that?",
    "Therapist: You were in an impossible situation. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still at 95. I can't shake the feeling of the blood on my hands.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Can you tell me what happens after?",
    "Client: The leader is praising me, telling everyone how devoted I am. But I feel hollow inside. Empty. I'm ushered back into the crowd, and people are patting me on the back, congratulating me. But all I can think about is that poor rabbit, and the people behind the curtain. I... I realize in that moment that I have to get out. That this isn't faith, it's madness. But I'm terrified of what they'll do if I try to leave.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... disgusted with myself. Angry at them for putting me in that position. Scared of what else they might have made me do if I had stayed.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to 85. Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also releasing something.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Can you tell me more about what you're experiencing in that moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm standing there, surrounded by all these people who are celebrating what just happened. But I feel completely alone. Isolated. It's like I'm watching everything from outside my body. The chanting has started up again, but it sounds distorted, almost demonic. I can smell the metallic scent of blood mixed with the incense. It's making me nauseous. I want to run, but I know I can't. Not yet. I have to pretend everything's okay.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with those feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: The rest of the ceremony is a blur. I'm going through the motions, mouthing the words to the chants, but inside I'm screaming. When it finally ends, I practically run out of the building. The cool night air hits me, and I gulp it down like I've been drowning. I make it to the edge of the compound before I throw up. I'm shaking, crying. I know I can't stay here anymore, but I'm terrified of what they'll do when they realize I want to leave.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly intense. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to 80. Talking about it, remembering how I felt then... it's painful, but it's also reminding me that I got out. That I was strong enough to leave.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You were strong enough. How do you feel about that strength now?",
    "Client: I... I feel proud, in a way. It took everything I had to leave. I had to plan for weeks, pretending everything was normal. When I finally got out, I was terrified they'd come after me. But I did it. I saved myself.",
    "Therapist: That's incredible resilience. As we start to wind down this session, can you tell me how you're feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also lighter somehow. Like I've let go of a weight I've been carrying. I'm still angry about what happened, still disgusted by what I was forced to do. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe hopeful? Like by facing this memory, I'm taking back some of the power they had over me.",
    "Therapist: That's a very positive perspective. What's your final SUDS level?",
    "Client: I'd say it's down to about 65 now. Still elevated, but much better than before.",
    "Therapist: You've done remarkable work today. How do you feel about ending the session here?",
    "Client: I think... I think that's good. This was intense, but I feel like I've made progress. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. You showed incredible courage today. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we fully close the session."
