    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the car accident?",
    "Client: Okay... I was driving home from work. It was raining heavily. The windshield wipers were barely keeping up. I remember gripping the steering wheel tightly, my knuckles turning white. The road was slick, and I could feel my tires struggling to maintain traction. Suddenly, I saw headlights coming towards me, swerving into my lane. My heart started racing...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The other car was coming straight at me. I tried to swerve, but everything happened so fast. I felt a sudden impact, metal crunching, glass shattering. The airbag deployed, hitting me in the face. I couldn't breathe for a moment. The car was spinning, and I had no control. It reminded me of being in a helicopter during a combat mission, that same feeling of helplessness...",
    "Therapist: Stay with the memory. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Right... The car finally came to a stop. I was disoriented, my ears ringing. I could smell gasoline and burning rubber. It was so similar to... No, I can't... This is too much.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I... I remember trying to unbuckle my seatbelt, but my hands were shaking so badly. I could hear people shouting outside, but it sounded muffled, like I was underwater. I was scared the car might explode, just like... just like when our convoy hit an IED. I started panicking, feeling trapped...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: I managed to get the door open and stumbled out. My legs felt weak, and I collapsed onto the wet pavement. The rain was still pouring down, mixing with blood from a cut on my forehead. I looked around and saw the other driver slumped over their steering wheel. I wanted to help, but I couldn't move. I felt frozen, useless, just like during the ambush in Afghanistan...",
    "Therapist: It's normal to have these connections. Keep going.",
    "Client: Sirens were approaching. I remember feeling relieved but also terrified. The flashing lights reminded me of explosions, and I started having flashbacks to the war. I couldn't differentiate between the accident scene and my combat memories. Everything blurred together. I was shaking uncontrollably, my breath coming in short gasps...",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Remember, you're here now.",
    "Client: The paramedics arrived and started checking me. Their touch made me flinch. They were asking me questions, but I couldn't focus. All I could think about was the other driver and my team members who didn't make it back. I felt this overwhelming guilt, like somehow I was responsible for everything. I started sobbing uncontrollably...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're safe.",
    "Client: They put me on a stretcher and into the ambulance. The confined space of the ambulance triggered more memories of being in military vehicles, always on alert. I kept expecting an explosion or gunfire. I couldn't calm down. The paramedic tried to reassure me, but his voice sounded distant. I felt so alone and scared...",
    "Therapist: You're not alone now. You're doing great.",
    "Client: At the hospital, everything was a blur. Doctors and nurses were all around me, but I felt detached from reality. They were treating my physical injuries, but I couldn't stop reliving both the accident and my war experiences. It was like being trapped in a nightmare I couldn't wake up from. I wanted to run, to hide, to do something, but I was powerless...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Reliving that moment is exhausting. But I also feel a bit lighter, like I've released some of the weight I've been carrying. It's still painful, but maybe a little less overwhelming than before.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's take a break."
