    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I don't know. A bit on edge, I guess. I've been dreading this all week, to be honest. It's hard to face these memories.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Yeah, I think so. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in the marketplace in Kabul. It's hot, so hot. The sun is beating down, and there's dust everywhere. I can smell spices and... something else. Something acrid. (Pause) God, I hate this smell.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What's happening around you?",
    "Client: People are shouting. There's this constant buzz of noise - vendors calling out, kids playing. But something feels off. I'm on edge, scanning the crowd. My hand keeps brushing my weapon.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, about a 6? Maybe 7?",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: I see... I see this little girl. She's wearing a bright blue dress, standing by a fruit stall. She reminds me of my niece back home. (Voice wavers) She's smiling at me, and I... I smile back.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What happens next?",
    "Client: There's a loud bang. So loud it hurts my ears. People start screaming. I'm thrown to the ground. (Breathing quickens) There's smoke everywhere. I can't see. I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: (Gasping) It's so real. I can taste the dust. I... I'm trying to get up, but my ears are ringing. I'm dizzy. (Pause) I see bodies. Oh God, there are bodies everywhere.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: Nine. Definitely a nine.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Take a deep breath. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Okay. Okay. I'm... I'm stumbling through the smoke. People are running, screaming. I'm looking for the little girl. (Voice breaks) I can't find her.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm failing. I should be helping these people, but I can't even stand straight. (Sobbing) There's so much blood. I've never seen so much blood.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Sarah. This is just a memory.",
    "Client: (Crying) I know, I know. But it feels so real. I can smell the blood, the smoke. I hear people calling for help, but I can't... I can't do anything.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I start moving. Checking bodies. Looking for survivors. My training kicks in, but I feel like I'm moving through molasses. Everything's slow, surreal.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: My heart's racing. I feel sick to my stomach. My hands are shaking so bad I can barely check for pulses.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here in the room with me. You're safe.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Right. Safe. I... I find a man. He's alive, but badly hurt. I start first aid, but there's so much chaos around us. I keep looking for the little girl.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm angry. So angry. Why did this happen? These are innocent people. (Voice rises) They didn't deserve this! And I couldn't stop it. I should have seen it coming. I should have...",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault, Sarah. You couldn't have known.",
    "Client: (Crying) But I should have! That's my job! I was supposed to protect them, and I failed. I failed that little girl.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. Where are you now in the memory?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm still in the market. More soldiers have arrived. We're evacuating survivors. But there are so many who didn't make it. (Quietly) I never found the little girl.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Numb. Just... numb. And so, so tired. I want to collapse, but I can't. I have to keep going.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about a 7 now. The adrenaline's wearing off.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Sarah. Can you describe what you see as you leave the market?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a war zone. Buildings are damaged. There's debris everywhere. I see a child's shoe on the ground, covered in dust. (Pause) I can't stop staring at it.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that image. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Guilt. Overwhelming guilt. And this... this deep sadness. It's like a weight on my chest. I can barely breathe.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction to what you've been through.",
    "Client: Is it? Because I feel anything but normal. I feel... broken. Like I left a part of myself in that market.",
    "Therapist: Many people feel that way after traumatic experiences. It's part of the healing process.",
    "Client: (Sighs) I guess. I just... I don't know how to move past this. How do I live with what I've seen?",
    "Therapist: That's what we're here to work on. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. Completely drained. But also... I don't know. Maybe a little lighter? Like I've let some of it out.",
    "Therapist: That's good, Sarah. You've done really well today.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's... it's hard. But I want to get better. I need to get better.",

    "Client: Okay. Yeah, next week. (Pause) You know, I think I might actually sleep tonight. First time in a while.",
    "Therapist: That's great to hear. Take care of yourself, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thanks. See you then."
