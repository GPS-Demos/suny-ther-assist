    "Therapist: Welcome, Priya. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I've been dreading this all week. My hands are actually a bit shaky. But I know it's important, so I'm here.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Yes, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in my car. It's a sunny afternoon, and I'm driving home from a client meeting. The radio's on, playing some pop song. I'm feeling good about how the meeting went.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm approaching an intersection. The light's green, so I'm not slowing down. Then... oh god... I see this other car. It's coming from the right, and it's not stopping. It's going so fast...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My heart's racing. I'm gripping the steering wheel so tight. I want to slam on the brakes, but there's no time. I'm... I'm terrified.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 70.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* The car hits me. There's this awful crunching sound, and my car is spinning. Everything's a blur. I can smell burning rubber and... and something else. Maybe it's airbag powder? I don't know. My head hurts so much.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm just sitting there, stunned. My ears are ringing. I can hear people shouting outside, but it sounds far away. I try to move, but my seatbelt's stuck. I'm panicking now. What if the car catches fire? What if I'm trapped?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's higher. Maybe 85?",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here in the room with me. You're safe. Take another deep breath.",
    "Client: *breathes* Okay. I... I manage to unbuckle my seatbelt. My hands are shaking so much. I push the door, but it's jammed. I have to kick it open. When I get out, my legs are wobbly. I nearly fall.",
    "Therapist: What do you see around you?",
    "Client: There are people gathering. Someone's asking if I'm okay, but I can barely focus on them. I see the other car. It's... it's worse than mine. There's smoke coming from the hood. I can hear sirens in the distance.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling physically at this moment?",
    "Client: My whole body's trembling. My head's pounding, and I feel nauseous. I think I might have whiplash. I'm... I'm starting to realize how close I came to... to dying.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: I can't stop staring at the other car. I... I hope the driver's okay. Oh god, what if they're not? What if... what if they're dead because of me?",
    "Therapist: Remember, you had the green light. What happens next?",
    "Client: Right, yes... The ambulance arrives. They're checking me over. I keep asking about the other driver, but no one will tell me anything. They want to take me to the hospital, but I'm resisting. I don't want to leave my car. It feels... it feels like abandoning the scene of a crime.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 80?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I finally agree to go to the hospital. In the ambulance, everything feels surreal. I keep replaying the crash in my head. Could I have done something differently? Should I have seen the car coming? I feel so guilty and scared.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those thoughts. What happens at the hospital?",
    "Client: They run tests, take x-rays. I have a mild concussion and whiplash, they say. But all I can think about is the other driver. I keep asking, but no one has answers. Hours pass. I'm exhausted, but I can't relax. Every time I close my eyes, I see that car coming at me.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. My chest feels tight. I want to cry, but I can't. I just feel... numb.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. What happens next?",
    "Client: Finally, a police officer comes to take my statement. I'm shaking as I recount what happened. Then... then he tells me the other driver is in critical condition. I... I break down. I can't stop sobbing. Even though he ran the red light, I feel responsible.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 90 now. This is the worst part.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *breathes shakily* Okay... I'm released from the hospital that night. My friend comes to pick me up. I can't bear to be alone. Every car that passes makes me flinch. I keep seeing headlights coming at me. I don't sleep at all that night.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope in the following days?",
    "Client: I... I struggle. I can't drive. I have nightmares every night. I keep checking the news, terrified I'll see that the other driver died. I can't focus on work. I feel like I'm constantly on edge, waiting for something bad to happen.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Reliving it is hard, but... but I also feel a bit lighter? Like I've let something out that I've been holding in.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's down to about 60 now.",
    "Therapist: Well done. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end.",
    "Client: *breathes deeply* Thank you. This was tough, but... I think it helped.",
    "Therapist: You did excellently. How are you feeling about our next session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm nervous, but also a bit hopeful. I think I can do this.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. We'll continue next time. For now, use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, Priya. I'll see you next week."
