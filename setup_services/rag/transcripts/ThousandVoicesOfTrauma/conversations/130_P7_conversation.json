    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Are you ready to revisit the memory we discussed?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay. Well, I'm standing outside the compound. It's early morning, and there's a chill in the air. I can see my breath. The gates are still closed, but I know they'll open soon for the morning ritual. My stomach is in knots because I know what's coming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: As the gates open, I can hear chanting from inside. It's a low, droning sound that makes my skin crawl. I don't want to go in, but I know I have to. My wife is already inside, and I'm afraid of what might happen if I don't show up.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure I can do this. My heart is racing just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm walking through the gates now. The chanting is getting louder, and I can see people gathered in the center of the compound. They're all wearing white robes, and in the middle, there's... there's...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going if you can.",
    "Client: In the middle, there's an altar. And on it... oh God, there's a young woman tied down. She's crying and begging for help. I want to run, to do something, but I'm frozen in place. I can't move.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here now. You're safe.",
    "Client: I feel so helpless. The leader approaches the altar with a knife. He's saying something about purification and sacrifice. I can't bear to watch, but I can't look away either. The woman's screams... they haunt me to this day.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel sick. My hands are shaking, and I can feel sweat running down my back. It's like I'm right there again, watching it happen.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply.",
    "Client: It's hard to breathe. I keep seeing her face, hearing her screams. I should have done something. Why didn't I do anything?",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. You were in danger too.",
    "Client: But I was a coward. I just stood there while they... while they killed her. And then afterwards, everyone acted like nothing had happened. We were told it was necessary, that it was for the greater good. How could I have believed that?",
    "Therapist: You were manipulated. It wasn't your choice.",
    "Client: I know that now, but it doesn't make it any easier. I can still smell the incense, see the blood on the altar. It's all so vivid, even after all these years.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like sharing this has lifted some of the weight I've been carrying. It's still terrible, but talking about it makes it feel less like a nightmare and more like something that actually happened. Something I can maybe start to process.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It's still hard, and I feel guilty for surviving when others didn't, but I think I'm starting to understand that it wasn't my fault. I was a victim too, in a way.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. How do you feel about ending here?",
    "Client: I think that would be good. I'm exhausted, but I feel like I've made some progress. Is it normal to feel both drained and somewhat relieved at the same time?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's very common. You've done excellent work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your support through this. It's not easy, but I think it's helping. I'm looking forward to going home and just being with my wife. She's been so supportive through all of this.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad you have that support. Take care of yourself this week.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again. See you next time.",
    "Therapist: Take care. We'll continue our work in our next session."
