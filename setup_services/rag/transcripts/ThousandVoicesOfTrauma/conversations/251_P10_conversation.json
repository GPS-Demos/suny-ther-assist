    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to dive into some heavy stuff today, and I'm not sure I'm ready for it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Are you willing to try the imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. It's just... it brings back so many memories, you know? But I want to get better, so I'll give it a shot.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's start with a SUDS rating. How distressed are you feeling right now, 0 to 100?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 40? My heart's beating a bit fast, but I'm not panicking or anything.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Let's begin. Close your eyes and describe the scene as if it's happening now.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm... I'm on my way home from work. It's late, maybe around 10 PM. The streets are pretty empty, and it's dark except for the streetlights. I can hear my heels clicking on the pavement, and I'm walking quickly because I just want to get home.",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: I see... I see the buildings, mostly shops that are closed for the night. There's a group of guys hanging out on the corner, laughing loudly. I'm trying not to make eye contact, just focused on getting to my apartment.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... uneasy. My stomach's kind of tight, and I'm gripping my purse closer to my body. I keep glancing over my shoulder, you know?",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I hear sirens in the distance. They're getting louder. I see a police car speeding down the street, and it screeches to a halt near that group of guys. Two officers jump out, and they're yelling something I can't quite make out.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Maybe a 60? My heart's really pounding now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going. What do you see and hear?",
    "Client: I see the officers approaching the group. They're... they're aggressive, pushing one of the guys against the wall. I can hear him protesting, saying he didn't do anything wrong. The other guys are getting agitated, raising their voices.",
    "Therapist: Stay in the moment. What are you doing?",
    "Client: I've... I've stopped walking. I'm frozen in place, watching this unfold. I want to do something, say something, but I'm scared. I can feel my hands shaking.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Keep describing what's happening.",
    "Client: One of the officers is twisting the guy's arm behind his back. He's... he's crying out in pain. The other guys are yelling at the cops to stop, that they're hurting him. It's so loud, I can hear my own heartbeat in my ears.",
    "Therapist: How high is your distress now?",
    "Client: It's... it's pretty high. Maybe an 80? I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. The situation is escalating. One of the other guys tries to intervene, and the second officer immediately draws his gun. Everything seems to freeze for a moment. I can see the fear in everyone's eyes, even the officers'.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My... my whole body is tense. My fists are clenched, and I can feel this knot in my throat. I want to scream, to tell them to stop, but I'm paralyzed.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: It all happens so fast. There's a scuffle, and then... a gunshot. It's so loud, it echoes off the buildings. I see the guy who was trying to help his friend fall to the ground. There's... there's blood. So much blood.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. You're safe here. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's maxed out. 100. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here in the office, not there. Can you feel the chair beneath you?",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, I can. It helps a little.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue describing what you see.",
    "Client: Everything's chaos now. People are screaming, running. The officers look panicked. One of them is calling for backup, the other is trying to... to help the guy who was shot. But there's so much blood, and he's not moving.",
    "Therapist: What are you doing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm fumbling with my phone. My hands are shaking so badly I can barely dial 911. I'm trying to tell the dispatcher what happened, but I'm crying and my words are all jumbled.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... helpless. Angry. Terrified. I keep thinking, \"This can't be happening. This can't be real.\"",
    "Therapist: Those are normal reactions. What happens after you call 911?",
    "Client: More police cars arrive. An ambulance too. They're trying to clear the area, but people are gathering, shouting at the police. Someone recognizes me, asks if I saw what happened. I can barely nod.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: Still pretty high. Maybe 90? My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I give my statement to one of the officers. My voice is shaky, and I keep looking at the ambulance, hoping to see some sign that the guy is okay. But deep down, I know he's not.",
    "Therapist: How does giving your statement make you feel?",
    "Client: Conflicted. I want to tell the truth, but I'm also scared. What if they twist my words? What if they don't believe me? I feel like I'm betraying my community by talking to them, but I also feel like I have to speak up for what happened.",
    "Therapist: Those are complex feelings. It's okay to feel that way. What happens after you give your statement?",
    "Client: They let me go home, but... but I can't move. I just stand there, watching as they put up police tape, as more people gather. Someone starts a chant, \"No justice, no peace.\" I can feel the anger, the fear in the air.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind at this point?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... this could have been me. Or my brother. Or my husband. It's not fair. It's not right. And I feel... I feel guilty for not doing more, for not speaking up sooner.",
    "Therapist: Those are heavy thoughts. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe 75? I'm still shaky, but talking about it... it helps, somehow.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's continue. How does the night end?",
    "Client: I... I finally manage to walk home. My legs feel like jelly. When I get to my apartment, I just... I just break down. I cry for what feels like hours. I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see that guy falling, see the blood...",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction to trauma. How do you feel now, thinking about that night?",
    "Client: It's... it's still hard. I feel this mix of anger and sadness and helplessness. But... but I also feel like talking about it is important. Like maybe, by sharing what happened, something can change.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 60, I think. I'm still upset, but not as overwhelmed as before.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well today, Maria. How are you feeling about the exercise?",
    "Client: It was tough, really tough. But... I think it helped. It's like, by facing it head-on, it loses some of its power over me, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's exactly the goal. You showed a lot of courage today. Is there anything else you want to share before we end?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm making progress.",
    "Therapist: You absolutely are. Let's take a few deep breaths together to close out the session."
