    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. The memory of the airplane crash feels so vivid now. I can still hear the screeching of metal and smell the jet fuel. My heart is pounding, and my palms are sweaty. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's like I'm right back there, watching the plane go down. I keep thinking about all those people... their families... God, it's just too much. I feel guilty for surviving when so many others didn't. Why did I get to live?",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How does that guilt manifest for you?",
    "Client: It's like a heavy weight on my chest. I can barely breathe sometimes. I find myself avoiding anything related to air travel or even watching the news. I'm constantly on edge, waiting for something bad to happen. It's exhausting, you know? I feel like I don't deserve to be happy or move on with my life.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts come up when you allow yourself to feel that guilt?",
    "Client: I think about how I could have done more. Maybe if I had reacted faster, I could have helped more people. I keep replaying those moments over and over in my head, thinking of all the things I should have done differently. It's like a never-ending loop of \"what ifs\" and regrets.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you express these thoughts?",
    "Client: Tense. Really tense. My shoulders are all knotted up, and there's this tightness in my throat. I feel like I might cry, but I'm also trying to hold it back. It's like my body is fighting against itself. I just want to curl up into a ball and disappear.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to let those feelings out. What happens if you allow yourself to cry?",
    "Client: I... I'm afraid I won't be able to stop. It's like opening a floodgate, you know? I've been holding it in for so long. But as I sit here and really let myself feel it, the tears are starting to come. It's... it's actually a bit of a relief. Like some of the pressure is being released.",
    "Therapist: Mm. How does this release compare to your usual way of coping?",
    "Client: It's different. Usually, I try to push everything down, keep busy, avoid thinking about it. But that just makes the anxiety worse in the long run. This... this feels more raw, but also more real. Like I'm finally acknowledging what happened instead of running from it.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your breathing now?",
    "Client: It's... it's slower. Deeper. I didn't even realize how shallow my breathing was before. As I focus on it, I can feel some of the tension leaving my body. It's like I'm coming back to the present moment instead of being stuck in the memory.",
    "Therapist: Good. How does being in the present feel?",
    "Client: It's... calmer. I'm starting to notice things around me again - the color of the walls, the sound of traffic outside. The memory is still there, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming. It's like I'm watching it from a distance now, instead of reliving it.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you observe the memory from this new perspective?",
    "Client: I'm realizing that... maybe I did the best I could in an impossible situation. I couldn't control what happened, but I did try to help. I'm remembering some of the people I did manage to assist, the small acts of kindness in the chaos. It doesn't erase the tragedy, but it helps balance out some of the guilt.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How does that realization affect your view of yourself?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. Part of me still feels guilty, but there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe acceptance? Like, I can acknowledge both the pain of what happened and the fact that I'm not solely responsible for it. It's a strange mix of emotions, but it feels more balanced than before.",
    "Therapist: What do you think this means for your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I think... I think it means I'm starting to process things in a healthier way. Instead of avoiding or getting lost in the trauma, I'm learning to face it. It's scary and painful, but also... hopeful? Like maybe I can learn to live with what happened without letting it control my life. It's a small step, but it feels significant.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: Honestly? It's terrifying. But also necessary. I'm tired of living in fear and guilt. This session was tough, but I also feel like I've made some progress. I want to keep going, to see where this leads. Maybe... maybe I can finally start to heal.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to explore more of the guilt. Especially around my relationships. The crash affected how I interact with people, my divorce... I push people away because I'm afraid of losing them. Maybe we could work on that?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll address that next time. How are you feeling now as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted, but in a good way. Like I've done some hard but important work. I'm a bit shaky, but also... lighter? Like I've put down a heavy burden, even if just for a moment. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Remember to be kind to yourself."
