    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Ahmed?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. Going through that memory of the home invasion again, it's like I was right back there, you know? I could hear the glass breaking, smell the fear in the air. It's intense.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. I remember feeling so powerless, hiding in the closet with my wife, praying they wouldn't find us. I keep thinking about what could have happened if they had. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does that feeling connect to your daily life now?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... I'm always on edge. Even at work, I'm constantly looking over my shoulder, expecting something bad to happen. It's exhausting, really. I can't relax, can't focus. It's affecting my business, my relationships... everything.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit the memory today?",
    "Client: Honestly? Terrifying. But... also different somehow. Like, I knew I was safe here, even though my body was reacting as if I was in danger. It's strange, but I feel a little... I don't know, stronger maybe? Like I faced it and survived again.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant observation. What do you make of that?",
    "Client: I guess it shows I'm making progress? It's still awful to relive, but maybe I'm learning to separate the past from the present a bit better. It's hard to explain, but I feel like I have a tiny bit more control now.",
    "Therapist: How might this relate to your recovery goals?",
    "Client: Well, I want to feel safe again, to enjoy life without constantly being afraid. This... this gives me hope that maybe I can get there. It's a long road, but at least I can see some movement forward now.",
    "Therapist: What strategies helped you during the exposure?",
    "Client: The breathing exercises we practiced definitely helped. And reminding myself that I'm here, in your office, not back in that moment. It's... it's tough, but it's getting a little easier each time.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about continuing with these sessions?",
    "Client: It's challenging, no doubt. But I think... I think it's worth it. I want my life back, you know? I want to be present for my wife, to run my business without constant fear. So yeah, I'm in. It's hard, but I'm committed to seeing this through.",
    "Therapist: That's commendable. What support do you need moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe some more tools to manage the anxiety between sessions? And... and maybe we could talk more about how to reconnect with my wife? I feel like this whole thing has put a strain on our relationship.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll work on that. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... okay. Better than I expected, actually. There's this weird mix of exhaustion and... I don't know, maybe hope? It's like I can see a tiny light at the end of the tunnel now.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Any final thoughts before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I guess. For guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm not alone in this fight anymore. That means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue this work next session. Take care, Ahmed."
