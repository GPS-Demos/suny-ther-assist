    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sam?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. Reliving those cult experiences... it's intense. I feel drained, but also kind of... I don't know, maybe relieved? Like I've been holding my breath for years and I'm finally exhaling.",
    "Therapist: Mm. What stood out most?",
    "Client: The isolation, I think. Remembering how cut off I felt from everyone outside the group. It's funny, I thought I was so connected to something greater back then, but now I see how alone I really was. And the shame... God, the shame of realizing how much I'd bought into it all.",
    "Therapist: How does that compare to now?",
    "Client: It's... different. I mean, I still struggle with trust issues and feeling like an outsider sometimes. But I have my partner now, and a few close friends. It's not the same kind of isolation. Still, talking about it brings back those old feelings of being trapped and manipulated.",
    "Therapist: Noticed any physical reactions?",
    "Client: Yeah, my heart was racing during parts of it. Especially when I was describing the rituals and how scared I was to question anything. My palms got really sweaty too. It's like my body remembers even when my mind wants to forget.",
    "Therapist: How are you coping with those sensations?",
    "Client: I'm trying to use those grounding techniques we talked about. Focusing on my breath, reminding myself I'm here in your office, not back there. It helps, but... it's still hard. Sometimes I worry I'll never fully shake off those experiences.",
    "Therapist: Understandable. What's helping most?",
    "Client: Honestly? Just... talking about it. For so long, I felt like I couldn't tell anyone. Like they wouldn't understand or they'd judge me. But being able to say it out loud, to have someone listen without condemning me... it's powerful. It makes me feel less... I don't know, less tainted by it all.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress, Sam.",
    "Client: Thanks. It doesn't always feel like progress, you know? Some days it feels like I'm right back where I started. But then I remember how I couldn't even say the word 'cult' a few months ago without having a panic attack. So yeah, I guess I am moving forward.",
    "Therapist: What's challenging you most now?",
    "Client: The anger, I think. I'm starting to feel really angry at the people who led the cult, at myself for falling for it. And I don't know what to do with that anger. It feels... dangerous, somehow. Like if I let it out, I might not be able to control it.",
    "Therapist: How might you express it safely?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Writing, maybe? Or some kind of physical activity to burn off the energy? I used to box before all this happened. Maybe getting back into that could help. Is that... is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a good idea. How else has this affected you?",
    "Client: It's... it's everywhere, really. My relationships, my work, even how I see myself. I second-guess every decision, worried I'm being manipulated again. And the depression... it's like this constant weight. Some days it's lighter, but it's always there.",
    "Therapist: How are you managing that?",
    "Client: I'm trying to be kinder to myself. To remember that I was vulnerable when they found me, that it wasn't my fault. The medication helps with the worst of the depression. And talking to my partner... she's been amazing through all this. Patient, you know? But I still struggle with feeling worthy of that kindness.",
    "Therapist: That self-compassion is crucial. Next steps?",
    "Client: I want to keep pushing through these exposures. As hard as they are, I can feel them helping. And maybe... maybe start opening up to a few more people about my experiences. Not everyone, but... maybe my closest friends. I think I'm ready for that. Is that... does that sound right?",
    "Therapist: Trust your instincts, Sam. You're making progress.",
    "Client: Thanks. It means a lot to hear that. Sometimes I still feel so lost, but... I'm starting to see a way forward. It's not easy, but... I'm not giving up. I can't go back to who I was in the cult, but maybe I can build something new. Something better.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Shall we end here?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I've got a lot to process. But... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's making a difference, even when it doesn't feel like it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work, Sam. See you next week?",
    "Client: Definitely. See you then."
