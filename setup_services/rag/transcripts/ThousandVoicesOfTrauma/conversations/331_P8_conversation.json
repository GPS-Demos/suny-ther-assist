    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also foggy at the same time. The memory feels so vivid, like it just happened yesterday. I can still hear the shouting, see the anger in their eyes. My heart is pounding, and I feel this tightness in my chest.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... shame? I feel ashamed that I couldn't do anything to stop it. I was just frozen, watching it all unfold. And now, reliving it, I feel so helpless all over again. It's like I'm back there, powerless and small.",
    "Therapist: How does that helplessness manifest in your body?",
    "Client: My shoulders are tense, and I feel this heaviness in my stomach. It's like there's a weight pressing down on me. My hands are clammy, and I notice I'm clenching my jaw. I just want to curl up and disappear.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why didn't I do something?\" And then I feel angry at myself for not intervening. But I also know it wasn't safe to step in. I'm struggling with this conflict between what I wish I had done and what I actually could have done. And then there's this voice in my head saying, \"This is what happens to people like us. We're always targets.\"",
    "Therapist: How does that belief affect you?",
    "Client: It makes me feel... constantly on edge. Like I'm always waiting for the next bad thing to happen. I find myself scanning crowds, looking for potential threats. It's exhausting, really. And it makes me want to isolate myself, to avoid situations where I might be vulnerable again.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about that response?",
    "Client: I guess... it's a way of trying to protect myself. But it's also limiting my life in a lot of ways. I'm missing out on experiences because I'm so focused on avoiding danger. It's like the trauma is still controlling me, even though the actual event is in the past.",
    "Therapist: How does recognizing that impact you?",
    "Client: It's... eye-opening, actually. And a bit frustrating. I've been letting this fear dictate so much of my life. But at the same time, I'm not sure how to change it. The fear feels so ingrained, you know? Like it's become a part of who I am.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to challenge that fear?",
    "Client: Hmm... I suppose it would mean taking some risks. Maybe putting myself in situations that make me uncomfortable, but aren't actually dangerous. It's scary to think about, but also... I don't know, maybe a little exciting? Like I could reclaim some of the freedom I've lost.",
    "Therapist: How does that possibility feel?",
    "Client: It's a mix of emotions, really. There's hope there, definitely. The idea that I could live differently, that I don't have to be controlled by this trauma forever. But there's also anxiety. What if I try and fail? What if I can't overcome this fear? And then there's a part of me that feels... almost guilty? Like if I move past this, I'm somehow betraying my community or forgetting what happened.",
    "Therapist: Can you elaborate on that guilt?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... this experience is part of a larger pattern of racism and violence that my community faces. If I heal from it, am I turning my back on that reality? Am I forgetting the struggles that others are still going through? I want to move forward, but I also feel this responsibility to... I don't know, bear witness? To keep fighting against the injustice.",
    "Therapist: How might healing impact that fight?",
    "Client: I... I hadn't thought about it that way. I suppose if I were healthier, less burdened by fear and anxiety, I might actually be able to do more. To speak out more effectively, to support others who've been through similar experiences. Maybe healing isn't about forgetting or moving on, but about becoming stronger, more resilient.",
    "Therapist: What does that perspective open up for you?",
    "Client: It feels... liberating, actually. Like maybe I don't have to choose between healing and staying true to my experiences and my community. Maybe by working through this trauma, I'm not just helping myself, but potentially others too. It's a different way of honoring what happened, by refusing to let it define my future.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you consider this?",
    "Client: I notice my breathing has slowed down a bit. The tightness in my chest isn't as intense. There's still some tension in my shoulders, but overall, I feel... lighter? Like a small weight has been lifted. It's not all gone, but there's a sense of... possibility, I guess. Like maybe change is actually possible.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to take away from this session?",
    "Client: I think... this new perspective on healing. The idea that working through my trauma isn't selfish or a betrayal, but potentially a way to become stronger and more able to help others. And also, the realization of just how much this fear has been controlling my life. I want to start challenging that, bit by bit. It won't be easy, but for the first time in a while, I feel like it might be possible.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How will you remind yourself of this?",
    "Client: I think I'll write it down, actually. Maybe put it somewhere I can see it every day. And I want to talk about it with my wife. She's been so supportive through all of this, and I think sharing this new perspective with her will help reinforce it for me. Plus, maybe it'll help her understand some of my behaviors better.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great plan. Anything else?",
    "Client: No, I think that covers it. This session has been... intense, but also really enlightening. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know we still have a lot of work to do, but I'm feeling more hopeful than I have in a long time.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. We'll continue next week."
