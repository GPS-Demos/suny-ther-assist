    "Therapist: Welcome back, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I know we're going to be talking about the cyber bullying incident again, and it still makes me anxious.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'll try to keep that in mind. It's just... every time I think about those messages, my heart starts racing.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Okay... So, it started about six months ago. I had just launched my online business, and I was really excited about it. But then, out of nowhere, these anonymous accounts started leaving horrible comments on my posts. They were calling me a fraud, saying my products were cheap knock-offs, and even making threats about ruining my reputation.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: It was relentless. Every day, I'd wake up to new notifications, and my stomach would just drop. I started dreading checking my phone or computer. The worst part was, I couldn't figure out who was behind it. Was it a competitor? Someone I knew? It made me paranoid about everyone around me.",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly difficult. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: I tried to ignore it at first, but it just got worse. They started creating fake accounts pretending to be dissatisfied customers, leaving bad reviews everywhere. I could feel my dream slipping away. I... I'm sorry, I'm getting really upset.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I just felt so helpless. I reported the accounts, but new ones would pop up. I couldn't sleep, I was constantly on edge. My husband tried to help, but he didn't really understand how much it was affecting me. I started having panic attacks, sometimes multiple times a day.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: The worst day was when they somehow got my personal email and started sending threats directly to me. They said they knew where I lived, that they were watching me. I was terrified to leave my house. I felt like my whole world was crumbling around me.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly frightening. You're very strong for sharing this.",
    "Client: I ended up shutting down my website and social media accounts. I couldn't take it anymore. But even after that, I was still paranoid. I kept thinking they would find other ways to harass me. I felt like a failure, like I had let everyone down, including myself.",
    "Therapist: You didn't fail. You're showing immense courage right now.",
    "Client: It's been months, but I still have nightmares about it. I'm afraid to start my business again, even though I want to. Every time I think about going online, I get this overwhelming sense of dread. I feel stuck, like I can't move forward.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel that way. You're processing a traumatic experience.",
    "Client: I just want to feel safe again. I want to be able to pursue my dreams without this constant fear hanging over me. But I don't know how to get past this.",
    "Therapist: You're taking important steps right now. Keep going.",
    "Client: I guess... I'm angry too. Angry that someone would do this, angry at myself for letting it affect me so much. I feel like I've lost a part of myself, you know? Like my confidence is just... gone.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel angry. You're working through it.",
    "Client: Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel normal again. Will I always be looking over my shoulder? Will I ever be able to trust people online again? It's exhausting living like this.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible resilience. Trust the process.",
    "Client: I want to believe that, but it's hard. Some days are better than others, but then something will trigger me - a notification sound, a random comment online - and I'm right back there, feeling helpless and scared. I hate that they still have this power over me.",
    "Therapist: You're reclaiming your power by facing this. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I need a moment. This is more difficult than I expected.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take your time. You're doing great."
