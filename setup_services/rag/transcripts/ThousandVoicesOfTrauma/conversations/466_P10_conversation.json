    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. The idea of reliving that plane crash... it's making my heart race already.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Uh, I'd say about a 6 out of 10. My palms are sweaty, and I feel a bit shaky.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. When you're ready, begin describing the event.",
    "Client: Right... okay. I'm at the airport. It's early morning, and I'm rushing to catch my flight. The terminal is busy, people everywhere. I can smell coffee and hear the constant chatter of announcements.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: I make it to the gate just in time. As I board the plane, I notice how cramped it feels. The air is stuffy, and I can smell that distinct airplane smell - a mix of cleaning products and recycled air.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling as you find your seat?",
    "Client: I'm feeling relieved that I made it, but also a bit anxious. Flying always makes me nervous, you know? I buckle up and try to get comfortable in the narrow seat.",
    "Therapist: Continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: We take off, and everything seems normal at first. I'm trying to distract myself by reading a magazine, but I can't focus. The plane starts to shake a bit - just turbulence, I think. But then... then it gets worse.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What do you notice?",
    "Client: The shaking intensifies. People start to murmur, looking around nervously. I can hear the fear in their voices. My heart is pounding so hard I can barely hear anything else. The oxygen masks drop down, and that's when I know we're in real trouble.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe even a 9. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Remember, you're here in the room with me. You're safe.",
    "Client: *takes a deep breath* Okay... okay. I'm putting on the oxygen mask with shaking hands. The plane is lurching violently now. I can hear people crying, praying. The flight attendants are trying to keep calm, but I can see the panic in their eyes.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: There's a deafening noise - metal screeching, alarms blaring. We're losing altitude fast. I'm gripping the armrests so hard my knuckles are white. I... I think about my family, how I never got to say goodbye. The ground is coming up so fast...",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I'm terrified. I can't believe this is how it ends. I feel so helpless, so small. Everything's happening so fast, but it also feels like time is standing still. I close my eyes, brace for impact...",
    "Therapist: And then?",
    "Client: The impact is... it's brutal. The force throws me forward against my seatbelt. There's a horrible crunching sound, and I feel a sharp pain in my chest. Everything goes dark for a moment. When I come to, there's smoke everywhere. People are screaming, crying out for help.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I unbuckle my seatbelt with trembling hands. My body aches all over, but adrenaline is kicking in. I see flames at the back of the plane. I need to get out. I stumble towards the nearest exit, trying to help others along the way. The smoke is so thick, I can barely see.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, describing this?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. My heart's racing, and I feel a bit lightheaded. But I'm okay. I can continue.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great. What happens as you reach the exit?",
    "Client: The door is jammed. I'm panicking, thinking we're trapped. But then, someone - I think it's one of the flight attendants - manages to force it open. The sudden rush of fresh air is almost overwhelming. We start helping people out onto the wing.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice around you?",
    "Client: It's chaos. The landscape around us is torn up from the crash. I can hear sirens in the distance. The heat from the fire is intense, and there's this acrid smell of fuel and smoke. People are coughing, crying, calling out for loved ones.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in shock, I think. There's this surreal feeling, like it can't be real. But at the same time, every sensation is so vivid. I'm scared, but also... grateful to be alive. There's this weird mix of terror and relief.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I help a few more people off the plane. My hands are shaking, but I'm focused on getting everyone out. We move away from the wreckage as the fire spreads. I can hear the structure of the plane groaning, threatening to collapse.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8. My heart's pounding, and I feel a bit nauseous remembering it all.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a moment. Breathe.",
    "Client: *takes a deep breath* Okay... As we get further from the plane, I start to realize the extent of what's happened. There are injured people everywhere. I see some who didn't make it... it's... it's awful. I feel helpless, wishing I could do more.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I try to help where I can. Comforting people, helping the injured. Emergency services start to arrive - firefighters, paramedics. It's a flurry of activity. I'm asked questions, checked for injuries. Everything feels like a blur.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel during all this?",
    "Client: I'm shaking uncontrollably. My chest hurts from the impact and from breathing in the smoke. I feel dizzy, probably from the shock. But there's also this surge of energy - like my body won't let me rest until I know everyone's safe.",
    "Therapist: What happens as things start to calm down?",
    "Client: As the immediate danger passes, the reality starts to sink in. I sit on the ground, watching the emergency teams work. I'm cold, despite the heat from the fire. Someone puts a blanket around my shoulders. I start to cry - just silent tears at first, then these deep, wracking sobs.",
    "Therapist: That's a natural reaction. How do you feel now, remembering that moment?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. I feel a lump in my throat, and my eyes are stinging. But it's not as overwhelming as it used to be. I can talk about it without feeling like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's come down a bit. Maybe a 6 or 7. It's still intense, but I feel more in control.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Let's continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: We're all taken to a nearby hospital. It's a whirlwind of tests, questions, and phone calls. I remember calling my family, trying to explain what happened. I could barely get the words out. The relief in their voices... it made me break down again.",
    "Therapist: How did you cope in the following days?",
    "Client: It was... tough. I couldn't sleep without having nightmares. Every loud noise made me jump. I felt guilty for surviving when others didn't. But I also felt this intense appreciation for life. It was confusing, all these conflicting emotions.",
    "Therapist: That's common after such a traumatic event. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. My heart rate has slowed down. Talking about it... it's not easy, but it doesn't feel impossible anymore. I think I'm starting to process it better.",
    "Therapist: You've done extremely well today. Let's end the exposure here. What's your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: I'd say it's down to a 4 now. I feel drained, but also... lighter, somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves before we wrap up.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you... this was hard, but I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: You're very welcome. You've shown great courage today."
