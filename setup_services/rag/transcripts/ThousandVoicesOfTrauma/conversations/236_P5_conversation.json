    "Therapist: Welcome, Amira. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Thompson. I'm... I'm not sure. A bit nervous, I guess. I've been thinking about this session all week, and I'm not sure what to expect.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's talk about today's plan.",
    "Client: Okay... Is it going to be about the war experiences? Because I'm really not sure I'm ready for that. Just thinking about it makes my heart race.",
    "Therapist: We'll focus on imaginal exposure. It's a crucial step in your recovery.",
    "Client: Imaginal exposure? What exactly does that mean? It sounds... intimidating.",
    "Therapist: It involves revisiting your trauma memory in a safe environment.",
    "Client: Revisit the memory? I... I don't know if I can do that. I've spent so long trying to forget. What if I can't handle it?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace and I'll support you throughout.",
    "Client: I appreciate that, but... I'm scared. What if I have a panic attack or something? And how will this even help me? I mean, I've been dealing with cyberbullying lately, and that's been hard enough. Going back to the war memories feels like too much.",
    "Therapist: This process helps reduce PTSD symptoms over time. Your bravery is commendable.",
    "Client: I don't feel brave at all. I feel terrified. But I want to get better. I'm tired of feeling this way, of the nightmares and the constant anxiety. It's affecting everything - my work, my relationships. I couldn't even stay married... Do you really think this will help?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it's proven effective. We'll start small and build gradually.",
    "Client: Okay... I trust you, Dr. Thompson. Can you tell me more about what exactly we'll be doing? And what should I expect to feel?",
    "Therapist: You'll describe a trauma memory. Emotions may intensify, but they'll subside.",
    "Client: That sounds scary, but I understand. Will you be there the whole time? And what if it gets too overwhelming?",
    "Therapist: I'll be here throughout. We can pause anytime you need.",
    "Client: Alright. I'm still nervous, but I'm willing to try. Thank you for explaining it to me. Is there anything I should do to prepare myself?",
    "Therapist: Just be open and honest. Your courage is the key ingredient.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot. I've felt so alone in this, especially living by myself now. It's comforting to know you'll be there. I'm ready to take this step, even if it's scary.",
    "Therapist: Your resilience is admirable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do this. I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Thank you for your support, Dr. Thompson."
