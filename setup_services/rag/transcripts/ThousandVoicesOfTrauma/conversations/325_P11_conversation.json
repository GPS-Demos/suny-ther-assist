    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving that moment when I saw my ex-husband become violent... it's bringing up a lot of emotions I thought I'd buried.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The fear. It was so visceral, you know? I could feel my heart racing, just like it did that day. And the helplessness... I felt so small and powerless watching him lose control like that.",
    "Therapist: How does that connect to your current experiences?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... I still feel that fear sometimes, even though I'm divorced now. Like, I'll hear a loud noise or someone will raise their voice, and suddenly I'm right back there. It's frustrating because logically I know I'm safe now, but my body doesn't seem to get the message.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. How did it feel to revisit the memory today?",
    "Client: It was tough, really tough. But... also different, somehow. Like, I could see it more clearly? Does that make sense? Before, it was just this big, scary blur. Now I can pick out details, like the color of the walls or the sound of traffic outside. It's still painful, but it feels... I don't know, more manageable maybe?",
    "Therapist: That's an important observation. What else did you notice?",
    "Client: I realized how much anger I still have. Not just at him, but at myself too. For not leaving sooner, for not seeing the signs. I know that's not fair, but it's there.",
    "Therapist: It's good you're recognizing those feelings. How might this relate to your depression?",
    "Client: Oh, wow. I hadn't thought about that connection. But yeah, I guess... carrying all this anger and fear around, it's exhausting. No wonder I feel so drained and hopeless sometimes. It's like I'm still living in that moment, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful connection. What do you think about that?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually kind of empowering, in a weird way? Like, if I can work through these trauma memories, maybe I can start to shake off some of the depression too. It's all connected, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: That's a great perspective. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's scary, for sure. But I think... I think I need to do this. For myself, for my kids. I want to be present in my life, not stuck in the past. It's hard, but I can see how it might help. And honestly? Just being able to talk about it like this, without falling apart completely... that feels like progress.",
    "Therapist: It absolutely is. What's one thing you'll take away from today?",
    "Client: Hmm... I think... the idea that facing these memories doesn't have to destroy me. It's painful, yeah, but I'm stronger than I thought. And maybe, just maybe, by working through this, I can start to feel more like myself again. Less anxious, less depressed. It's a long road, but... I think I'm ready to walk it.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How will you care for yourself tonight?",
    "Client: I think I'll take a long bath, maybe call my sister. Just... be gentle with myself, you know? And remind myself that I'm safe now, that I'm doing this hard work for a reason. And maybe write a bit in my journal about what we talked about today. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Those sound like excellent self-care strategies. Anything else you want to discuss?",
    "Client: No, I think... I think I'm good for now. This was intense, but... good. Thank you for guiding me through it. I know we have more work to do, but I'm feeling... cautiously optimistic? Is that the right phrase?",
    "Therapist: It's perfect. You did great today, Sarah. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, definitely. Thank you again. I'll see you next week."
