    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and describe the hostage situation.",
    "Client: Okay... We were on patrol when suddenly... gunfire erupted. We took cover behind some abandoned vehicles. The air was thick with dust and the smell of gunpowder. I could hear shouting in a language I didn't understand. Then I saw them... three of our team members being dragged away at gunpoint.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably a 6. My heart's starting to race a bit.",
    "Therapist: Thanks. Keep going.",
    "Client: We were outnumbered. I wanted to help, but our commanding officer ordered us to hold position. I felt so... helpless. The hostage-takers disappeared into a nearby building with our people. We could hear muffled screams...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to an 8. I can feel my palms getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: We waited for what felt like hours. The sun was beating down, and I could taste sand in my mouth. Every noise made me jump. I kept imagining what they might be doing to our teammates. Then we heard a single gunshot from inside the building...",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: Nine... definitely a nine. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Right... okay. After the gunshot, everything went quiet. Too quiet. We were preparing for the worst when suddenly our radios crackled. It was one of the hostages!

But then I saw the body of one of the hostage-takers... and I realized... I realized it was just a kid. Couldn't have been more than 16...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually dropped to a 7. Talking about the rescue... it helped a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's good. How are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: My breathing's a bit calmer, but I still feel tense. Like I'm ready to jump into action at any moment.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. Let's continue.",
    "Client: After we got everyone out, the debriefing was intense. Everyone was talking about how brave the hostages were, how smoothly the rescue went. But all I could think about was that kid... and how close we came to losing our people. I felt... I don't know... guilty? For feeling relieved when someone had died?",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: Back up to an 8. Thinking about the aftermath is... it's tough.",
    "Therapist: I understand. You're handling this well.",

    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually down to a 6. Talking about it... it helps. Makes it feel less overwhelming somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How do you feel about stopping here?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think that's good. I feel... drained, but also a bit lighter? If that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: It absolutely does. You did excellent work today."
