    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's a bit overwhelming, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel a tightness in my chest. The memory of my ex-wife telling me she wanted a divorce... it's like I'm right back there in our living room, hearing those words again. I can see the pain in her eyes, mixed with determination. It's strange how vivid it all is, even after all these years.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how I failed. Failed as a husband, failed to see the signs. I wonder if I could have done something differently, you know? Maybe if I'd been more attentive, or worked less... But then I also feel angry. Angry that she gave up on us, angry that she didn't try harder to make it work. It's... it's a confusing mix of emotions.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you're experiencing these thoughts?",
    "Client: My shoulders feel tense, like I'm carrying a heavy weight. There's this knot in my stomach that won't go away. And my throat... it feels tight, like I'm trying to hold back tears. It's funny, I didn't cry when she told me she wanted a divorce, but now, years later, I feel like I could break down at any moment.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's sadness. A deep, aching sadness. Not just for the end of my marriage, but for the life I thought I'd have. We had plans, you know? We talked about growing old together, traveling the world when we retired. And now, here I am, 67 and alone. It's not just the loss of her, but the loss of that future we'd imagined together.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your childhood experiences?",
    "Client: Oh... wow. I hadn't thought about that, but... I guess it does remind me of when my parents separated when I was young. That same feeling of abandonment, of not being good enough. I remember thinking then that if I was just a better son, maybe they'd stay together. And now, with my divorce, I had that same thought - if I was just a better husband, she might have stayed.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about that pattern?",
    "Client: I... I suppose I've always put the burden on myself, haven't I? Always thinking that if I was just \"better\" somehow, people wouldn't leave. It's like I'm that little boy again, thinking he can control whether adults stay or go. But that's not really how it works, is it? People make their own choices, for their own reasons.",
    "Therapist: How does recognizing that feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a bit liberating. Don't get me wrong, it's still painful. But there's a part of me that feels lighter, realizing that maybe it wasn't all my fault. That I'm not solely responsible for every relationship that ends. It's a strange mix of relief and sadness.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much I've been holding onto this pain, this idea that I'm somehow fundamentally flawed or unlovable. It's colored so many of my interactions since the divorce. I've been hesitant to form close relationships, always waiting for the other shoe to drop. But maybe... maybe I don't have to live like that anymore.",
    "Therapist: How might things be different if you didn't carry that belief?",
    "Client: I think... I think I might be more open to new relationships. Not just romantic ones, but friendships too. I've been so guarded, so afraid of being hurt again. But if I can accept that relationships ending doesn't mean I'm inherently flawed... maybe I can allow myself to connect with people again. It's scary to think about, but also... exciting, in a way.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you consider that possibility?",
    "Client: There's a part of me that feels hopeful, for the first time in a long while. Like maybe it's not too late to build a new life, to find happiness again. But there's also fear. What if I'm wrong? What if I open myself up and get hurt again? It's like I'm standing on the edge of something, and I'm not sure if I should step back or jump forward.",
    "Therapist: How would you like to approach that uncertainty?",
    "Client: I... I think I want to try. To take small steps forward. Maybe start by reconnecting with old friends, or joining a community group. Something low-stakes to start with. I'm realizing that isolating myself hasn't really protected me from pain - it's just kept me from experiencing joy too. And I... I want to feel joy again, even if it comes with the risk of pain.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a significant shift. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter. Like a weight has been lifted. There's still sadness there, and fear, but also a glimmer of hope. It's like I can see a path forward now, even if it's a bit foggy. And I'm grateful, you know? Grateful for this chance to work through these feelings, to understand myself better. It's not easy, but... I think it's worth it.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to remember from today's session?",
    "Client: I want to remember that I'm not defined by my past relationships or traumas. That it's okay to open myself up to new connections, even if it's scary. And most importantly, that I'm not responsible for other people's choices - I can only control my own actions and reactions. It's a lot to take in, but it feels like an important realization.",
    "Therapist: How would you like to care for yourself after this session?",
    "Client: I think I need some quiet time to process all of this. Maybe I'll take a walk in the park near my home. There's something soothing about being in nature, and I think it might help me reflect on everything we've talked about. And perhaps... perhaps I'll reach out to an old friend, just to say hello. Baby steps, right?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful plan. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up?",
    "Client: No, I think... I think I've said everything I need to for now. This session has given me a lot to think about, and I'm feeling both drained and oddly energized. Thank you for guiding me through this. It wasn't easy, but I feel like I've made some real progress today.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. We'll continue next week."
