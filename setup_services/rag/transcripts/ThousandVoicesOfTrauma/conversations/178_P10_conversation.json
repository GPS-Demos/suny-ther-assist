    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Singh. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to be talking about some difficult things today, and I'm not sure how I'll handle it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Can you tell me your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10. Not too bad, but definitely feeling some tension.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Let's begin. Close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm... I'm at the protest. It's a warm day, and I can feel the sun on my face. There are people all around me, holding signs and chanting. I can smell sweat and hear the rumble of voices. My heart is starting to beat faster as I see the line of police officers in riot gear approaching.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What's happening now?",
    "Client: The crowd is getting louder. Someone near me shouts, \"No justice, no peace!\" I join in, my voice cracking a bit. The police are getting closer, and I can see their faces now. They look... angry. Determined. I'm starting to feel scared.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 6 now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue.",
    "Client: Right... um... Suddenly, there's a loud bang. I think it's a flash-bang grenade. People start screaming and running. I'm frozen for a moment, then I start to move too. But it's chaos. I can't... I can't breathe properly. The air is thick with tear gas.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What do you see? What do you feel?",
    "Client: I see... I see people falling. Someone bumps into me hard, and I stumble. My eyes are burning, and I'm coughing. I'm trying to find a way out, but everywhere I turn, there are bodies pressing against me. I hear shouting, crying... God, I'm so scared.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're here, safe in my office.",
    "Client: Yeah... okay... I... I see a young man next to me get hit with a baton. He falls, and I try to help him up. But then a police officer grabs me. His grip is so tight, it hurts. I can smell the leather of his gloves, feel the rough texture of his uniform.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking, \"This can't be happening. Not here, not in America.\" I'm... I'm angry, but mostly terrified. I try to tell the officer I wasn't doing anything wrong, but he's not listening. He's shoving me towards a police van.",
    "Therapist: And how does your body feel?",
    "Client: My heart is pounding so hard I can hear it. My mouth is dry, and I'm shaking. I feel... helpless. Like I'm back in school, being bullied all over again. But this time, it's worse because these are people who are supposed to protect us.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. Maybe even a 9.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... I'm in the van now. It's dark and cramped. There are others here too, all of us scared and confused. Someone is crying softly. I can taste blood in my mouth - I must have bit my lip. The van starts moving, and I... I feel like I'm going to be sick.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: We... we arrive at the police station. They process us like criminals. Fingerprints, mugshots. I keep trying to explain that I was just protesting peacefully, but no one listens. They put me in a cell. It's cold and smells of disinfectant and sweat.",
    "Therapist: How long are you there?",
    "Client: It feels like forever. Hours pass. I'm worried about my family, my job. What if I lose everything because of this? I... I start to cry. I can't help it. I feel so... so powerless.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe a 7 or 8.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Take another deep breath. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... Eventually, they let me make a phone call. I call my wife. Her voice... God, hearing her voice nearly breaks me. She's worried sick. I try to explain what happened, but I'm stumbling over my words. I feel ashamed, even though I know I didn't do anything wrong.",
    "Therapist: What does that shame feel like?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a weight in my stomach. Like I've let everyone down. My parents came to this country for a better life, and here I am, in a jail cell. I feel like I've failed them, failed my community.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you were standing up for what you believe in.",
    "Client: Yeah... you're right. I know that, logically. But in that moment, all I can feel is fear and shame. They keep us there overnight. I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see the angry faces of the police officers, hear the screams of the protesters.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel during this time?",
    "Client: Tense. So tense it hurts. My shoulders are up to my ears, my jaw is clenched. I have a headache that won't go away. And I'm exhausted, but too wired to sleep.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe a 6?",
    "Therapist: Good. You're doing great. What happens in the morning?",
    "Client: They finally release us. No charges, they say, but it feels like a warning. When I step outside, the sunlight hurts my eyes. I see my wife waiting for me, and I... I break down. I hug her so tight, like I'm afraid she'll disappear if I let go.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to be reunited with her?",
    "Client: Relief. Overwhelming relief. But also... I don't know. I feel changed. Like the world isn't as safe as I thought it was. I keep looking over my shoulder, expecting to see a police officer coming for me.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction to trauma. How are you feeling now, reliving this?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. My heart is still racing a bit. But... I don't know. There's something... cathartic about talking about it like this. Like I'm finally letting it out.",
    "Therapist: That's good. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 4 now, I think.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay...",
    "Therapist: Now, slowly open your eyes. Look around the room. Can you name five things you see?",
    "Client: Um... I see your desk, the bookshelf, the window, the plant in the corner, and the clock on the wall.",
    "Therapist: Good. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also... lighter? Like I've put down a heavy burden I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's normal after an intense session like this. Well done today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It... it wasn't easy, but I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: You showed great courage. Let's talk about self-care for the rest of the day.",
    "Client: Okay. I think... I think I'll call my wife when I get home. Maybe we can have a quiet evening together.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Remember to be kind to yourself.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you, doctor. Same time next week?",
    "Therapist: Yes, I'll see you then. Take care, Mr. Singh."
