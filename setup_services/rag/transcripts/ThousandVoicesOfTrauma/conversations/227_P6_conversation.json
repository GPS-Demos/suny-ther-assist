    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's begin when you're comfortable.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm back in our old neighborhood. It's late afternoon, and I'm playing outside with my friends. Suddenly, I hear shouting from the house next door. My stomach tightens as I recognize Mr. Johnson's angry voice. I freeze, not sure what to do.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4. I'm tense, but it's manageable.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue.",
    "Client: The shouting gets louder. I hear something crash inside the house. My friends look scared and start to leave. I want to run too, but my feet won't move. Then I see Mrs. Johnson stumble out the front door, her face bruised and tear-stained. My heart's pounding now.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. I can feel my palms sweating.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Mr. Johnson follows her out, still yelling. He grabs her arm roughly, and she cries out in pain. I want to help, but I'm terrified. I can't breathe properly. My chest feels so tight.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it if you can.",
    "Client: I... I see him raise his hand to hit her. I close my eyes, but I can still hear the impact and her scream. I'm shaking all over. I feel so helpless, so guilty for not doing anything.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's a 9. I feel like I'm right back there. My heart's racing.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're safe here. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: I open my eyes, and Mrs. Johnson is on the ground. Mr. Johnson storms back inside. I want to run to her, but I'm frozen in place. I feel sick to my stomach. The guilt is overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Current SUDS?",
    "Client: Still a 9. I can't shake this feeling of dread and shame.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Let's stay with it a bit longer.",
    "Client: I finally find the courage to move. I run inside my house and tell my mom what happened. She calls the police, but by the time they arrive, Mr. Johnson is gone. I see Mrs. Johnson being taken away in an ambulance. I feel so angry and scared.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's starting to come down a bit. Maybe a 7?",
    "Therapist: That's good. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Drained. Sad. But also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved to have talked about it?",
    "Therapist: That's common. Well done for getting through that.",
    "Client: Thanks. It was tough, but I'm glad I did it. I didn't think I could face those memories.",
    "Therapist: You showed great courage. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Better. My heart's slowing down. I feel more... present.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. Let's take a few deep breaths together."
