    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like my whole body is vibrating. I can still see the scene so vividly in my mind - the dark room, the chanting, the smell of incense. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... guilt? I feel guilty for not doing anything to stop what was happening. I was just frozen, watching it all unfold.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. Can you tell me more about that guilt?",
    "Client: It's like... I should have known better. I was an adult, I should have seen the red flags. But I was so caught up in the promise of belonging, of finding answers. I let myself be manipulated, and I stood by while others were hurt. I can't shake the feeling that I'm responsible somehow.",
    "Therapist: Where do you feel that guilt in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a heavy weight in my chest. It's making it hard to breathe. And my stomach is in knots. I feel nauseous just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep hearing the leader's voice, telling us that we were special, chosen. But now I realize how twisted it all was. I'm thinking about how easily I fell for it all, how I ignored my instincts. I'm wondering if I'll ever be able to trust my own judgment again.",
    "Therapist: How does that uncertainty about trusting yourself affect you?",
    "Client: It's... it's crippling. I second-guess every decision now. I'm constantly worried that I'm being fooled or manipulated. It's exhausting, always being on guard like that. I miss the confidence I used to have in myself.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing about your reactions?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm angry. Really angry. At the cult leaders for their manipulation, but also at myself for being so gullible. I want to scream, to hit something. But at the same time, I feel this deep sadness. It's like I'm mourning the person I used to be before all of this.",
    "Therapist: How does expressing that anger feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually kind of liberating. I've been holding it in for so long, trying to just move on and forget. But acknowledging it, letting myself feel it... it's like a release. My shoulders feel less tense now.",
    "Therapist: What do you make of that release?",
    "Client: I... I think maybe I've been too hard on myself. Trying to just push everything down and pretend it didn't affect me. But it did. It changed me. And maybe... maybe that's okay. Maybe I need to accept that and work through it instead of fighting it.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... it's both scary and comforting. Scary because it means facing everything head-on. But comforting because... well, it feels more honest. Like I'm finally being true to myself and my experiences.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean for your recovery to embrace that honesty?",
    "Client: I think... I think it would mean finally letting go of the shame. Accepting that I was vulnerable, that I made mistakes, but that doesn't define me. It would mean allowing myself to heal, truly heal, instead of just trying to bury everything.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you consider that?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a warmth spreading through my chest. The knot in my stomach is loosening a bit. I feel... lighter somehow. Like I can breathe a little easier.",
    "Therapist: What does that lightness mean to you?",
    "Client: It feels like... hope, I guess. Like maybe there's a way forward from all of this. That I don't have to be trapped by my past forever. It's a small feeling, but it's there.",
    "Therapist: How might you nurture that feeling of hope?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to be kinder to myself. To acknowledge the progress I've made, even when it feels small. And maybe... maybe I need to start trusting myself again, bit by bit. Trusting that I can make good decisions, that I can recognize manipulation now.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you could take towards that?",
    "Client: I... I could start by making a decision each day, something small, and then reflecting on it. Like what to have for lunch, or what route to take on my walk. Just to practice trusting my own judgment again.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea feel?",
    "Client: It feels... manageable. Not overwhelming. Like something I could actually do. And it feels... empowering, I guess. Like I'm taking back control, even if it's just in small ways.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... tired, but in a good way. Like I've done some hard work. My body feels more relaxed than when we started. And I feel... I don't know, maybe a little proud of myself for facing this memory head-on. It wasn't easy, but I did it.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. How would you like to close our session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to take a few deep breaths. To ground myself before I leave. And maybe... maybe remind myself that I'm safe now, that I've come a long way. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's do that together."
