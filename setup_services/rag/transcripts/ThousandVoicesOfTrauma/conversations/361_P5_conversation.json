    "Therapist: Welcome, John. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm honestly a bit nervous. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of reliving those moments from the cyclone... it's intimidating. I've spent so long trying to push those memories away, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about losing control. What if I can't handle it? What if I break down completely? I've worked hard to build my business and life after the divorce, and I'm scared this might set me back.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How can I support you today?",
    "Client: I guess... I need to know that you'll be here to guide me through it. That if it gets too intense, we can stop. And maybe some reassurance that this won't undo all the progress I've made in my life?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll go at your pace, and can pause anytime. This is to help you heal, not regress.",
    "Client: Okay, that helps. But I'm still curious - how exactly is reliving this trauma supposed to help me? It seems counterintuitive.",
    "Therapist: Great question. Exposure helps process memories safely, reducing their power over you. Shall I explain further?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think understanding the process might help me feel more in control.",
    "Therapist: It allows your brain to reprocess the trauma, integrating it as a past event rather than a current threat.",
    "Client: That makes sense. I've noticed how the memories still feel so fresh, like they're happening now. So this could help change that?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. Over time, revisiting memories can decrease their emotional intensity. Ready to start?",
    "Client: I think so. Just... promise you'll be right here with me? I've never really talked about this with anyone before.",
    "Therapist: I promise. You're showing immense courage. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Okay. Yes, let's do this. I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Where do we start?",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. When you're ready, describe the day of the cyclone."
