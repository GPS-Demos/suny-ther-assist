    "Therapist: Welcome. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. There's a part of me that wants to dive in, you know? But there's also this knot in my stomach. It's like my body is telling me to run, but my mind knows I need to face this.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start slowly. Can you describe where you were before the airplane crash?",
    "Client: Right, okay. Um... I was at the airport in Fiji. It was supposed to be the start of my dream vacation, you know? I remember the heat as soon as I stepped out of the taxi. The air was thick with humidity, and there was this sweet smell of tropical flowers mixed with jet fuel.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Uh, maybe a 3? I'm okay talking about the airport.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: So, I'm walking into the small airport. It's crowded, lots of tourists in bright clothes. I'm lugging my backpack, feeling excited but also a bit anxious about the small plane we're taking to the outer islands. I remember thinking, \"Should I have just stayed on the main island?\"",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The noise. It's so loud. People chattering in different languages, announcements over the crackling speakers. I'm at the check-in counter now, handing over my passport. The attendant looks bored, barely glancing at me. I'm starting to sweat, partly from the heat, partly from nerves.",
    "Therapist: How's your anxiety level now?",
    "Client: It's creeping up. Maybe a 5?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: Right, deep breath. Okay... I'm walking towards the gate. It's more of a glorified waiting area, really. I can see the small plane through the windows. It looks... so tiny. My heart starts racing a bit. I'm thinking, \"Is it too late to back out?\"",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I sit down. My hands are shaky as I pull out my water bottle. I take a sip, trying to calm myself. There's a family nearby, kids laughing and playing. I envy their carefree attitude. The boarding call comes, and I feel this surge of adrenaline. Part excitement, part terror.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your SUDS level as you board?",
    "Client: It's... it's higher now. Maybe a 7? My mouth is dry, and I can feel my pulse in my ears.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Take another deep breath. What do you see as you board?",
    "Client: The... the stairs to the plane. They're metal, and they wobble slightly as I climb. The flight attendant greets me with a smile, but I can barely respond. I'm too focused on steadying my breathing. The inside of the plane is cramped. I have to duck my head. The seats are worn, and there's this musty smell mixed with something chemical... probably cleaning products.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going. What happens as you find your seat?",
    "Client: I'm by the window. I always choose the window seat, but now I'm regretting it. I can see the wing, how small it is. I'm fastening my seatbelt, and it feels too tight, constraining. People are still boarding, shuffling past. I close my eyes for a moment, trying to center myself.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling physically right now?",
    "Client: My... my heart is pounding. I can feel sweat trickling down my back. My fingers are tingling a bit. Is that normal? I feel like I can't get enough air.",
    "Therapist: That's anxiety. You're safe here. Try focusing on your breath. In for four, out for four.",
    "Client: Okay... *deep breath* That helps a little. The plane is full now. The engines start, and there's this vibration through the whole aircraft. We're taxiing, and I'm gripping the armrests so hard my knuckles are white. The take-off... oh god, the take-off is rough. We're bouncing, and I can hear the landing gear retracting. My stomach lurches.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're doing well. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. A 9, maybe? I feel like I might be sick.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Remember, you're here, safe in my office. Can you name five things you see around you right now?",
    "Client: Um... your desk, the plant in the corner, the clock on the wall, the bookshelf, and... and the painting of the ocean.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, can you continue? What happens next in the plane?",
    "Client: We're... we're leveling off. There's some turbulence, but it's not too bad. I'm starting to relax a little, thinking maybe it won't be so bad. Then... then there's this loud bang. The whole plane shakes. People are screaming. The oxygen masks drop down, and I'm fumbling to put mine on. My hands are shaking so badly.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... The plane is losing altitude fast. I can see the ocean getting closer through the window. The flight attendants are shouting instructions, but I can barely hear them over the roar of the wind and the engines. We're going down, and all I can think is, \"This is it. I'm going to die.\"",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's maxed out. A 10. I feel like I'm there again.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you survived. You're here now, safe. Can you feel your feet on the floor?",
    "Client: Yes... yes, I can.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep that connection. What happens in the final moments?",
    "Client: We hit the water. There's this deafening crash, and water starts pouring in immediately. I'm struggling with my seatbelt, panic taking over. Somehow, I get it undone. The plane is filling with water so fast. I'm fighting against the current, trying to find a way out. My lungs are burning. I need air.",
    "Therapist: Breathe with me. In... and out. You made it out.",
    "Client: *breathing heavily* I... I did. I found a crack in the fuselage. I don't know how, but I squeezed through. Then I was in the ocean, gasping for air, surrounded by debris. The shock of the cold water... it was like being hit all over again.",
    "Therapist: You're incredibly strong. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Drained. Shaky. But... also a bit proud? I've never been able to talk about it in this much detail before.",
    "Therapist: That's a huge accomplishment. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves. Can you tell me about your surroundings again?",
    "Client: Sure. I'm... I'm in your office. The leather of the chair is cool against my skin. I can hear the hum of the air conditioner. The clock is ticking softly. Your plant... it's a fern, isn't it? The leaves are so delicate.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. And how's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's coming down. Maybe a 6? I feel wrung out, but also... lighter somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's normal after an intense session. How about we do a quick relaxation exercise before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yes, please. That would be good.",
    "Therapist: Okay, let's start with some deep breathing...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Better. Calmer. I'm surprised I got through it all.",
    "Therapist: You did incredibly well. We'll end here for today. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we finish?",
    "Client: No, I think I'm okay. Thank you for guiding me through this. It was tough, but... I think it was important.",
    "Therapist: It absolutely was. You've made significant progress today. We'll continue to work through this in our next session. Take care of yourself this week.",
    "Client: I will. Thanks again.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. I'll see you next week."
