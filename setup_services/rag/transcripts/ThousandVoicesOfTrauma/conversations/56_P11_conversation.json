    "Therapist: How are you feeling after going through that memory today?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like I'm still there, you know? The sounds, the smells... they're all so vivid. I can still hear the cries of those women being loaded onto the trucks. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The helplessness. I felt so powerless watching it all unfold. As a soldier, I was trained to protect people, but in that moment, I couldn't do anything. I keep thinking about their faces, their fear. It's... it's haunting me.",
    "Therapist: How does that connect to your everyday life now?",
    "Client: I guess... I often feel that same sense of powerlessness, even in normal situations. Like at work, when I'm faced with a challenge, I sometimes freeze up, feeling like I can't make a difference. It's frustrating because I know I'm capable, but... that feeling of helplessness just takes over.",
    "Therapist: I see. What else did you notice during the exposure?",
    "Client: My heart was racing, and I felt this tightness in my chest. It's the same feeling I get when I have nightmares or flashbacks. But... but this time, I managed to stay present. I didn't completely lose myself in the memory. That's... that's progress, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How do you feel about that progress?",
    "Client: It's... it's a relief, actually. I mean, it's still incredibly difficult to go through these memories, but knowing that I can stay grounded... it gives me hope. Maybe I'm not as stuck as I thought I was.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What helped you stay present?",
    "Client: I focused on my breathing, like we've practiced. And... and I reminded myself that I'm here, in this room, safe. It's... it's not easy, but it's getting a little better each time.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great resilience. How might this help moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I think it might help me face other difficult situations. If I can handle revisiting these traumatic memories, maybe I can handle the day-to-day challenges better too. It's like... like I'm rebuilding my confidence, bit by bit.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent connection. What's your takeaway from today's session?",
    "Client: I guess... I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. And... and that even though these memories are painful, facing them doesn't break me. It's... it's hard work, but I'm making progress. I just... I just hope I can keep this momentum going.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about continuing with the therapy?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm committed to it. It's not easy, and sometimes I dread coming here because I know it'll be painful. But... but I also know it's helping. I want to reclaim my life, you know? I want to be present for my family, to enjoy my work again. So... so yeah, I'm in. It's tough, but I'm in.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is admirable. Shall we schedule our next session?",
    "Client: Yes, please. And... thank you. For guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't judge. I know I have a long way to go, but... but I'm grateful for your support.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. I'll see you next week, same time?",
    "Client: Yes, that works. I'll... I'll try to practice some of the coping techniques we've discussed between now and then. Is there anything specific you think I should focus on?",
    "Therapist: Continue with your breathing exercises. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That sounds good. I've found them helpful, especially when I'm feeling overwhelmed. I'll make sure to set aside some time each day to practice. And... and I'll try to be more mindful of when I'm starting to feel that sense of helplessness in my daily life. Maybe I can use the breathing exercises in those moments too.",
    "Therapist: Excellent plan. Take care, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I'm nervous about what the next session might bring up, but I'm also... I'm also looking forward to it, in a way. It's like... like I'm finally facing these demons head-on instead of running from them. It's scary, but... but it feels right. I'll see you next week."
