    "Therapist: Welcome, Raj. Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm honestly quite nervous, Dr. Patel. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of reliving that earthquake... it's terrifying. I've spent years trying to forget it all.",
    "Therapist: Your anxiety is understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried that talking about it will bring back all those intense feelings of fear and helplessness. I remember the ground shaking, buildings collapsing... I was just a child, but those images are still so vivid. What if I can't handle it?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How do you think revisiting might help?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe it could help me process what happened? But I'm not sure. It feels counterintuitive to deliberately recall something so traumatic.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. It may seem counterintuitive, but it's a crucial step. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: How long will we spend on this? And what if I start panicking during the exercise? I'm also worried about how this might affect my sleep or my ability to focus at work. I've been doing better lately, and I don't want to regress.",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. What support do you think you'll need?",
    "Client: I think I'd feel better if we had some sort of signal I could use if things get too overwhelming. And maybe if we could start with just a short session today? I'm also wondering if there are any grounding techniques I could use during or after the exposure.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent suggestions. Let's establish a signal now.",
    "Client: Okay, how about if I raise my hand? That seems simple enough. And maybe we could have some water nearby? Sometimes when I get anxious, my throat feels very dry.",
    "Therapist: Agreed. Hand signal and water. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm still nervous, but I understand why this is important. I want to be able to think about my childhood without being overwhelmed by fear. And I want to be able to talk about it with my wife and kids someday. So, yes, I'm ready. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Shall we start?",
    "Client: Yes, let's start. I'm taking a deep breath... okay, I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Where should I begin? Should I start with the moment the earthquake hit, or...?",
    "Therapist: Start wherever feels natural to you.",
    "Client: Alright. I was in school that day. It was just after lunch, and we had just settled back into our classroom. I remember the teacher was writing something on the blackboard when suddenly..."
