    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the scene?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in my childhood home. It's late at night, and I can hear yelling from downstairs. My parents are fighting again. I'm in my bed, trying to block out the noise, but it's getting louder.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: I can hear glass breaking now. My mom is screaming at my dad to stop. I'm so scared, I want to help her, but I'm frozen in my bed. My heart is racing, and I'm starting to shake.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I can hear footsteps coming up the stairs. They're heavy and fast. I'm terrified it might be my dad. I'm holding my breath, hoping he won't come into my room. The door handle starts to turn...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: It's my mom. She rushes in, her face is tear-stained, and there's a bruise forming on her cheek. She's telling me we need to leave, now. I'm confused and scared, but I start packing a bag. My hands are shaking so much I can barely zip it up.",
    "Therapist: That's it. Stay present with the memory.",
    "Client: We're sneaking down the stairs now. I can see my dad passed out on the couch, surrounded by empty bottles. The living room is a mess, with broken glass everywhere. Mom is pulling me towards the door, whispering that we need to be quiet. I'm trying not to cry, but I can feel tears running down my face.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: We make it to the car, and Mom starts driving. I don't know where we're going, and I'm too afraid to ask. I keep looking back, worried that Dad might wake up and come after us. The streets are empty, and it's so dark outside. I feel lost and alone, even though Mom is right there.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: We end up at my aunt's house. Mom is crying as she explains what happened. I'm sitting on the couch, still in my pajamas, feeling numb. I don't understand why this is happening to us. Why can't we just be a normal family? I'm angry at Dad, but I'm also scared for him. What if he wakes up alone and realizes we're gone?",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job describing this. Keep going.",
    "Client: The next few days are a blur. We stay at my aunt's, and I miss school. Mom has bruises that she tries to hide, and she cries when she thinks I'm not looking. I overhear them talking about restraining orders and divorce. I feel like my whole world is falling apart, and there's nothing I can do to fix it.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling overwhelmed. My heart is racing, and I can feel that tightness in my chest again. It's like I'm right back there, feeling so helpless and scared. But... I also feel a bit relieved to have talked about it. It's like a weight I've been carrying for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've done well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to talk about, but I think it's getting a little easier each time. I just wish I could let go of the guilt I feel for not being able to protect my mom or fix my family.",
    "Therapist: Remember, it wasn't your responsibility.",
    "Client: I know that logically, but emotionally it's still difficult to accept. Sometimes I wonder how different things might have been if I had done something, anything. But then I remind myself that I was just a child. I couldn't have changed what happened.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel drained, but also a bit lighter. Talking about it brings up all those old feelings, but it also helps me see how far I've come. I'm not that scared, helpless child anymore. I've survived, and I'm working on healing. It's a process, but I think I'm making progress.",
    "Therapist: You are. We'll end here for today.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you for guiding me through this. It's tough, but I think it's helping. I'm looking forward to our next session, even though I know it won't be easy. I'm committed to this process and to my healing.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. Take care."
