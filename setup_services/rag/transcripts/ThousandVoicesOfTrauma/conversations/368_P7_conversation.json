    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and take us back to that day in the hospital.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in the hospital waiting room. It's crowded, and I'm there for a routine check-up. Suddenly, there's shouting. A man bursts in waving a gun. He's demanding drugs. People are screaming and ducking for cover. I'm frozen in my seat.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The gunman is yelling at the receptionist. He's so angry. I can see the fear in her eyes. My heart is racing. I want to run, but I'm too scared to move. He turns and sees me staring. Oh God, he's coming towards me now.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. You're safe here.",
    "Client: He grabs my arm and pulls me up. He's using me as a shield, pressing the gun to my head. I can feel the cold metal. I'm shaking uncontrollably. He's shouting at everyone to stay back or he'll shoot me. I can smell his sweat, hear his heavy breathing. I'm terrified.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: The police arrive. There are sirens everywhere. The gunman is getting more agitated. He's tightening his grip on me, and the gun is digging into my temple. I'm crying silently. I think I'm going to die. I keep thinking about my family, how I might never see them again.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: Hours pass. My legs are aching from standing so long. The negotiator is trying to talk him down, but he's not listening. Suddenly, there's a loud bang. I think it's a gunshot at first, but it's a flash-bang. Everything goes chaotic. The gunman is startled, and I feel his grip loosen. I break free and run. Someone tackles me to the ground - it's a police officer. I hear more shouting, then silence.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm overwhelmed. My heart is racing just like it did that day. I can still feel the gun against my head, smell the gunman's sweat. It's so vivid.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: It helps to talk about it, but it's also terrifying. I've never told anyone all the details before. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved?",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard, but I want to get better. I'm tired of feeling afraid all the time, of avoiding hospitals and crowded places. I want my life back.",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: A bit shaky, but okay. It's strange, but talking about it makes it feel less overwhelming. Like, it's still awful, but maybe I can handle it better than I thought.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. Well done today.",
    "Client: Thanks. I'm nervous about our next session, but I think I'm ready to keep working on this. It's time to stop letting that day control my life.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive attitude. We'll end here for today."
