    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. Going through that memory of when I first got diagnosed with my illness, it's bringing up so many emotions. I felt like I was right back there in that doctor's office, hearing those words all over again. My heart was racing, and I could feel that same sense of panic rising in my chest.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most?",
    "Client: The look on my mom's face. She was trying so hard to be strong for me, but I could see the fear in her eyes. It made everything feel so much more real and terrifying. And then there was this overwhelming sense of loneliness, like suddenly I was cut off from the rest of the world. It's strange because I wasn't physically alone, but emotionally, I felt completely isolated.",
    "Therapist: How does that compare to now?",
    "Client: It's... different. I mean, I still have moments where I feel that isolation, but it's not as all-consuming as it was then. I've learned to reach out more, to let people in. But going through that memory, it's like I can still feel echoes of that initial shock and fear.",
    "Therapist: What helped you get through it today?",
    "Client: I kept reminding myself that I'm not in that moment anymore. That I've come a long way since then. And... I don't know, there's something about facing it head-on that makes it feel less overwhelming. It's still hard, but it doesn't have the same power over me that it used to.",
    "Therapist: That's insightful. How's your body feeling?",
    "Client: It's strange. I can feel some tension in my shoulders, and my stomach feels a bit knotted. But it's not as bad as I expected. I thought I'd be shaking or crying, but I feel... I don't know, maybe a bit stronger than I anticipated?",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm thinking about how much this experience shaped me. Not just the illness itself, but that moment of diagnosis. It's like it divided my life into before and after. But now, I'm starting to see that maybe it doesn't have to be such a stark division. Maybe I can integrate it into my story without letting it define everything.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization feel?",
    "Client: It feels... liberating, I guess? Like maybe I'm not as trapped by this experience as I thought I was. Don't get me wrong, it's still difficult to think about, but it feels less like this insurmountable obstacle and more like... I don't know, a part of my journey?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful shift. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I think... I want to keep exploring this. Maybe try to connect with others who've gone through similar experiences? And I want to work on not letting the fear of potential health issues control my life so much. It's going to be a process, but I feel like I'm starting to see a way forward.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a great plan. Anything else?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm starting to understand myself better. And even though it's painful, there's something... I don't know, almost empowering about facing these memories head-on.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work, Sarah. Ready to wrap up?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. It's a lot to process, but I'm feeling... okay. Maybe even a little hopeful? It's nice to feel like I'm making progress, even if it's small steps.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. We'll pick up here next time."
