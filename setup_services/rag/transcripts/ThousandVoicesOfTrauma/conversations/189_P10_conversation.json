    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Johnson. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Oh, well... I'm feeling a bit uneasy, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about that day, and it's... it's not easy.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to help you process this. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Yes, let's... let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I'm in my daughter's house. It's a sunny afternoon, and I'm babysitting my grandson, little Marcus. He's playing with his toys on the living room floor, and I'm... I'm knitting in my favorite armchair. The windows are open, and I can hear the neighborhood children playing outside.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud crash outside. I... I hear shouting. Marcus looks up at me, scared. I tell him it's okay and go to the window to see what's happening.",
    "Therapist: What do you see out the window?",
    "Client: There's... there's a group of young men. They're arguing, pushing each other. One of them... oh God, one of them pulls out a gun. I... I can't believe what I'm seeing.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. My heart is racing. I want to look away, but I can't. I... I should call the police, but I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 70. Maybe 75.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: The man with the gun, he... he fires. The sound is so loud. I see one of the other men fall. There's blood... so much blood. I... I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're here in the office with me. Take another deep breath.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) Okay... okay. I... I turn away from the window. Marcus is crying now. I scoop him up and run to the bathroom. I... I lock the door and sit on the floor, holding him tight.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. I can hear more shouting outside, car tires screeching. I'm trying to comfort Marcus, but I can barely speak. I'm... I'm praying, begging God to keep us safe.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 85. This is so hard.",
    "Therapist: I know it's difficult, but you're doing really well. Stay with me. What happens next?",
    "Client: We... we stay in the bathroom for what feels like hours. Eventually, I hear sirens. Police, ambulances. I'm still too scared to move. Marcus has fallen asleep in my arms, exhausted from crying.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm so tense. My back aches from sitting on the hard floor. My arms are sore from holding Marcus. But I... I can't let him go. I feel like if I move, something terrible will happen.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. Take another deep breath. What happens after that?",
    "Client: There's... there's a knock on the front door. A voice calls out, saying it's the police. I... I still don't move. Then I hear my daughter's voice. She's home early. She's calling for us, sounding panicked.",
    "Therapist: What do you do then?",
    "Client: I... I finally stand up. My legs are shaky. I unlock the bathroom door and step out. My daughter sees us and bursts into tears. She hugs us both so tight. I... I start crying too. I can't stop.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm overwhelmed. Relieved we're safe, but... but so shaken. I can't stop thinking about the man who was shot. Did he survive? I... I saw him fall. Oh God, I saw someone get shot.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 80.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you name five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: Um... I see... your desk, the bookshelf, the clock on the wall, the plant in the corner, and... and the tissue box.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, can you continue? What happened after your daughter came home?",
    "Client: We... we sat in the living room. The police came in to take our statement. I could barely speak. My daughter did most of the talking. I just held Marcus, who was still asleep. I... I couldn't stop staring out the window, even though the street was empty now.",
    "Therapist: How did you feel during the police interview?",
    "Client: I felt... numb. Like it wasn't real. But every time I blinked, I saw that man falling again. I... I kept thinking I should have done something. Called the police sooner, or... or something.",
    "Therapist: It's common to have those thoughts, but remember, you kept yourself and Marcus safe. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. So tired. But I'm also... angry. Why did this have to happen? Why in our neighborhood? It's not fair.",
    "Therapist: Your anger is valid. What happened next?",
    "Client: The police left. My daughter wanted me to stay the night, but I... I couldn't. I needed to go home. I felt like I couldn't breathe in that house anymore.",
    "Therapist: How did you feel leaving?",
    "Client: Guilty. So guilty. I felt like I was abandoning them. But I... I just couldn't stay. I drove home in a daze. I don't even remember the drive.",
    "Therapist: What did you do when you got home?",
    "Client: I... I locked all the doors and windows. Double-checked them. Then I sat in my bedroom, with all the lights on. I couldn't sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw... I saw it all again.",
    "Therapist: That must have been exhausting. How are you feeling now, as you remember all this?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. My heart feels heavy. I'm sad and angry and... and scared. I keep thinking, what if it happens again? What if next time, it's not strangers, but someone I love?",
    "Therapist: Those are natural fears after what you've been through. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe 65?",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this well. Can you tell me about the days following the incident?",
    "Client: I... I didn't leave my house for a week. My daughter called every day, but I... I couldn't bring myself to go back there. I felt so guilty, but the thought of seeing that street again... I just couldn't.",
    "Therapist: How did that affect your relationship with your family?",
    "Client: It... it strained things. My daughter was worried about me. She wanted me to see a doctor, thought I might be depressed. I... I pushed her away. I didn't want to talk about it. I just wanted to forget.",
    "Therapist: But you couldn't forget, could you?",
    "Client: No... no, I couldn't. I had nightmares. I'd wake up in a cold sweat, thinking I heard gunshots. I... I stopped watching the news. I couldn't bear to hear about any more violence.",
    "Therapist: How did this experience change you?",
    "Client: I became... paranoid, I guess. Always looking over my shoulder. I... I stopped going for my daily walks. I used to love sitting on my porch in the evenings, but now... now I stay inside with the doors locked.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really difficult. How has this affected your daily life?",
    "Client: It's... it's like I'm not living anymore, just... existing. I miss my old life. I miss feeling safe. I miss being able to enjoy time with my grandson without... without seeing that man fall every time I close my eyes.",
    "Therapist: You've been through a lot. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. So tired of being afraid. But talking about it... it's hard, but it's also... I don't know, maybe a little relieving? Like I'm not carrying this all alone anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's lower. Maybe 50? I still feel shaky, but... but a little lighter too.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today. How do you feel about the progress we've made?",
    "Client: I... I think it's good. It's hard, but... but maybe it's helping? I don't know. I just want to feel normal again.",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. We'll work towards that together. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we end?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm okay for now. This was... it was tough, but... but I'm glad I did it. Thank you for... for listening, for helping me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. You've shown great courage today. We'll continue to work through this together."
