    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's like I was right back there, you know? The sounds of the sirens, the smell of smoke... it all came flooding back. My heart's still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt during that earthquake. We were supposed to be there to help civilians, but in that moment, I couldn't even help myself. It's... it's overwhelming to remember how small and insignificant I felt in the face of such destruction.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does your body feel as you recall these memories?",
    "Client: Tense. Really tense. My shoulders are tight, and I feel this knot in my stomach. It's like my body's preparing for something bad to happen, even though I know I'm safe here.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are you experiencing?",
    "Client: Fear, definitely. But also... guilt, I think. I survived when others didn't. And anger, too. Angry at the situation, at myself for not being able to do more. It's all mixed up together.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when you first experienced the event?",
    "Client: They're... they're not as intense now. Back then, it was like being hit by a tidal wave of emotion. Now it's more like... I don't know, choppy seas? Still rough, but I can breathe through it.",
    "Therapist: What's helping you manage these emotions right now?",
    "Client: Reminding myself that I'm here, in this room, not back there. And... and knowing that I've gotten through this before. It's hard, but I'm doing it, aren't I?",
    "Therapist: Indeed. How does that realization make you feel?",
    "Client: Stronger, I guess. Like maybe I'm not as helpless as I sometimes feel. It's a small thing, but it feels important somehow.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing about your experience right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm surprised by how vivid the memories still are. The way the ground shook, the sounds of buildings crumbling... But I'm also noticing that I can step back from them a bit. Like, I can observe the memory without being completely swept away by it. Is that... is that progress?",
    "Therapist: What do you think?",
    "Client: I think it might be. It's still hard, don't get me wrong. But before, even thinking about that day would send me into a panic. Now, it's uncomfortable, but I can talk about it. That has to mean something, right?",
    "Therapist: How does this shift impact your view of your recovery?",
    "Client: It makes me feel... hopeful, I suppose. Like maybe I'm not stuck with this forever. But it's also scary in a way. What if I forget? What if moving on means I'm dishonoring those who didn't make it?",
    "Therapist: Tell me more about that fear.",
    "Client: It's like... part of me feels like I need to hold onto this pain, you know? As if remembering and hurting is the only way to honor what happened. But another part of me is so tired of carrying this weight. I want to be able to think about my time in service without being dragged back to that terrible day.",
    "Therapist: How might you honor your experience without being defined by it?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe by using what I've learned to help others? Or by living the kind of life that makes all of this mean something? It's hard to imagine, but... but I think I want to try.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you consider that possibility?",
    "Client: A mix of things. There's some anxiety, definitely. The idea of letting go of this... it's scary. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe relief? Like I'm giving myself permission to move forward. And underneath it all, there's this tiny spark of excitement. Like maybe there's more to my story than just this trauma.",
    "Therapist: How does that spark feel?",
    "Client: It feels... good. Fragile, but good. Like a little flame I want to protect and nurture. I haven't felt anything like that in a long time.",
    "Therapist: What do you need to help that spark grow?",
    "Client: Patience, I think. And... and kindness towards myself. I've been so hard on myself for so long. Maybe I need to practice treating myself with the same compassion I'd show to someone else who went through this.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How might you start doing that?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe by acknowledging when I'm having a hard day without beating myself up about it? Or by celebrating small victories, like getting through this session. It feels strange to even think about being kind to myself, but... but I think I'd like to try.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you could take this week?",
    "Client: I could... maybe I could start a journal? Write down one thing each day that I handled well, no matter how small. It sounds silly when I say it out loud, but it might help me see that I'm not failing all the time.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that idea?",
    "Client: A little nervous, to be honest. It's not something I'd usually do. But also... kind of excited? Like maybe this could be the start of something new. Something better.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, somehow. Like I've set down a heavy backpack I've been carrying. I know it's not gone for good, but just putting it down for a while... it helps. And I feel proud, too. This wasn't easy, but I did it. I'm doing it.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. We'll pick up here next time."
