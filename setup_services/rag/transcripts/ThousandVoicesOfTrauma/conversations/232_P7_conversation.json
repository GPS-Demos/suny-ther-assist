    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the prison scene?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in a small, dimly lit cell. The walls are gray concrete, and there's a tiny window high up. I can hear the echoes of footsteps in the corridor outside. The air is stale and damp. I'm sitting on a thin mattress on a metal bed frame, my hands shaking slightly.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: I... I can feel my heart racing. The cell door is made of heavy metal with a small slot for food trays. There's graffiti scratched into the walls from previous inmates. I'm cold, and the jumpsuit they gave me is rough against my skin. I keep thinking about the firefight that led to my capture, replaying it in my mind over and over.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that memory. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The sounds of gunfire and explosions seem to echo in my head. I can smell the gunpowder and feel the adrenaline coursing through my body. But now, in this cell, I feel helpless and trapped. I don't know how long I'll be here or what's going to happen to me. The uncertainty is overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I'm trying to stay calm, but it's hard. I can hear other prisoners sometimes - crying, shouting, or just talking. It reminds me that I'm not alone, but it also makes me feel more isolated. I miss my unit, my friends. I wonder if they're okay, if they made it out. The guilt of being captured while others might have died is crushing.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's just... every time I close my eyes, I see flashes of the battle. The faces of my comrades, the enemy soldiers. I can't shake the feeling that I failed somehow. And now, in this cell, I feel so powerless. I try to keep track of time, but the days blur together. The interrogations are the worst - I'm afraid of what they might do, what information they might try to force out of me.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The isolation is getting to me. I try to exercise in my cell to keep my mind occupied, but it's not enough. I find myself talking to myself sometimes, just to hear a friendly voice. The guards are mostly silent, which adds to the eerie atmosphere. I keep hoping for news from outside, any sign that someone knows where I am. But as days turn into weeks, hope starts to fade. I'm struggling to hold onto who I am, my values, my identity.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job staying present with the memory.",
    "Client: It's hard not to give in to despair. I try to remember my training, to stay strong, but there are moments when I just want to break down and cry. The lack of privacy is dehumanizing - being watched constantly, even in my most vulnerable moments. I miss the sun, fresh air, the feeling of grass under my feet. Simple things I took for granted before. I worry about my family, if they know what's happened to me. The thought of them suffering because of my situation adds another layer of pain.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Keep going.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I start to have nightmares about never getting out, about being forgotten. During the day, I try to keep my mind sharp by solving puzzles in my head, reciting poems, anything to stay sane. But at night, the fears creep in. I wake up in cold sweats, sometimes unsure if I'm still dreaming or if this is my reality. The constant state of alertness is exhausting. Every sound could mean danger or maybe rescue. It's a rollercoaster of emotions that never seems to end.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this difficult memory very well.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's... it's not easy to relive this. The hardest part is the loss of control over my own life. Every aspect of my existence is dictated by others - when I eat, sleep, even use the bathroom. It strips away your dignity bit by bit. I try to hold onto hope, to believe that one day I'll be free again, but there are days when it feels impossible. The not knowing is perhaps the cruelest part of it all.",
    "Therapist: You're showing remarkable resilience. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling drained, to be honest. Talking about this brings back a lot of intense emotions. My heart is still racing a bit, and I feel a heaviness in my chest. But at the same time, there's a small sense of relief in sharing this burden. It's like I've been carrying this weight for so long, and now, even if it's just for a moment, I'm not carrying it alone. I'm grateful for the chance to process this, even though it's painful.",
    "Therapist: You've done an incredible job today. Let's start winding down.",
    "Client: Thank you. I didn't realize how much I had bottled up inside. Reliving those moments was intense, but I think it's helping me understand my experiences better. I still feel some anxiety, but it's not as overwhelming as when we started. I'm starting to see that while those experiences were traumatic, they don't define who I am now. It's a small step, but it feels like progress.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent insight. How would you like to close our session?",
    "Client: I think I'd like to take a few deep breaths and ground myself in the present. Maybe we could talk about some coping strategies I can use when these memories come up outside of our sessions? I want to build on this progress and feel more in control of my reactions to these memories.",
    "Therapist: That's a great idea. Let's do that."
