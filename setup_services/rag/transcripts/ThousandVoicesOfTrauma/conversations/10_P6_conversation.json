    "Therapist: Welcome, Rahul. Today we'll continue with our imaginal exposure exercise. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control. Let's start with your current SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10 right now. Just thinking about revisiting the memory is making me a bit anxious.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day. Describe what you see.",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in our living room. It's late afternoon, and the sunlight is streaming through the windows. I can hear my partner in the kitchen, pots and pans clanging. There's tension in the air, like a storm about to break. My heart is starting to race a bit.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear footsteps coming towards me. My partner enters the room, face twisted with anger. I can feel my muscles tensing, preparing for what's coming. The shouting starts, and I... I feel so small, so helpless.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 7. My palms are sweaty, and I can feel my heart pounding in my chest.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The words are getting louder, more hurtful. I see a vase flying across the room, shattering against the wall. I flinch, trying to make myself smaller. The sound of breaking glass... it's so vivid. I feel trapped, like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe even a 9. I feel like I'm right back there, reliving it all over again.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Remember, this memory can't hurt you now.",
    "Client: I know, but it feels so real. I can smell the lingering scent of dinner mixed with the sharp tang of fear. My body is shaking, and I... I just want to run, but I'm frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I finally find my voice. I yell back, telling my partner to stop. There's a moment of stunned silence, and then... and then they break down crying. The anger dissipates, replaced by guilt and shame. I feel... I feel a mix of relief and exhaustion.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down. Maybe a 6? My heart is still racing, but I'm starting to feel more present in the room with you.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're doing great. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: I remember the aftermath. The broken glass on the floor, the heaviness in the air. We both just sat there, not speaking, for what felt like hours. I felt so alone, even with my partner right there.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 4 again. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I survived it again, here with you.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've done excellent work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard, but... I think it's getting easier to face it each time.",
    "Therapist: That's the goal. How are you feeling overall now?",
    "Client: Tired, but okay. My SUDS is probably around a 3 now. I'm glad we did this.",
    "Therapist: I'm proud of your progress. Let's end here and discuss self-care for the rest of your day."
