    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Maria?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's always hard to go back there, you know? Reliving those moments in the war zone, and then connecting it to what I saw with the human trafficking victims... it's just so overwhelming. My hands are still trembling a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you this time?",
    "Client: The sounds. God, the sounds were so vivid. The explosions in the distance, the screams of the people we were trying to rescue. And then, in my mind, it kind of... merged with the cries of those trafficked women we found. It's like my brain couldn't separate the two experiences anymore. I felt so helpless in both situations.",
    "Therapist: Hmm. How did that helplessness feel in your body?",
    "Client: It was like a weight on my chest. I could barely breathe. My throat felt tight, and I had this urge to run, but I was frozen in place. It's funny, you know? I'm a professional, I've dealt with difficult situations in my job, but in these moments, I feel like I'm right back there, completely powerless.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage facing these memories.",
    "Client: Thank you. It doesn't feel like courage most of the time. It feels like I'm barely holding it together. But I guess... I guess I am facing it, aren't I? That's something, at least.",
    "Therapist: Indeed. How does this connect to your daily life now?",
    "Client: Well, I've noticed that I'm jumpier at work. Loud noises, unexpected movements... they all set me off. And I've been having trouble sleeping again. I keep seeing their faces - the soldiers, the victims. It's like they're all blended together in this horrible tapestry of suffering. I feel like I should have done more, you know?",
    "Therapist: What would \"more\" have looked like?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Saved more people? Stopped the trafficking ring entirely? Prevented the war? *laughs bitterly* I know it sounds ridiculous when I say it out loud. But that's the thing, isn't it? My rational mind knows I did what I could, but my emotions... they're not so easily convinced.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight, Maria.",
    "Client: Yeah, I suppose it is. I've never really thought about it that way before. It's like there's this constant battle between what I know and what I feel. And most of the time, the feelings win out. That's probably why I've been so depressed lately. It's exhausting, always fighting against yourself.",
    "Therapist: How might we use this insight moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I need to be kinder to myself? Accept that I did what I could with the resources and knowledge I had at the time. It's not easy, though. Part of me feels like if I let go of this guilt, I'm somehow dishonoring those who suffered. But I know that's not rational either. *sighs* It's all so complicated.",
    "Therapist: It is complex. What small step could you take this week?",
    "Client: Hmm... Maybe I could try writing down one thing each day that I did well, or one situation where I made a positive difference. Even if it's something small. Just to remind myself that I'm not powerless, that I can still have a positive impact on the world. Do you think that might help?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like an excellent idea. How do you feel about trying it?",
    "Client: I feel... cautiously optimistic? It's a bit scary, to be honest. The idea of focusing on the positive feels almost... wrong, somehow. Like I'm betraying my experiences or the people I couldn't help. But I know that's not true. I need to find a way to live with what happened, don't I? To honor their memory by living the best life I can. *takes a deep breath* Yeah, I think I'm ready to give it a try.",
    "Therapist: You're showing real strength, Maria. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that's a good idea. This session was... intense. But I feel like I've made some progress. Thank you for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I'm starting to see a glimmer of hope. Maybe, just maybe, I can learn to live with these experiences without letting them control me. It's a long road ahead, but I'm willing to keep walking it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work. See you next week?",
    "Client: Absolutely. Thank you again. I'll see you next week."
