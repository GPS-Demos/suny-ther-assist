    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to the car accident. Describe what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in my car, driving home from work. It's dark out, and the road is wet from rain. I can hear the windshield wipers... suddenly, I see headlights coming straight at me. My heart starts racing...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 6... maybe 7.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue with what you're seeing and feeling.",
    "Client: The other car is swerving... I try to move out of the way, but it's happening so fast. I feel frozen, like I can't react quickly enough. There's this horrible screeching sound, and then... impact. It's so loud, and I feel my body jerk forward. The airbag deploys, and it hurts... my chest aches, and I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Probably an 8.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm disoriented... everything's hazy. I smell something burning, and I'm terrified the car might explode. I'm trying to unbuckle my seatbelt, but my hands are shaking so much. I can hear people shouting outside, but it sounds far away. I'm... I'm scared I might be trapped.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating at this moment?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. A 9, I think. My heart's pounding just talking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *takes a shaky breath* Okay... I manage to get out of the car. My legs feel weak, and I'm dizzy. I see the other driver... he looks okay, just shocked. There are people gathering around, asking if we're alright. I nod, but I don't think I can speak. I'm trembling all over, and I feel like I might throw up.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7 or 8.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're processing this well. Continue.",
    "Client: The ambulance arrives. The paramedics are checking me over. They're kind, but I still feel so shaken. They tell me I'm in shock, which makes sense because I feel disconnected, like this isn't really happening to me. They want to take me to the hospital, just to be sure...",
    "Therapist: And your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's lower... maybe a 6. Talking about the paramedics helps. They made me feel safer.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: I think I can keep going. At the hospital, they run tests. I'm sore all over, but nothing's broken. I keep replaying the accident in my head, wondering if I could've done something differently. The doctor tells me I was lucky, but I don't feel lucky. I feel... vulnerable. Like the world isn't as safe as I thought it was.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating as you think about that feeling?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 5 now. Talking about it is helping, I think.",
    "Therapist: You're doing excellent work. Let's pause here and reflect."
