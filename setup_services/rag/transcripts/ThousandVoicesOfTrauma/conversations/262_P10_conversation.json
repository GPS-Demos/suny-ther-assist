    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling a bit jittery, to be honest. My hands are kind of clammy.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember, we'll use the SUDS scale. Where are you now?",
    "Client: Uh, probably around a 4 or 5.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath and start when you're ready.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm walking down the street near my apartment. It's a sunny day, but there's tension in the air. I can hear distant shouting. My heart starts to beat faster as I turn the corner and see a crowd gathering. There are people holding signs, chanting. I see police officers in riot gear lining up across the street. The atmosphere feels electric, dangerous.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you see, hear, feel?",
    "Client: I... I can smell sweat and hear the crowd getting louder. Someone bumps into me, and I flinch. The police are shouting something, but I can't make it out over the noise. My mouth goes dry, and I'm frozen in place. I want to leave, but I can't move.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's probably a 7. My heart's racing.",
    "Therapist: Take a slow, deep breath. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... Suddenly, there's a loud bang. I think it's a tear gas canister. People start screaming and running. I'm pushed and shoved as the crowd surges. I can't breathe... The air is thick and acrid. My eyes are burning. I'm coughing, trying to cover my face with my shirt. I'm terrified.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I stumble and fall. People are trampling over me. I can hear batons hitting flesh, more screaming. I manage to crawl to the side of a building. My knee is bleeding, and I can taste blood in my mouth. I'm shaking uncontrollably. I see a young woman being roughly handled by an officer. She's crying out for help, but no one's stopping to assist her.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm scared. Really scared. My SUDS is probably a 9. Can we... can we pause for a second?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take a moment. Breathe deeply.",
    "Client: (After a pause) Okay... I think I can continue.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going when you're ready.",
    "Client: I'm huddled against the building, trying to make myself as small as possible. The chaos is everywhere. I see a man get hit in the head with a baton. He goes down hard, blood pouring from his forehead. I want to help, but I'm paralyzed with fear. The sound of sirens is getting louder, more police are arriving. Someone grabs my arm, and I nearly scream.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens?",
    "Client: It's... it's another protester. They're pulling me up, telling me we need to run. I stumble to my feet, my legs feel like jelly. We're running down an alley, away from the main street. I can hear footsteps behind us, shouting. My lungs are burning, and I'm gasping for air. We turn another corner, and I lose my balance, crashing into a dumpster.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8. My heart's pounding in my ears.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The person who was helping me is gone. I'm alone in this alley, and I can hear the riot getting closer again. I'm trying to catch my breath, but I can't seem to get enough air. My vision is blurry, probably from the tear gas earlier. I hear heavy footsteps approaching. I'm frozen, pressed against the wall, praying they won't see me.",
    "Therapist: What do you see? What do you feel?",
    "Client: I... I see a police officer at the end of the alley. They're scanning the area, baton in hand. I'm trembling, trying not to make a sound. My throat feels tight, and I'm fighting the urge to cough. The officer takes a step into the alley, and I hold my breath. I can feel my heart hammering against my ribs.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: The officer... they're getting closer. I can see the stern expression on their face, the sweat on their forehead. They're saying something into their radio, but I can't make it out over the blood rushing in my ears. Suddenly, there's a crash from the other end of the alley. The officer turns and runs towards the sound. I let out a shaky breath, sliding down the wall until I'm sitting on the ground.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Relieved, but still scared. My SUDS is maybe a 7 now. My whole body aches, and I'm still shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep describing what's happening.",
    "Client: I... I stay there for what feels like hours, but it's probably only minutes. The sounds of the riot are fading, but I can still hear sirens in the distance. I slowly get to my feet, my legs wobbly. I start making my way out of the alley, constantly looking over my shoulder. The streets are a mess - overturned trash cans, broken glass, abandoned signs. There's a haze in the air from the tear gas.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I start walking home. My pace is quick, but I'm trying not to run and draw attention. I pass by small groups of people, some looking shell-shocked, others angry. I keep my head down, avoiding eye contact. As I get further from the protest area, the streets become more normal. But I still feel on edge, like it could all start up again at any moment.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down. Maybe a 5 or 6. I'm still tense, but the immediate danger feels past.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue describing what happens.",
    "Client: I finally reach my apartment building. My hands are shaking so much I can barely get my key in the lock. Once inside, I slam the door shut and lock it. I slide down to the floor, my back against the door. I'm safe, but I can't stop crying. The images keep flashing through my mind - the violence, the fear, the helplessness. I feel... I feel broken.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. Emotionally and physically. My SUDS is probably around a 4 now. It's like... like I've lived through it all over again.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Look around the room.",
    "Client: Okay... I see the chair I'm sitting in, the desk with your computer, the painting on the wall. I can feel the armrests under my hands. My breathing is slowing down.",
    "Therapist: Good. How do you feel about the session?",
    "Client: It was intense. Scary. But... I think it helped. It's like... like I faced it and survived again.",
    "Therapist: You did very well. Let's talk about what you experienced."
