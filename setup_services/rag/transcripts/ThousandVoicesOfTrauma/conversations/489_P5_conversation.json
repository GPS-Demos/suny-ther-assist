    "Therapist: Good morning, Mr. Johnson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Morning, Doc. I'm... well, I've been better. My back's been acting up something fierce lately. Makes it hard to get comfortable, you know? But I'm here, so that's something, right?",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your effort. Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Imaginal exposure? That's the thing where I have to relive... you know, the hurricane, right? I'm not gonna lie, Doc, I'm pretty nervous about that. My heart's already racing just thinking about it. Are you sure this is necessary?",
    "Therapist: It's a crucial step in your recovery. Can you share your main concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about getting overwhelmed. What if I can't handle it? I mean, I'm not as young as I used to be. And with my chronic pain... sometimes it's hard to tell what's causing what, you know? Plus, I've been trying so hard to forget all that. Won't this just bring it all back?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace and take breaks as needed.",
    "Client: That's... that's good to hear. I appreciate that, Doc. I guess I'm just scared of facing it all again. It was such a terrifying experience. I lost so much... my home, my sense of security. Sometimes I still wake up thinking I hear the wind howling. How is reliving all that supposed to help?",
    "Therapist: By processing the memory, we can reduce its power over you. It may be difficult, but it's healing.",
    "Client: I see. So it's like... facing the monster under the bed, huh? Shine a light on it and it's not so scary anymore? I hope you're right. I'm tired of living in fear, of always looking over my shoulder for the next disaster. If this can help with that, I suppose it's worth a try.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. Your courage is commendable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Alright, Doc. I trust you. But... what exactly should I expect? Will I feel like I'm right back there in the middle of it all? And what if I... I don't know, break down or something? I'm not sure how much control I'll have once we start digging into those memories.",
    "Therapist: You might feel intense emotions. I'll guide you through it. We can pause anytime you need.",
    "Client: Okay, that's... that's reassuring. I appreciate you being here with me through this. It means a lot, you know? Not having to face this alone. I've felt so isolated since the hurricane. My kids, they try to understand, but unless you've been through something like that... Well, you know how it is. So, thank you. I'm still nervous, but I'm ready to give this a shot.",
    "Therapist: Your resilience is inspiring. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we start?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do this. I'm as ready as I'll ever be, I suppose. Just... promise me you'll pull me out if it gets too intense? I know you said we can pause, but sometimes when I start remembering, it's like I get stuck there. It's hard to pull myself out.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'll be right here, guiding you. Let's begin..."
