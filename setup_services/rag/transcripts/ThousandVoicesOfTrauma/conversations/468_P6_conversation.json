    "Therapist: Alright, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day of the natural disaster.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm there. It's early morning, and I can hear the wind howling outside. The trees are swaying violently, and I'm alone in my apartment. My heart is starting to race already.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The wind is getting stronger. I can hear things hitting the windows. Branches, maybe? I'm trying to decide if I should leave or stay put. My hands are shaking as I try to check the news on my phone. The power flickers, and I feel a jolt of panic.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. My palms are sweaty, and I feel like I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud crash. A tree has fallen on the building next door. I can hear screaming. I'm frozen, unsure what to do. My chest feels tight, and I'm struggling to breathe. I want to run, but I don't know where it's safe to go.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's an 8 now. I feel like I'm right back there, reliving it all over again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: The building is shaking. I can hear glass breaking somewhere. I'm curled up in a corner, trying to make myself as small as possible. I'm crying, but I can barely hear myself over the wind. I feel so helpless and alone.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: I know it's difficult. You're very brave for facing this. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: I'm trying, but it's like I can't get enough air. My whole body is tense. I keep thinking about how I might die here, alone in this apartment. The noise is deafening, and I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level now?",
    "Client: Still a 9. I feel like I'm right on the edge of losing control.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you survived this. You're safe now.",
    "Client: Right... I'm safe. I'm here. The storm starts to die down after what feels like hours. The silence afterwards is almost as scary as the noise. I'm afraid to move, to see what's left.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7 now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going.",
    "Client: I finally get up on shaky legs. Everything's a mess. There's water everywhere from a broken window. I can hear sirens in the distance. I feel drained, but also relieved that it's over. I'm alive.",
    "Therapist: And your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5 now. I feel exhausted, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger?",
    "Therapist: You did exceptionally well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, but also kind of proud. It was tough, but I made it through.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's take a moment to breathe and ground ourselves."
