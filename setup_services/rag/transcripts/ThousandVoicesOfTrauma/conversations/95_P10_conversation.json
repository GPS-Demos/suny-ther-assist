    "Therapist: Welcome, Nadia. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about my hospitalization, and just thinking about it makes my heart race a little.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 5 out of 10 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. When you're ready, close your eyes and take us back to that day.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Alright... I'm in my dorm room. It's early morning, and I've been feeling awful for days. My roommate left for class, but I can't get out of bed. I'm sweating, but I feel so cold. My whole body aches, and there's this pressure in my chest that's getting worse.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: I... I try to reach for my phone, but my arm feels so heavy. I'm scared because I can't seem to catch my breath properly. The room is spinning a little, and I realize I need help, but I can't... I can't move.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, like there's a weight on it. My hands are a bit shaky. It's... it's hard to talk about this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a deep breath. SUDS?",
    "Client: Maybe a 7 now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I manage to grab my phone and call my friend Sarah. My voice is barely a whisper. I tell her I need help, that something's really wrong. She says she's coming right away, but those minutes feel like hours. I'm lying there, and I start to wonder if I'm... if I'm dying. The pain in my chest is getting worse, and I can hear my heartbeat in my ears.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. I keep thinking about my family back home, how they don't know what's happening. I wonder if I'll ever see them again. God, it hurts to remember this...",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. This is just a memory. Keep going.",
    "Client: Sarah bursts into the room. She looks so scared when she sees me. She's talking to me, but I can barely focus on her words. Everything's a blur as she calls for an ambulance. I remember the paramedics arriving, their voices urgent but muffled like I'm underwater. They're asking me questions, but it's so hard to answer.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice around you?",
    "Client: The lights seem too bright. There are so many hands touching me, moving me. I hear the beep of machines. Someone's cutting off my favorite pajama top, and I want to tell them to stop, but I can't speak. I'm being lifted onto a stretcher, and the movement makes the pain worse.",
    "Therapist: How's your anxiety now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's pretty high. Maybe an 8.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're doing well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *shaky breath* In the ambulance, everything's happening so fast. There's an oxygen mask on my face, and I can hear the siren. I'm trying to focus on the paramedic's face, but my vision keeps blurring. I'm so scared, and I feel so alone. We arrive at the hospital, and suddenly there are more people, more voices. I'm wheeled into a room with bright lights and beeping machines.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you experiencing?",
    "Client: I feel so exposed and vulnerable. Doctors are talking over me, using words I don't understand. Someone's putting an IV in my arm, and it stings. I want to ask what's happening, but I can't seem to form the words. The pain in my chest is overwhelming, and I'm gasping for air.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. This is just a memory. SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: I remember a doctor leaning over me, telling me they need to do some tests. I'm moved to different rooms, poked and prodded. Each movement is agony. I hear words like \"pneumonia\" and \"sepsis,\" and I'm trying to understand what it all means. Time seems to stretch and blur. At some point, they tell me they need to put me on a ventilator. I'm crying, shaking my head, but they explain I can't breathe on my own anymore.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind at this point?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. I don't want to be put to sleep. I'm thinking about all the things I haven't done yet, all the people I love. I'm wondering if I'll wake up again. As they're preparing me for intubation, I'm silently praying, begging to survive this.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those emotions. What do you feel in your body?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I feel cold all over, but I'm sweating. My chest hurts, both from the memory and from how tense I am right now. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Remember, you're here now, safe. SUDS?",
    "Client: It's still a 9. This is so vivid, like I'm reliving it.",
    "Therapist: Take a few deep breaths. Focus on the present moment.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... I can continue.",
    "Therapist: Alright. What happens next?",
    "Client: The next thing I remember is waking up in the ICU. I'm confused, disoriented. There's a tube in my throat, and I can't speak. I'm panicking, trying to reach for it, but my hands are restrained. A nurse rushes over, telling me to calm down, that I'm okay. But I don't feel okay. I feel trapped, helpless.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are you experiencing?",
    "Client: Fear, frustration, confusion. I want to ask what happened, how long I've been there, but I can't speak. I'm trying to communicate with my eyes, but I'm not sure if anyone understands. I'm in pain, but it's different now - duller, but everywhere.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: Days blur together. I drift in and out of consciousness. Sometimes I see my parents by my bed, looking worried and tired. I want to tell them I'm sorry, that I love them, but I can't. The tube is eventually removed, but talking is painful and difficult. I'm so weak, I can barely lift my hand.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, both in the memory and here?",
    "Client: In the memory, I'm feeling a mix of relief and fear. Relief that I'm alive, but fear about what's next. Here... I'm feeling drained, but also a bit lighter. Like I'm finally letting some of this out.",
    "Therapist: That's good. SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 7 now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The recovery is slow and painful. Physical therapy is exhausting, and there are moments when I wonder if I'll ever feel normal again. But gradually, I start to improve. I remember the first time I manage to walk down the hospital hallway without assistance. It's such a small thing, but it feels like a huge victory.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind during this time?",
    "Client: I'm grateful to be alive, but I'm also scared about the future. Will there be lasting effects? Can I go back to my studies? I worry about falling behind, about how this will impact my life. But there's also a new appreciation for life, for the simple things I took for granted before.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization make you feel?",
    "Client: It's bittersweet. I'm thankful for this second chance, but the experience has changed me. I feel more vulnerable now, more aware of how fragile life can be. It's both empowering and terrifying.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm actually feeling a bit better. Talking through this, even though it's hard, feels like I'm taking some control back. It's still scary, but maybe a little less overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. SUDS?",
    "Client: I'd say it's down to a 5 now.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Focus on your breathing.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay. I feel more present now.",
    "Therapist: You've done remarkably well today. How do you feel about the session?",
    "Client: It was tough, but... I think it was good. I've never really talked about it in this much detail before. It's exhausting, but I also feel a bit lighter.",
    "Therapist: That's often how it goes. You've taken a big step today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I understand now why we need to do this. It's hard, but I can see how it might help in the long run.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. We'll continue to work through this. For now, let's end with some relaxation exercises.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes and focus on your breath..."
