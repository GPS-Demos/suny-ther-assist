    "Therapist: How are you feeling after today's imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. The memory of that earthquake was so vivid this time. I could almost feel the ground shaking beneath me again. It's strange because I've been thinking about human trafficking lately, given our recent discussions, but during the exposure, it was all about the earthquake. I felt so helpless, you know?",
    "Therapist: What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The sounds. The creaking of buildings, people screaming, car alarms going off. It was chaotic. And the dust... I remember the dust making it hard to breathe. I felt trapped, like I couldn't escape. It's funny, I've been so focused on the human trafficking cases I've been working on, but this brought me right back to that day.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. My heart was racing, and I felt that familiar tightness in my chest. But... it was different this time. I felt more in control, if that makes sense? Like, I knew I was safe here, even though the memory was scary. It's hard to explain.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What thoughts came up?",
    "Client: I kept thinking, \"I need to help.\" Even though I was scared, there was this overwhelming urge to do something. It's similar to how I feel about the trafficking cases I work on now. That need to make a difference, you know? But during the earthquake, I felt so powerless.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your current experiences?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's why I push myself so hard at work. Especially with these trafficking cases. It's like I'm trying to make up for not being able to help more during the earthquake. But it's exhausting. I'm always on edge, waiting for the next disaster or the next case.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful connection. How can we use this awareness?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I need to find a balance? I want to help, but I can't save everyone. During the earthquake, I couldn't save everyone, and that's not my fault. It's the same with my work now. I'm doing what I can, but I need to take care of myself too.",
    "Therapist: Excellent insight. How might you implement that?",
    "Client: I could start by setting some boundaries at work. Maybe not taking my work home with me every night. And... I could try to be kinder to myself when I feel like I'm not doing enough. It's hard, but I think it might help with my anxiety too.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, actually. Talking through this has helped me see things differently. I'm still a bit shaky from the exposure, but I feel like I understand myself better. It's like connecting dots I didn't even know were there.",
    "Therapist: You've made significant progress today. What's your takeaway?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's that my past experiences are influencing my present more than I realized. But also that I have the power to change how I respond to things. I don't have to be controlled by my trauma or my anxiety. It's empowering, in a way.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How will you care for yourself this week?",
    "Client: I'm going to try that meditation app you recommended. And maybe take a long bath tonight. Oh, and I promised my partner I'd go for a hike this weekend. I've been putting it off, but I think it'll be good for me to get out in nature.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like wonderful self-care plans. Anything else?",
    "Client: No, I think that's it for now. Thank you for today. It was tough, but I feel like I've made real progress. I'm actually looking forward to our next session, which is new for me.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work. See you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. See you then."
