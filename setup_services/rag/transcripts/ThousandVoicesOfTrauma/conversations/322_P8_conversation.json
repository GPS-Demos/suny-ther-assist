    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my whole body is shaking, but I can't actually see it moving. My heart's racing, and I feel this tightness in my chest. The memory of that animal attack... it's so vivid now. I can almost smell the forest, hear the growling. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. How I froze when I saw the bear. It's like... it's like I'm reliving that moment of pure terror. But there's also this voice in my head saying, \"You survived. You made it out.\" It's confusing, you know? Part of me is still there, in that moment of fear, and another part knows I'm safe here.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you describe this?",
    "Client: My palms are sweaty, and I feel this tingling sensation in my fingertips. It's like my body is preparing to run or fight, even though I know I'm safe here. My breathing is shallow, and I'm feeling a bit lightheaded. It's... it's intense.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are you experiencing?",
    "Client: Fear is the strongest, definitely. But there's also... I don't know, maybe shame? I feel ashamed that I froze, that I couldn't protect myself better. And there's anger too - anger at the bear, at the situation, at myself for being there in the first place. It's a whirlwind of emotions, really.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when it first happened?",
    "Client: They're... they're similar, but different. Back then, it was pure, raw terror. Now, it's like I'm feeling everything at once. The fear is still there, but it's mixed with all these other emotions. And there's a part of me that knows I'm safe now, which wasn't there during the actual attack. It's like I'm straddling two worlds - the past and the present.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your thoughts now?",
    "Client: My thoughts are all over the place. One moment I'm replaying the attack, the next I'm thinking about how this experience has affected my life. I'm thinking about how I avoid hiking now, how I get anxious even seeing trees sometimes. But I'm also thinking about how I want to overcome this, how I don't want this fear to control me forever. It's like my mind is trying to process everything at once.",
    "Therapist: How does sharing this make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's both terrifying and relieving. Terrifying because I'm facing these memories head-on, something I've avoided for so long. But there's also this sense of relief, like I'm finally letting out something I've been holding in for years. And... and there's a tiny bit of hope too. Hope that maybe by facing this, I can start to move past it.",
    "Therapist: What does that hope feel like?",
    "Client: The hope feels... it feels like a small warmth in my chest. It's not big, but it's there. It's like a tiny light in all this darkness. I guess it's the part of me that believes I can get through this, that I can heal. It's scary to feel hopeful because what if I'm wrong? But at the same time, it feels good to have that little spark.",
    "Therapist: How does this experience connect to your broader journey?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's showing me how much this trauma has affected every part of my life. My relationships, my work, even how I see myself. But it's also making me realize how strong I am. I survived that attack, and I'm here now, facing it. It's painful and scary, but I'm doing it. Maybe this is the first step towards reclaiming my life, you know?",
    "Therapist: What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I think I need... I need a moment to just breathe. To remind myself that I'm safe here. And maybe... maybe I need to acknowledge how far I've come. It's hard, but I'm doing this. I'm facing my fears. I guess I need to be kind to myself right now.",
    "Therapist: Take all the time you need. How can we support you moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to keep doing this. As hard as it is, I feel like I'm finally starting to process what happened. Maybe we could work on some coping strategies for when the memories feel overwhelming? And... and I think I might need help rebuilding my confidence. The attack shook my faith in myself, in my ability to handle difficult situations. I want to find that strength again.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Is there anything else you'd like to share?",
    "Client: I just... I want to thank you. For creating this safe space where I can face these memories. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm not alone in this anymore. And that... that means a lot. I'm scared of what's to come, of facing more of these memories, but I'm also... I'm also a little excited. Excited to see who I can be without this fear controlling me. It's a long road ahead, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I might be able to walk it.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible courage today. How do you want to close our session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to end with a moment of grounding. Maybe we could do a quick breathing exercise? Just to help me center myself before I leave. And... and maybe we could acknowledge the work we did today. It feels important to recognize that, even though it was hard, we made progress. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's do that together."
