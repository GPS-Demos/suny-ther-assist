    "Therapist: Welcome back. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm feeling a bit jittery, to be honest. My stomach's in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to support you. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 6 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and take us to that day at work.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Alright... I'm walking into the office. It's early, maybe 7:30 AM. The lights are still dim, and there's this eerie quiet. I can smell the stale coffee from yesterday...",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I see my boss's door is open. That's unusual. My heart starts racing a bit. I know something's off.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What do you notice in your body?",
    "Client: My palms are getting sweaty. I can feel my shirt sticking to my back. I... I want to turn around and leave, but I can't.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Continue.",
    "Client: I approach his office, and I can hear him on the phone. He's angry, shouting at someone. I freeze, not knowing if I should knock or just walk away. But then he sees me...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's creeping up. Maybe a 7 or 8.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What happens when he sees you?",
    "Client: He... he waves me in aggressively. I feel like a child being scolded. My legs are shaky as I enter. He slams the phone down and just... glares at me.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What do you see, hear, feel?",
    "Client: His face is red, veins bulging on his forehead. I can hear my own heartbeat in my ears. The air feels thick, hard to breathe. He starts yelling about a project I worked on...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: He's saying I've ruined everything, that I'm incompetent. His words... they're like physical blows. I want to defend myself, but I can't speak. My throat's so tight...",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here now, safe. What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm right there again.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. You're doing great.",
    "Client: (Shaky breath) Okay... He's standing now, looming over me. I feel so small, so... worthless. He's saying I'm lucky to even have this job, that no one else would hire someone like me...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm angry. And scared. And ashamed. It's all mixed up inside me.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Let those feelings be there. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I start to cry. I hate that I'm crying, but I can't stop. He looks disgusted. Says I'm pathetic, that I need to toughen up if I want to survive in this industry.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're doing really well.",
    "Client: I want to run, but my body won't move. I'm just sitting there, tears streaming down my face, as he continues to berate me. I feel so exposed, so... violated.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still a 9. Maybe even a 10. I can barely breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Focus on your breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Deep, shaky breaths) Okay... I'm... I'm still in his office. He's quieter now, but his words are still cutting. He's telling me I need to work overtime, weekends, whatever it takes to fix this mess I've made.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Defeated. Crushed. Like I'm nothing more than a... a machine to be used up and discarded.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: I nod. I can't even look at him. I just nod and agree to everything. I feel like I'm betraying myself, but I don't know what else to do.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: He dismisses me with a wave of his hand. As I stand up, my legs are wobbly. I feel lightheaded. I stumble a bit as I leave his office.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice around you?",
    "Client: The office is busier now. I can see my coworkers glancing at me. They know... they must have heard. I feel so exposed, so humiliated.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens as you leave his office?",
    "Client: I... I rush to the bathroom. I need to hide, to escape. I lock myself in a stall and just... break down. I'm sobbing, trying to muffle the sound.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. It hurts to breathe. My hands are shaking uncontrollably. I feel nauseous, like I might throw up.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I can hear people coming in and out of the bathroom. I'm terrified they'll recognize me, that they'll know I'm the one crying. I feel so ashamed, so weak.",
    "Therapist: How long do you stay there?",
    "Client: It feels like hours, but it's probably only about 20 minutes. I... I try to pull myself together. I splash water on my face, but I can still see how red and puffy my eyes are.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I don't know how I can face anyone. I feel like everyone will see right through me, see how broken and useless I am. I'm thinking about quitting, about running away.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe a 7.",
    "Therapist: Good. Take a deep breath. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I force myself to go back to my desk. My coworkers are all busy, or at least pretending to be. No one looks at me directly. I feel like a ghost.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Isolated. Alone. Like I'm not even a person anymore, just a... a problem to be avoided.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens for the rest of the day?",
    "Client: I... I try to work, but I can't focus. My mind keeps replaying the meeting with my boss. I feel sick every time I think about it. I stay late, trying to fix things, but I'm not even sure what I'm doing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How does the day end?",
    "Client: It's dark when I finally leave. The office is empty. I... I feel empty too. Like something fundamental has been taken from me. I can barely remember the drive home.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level as you're leaving?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about a 5 or 6. I'm exhausted, emotionally drained.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Okay... I'm... I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. Slowly open your eyes when you're ready. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. But also... I don't know. There's a bit of relief, I think. Like I've finally let some of that out.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've done excellent work today. How would you rate your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about a 4, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you... I... I didn't think I could do that.",
    "Therapist: You did wonderfully. Remember, you're stronger than you think. We'll process this more next time."
