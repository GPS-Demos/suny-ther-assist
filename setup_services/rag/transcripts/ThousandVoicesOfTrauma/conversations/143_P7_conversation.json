    "Client: Okay... I'm standing outside my brother's house. It's a sunny day, but everything feels wrong. I can hear shouting from inside.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: I... I hesitate at the door. The shouting gets louder. I recognize my brother's voice, he sounds angry. There's another voice too, unfamiliar.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I push the door open. The arguing stops for a moment. I see my brother in the living room, facing a man I don't know. They both look at me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The stranger, he... he pulls out a gun. Everything seems to slow down. My brother's eyes widen. I can't move. I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice shaking) The man points the gun at my brother. I want to shout, to do something, but I'm frozen. Then... then there's a loud bang. My ears are ringing.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: My brother... he falls. There's blood. So much blood. The stranger runs past me, knocking me to the ground. I crawl to my brother, but... but...",
    "Therapist: I know this is hard. You're very brave for facing this memory.",
    "Client: (crying) He's not moving. I'm shaking him, calling his name, but he's not responding. I can feel the warmth leaving his body. I... I couldn't save him.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're doing incredibly well.",
    "Client: I hear sirens in the distance. My hands are covered in his blood. I can't stop crying. I feel so helpless, so angry at myself for not doing more.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're recalling this memory. You're safe now.",
    "Client: The police arrive, then the paramedics. They're asking me questions, but I can barely speak. I just keep looking at my brother's body. I can't believe he's gone.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great strength. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Everything after that is a blur. I remember sitting in a police station, giving a statement. I remember calling our parents, hearing my mother's scream when I tell her. It's like I'm watching it all happen to someone else.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job staying with the memory.",
    "Client: The days after... I couldn't sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw it happening again. The guilt was overwhelming. I kept thinking of all the things I could have done differently.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those thoughts. You're processing it well.",
    "Client: The funeral was... it was surreal. Seeing all those people, hearing them talk about my brother. I felt so angry, so lost. I couldn't even bring myself to speak at the service.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. You're handling this memory courageously.",
    "Client: After everyone left, I just sat by his grave for hours. I talked to him, apologized for not saving him. I promised I'd find a way to make it right somehow.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible resilience. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: (taking a deep breath) It's... it's still painful, but talking about it... it feels a little less overwhelming. Like I can breathe a bit easier.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. You've done very well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable strength. Let's end here for today."
