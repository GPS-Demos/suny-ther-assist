    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart is still racing, and I feel this tightness in my chest. The memories, they're so vivid now. I can still see the dimly lit room, smell the musty air. It's like I'm right back there, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... shame? I feel like I should have done something, anything to stop it. I was just a child, but still... I keep thinking, \"Why didn't I run? Why didn't I scream?\" It's like my body was frozen, and I hate myself for it.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How does that shame feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's heavy. Like a weight pressing down on my shoulders. And there's this knot in my stomach that won't go away. I feel small, you know? Like I want to curl up and disappear.",
    "Therapist: And what thoughts are going through your mind as you experience these sensations?",
    "Client: I keep hearing their voices. The traffickers. They said... they said no one would ever want me after this. That I was damaged goods. And part of me still believes that, even after all these years. I mean, I'm married now, but sometimes I wonder if my wife really knows who I am, what I've been through.",
    "Therapist: How do those thoughts impact you now?",
    "Client: They... they make me feel isolated. Like there's this wall between me and everyone else. Even when I'm with my family, there's always this part of me that feels separate, different. And sometimes, when the memories are really bad, I turn to alcohol. I know it's not healthy, but it numbs the pain, you know?",
    "Therapist: I see. What else are you noticing about your experience right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm angry. Really angry. Not just at the traffickers, but at the whole system that allowed it to happen. At the adults who should have protected me but didn't. And I'm realizing... I'm angry at myself too. For carrying this burden for so long, for letting it affect my life in so many ways.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to acknowledge that anger?",
    "Client: It's... it's scary, but also kind of freeing? Like, for so long I've tried to push it down, to be the \"good\" survivor. But now, letting myself feel it... it's like a release. My fists are clenched, and I can feel this energy coursing through my body. It's almost empowering, in a way.",
    "Therapist: What do you make of that empowerment?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's new, you know? I've spent so long feeling helpless, like a victim. But this anger, this energy... maybe it means I'm not as powerless as I thought. Maybe I can use it to make changes, to heal. It's scary, but also... hopeful? Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it does. How does this new perspective sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... it's a lot to take in. Part of me wants to embrace it, to use this energy to move forward. But there's also this fear. What if I let myself hope and then get hurt again? What if I'm not strong enough to really change things? And yet... I'm tired of living in fear. I want to reclaim my life, you know?",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What would reclaiming your life look like for you?",
    "Client: I... I think it would mean being more open with my wife, for starters. Maybe even considering therapy for my drinking. And... and maybe using my experience to help others? I've always kept it hidden, but what if sharing could make a difference? It's terrifying to think about, but also... exciting? Like maybe there's a purpose to all this pain.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a significant shift. How are you feeling now, compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also lighter somehow. Like I've set down a heavy backpack I've been carrying for years. There's still fear and pain, but also this glimmer of... possibility? Hope? I don't know if I'm ready to fully embrace it yet, but it's there. And that's... that's something new.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. What would you like to focus on in our remaining time?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to explore this idea of reclaiming my life a bit more. Maybe talk about some concrete steps I can take? It feels big and scary, but also like something I need to do. For myself, for my family... for that child I used to be.",
    "Therapist: Alright, let's do that. Where would you like to start?",
    "Client: Well, I guess the drinking is a big one. It's been my crutch for so long, but I know it's not helping. Maybe we could talk about some strategies for cutting back? And... and maybe how to start that conversation with my wife about everything? I want to be honest with her, but I'm not sure how to even begin.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like important areas. Which feels most pressing to you right now?",
    "Client: I think... I think talking to my wife. The drinking is a problem, yes, but I feel like if I can open up to her, really let her in... maybe I won't need the alcohol as much? She's always been supportive, but there's so much I've kept hidden. I'm scared, but I also feel like it's time. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it does. How might you approach that conversation?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to just blurt it all out, but I know that might be overwhelming. For both of us. Maybe... maybe I could start by telling her I've been in therapy? And that there are things from my past I want to share with her? I don't know... it feels so big. How do you even begin to tell someone something like this?",
    "Therapist: That's a common concern. What do you think your wife's reaction might be?",
    "Client: I... I think she'd be supportive. She's always been there for me, even when she didn't understand why I was struggling. But I'm also afraid it might change how she sees me. What if she looks at me differently? What if it's too much for her to handle? But then... keeping it all inside hasn't been working either. It's like I'm caught between fear of sharing and fear of staying silent.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How might sharing impact your relationship?",
    "Client: I... I think it could bring us closer. There's always been this wall between us, this part of me she couldn't reach. Maybe if I let her in... we could connect on a deeper level? But it's also scary. What if she can't handle it? What if it pushes her away? But then I think... she's stood by me all these years, even without knowing. Maybe... maybe I need to trust in that love?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's your next step?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to prepare myself. Maybe write down what I want to say? And choose a time when we're both calm and have space to talk. And... and maybe have some resources ready? In case she has questions or wants to know how to support me better. It's scary, but... I think it's time. I'm tired of carrying this alone.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful approach. How are you feeling about this decision?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm nervous, definitely. But also... relieved? Like I'm finally taking a step towards real healing. And there's a part of me that's... proud, I guess? For having the courage to even consider this. It feels like I'm reclaiming some of the power that was taken from me all those years ago.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. We're nearing the end of our session. Is there anything else you'd like to address?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm good for now. This has been a lot to process, but in a good way. I feel like I have a direction now, you know? It's scary, but also exciting. Thank you for... for helping me get to this point. For the first time in a long time, I feel like maybe... maybe there's a way forward.",
    "Therapist: You've done important work today. How would you like to close our session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to take a moment to just breathe. To sit with this new feeling of possibility. And maybe... maybe make a promise to myself. To take that first step, however small, towards opening up to my wife. It's terrifying, but also... it feels right. Like it's time.",
    "Therapist: That's a wonderful way to end. Take those breaths, and we'll close here for today."
