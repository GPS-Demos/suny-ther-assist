    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been thinking about our last session and the idea of this imaginal exposure thing. It's been on my mind a lot.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about reliving the trauma from my surgery complications. It was such a terrifying experience, and the thought of going back there in my mind... it's scary. Plus, with all the online harassment I've been dealing with lately, I feel like I'm already on edge. I'm not sure if I can handle this.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. Shall we discuss the process?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I need to understand what's going to happen and why we're doing this. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest.",
    "Therapist: The goal is to process the trauma memory. How does that sound?",
    "Client: Process the trauma memory? I'm not sure I understand. Does that mean I have to relive everything in detail? I've been trying so hard to avoid thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Yes, but in a safe, controlled environment. It helps reduce PTSD symptoms.",
    "Client: I see. But how can reliving it possibly help? Won't it just make everything worse? I'm already struggling with the cyberbullying situation, and this feels like it might push me over the edge.",
    "Therapist: It may be difficult initially, but it often leads to improvement. Thoughts?",
    "Client: I'm scared, but I trust you. If you think this will help, I'm willing to try. Can you tell me more about what to expect during the session? Will you be there to support me if it gets too intense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'll guide you through it. You're in control throughout.",
    "Client: Okay, that's reassuring. I appreciate your support. I guess I'm just worried about how I'll react. What if I panic or can't handle it? And how does this relate to the cyberbullying I'm dealing with now?",
    "Therapist: We'll take breaks if needed. This may help with current stressors too.",
    "Client: That makes sense. I hadn't thought about how it might help with the cyberbullying situation. I suppose if I can face my medical trauma, maybe I'll feel stronger in dealing with online harassment. It's all about facing fears, right?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. Your courage is commendable. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm still nervous, but I feel a bit more prepared now. Thank you for explaining everything and being so patient with my questions. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Great. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we start?",
    "Client: Yes, I'm ready. I know it won't be easy, but I'm hopeful that this will help me move forward. Let's begin the imaginal exposure."
