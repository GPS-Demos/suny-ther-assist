    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving that animal attack, it brought back so many memories and sensations I thought I'd buried.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you?",
    "Client: The fear. It was so visceral. I could almost feel the dog's breath on my skin again. And the helplessness... I felt like that scared little boy all over again, you know?",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. My heart was racing, and I felt this tightness in my chest. But... it's strange. By the end, it felt a little less scary. Like, I knew I was safe here, even while remembering it.",
    "Therapist: That's a great observation. How does this connect to your daily life?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... I've always been on edge around dogs. Even small ones. But going through this memory, it's like... maybe I can face that fear bit by bit?",
    "Therapist: That's insightful. What else did you notice?",
    "Client: I realized how much that attack affected my relationships. I've always had trouble trusting others, especially in shared spaces. It's probably why I've stayed single, you know? Always waiting for the other shoe to drop.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that realization?",
    "Client: It's... eye-opening. And a bit sad, to be honest. I've missed out on a lot because of this fear.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What would you like to work on moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to work on trusting others more. Maybe even consider getting a pet someday. It sounds crazy, but... I don't want to let this fear control me anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. How can we support that in our sessions?",
    "Client: Could we... maybe practice more exposures? Not just with the memory, but perhaps with actual dogs? I know it sounds terrifying, but I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll take it step by step. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... hopeful? It's like I can see a path forward now. It's scary, but I'm willing to walk it.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. What will you focus on this week?",
    "Client: I think I'll try to be more open with my roommates. Maybe share a bit about what I'm going through. It's a small step, but it feels important.",
    "Therapist: That's a great idea. Anything else you want to discuss?",
    "Client: No, I think that's it for now. Thank you for guiding me through this. It's tough, but I feel like I'm finally moving forward.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work. See you next week?",
    "Client: Definitely. I'm nervous, but I'm looking forward to it. Thanks again."
