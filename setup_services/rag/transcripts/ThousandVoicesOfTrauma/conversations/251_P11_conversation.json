    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Maria?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart is still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. That memory of the police brutality I witnessed during my deployment... it's so vivid. I can still hear the screams, you know? The sound of batons hitting flesh. It's like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. I was trained to protect people, but in that moment, I couldn't do anything. I just stood there, frozen, watching these civilians being beaten. And the smell... the air was thick with tear gas and fear. It's like I can still taste it.",
    "Therapist: How did reliving that memory feel different today?",
    "Client: It's... it's still painful, but maybe a little less overwhelming? I noticed I was able to breathe through it better this time. But I still felt this intense guilt and shame. Like, why didn't I do something? I'm supposed to be brave, you know?",
    "Therapist: You're showing a lot of bravery right now, Maria.",
    "Client: Thanks, I... I guess I am. It's just hard to feel that way. After the exposure, I kept thinking about how this affects my life now. Like, when I see police officers in my neighborhood, I get so tense. My husband doesn't understand why I sometimes can't even watch the news. It's like I'm constantly on edge, waiting for something bad to happen.",
    "Therapist: How do you think this connects to your PTSD symptoms?",
    "Client: Oh, wow. I mean, it's probably why I have such a hard time sleeping, right? And why I'm always checking exits when I'm in public places. It's like my brain is stuck in that combat zone, always on high alert. And I guess... I guess that's why I've been feeling so depressed lately. It's exhausting living like this.",
    "Therapist: What did you learn about yourself today?",
    "Client: I... I realized I'm stronger than I thought. I mean, I made it through that memory without completely falling apart. And maybe... maybe it wasn't my fault that I couldn't intervene. I was following orders, and the situation was so chaotic. I'm starting to see that maybe I've been too hard on myself.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight, Maria.",
    "Client: Yeah, it feels important. And you know what? I think I'm finally starting to understand why you keep encouraging me to face these memories. It's painful, but... I feel like I'm slowly taking back control. Like, maybe I don't have to let this experience define my whole life.",
    "Therapist: How can you apply this moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to be more patient with myself. Maybe next time I feel triggered, I can try those breathing exercises we practiced. And I want to try talking to my husband about this more. He wants to understand, and I've been pushing him away. Oh, and I'm going to try to limit my news intake, focus on more positive things.",
    "Therapist: Excellent strategies. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: It's scary, but... I'm ready. I want my life back, you know? And for the first time in a long while, I feel like that might actually be possible. So yeah, let's keep going. I'm tired of letting fear run my life.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable, Maria. We'll take it step by step.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I really appreciate your support through all this. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't judge. I know we have a long way to go, but I'm starting to feel a glimmer of hope. That's new for me, and it's... it's nice."
