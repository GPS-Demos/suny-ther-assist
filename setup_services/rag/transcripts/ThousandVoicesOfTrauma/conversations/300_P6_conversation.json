    "Therapist: Alright, Sarah, let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the day of your accident.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm driving home from work. It's raining heavily, and the roads are slick. I can feel my hands gripping the steering wheel tightly. The windshield wipers are struggling to keep up with the downpour.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, about a 4 out of 10. I'm tense, but manageable.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue.",
    "Client: I'm approaching the intersection, and the light turns yellow. I decide to slow down, but as I press the brake, the car starts to hydroplane. My heart is racing now, and I can't control the vehicle. I'm sliding towards the intersection, and I see another car coming from the left. Oh god, I can't stop...",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. My palms are sweating, and I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: The impact is deafening. Metal crunching, glass shattering. I'm jolted forward, but the airbag deploys. Everything's a blur. I can smell gasoline and burning rubber. My head is throbbing, and I taste blood in my mouth. I'm so disoriented...",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm right back there. My chest is so tight.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're here with me. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *inhales shakily* I... I can hear people shouting outside the car. Someone's asking if I'm okay, but I can't respond. I'm frozen, just staring at the crumpled hood of my car. I can't believe this is happening. What if the other driver is hurt? What if I've killed someone?",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: Still a 9. My hands are shaking so much.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're handling this bravely. Continue.",
    "Client: I hear sirens in the distance. They're getting louder. Someone's trying to open my door, but it's jammed. I want to tell them I'm okay, but I can't speak. I'm just crying silently. The paramedics arrive, and they're talking to me, but their voices sound far away. They're using some tool to pry open the door...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down a bit. Maybe a 7? I'm starting to feel a little disconnected from the memory.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. How are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: My heart's still racing, but not as bad. I feel drained, like I've run a marathon.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's continue.",
    "Client: They get me out of the car and onto a stretcher. I catch a glimpse of the other driver being treated. He's conscious, which floods me with relief. As they load me into the ambulance, I start to panic about what this means for my life, my work...",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: Back up to an 8. The worry is overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: I understand. You're safe now. This is just a memory.",
    "Client: *nods* In the ambulance, they're asking me questions, checking my vitals. I can't stop thinking about how everything's going to change. Will I be able to work? How will I pay for this? What if I have lasting injuries?",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down. Maybe a 6 now. I'm starting to feel more present in the room with you.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this well.",
    "Client: As we arrive at the hospital, I'm feeling more alert but also more scared. The reality is sinking in. I'm wheeled into the ER, and there's so much activity around me. Doctors, nurses, machines beeping...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's holding steady at a 6. I feel exhausted, but less panicked.",
    "Therapist: You've done an excellent job. Let's start winding down.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you. This was intense, but... I think it helped.",
    "Therapist: You showed great courage. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Drained, but... lighter somehow. Like I've released something.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. Well done, Sarah."
