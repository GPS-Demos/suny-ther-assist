    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart's still racing, and I feel kind of shaky. Going through that memory of the police brutality incident was really intense. I could almost feel the officer's hands on me again, you know? It's like I was right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really difficult. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The fear. God, the fear was just... paralyzing. I remember feeling so helpless, like I couldn't do anything to protect myself. And the anger too. I was so angry that this was happening to me, that someone who's supposed to protect people was hurting me instead. It's just... it's not right, you know?",
    "Therapist: I hear you. How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was tough, really tough. But... I don't know, maybe a little different from before? Like, I could still feel all those emotions, but it's like I was watching it happen from a distance. Does that make sense? I mean, it still hurt, but I didn't feel as trapped by it as I usually do.",
    "Therapist: That's an interesting observation. Can you tell me more about that?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... before, whenever I thought about what happened, it was like I was right back there. I couldn't escape it. But today, even though it was still painful to remember, I could kind of... step back from it? Like, I know it happened to me, but I also know I'm here now, in this room, and I'm safe. It's a weird feeling.",
    "Therapist: How do you think this relates to your PTSD symptoms?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe it's helping? I mean, I still have nightmares and flashbacks, but they don't seem as frequent lately. And when they do happen, I think I'm getting a little better at grounding myself. Like, using those techniques we've talked about. It's still hard, but... I don't know, maybe I'm making progress?",
    "Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing some changes. How does that feel?",
    "Client: It feels... good, I think. Scary too, though. Like, part of me is afraid to hope that things might get better. What if I'm just fooling myself, you know? But then another part of me is like, maybe this is what healing feels like? It's confusing.",
    "Therapist: That's a very normal reaction. What would you like to focus on moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I want to work on feeling safer in public. Ever since the incident, I've been so anxious around police officers or in crowded places. I know not every situation is dangerous, but my body doesn't seem to understand that. Maybe we could work on that?",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. How do you feel about continuing with the exposures?",
    "Client: They're tough, really tough. But... I think they're helping. It's like, the more I face these memories, the less power they have over me. Don't get me wrong, it's still terrifying every time we do it. But I'm starting to see that I can get through it, you know? And maybe, just maybe, I can get through this whole thing and come out okay on the other side.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. What else would you like to share about today's session?",
    "Client: I guess... I'm proud of myself? Is that okay to say? It feels weird to be proud of something like this, but... I didn't think I could do it. I didn't think I could face these memories without completely falling apart. But I did it. I'm doing it. And even though it's hard, and even though I still have a long way to go, I feel like maybe I'm stronger than I thought I was.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How can we build on this moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe we could start working on some of those anxiety-provoking situations? Like, maybe we could practice some coping strategies for when I see police officers, or when I'm in a crowded place? And... I don't know if this is possible, but maybe someday we could work up to me actually talking to a police officer? Not the one who hurt me, obviously, but just... any officer. To prove to myself that not all of them are dangerous. Is that too much?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. Those are excellent ideas. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired. Really, really tired. But also... kind of hopeful? Like, for the first time in a long time, I can see a future where I'm not controlled by this trauma. It's still far away, and the path to get there is scary as hell. But I can see it. And that... that means a lot to me.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we end?",
    "Client: I don't think so. Just... thank you. For helping me through this. For believing in me even when I don't believe in myself. It means more than I can say.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. I'll see you next week?",
    "Client: Yeah, I'll be here. Thanks again."
