    "Therapist: Mrs. Rodriguez, today we'll focus on imaginal exposure. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so, Dr. Thompson. But I'm feeling a bit nervous. Can you explain what exactly we'll be doing?",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll revisit the airplane crash memory in detail. This helps process the trauma.",
    "Client: Oh, I see. It's just... I've tried so hard to forget that day. The screams, the chaos... it still haunts me. And with my chronic pain, I worry it might be too much to handle.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace and take breaks if needed.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I appreciate your understanding, doctor. It's been years since the crash, but sometimes it feels like yesterday. Especially when I hear planes overhead or see news about air travel accidents. It brings everything back in a flash.",
    "Therapist: Those reactions are normal. This exercise aims to reduce those intrusive memories.",
    "Client: I hope so. I've lived with this fear for so long. It's affected everything - my sleep, my relationships. Even simple things like watching movies can trigger memories.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Remember, you're in control during this process.",
    "Client: Thank you, that means a lot. I've never really talked about this in detail before. Not even with my late husband. I always felt like I was burdening others with my fears. But I'm tired of letting this control my life. I want to be able to visit my grandchildren without panicking about the flight.",
    "Therapist: That's a great motivation. Shall we start with some relaxation techniques?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think that would help calm my nerves. This is all so new to me, but I'm willing to try. I just hope I can get through it without breaking down completely.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel emotional. We'll navigate this together.",
    "Client: I appreciate that, Dr. Thompson. Your calm demeanor helps. I'm ready to face this, even if it's difficult. For my grandchildren, for myself... it's time to confront these memories head-on."
