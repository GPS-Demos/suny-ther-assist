    "Therapist: Okay, Mr. Patel, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I understand why we're doing this.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and describe the car accident.",
    "Client: Alright... I was driving home from work. It was raining heavily, and visibility was poor. I remember gripping the steering wheel tightly, leaning forward to see better through the windshield. The wipers were going at full speed, but it barely helped. I was so tense, my shoulders were up to my ears.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10. I can feel my heart beating a bit faster.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Continue.",
    "Client: Suddenly, I saw headlights coming towards me. They were in my lane. I panicked, swerving to avoid them. My car started to skid. I lost control... The world was spinning. I heard the screeching of tires, the crunch of metal. The airbag exploded in my face. It felt like being punched. I couldn't breathe. The smell of burning rubber filled my nostrils.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 7. My palms are sweating, and I feel a tightness in my chest.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: After the crash, there was this eerie silence. Then I heard someone screaming. It took me a moment to realize it was me. I was trapped, my legs pinned under the dashboard. The pain was excruciating. I could taste blood in my mouth. I thought I was going to die there, alone in the rain.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's an 8 now. I feel like I'm back there. My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: I... I remember the sound of sirens in the distance. They seemed so far away. I was shivering, partly from shock, partly from the cold rain coming through the shattered window. I kept thinking about my late wife, wondering if I'd see her soon. The fear was overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's still at 8. I feel dizzy, like the room is spinning.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it.",
    "Client: The rescue team arrived. They were talking to me, but their voices sounded muffled. I remember the pain as they cut me out of the car. Every movement was agony. When they finally got me out, the rain hit my face. It was oddly refreshing, like it was washing away the nightmare. But then I saw my mangled car, and the reality hit me hard.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down. Maybe a 6? I feel exhausted, but the panic is subsiding.",
    "Therapist: That's good. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Drained. My muscles are sore from tensing up. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a bit relieved? Like I've faced something I've been avoiding.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You did well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was tough, but I think it helped. I haven't allowed myself to remember it in such detail before.",
    "Therapist: That's the goal. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Tired, but okay. My SUDS is probably down to a 3 now. I feel more in control.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's end here and discuss coping strategies."
