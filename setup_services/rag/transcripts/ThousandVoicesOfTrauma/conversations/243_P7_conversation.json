    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the medical incident that led to your imprisonment?",
    "Client: Well, it was about two years ago. I was in the hospital for a routine check-up, and suddenly everything went wrong. I remember lying on the examination table when the doctor came in with a grim expression. He said they found something concerning and needed to run more tests immediately. Before I knew it, I was being wheeled into a small, windowless room. The walls were stark white, and the fluorescent lights buzzed overhead. It felt like I was trapped in a box, cut off from the world.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: They started hooking me up to various machines. The beeping was constant, almost maddening. I could feel my heart racing, and my palms were sweaty. I tried to ask questions, but the medical staff seemed to ignore me. They spoke in hushed tones, using words I didn't understand. I felt so powerless, like I was no longer in control of my own body or decisions. The worst part was when they told me I couldn't leave. They said it was for my own safety, but it felt like I was being imprisoned.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: It's hard to describe the panic I felt. I've never been claustrophobic, but in that moment, the walls seemed to be closing in on me. I couldn't breathe properly. I remember trying to sit up, but the tubes and wires restricted my movement. A nurse came in and pushed me back down, telling me to stay still. Her touch felt invasive, threatening. I wanted to scream, to fight back, but I was too weak and scared. The helplessness was overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Hours passed, or maybe it was days. Time lost all meaning in that room. The constant tests, the needles, the prodding - it all blurred together. I felt like a lab rat, not a person. The worst part was the isolation. My family wasn't allowed to visit due to some medical protocol. I was alone with my fears, my imagination running wild with worst-case scenarios. Every time a doctor entered, I braced myself for bad news. The uncertainty was torture.",
    "Therapist: I understand this is difficult. You're doing great.",
    "Client: One night, I woke up in a cold sweat. The room was dark except for the glow of the machines. For a moment, I forgot where I was and tried to get up. The alarm on one of the machines started blaring, and suddenly the room was flooded with light and people. They held me down, saying I was having a panic attack. Someone jabbed a needle into my arm, and everything started to go fuzzy. As I was losing consciousness, all I could think was, \"This is it. I'm going to die here, alone and afraid.\" The feeling of utter helplessness and loss of control... it still haunts me.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I'm shaking a bit. My heart is racing, just like it did back then. It's hard to talk about this, to relive those moments. I can almost smell the antiseptic, feel the cold metal of the bed rails. But at the same time, there's a part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I survived it once, so maybe I can face the memory now. It's still terrifying, but I'm here, I'm safe, and I'm talking about it. That's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You've shown incredible strength today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It means a lot to hear that. You know, I've never really told anyone the full story before. I always felt like people wouldn't understand, or they'd think I was overreacting. But going through it step by step like this... it makes me realize just how traumatic it really was. I'm not crazy for feeling this way, am I? For still being affected by it after all this time?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. Your feelings are valid.",
    "Client: That's... that's reassuring to hear. I've spent so long trying to push these memories away, to pretend they didn't affect me. But they did. They changed me. I used to be so independent, so confident in my health and my body. Now, I find myself hesitating to even go for a check-up. The fear of being trapped like that again... it's paralyzing sometimes. But talking about it like this, facing it head-on... it's terrifying, but also somehow liberating. Like I'm finally acknowledging what happened to me instead of running from it.",
    "Therapist: You're making great progress. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: I... I think I can keep going. It's hard, and part of me wants to stop, to retreat back into denial. But another part of me feels like I need to see this through. Like maybe if I can face these memories here, with you, I can start to regain some of the control I lost that day. Is that... is that normal? To feel both scared and determined at the same time?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Those feelings often go hand in hand.",
    "Client: Okay, that's good to know. I guess I'll continue then. After that night when they sedated me, things got even worse. The doctors decided I needed to be under constant observation. They moved me to a different room, one with a large window where the nurses could always see me. It felt like being in a fishbowl. I had no privacy, no moment of peace. Every time I closed my eyes, someone would come in to check on me. The lack of sleep, the constant interruptions... it was like a form of torture. I started to lose track of reality. Was I really sick, or was this all some terrible mistake? I couldn't trust my own judgment anymore.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're safe now.",
    "Client: Thank you for reminding me. It's easy to get lost in those memories. The feeling of powerlessness was the worst part. Every decision was made for me - what I ate, when I slept, what medications I took. I felt like a child, but not in a cared-for way. More like I was completely at the mercy of others. There was one nurse who was particularly rough. She would come in to change my IV, and her hands were always cold. She never spoke to me, just treated me like an object. Each time she touched me, I wanted to scream. But I couldn't. I was too afraid of what might happen if I caused trouble.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel angry about that. You're handling this bravely.",
    "Client: Angry... yes, I guess I am angry. I've never really let myself feel that before. I was always too focused on the fear and the helplessness. But you're right, I am angry. Angry at the doctors for not explaining things better, angry at the nurses who treated me like a nuisance, angry at myself for not standing up for my rights. And yet, beneath all that anger, there's still this core of fear. Fear that if I speak up, if I let myself feel this anger, somehow I'll end up back in that room, powerless and alone.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have mixed emotions. You're doing great exploring them.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's... it's overwhelming to face all these emotions at once. But in a strange way, it's also empowering. Like I'm finally allowing myself to process what happened, instead of just trying to bury it. I remember the day they finally told me I could go home. I should have been relieved, but instead, I felt this intense anxiety. What if they changed their minds? What if something went wrong as soon as I left? It took all my courage to actually walk out of that hospital. And even then, for weeks afterward, I kept expecting someone to show up and tell me it was all a mistake, that I had to go back.",
    "Therapist: That must have been very difficult. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, to be honest. Reliving all of this is draining. But there's also a part of me that feels... lighter, somehow. Like I've been carrying this heavy secret around, and now I'm finally starting to put it down. It's scary, but also... hopeful? Is that the right word? I don't know if I'll ever be completely free of these memories, but maybe I can learn to live with them without letting them control me. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You've shown incredible strength today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this, let alone feel like I might be able to move past it. It's still scary, and I know we have more work to do, but for the first time in a long time, I feel like there might be a light at the end of this tunnel. I'm grateful for your guidance and support through this process. It means more than I can express.",
    "Therapist: You've done remarkable work today. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. I feel drained, but in a positive way, if that makes sense. Like I've finally started to lance a wound that's been festering for too long. Thank you for your patience and understanding. I know it couldn't have been easy to listen to all of this. I'm nervous about what comes next, but also... cautiously optimistic. Is it okay if we take a moment before I leave, just to sit quietly? I think I need a few minutes to ground myself before I face the outside world again.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take all the time you need."

      "Client: Thank you. It's... it's overwhelming to face all these emotions at once. But in a strange way, it's also empowering. Like I'm finally allowing myself to process what happened, instead of just trying to bury it. I remember the day they finally told me I could go home. I should have been relieved, but instead, I felt this intense anxiety. What if they changed their minds? What if something went wrong as soon as I left? It took all my courage to actually walk out of that hospital. And even then, for weeks afterward, I kept expecting someone to show up and tell me it was all a mistake, that I had to go back."
