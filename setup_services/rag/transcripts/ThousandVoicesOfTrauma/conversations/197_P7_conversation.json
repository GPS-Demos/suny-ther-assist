    "Therapist: Welcome, Fatima. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit anxious, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about the cyber bullying incident, and it's making me nervous.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's just... every time I think about it, my heart starts racing. I never thought I'd be a victim of cyber bullying at my age.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Okay... It started when I joined that online support group for divorced women. At first, it was wonderful. I felt less alone. But then, this one woman... she started targeting me. She would mock my posts, twist my words, and make cruel jokes about my Middle Eastern background.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that memory. You're safe here.",
    "Client: It's hard... She created memes of me using my profile picture, adding offensive text. She shared them in the group and on other platforms. I felt so exposed, so violated. My children saw them... they were horrified.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I couldn't sleep. I kept checking my phone, dreading what I might see next. My depression got worse. I felt like I couldn't trust anyone online anymore. I started isolating myself, even from my family. I was embarrassed and ashamed.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: The worst part was when she found my business page and started leaving negative reviews. I'm self-employed, and my reputation is everything. I felt like my whole life was crumbling. I kept thinking, \"I'm 68, I shouldn't have to deal with this childish behavior.\"",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. Continue.",
    "Client: I tried to report her, but the group admins were slow to respond. It felt like nobody was on my side. I started having nightmares about being chased by faceless people laughing at me. I felt so powerless, so vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. Keep going.",
    "Client: Eventually, my daughter helped me gather evidence and report the woman to the platform. She was banned, but the damage was done. I still struggle with trusting online interactions. I feel like I'm always on edge, waiting for the next attack.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Talking about it... it's hard, but I feel a little lighter. Like I'm taking back some control. But I'm also exhausted. Reliving it is draining.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You did very well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I just want to feel safe online again. I miss the connections I had, but I'm so scared of being hurt again.",
    "Therapist: We'll work on that together. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I hope so. Sometimes I feel silly for being so affected by this. I've faced other challenges in my life, but this one... it just hit differently.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. It's okay to be affected.",
    "Client: Thank you for saying that. It helps to hear it from someone else. I'm trying to be strong for my family, but sometimes it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have those moments. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I'm trying to focus on the positive things in my life, like my grandchildren. But sometimes the fear and anxiety just creep back in.",
    "Therapist: That's natural. We'll work through it together.",
    "Client: I hope so. I want to be able to enjoy my online business and connections again without this constant fear. It's affecting everything - my work, my relationships, my sleep.",
    "Therapist: You're taking important steps. Be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's a long journey, but I'm committed to healing. I don't want this experience to define me or limit my life any further.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but also a bit relieved. Talking about it is hard, but I can feel it's helping. I'm grateful for this safe space to process everything.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. We'll end here."
