    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to be talking about the earthquake, and just thinking about it makes my heart race a little.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 5 out of 10 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. When you're ready, close your eyes and take us back to that day.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Alright... It's early morning, and I'm in my apartment in Christchurch. I've just woken up and I'm making coffee. The sun is barely up, and everything is quiet. Then... then the ground starts to shake. It's gentle at first, but it quickly becomes violent. I... I can hear things falling and breaking all around me.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. My heart is pounding so hard I can feel it in my throat. I can't think straight. I'm frozen in place, gripping the kitchen counter.",
    "Therapist: What do you see around you?",
    "Client: The... the cupboards are flying open. Dishes are crashing to the floor. The coffee pot slides off the counter and shatters. I can hear car alarms going off outside, and people screaming. It's so loud, like a freight train is passing right through my living room.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I try to move, to get under the table, but I'm stumbling. The floor is moving so much, it's like being on a ship in a storm. I fall, and... and I cut my hand on some broken glass. I can see blood, but I barely feel it. I'm too scared.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm going to die. This is it. The building is going to collapse, and I'm going to be crushed. I'm thinking about my family, my husband. Will I ever see them again? Oh God, it just keeps going and going...",
    "Therapist: You're safe now, Sarah. Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: (Breathing heavily) It's... it's about an 8 now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember your grounding techniques. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: (Takes another deep breath) Right... okay. I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: The shaking finally stops, but everything is silent for a moment. It's eerie. Then I hear people crying, shouting for help. I'm shaking so bad I can barely stand up. When I do, I see that my apartment is destroyed. There's glass and debris everywhere. I can smell gas.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I grab my phone and my keys. I'm still in my pajamas, but I don't care. I need to get out. I'm stumbling down the stairs, they're cracked and shifted. Outside, it's chaos. Buildings are damaged, some have collapsed. There's dust everywhere, making it hard to breathe.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in shock, I think. It doesn't feel real. I'm looking at my neighborhood, places I see every day, and it's like a war zone. I can hear sirens in the distance. People are wandering around, dazed and injured. I... I see a woman crying, holding a child. I want to help, but I don't know how.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Sarah. Stay with the memory. What happens after that?",
    "Client: I... I start walking. I don't even know where I'm going at first. I'm just moving away from the buildings, afraid they might collapse in an aftershock. I end up in a park with a bunch of other people. Everyone looks shell-shocked. We're all just... waiting. For what, I don't know.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking about during this time?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm worried sick about my husband. He was at work, in the city center. I try calling him, but the lines are down. I keep imagining the worst. What if his building collapsed? What if he's hurt, or... or worse? I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly difficult. How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still pretty high. Maybe a 7.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to breathe. Remember, you survived this. You're here now.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) Yeah... yeah, I did survive.",
    "Therapist: When you're ready, continue with what happened next.",
    "Client: Okay... As we're in the park, aftershocks keep hitting. Each one sends a wave of panic through the crowd. People are crying, praying. I'm trying to stay calm, but every time the ground shakes, I feel like I'm right back in that first moment. Hours pass, and we start hearing news trickling in. The damage is extensive. People have died. I... I still haven't heard from my husband.",
    "Therapist: How are you coping with the uncertainty?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm trying to stay hopeful, but it's hard. I keep cycling between panic and numbness. Someone in the crowd has a battery-powered radio, and we're all huddled around it, desperate for information. Every time they mention a collapsed building, my heart stops. I'm... I'm so scared.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Keep going.",
    "Client: As night falls, it gets cold. We're still in the park, afraid to go back to our homes. Some people have blankets or jackets, but I'm still in my pajamas. I'm shivering, but I barely notice. All I can think about is my husband. I've tried walking to his office, but the roads are blocked. Emergency services are everywhere.",
    "Therapist: What do you do to get through the night?",
    "Client: I... I don't sleep. I can't. Every time I close my eyes, I feel the ground shaking again. I talk to the people around me, sharing our stories, our fears. It helps a little, knowing I'm not alone in this. But I still feel so isolated, so powerless.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe a 6?",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: As dawn breaks, I decide I can't just sit and wait anymore. I start walking towards the city center again. The streets are a mess - cracked roads, fallen power lines, abandoned cars. I have to climb over rubble in some places. It's like walking through a nightmare.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling as you make this journey?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm determined, but also terrified of what I might find. Every step is a struggle. I'm exhausted, hungry, and scared. But I have to find my husband. I have to know.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I finally make it to his office building. It's still standing, but damaged. There are rescue workers everywhere. I'm frantically asking anyone I can if they've seen him. No one has answers. I'm about to break down when I hear someone call my name. It's... it's him. He's alive.",
    "Therapist: That must have been an overwhelming moment. How did you feel?",
    "Client: I... I can't even describe it. Relief, joy, disbelief... I just ran to him and held on like I'd never let go. We both broke down crying. He had been trapped in the building for hours before they got him out. He was trying to find me too.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to really feel that reunion. You're safe, you're together.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Yeah... we made it. We survived.",
    "Therapist: You did. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained, but also relieved. Talking about it... it's hard, but it feels like I'm starting to process it better.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress, Sarah. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 4, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant improvement. You've done incredibly well today. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay... thank you. This... this is helping. It's hard, but it's helping.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. Remember, you're resilient, and you're not alone in this journey."
