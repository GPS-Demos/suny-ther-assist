    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, James?",
    "Client: I... I'm not really sure. It's a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving that memory of being bullied because of my ethnicity... it brought up a lot of emotions I thought I'd buried.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The feeling of helplessness, I guess. I remember standing there in the school hallway, surrounded by these guys who were taunting me, calling me names... God, I can still hear their voices. It's like I was right back there, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. How did your body react?",
    "Client: My heart was racing, and I felt this tightness in my chest. My palms got all sweaty, just like they did back then. It's crazy how vivid it all felt.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts went through your mind?",
    "Client: I kept thinking, \"Why me? What did I do to deserve this?\" And then... I felt angry. Not just at them, but at myself for not standing up to them. I've always carried that guilt, you know?",
    "Therapist: Guilt is common. How do you see it now?",
    "Client: I... I guess I'm starting to realize it wasn't my fault. I was just a kid, and they were the ones in the wrong. But it's still hard to shake that feeling sometimes.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. What else?",
    "Client: I noticed that as we went through the memory, it... it started to feel less overwhelming. Like, I could separate myself from it a bit more. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's a positive sign. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: It's... relieving, I suppose. Like maybe I'm not as trapped by this memory as I thought. But it's also a bit scary, you know? This has been a part of me for so long.",
    "Therapist: Change can be unsettling. What's your biggest fear?",
    "Client: I guess... I'm afraid of forgetting. Not the memory itself, but the impact it had on me. It shaped who I am in a lot of ways, both good and bad.",
    "Therapist: How has it shaped you positively?",
    "Client: Well, I've become more empathetic towards others who might be experiencing discrimination. And I'm studying social work now, partly because of what I went through. I want to help others who've been marginalized.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful transformation. Anything else?",
    "Client: I realized during the exposure that I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. I survived that experience, and here I am, working through it. That feels... empowering, I guess.",
    "Therapist: How might this realization affect your daily life?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I'll be less hesitant to put myself out there. I've always been a bit reserved, afraid of being judged. But if I could face this memory, maybe I can face other challenges too.",
    "Therapist: That's a great perspective. What's your next step?",
    "Client: I want to keep working on this. It's hard, but I feel like I'm making progress. Maybe... maybe I could try sharing my experience with a close friend? I've always kept it to myself.",

    "Client: It was tough, but... good. I feel drained, but also lighter somehow. Like I've put down a heavy backpack I've been carrying for years. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You did the hard work. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... I'm grateful. For this opportunity to heal, and for your support. I know we have more work to do, but for the first time in a long time, I feel hopeful about the future."
