    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Johnson. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we've talked about this, but actually doing it feels different. My hands are a bit clammy.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Can you rate your distress on the SUDS scale?",
    "Client: Um, probably a 6 out of 10. It's not overwhelming, but I can feel my heart beating faster.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Let's start when you're ready. Describe the scene as vividly as you can, in present tense.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm at the local park. It's a sunny afternoon, and I'm walking my neighbor's dog as a favor. The grass is really green, and there are kids playing on the playground nearby. I can hear their laughter... The dog, Max, is pulling on the leash a bit, eager to explore. I'm... I'm feeling relaxed, enjoying the fresh air and sunshine.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: As we're walking along the path, I notice a man with a large dog up ahead. The dog looks... intimidating. It's some kind of bulldog mix, I think. The man seems to be struggling to control it. I... I'm starting to feel a bit uneasy. My grip on Max's leash tightens.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: The man's dog suddenly lunges forward, breaking free from his grip. It's... it's running straight towards us. I can see its teeth, hear its aggressive barking. My heart is pounding now. I... I freeze. I can't move. Max is barking too, but it sounds far away. Everything seems to slow down...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What do you see and hear?",
    "Client: I... I see the dog getting closer. Its eyes look... wild. I can hear people shouting in the background, but it's muffled. My body feels cold, despite the sun. I want to run, but my legs won't move. The dog is almost upon us now...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to an 8. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... The dog reaches us. It's... it's not attacking me, but it goes for Max. There's a blur of fur and teeth. I hear Max yelping in pain. I'm... I'm screaming, but it doesn't sound like my voice. I finally manage to move, trying to pull Max away, but the other dog is so strong. I can smell its hot breath... feel its fur brush against my leg as I struggle to separate them.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with the memory. What happens next?",
    "Client: The owner finally reaches us. He's yelling and trying to pull his dog off. There's... there's blood on the ground. I don't know if it's Max's or the other dog's. My hands are shaking as I hold onto Max. People are gathering around us now. Someone's saying they've called for help. I... I can't stop staring at Max. He's whimpering, and I see a deep gash on his side. I feel... I feel so guilty. Like I failed to protect him.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still at an 8. My stomach feels queasy.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The next few minutes are a blur. A park ranger arrives. They're talking to me, but I can barely understand what they're saying. I'm just focused on Max, holding him, trying to comfort him. My clothes are stained with his blood. I... I can smell it. It makes me feel sick. The owner of the other dog is apologizing profusely, but I can't even look at him. I'm angry, but mostly I just feel... helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: Someone helps me get Max to my car. We're driving to the vet now. The car smells like blood and wet dog. I keep glancing at Max in the backseat. He's so quiet... I'm terrified he won't make it. My hands are shaking on the steering wheel. I... I keep seeing flashes of the attack in my mind. The sound of the dogs fighting, the feeling of fur and teeth... it's all jumbled up. I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Remember to take deep breaths. You're safe now. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 9. My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing really well. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you name five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: Um... I see the clock on the wall, your desk, the plant in the corner, the bookshelf, and... and the painting behind you.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, when you're ready, continue with the memory.",
    "Client: Okay... We arrive at the vet. I'm struggling to carry Max inside. My arms are shaking from the effort and the adrenaline. The waiting room is busy, but everything goes quiet when we enter. I must look a mess - covered in blood and dirt. A nurse rushes over to help. They take Max away quickly. I'm left standing there, feeling lost and scared. The receptionist is asking me questions, but I can barely focus. My mind keeps replaying the attack over and over...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with the memory. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I sit in the waiting room. Time seems to crawl. Every time a door opens, I jump. My clothes are stiff with dried blood. I can still smell it. I'm... I'm trying to call my neighbor, to tell her what happened, but my hands are shaking so much I can barely use my phone. When I finally get through, I break down crying. I feel so guilty, so responsible. What if Max doesn't make it? How can I face my neighbor?",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling overwhelmed. My SUDS is still at a 9. I can feel my heart pounding in my chest.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing great. Let's take another grounding moment. Can you tell me three things you can hear right now?",
    "Client: I can hear... the clock ticking, the air conditioning, and... and traffic outside the window.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue with the memory.",
    "Client: Alright... After what feels like hours, the vet finally comes out. I stand up so quickly I feel dizzy. She tells me Max will be okay. He needed stitches and will take some time to recover, but he'll live. I... I feel a rush of relief so strong it makes my knees weak. I start crying again, but this time from relief. The vet is explaining the aftercare, but I'm having trouble focusing. I just keep thinking about how close it was, how it could have been so much worse...",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. What happens after that?",
    "Client: My neighbor arrives at the vet. I... I'm terrified of how she'll react, but she just hugs me. She's not angry, just concerned about Max and... and me. We wait together until Max is ready to go home. When they bring him out, he's groggy and bandaged, but alive. Seeing him... it brings back flashes of the attack. The sounds, the smells... I have to take a deep breath to steady myself.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe a 7 now. I still feel shaky, but not as overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: We take Max home. My neighbor insists I stay with them for a while. I'm... I'm grateful. I don't want to be alone. As we settle Max into his bed, I can't stop watching him breathe. Every time he whimpers in his sleep, I flinch. I keep replaying the attack in my mind, thinking of what I could have done differently. My neighbor makes me some tea, but I can barely drink it. My hands won't stop shaking. I... I feel exhausted, but I'm afraid to close my eyes. Afraid I'll see it all again...",
    "Therapist: You've done really well today. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. Emotionally and physically. My SUDS is down to about a 6 now. I feel... I don't know, kind of numb?",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. You've processed a lot today. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay... I... I actually feel a bit lighter. Like I've let something out that I've been holding in for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's often how people feel after these sessions. You've done excellent work today. We'll talk more about this experience next time."
