    "Therapist: Mrs. Adebayo, today we'll begin imaginal exposure. Are you ready to discuss this?",
    "Client: I suppose so, doctor. Though I must admit, I'm not entirely sure what that means. Is it going to be difficult?",
    "Therapist: It can be challenging, but I'll guide you through it. How are you feeling about trying this?",
    "Client: Well, to be honest, I'm a bit nervous. At my age, I've been through so much already. The memories of fleeing my home country... they're not easy to revisit. But if you think it will help, I'm willing to try.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Can you share what concerns you most about this exercise?",
    "Client: I worry that bringing up those old memories might be too overwhelming. You know, doctor, when I close my eyes, I can still hear the sounds of gunfire and see the fear on my children's faces as we ran. It's been years, but it feels like yesterday sometimes.",
    "Therapist: I understand. How do you usually cope with these vivid memories?",
    "Client: Oh, I try to keep busy. I help my daughter with her children, I cook, I pray. But sometimes, late at night, the memories creep in, and I feel so helpless again. It's like being back there, powerless and afraid.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. Imaginal exposure can help process these memories. Shall I explain more?",
    "Client: Yes, please do. I want to understand what I'm getting myself into. Will it be like reliving everything all over again?",
    "Therapist: In a way, yes, but in a safe, controlled environment. How does that sound to you?",
    "Client: It sounds scary, if I'm being honest. But I trust you, doctor. You've been very kind to me these past few months. If you think this will help me sleep better at night and stop jumping at every loud noise, then I'm willing to give it a try.",
    "Therapist: Your trust means a lot. What questions do you have about the process?",
    "Client: Well, what exactly will I need to do? And what if it becomes too much for me to handle? I'm not as young as I used to be, you know. My heart isn't as strong as it once was.",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the traumatic event. We can pause anytime. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That sounds... manageable, I suppose. But doctor, will you be here with me the whole time? I don't think I could face those memories alone. They've been my burden for so long.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'll be here throughout. How else can I support you?",
    "Client: Just knowing you'll be here helps, doctor. Perhaps... could we have a cup of tea nearby? In my culture, tea is comforting. It might help me feel more at ease. And maybe, if it's not too much trouble, could we have a moment of prayer before we begin? It would mean a lot to me.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Tea and prayer are welcome. Anything else you need?",
    "Client: No, I think that covers it. Thank you for being so understanding, doctor. I know I'm not your usual patient - an old woman with a lifetime of hardships. But I'm grateful for your patience and kindness. I feel ready to face this challenge now, with your help.",
    "Therapist: Your resilience is inspiring. Shall we begin with a brief relaxation exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, that sounds like a good idea. I could use some relaxation before we delve into those difficult memories. You know, doctor, despite my age, I still find myself learning new things. Who would have thought I'd be doing something like this at 74? Life truly is full of surprises.",
