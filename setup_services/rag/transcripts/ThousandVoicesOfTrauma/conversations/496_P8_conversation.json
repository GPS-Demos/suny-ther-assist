    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. My heart's still racing a bit. It felt so real, you know? Like I was back there in the car, hearing the screeching tires and feeling the impact all over again. I can still smell the burning rubber and... and the airbag powder. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I think. No, maybe it's more like... anxiety? Yeah, anxiety. It's like this tight knot in my chest that won't go away. I keep thinking about how close I came to... to not making it. And then I feel guilty because I did survive, and others might not have been so lucky.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt manifest for you?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a weight on my shoulders. I find myself constantly wondering why I was spared. Was it just random chance? Do I deserve to be here? And then I feel awful for even thinking that because I know my family and friends are grateful I'm alive. But I can't shake this feeling that I should be doing more with my life now, you know?",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are coming up as you reflect on this?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how fragile life is. One moment you're driving home from class, and the next... everything changes. It makes me question a lot of things. Like, am I wasting my time? Should I be living differently? And then there's this constant fear that it could happen again. I've been avoiding driving as much as possible, which I know isn't practical, but... the thought of getting behind the wheel again terrifies me.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you're sharing this?",
    "Client: Tense. Really tense. My shoulders are all bunched up, and I notice I'm clenching my jaw. There's this nervous energy in my legs too, like I want to run or something. And my breathing... it's shallow. I have to remind myself to take deep breaths.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants reassurance that everything will be okay, but I know that's not realistic. I guess I need... understanding? And maybe some guidance on how to move forward. How to live with this fear without letting it control me. Is that even possible?",
    "Therapist: It is. How do you think facing this memory might help with that?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe the more I confront it, the less power it'll have over me? It's just so hard. Every time I think about it, it's like I'm right back there. But I've noticed that each time we do this, the intensity lessens a little. It's still awful, but... maybe a tiny bit more manageable? I don't know if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: It does. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much this accident has affected every part of my life. My studies, my relationships, even how I see the world. It's like there's a before and after, you know? And I'm still trying to figure out who I am in this 'after.' Sometimes I catch myself feeling angry - at the other driver, at the circumstances, even at myself for being in that situation. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Anger is a common response. How do you handle those feelings?",
    "Client: Not well, I think. I tend to bottle it up because I feel like I don't have the right to be angry. I mean, I survived, right? But then it comes out in other ways. I snap at my friends, or I'll have these intense workout sessions where I push myself too hard. It's like I'm punishing myself, in a way. I know that's not healthy, but I don't know how else to deal with it.",
    "Therapist: What might be a more helpful way to approach these feelings?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe talking about them more? Or finding some kind of outlet that doesn't involve hurting myself or pushing others away? I've thought about maybe joining a support group for accident survivors, but the idea of sharing this with strangers is intimidating. At the same time, I think it might help to know I'm not alone in feeling this way.",
    "Therapist: How does the idea of connecting with others who've had similar experiences feel?",
    "Client: It's scary, but... also kind of relieving? Like, maybe they'd understand without me having to explain everything. And maybe hearing their stories would help me feel less... I don't know, less broken? That's how I feel sometimes, like this accident broke something inside me and I don't know how to fix it. But if other people have gone through this and come out the other side, maybe there's hope for me too.",
    "Therapist: What gives you hope right now?",
    "Client: That's a tough one. I guess... the fact that I'm here, doing this therapy. Six months ago, I couldn't even talk about the accident without having a panic attack. Now, it's still hard, but I can get through it. And there are moments, brief ones, where I feel okay. Like maybe I can have a future that isn't defined by this trauma. Those moments are rare, but they're there. Is it naive to think they might become more frequent?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. How can you nurture those hopeful moments?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe by acknowledging them when they happen? And trying to remember them when things get tough? I've been thinking about starting a journal, actually. To write down the good moments, and maybe work through some of the harder stuff too. Do you think that could help?",
    "Therapist: It could be very beneficial. What else might support your healing?",
    "Client: I've been considering getting back into art. I used to draw a lot before the accident, but I haven't touched my sketchbook since. It always helped me process my emotions before. Maybe it could help now too? And I think... I think I need to try reconnecting with my friends. I've been pushing them away because I didn't want to burden them, but I'm realizing that isolation isn't helping. It's just making everything feel more overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like positive steps. How do you feel about our session today?",
    "Client: Exhausted, honestly. But also... lighter, somehow? Like I've set down a heavy backpack I've been carrying. I know there's still a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe I can do this. Like maybe I'm stronger than I thought. Is that... is that progress?",
    "Therapist: It certainly is. What's one thing you'll take away from today?",
    "Client: I think... the realization that it's okay to not be okay. That healing isn't linear, and setbacks don't mean failure. And maybe... maybe the accident changed me, but it doesn't have to define me. I can choose how I move forward. It won't be easy, but I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How would you like to close our session?",
    "Client: Could we... could we just sit in silence for a moment? I feel like I need to let all of this settle. And maybe... maybe end with a grounding exercise? I think that would help me transition back into the rest of my day.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take a few deep breaths together."
