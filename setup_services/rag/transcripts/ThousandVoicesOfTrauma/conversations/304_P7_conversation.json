    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure exercise. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the moment you learned about your loved one's passing?",
    "Client: It was a regular Tuesday morning. I was at work, just settling in at my desk when my phone rang. It was my mother, and her voice... it was shaky. She told me that my father had suffered a heart attack and... he didn't make it. I remember feeling like the world had stopped. My chest tightened, and I couldn't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: I... I remember gripping the edge of my desk, trying to steady myself. The office around me became a blur. I could hear my coworkers talking, but it all sounded muffled, like I was underwater. I kept thinking, \"This can't be real. It's a mistake.\" But my mother's sobs on the other end of the line... they were so raw, so real.",
    "Therapist: That's it. You're handling this bravely.",
    "Client: I felt so alone at that moment. Being the only South Asian person in my office, I didn't think anyone would understand the depth of my pain. In our culture, losing a parent... it's like losing a part of yourself. I wanted to scream, to let out this overwhelming grief, but I couldn't. I just sat there, frozen, as tears silently rolled down my face.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I remember looking at the family photo on my desk. It was from our last Diwali celebration. My father looked so happy, so alive. The contrast between that image and the reality I had just learned... it was too much. I felt a wave of nausea hit me, and I had to rush to the bathroom.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: In the bathroom, I broke down completely. I couldn't stop shaking. All I could think about was how I had spoken to him just the night before, and how normal everything had seemed. We had made plans for the weekend. Now, suddenly, those plans would never happen. I felt this overwhelming sense of regret for all the things left unsaid, all the moments we'd never share.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: As I tried to compose myself, I caught my reflection in the mirror. I looked pale, almost ghostly. And in that moment, I realized I needed to be strong for my mother and sisters. But I felt so unprepared, so lost. How could I support them when I could barely hold myself together? The weight of responsibility crashed down on me, and I felt like I couldn't breathe again.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I took a few deep breaths, splashed some water on my face, and tried to gather my thoughts. When I went back to my desk, my manager was there. He looked concerned but also uncomfortable. He told me to take as much time as I needed, but I could see the awkwardness in his eyes. It was like he didn't know how to deal with my grief, especially given our cultural differences.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue sharing what you remember.",
    "Client: I nodded and started packing up my things. As I was doing this, I overheard a coworker whisper, \"I hope he doesn't make a scene.\" It was like a knife to my heart. I felt so misunderstood, so alienated. I wanted to explain that in my culture, expressing grief isn't making a scene - it's honoring the person we've lost. But I didn't have the energy. I just left, feeling more alone than ever.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're handling this courageously.",
    "Client: The drive home was a blur. I remember gripping the steering wheel so tightly my knuckles turned white. I kept expecting to wake up from this nightmare. When I got home, the emptiness of my apartment hit me hard. I collapsed on the couch and just... broke. I cried for hours, alternating between disbelief, anger, and profound sadness. I wanted to call my father, to hear his voice one last time, but I knew that was impossible now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with those memories.",
    "Client: As night fell, I realized I needed to start making arrangements. Booking flights, informing relatives... it all felt so surreal. Each call, each message sent, made it more real. And through it all, there was this underlying fear. How would life be without my father? He was my rock, my guide. The thought of navigating life, especially as a minority in this country, without his wisdom and support... it terrified me.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel overwhelmed. You're handling this bravely.",
    "Client: I remember sitting on the floor, surrounded by old photo albums. Each picture was a reminder of what I'd lost. I found myself talking to the photos, telling my father how much I loved him, how sorry I was for any disappointments I might have caused. The guilt of being away, of not being there in his final moments, it was crushing. I felt like I had failed as a son, failed in my cultural duties.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. It's okay to express these feelings.",
    "Client: As dawn broke, I was still awake, lost in memories and regrets. The world outside my window seemed unchanged, but my world had shattered. I felt so disconnected from everything. How could life go on when such a vital part of mine had ended? The loneliness of that moment, the weight of grief and cultural expectations... it was almost unbearable.",
    "Therapist: You've done an incredible job sharing this difficult memory. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained, but also somewhat lighter. Talking about it, especially the cultural aspects that I often feel others don't understand, it's both painful and relieving. There's still a deep ache, but sharing it makes me feel less alone in my grief. Thank you for listening and understanding.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable strength. We'll end here for today."
