    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. My pain's been acting up a bit, which always makes me a bit anxious. But I'm here, ready to work on things.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad you're here. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: Honestly? I'm nervous. I've been dreading this part. The idea of reliving that dog attack... it makes my heart race just thinking about it. Is it really necessary?",
    "Therapist: I understand your concern. Can you tell me more about your hesitation?",
    "Client: Well, I've spent so long trying to forget what happened. The thought of purposely bringing it all back... it feels counterintuitive. And with my chronic pain, I'm worried it might make everything worse. Plus, I'm not sure I can handle the emotions that might come up.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How about we discuss the purpose behind this exercise?",
    "Client: Okay, I'm listening. But I'm still not sure about this. It's just... the memory is so vivid, you know? I can still hear the growling, feel the teeth... Sorry, I'm getting ahead of myself. Please, explain why we need to do this.",
    "Therapist: It helps process the trauma. By facing it, we can reduce its power over you.",
    "Client: I see. But won't reliving it just make everything worse? I mean, I've been managing okay by avoiding thinking about it. Well, mostly okay. I guess I do have nightmares sometimes, and I can't go near dogs anymore. But still, isn't this risky?",
    "Therapist: It may feel uncomfortable initially, but it's a crucial step towards healing. We'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: My pace? That's... reassuring, I suppose. But what if I panic? Or what if I can't do it at all? I don't want to disappoint you or waste our time.",
    "Therapist: You won't disappoint me. We're partners in this. What other concerns do you have?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about how I'll feel afterwards. Will I be able to function? I live with roommates, and I don't want them to see me upset. And work... I can't afford to take time off if this throws me off balance. Plus, with my chronic pain, I'm concerned that the stress might trigger a flare-up.",
    "Therapist: Those are understandable worries. We'll develop coping strategies together. What else?",
    "Client: I guess I'm also curious about what exactly we'll be doing. Will I need to close my eyes? Talk about every detail? How long will it last? And... will you be there the whole time?",
    "Therapist: Yes, I'll be here throughout. We'll start slowly, focusing on manageable parts of the memory.",
    "Client: Okay, that doesn't sound as scary as I imagined. So, we won't dive into the worst parts right away? That's a relief. I think I can handle that. But what if I get overwhelmed?",
    "Therapist: We can pause anytime. Your safety and comfort are priorities. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's... actually really comforting. Knowing we can stop if it gets too much helps a lot. I think I'm still nervous, but maybe a bit less so now. You really think this will help with my PTSD symptoms?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it's proven effective for many. Your courage in trying this is admirable.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot. I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be. It won't be easy, but if it helps me move past this and reclaim my life, it'll be worth it. Where do we start?",
    "Therapist: We'll begin by setting a safe mental space. Are you ready to try that now?",
    "Client: A safe mental space? That sounds good. Yes, I think I'm ready. Can you guide me through it? I want to do this right."
