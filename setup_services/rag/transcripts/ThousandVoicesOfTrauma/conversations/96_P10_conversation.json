    "Therapist: Good morning, Carlos. How are you feeling about our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: Buenos d\u00edas, Dr. Rodriguez. To be honest, I'm... I'm a bit anxious. My hands are a little shaky. It's been so long since I've talked about the accident, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: S\u00ed, I think so. Let's... let's give it a try.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: (deep breath) It's a sunny afternoon. I'm driving my old Chevy pickup, heading to pick up my granddaughter from school. The radio's playing some old boleros... (pauses) I can almost smell the leather seats.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm approaching the intersection near her school. The light's green, so I keep going. Then... then I hear this awful screeching sound. It's so loud, dios m\u00edo. I turn my head and there's this blue car coming right at me. It's not stopping. I... I can't...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Carlos. Stay with it. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 7. My heart's racing.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (audible breath) Okay... The blue car slams into my side. There's this horrible crashing sound, metal twisting. I'm spinning... everything's a blur. I can smell gasoline and burning rubber. My body jerks violently, and I feel this sharp pain in my chest. I can't breathe... I can't...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Carlos. Stay with those sensations. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I hear people shouting. Someone's calling for help. My vision's blurry, but I see faces peering in through the cracked windshield. They look scared. I want to tell them I'm okay, but I can't speak. My mouth tastes like blood.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. My chest feels tight, just like it did then. SUDS is maybe an 8 now.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave, Carlos. Remember, you're here with me, safe in my office. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: (shaky breath) Gracias... I... I can hear sirens in the distance. They're getting closer. I'm trying to move, but everything hurts. My left arm is pinned against the door. I'm so scared... I keep thinking about my granddaughter waiting for me. What if I never see her again?",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I'm thinking about my late wife, Maria. How devastated she'd be if something happened to me. I'm praying, \"Por favor, Dios, don't let me die here.\" The pain is getting worse, and I'm feeling lightheaded.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Carlos. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe a 9. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you survived this. You're here now, telling me about it. Take a deep breath and continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (audible breath) Okay... The paramedics arrive. I hear them talking, but it's all muffled. They're asking me questions, but I can barely respond. I feel them putting a neck brace on me, and then they're cutting me out of the truck. The movement sends sharp pains through my body.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My... my left side aches. I can almost feel the pressure of the door against me. My breathing is shallow, just like it was then.",
    "Therapist: Good, Carlos. You're very in touch with those sensations. Keep going.",
    "Client: They're lifting me onto a stretcher. The sky above me is so bright, it hurts my eyes. I hear one of the paramedics say something about internal bleeding. I'm terrified. As they load me into the ambulance, I catch a glimpse of my truck. It's... it's completely destroyed. I can't believe I was just inside that.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with those images and feelings.",
    "Client: The ambulance is moving now. The siren is so loud. There's a young paramedic beside me, telling me to stay awake. But I'm so tired... everything's starting to fade. I keep thinking about Maria, about my granddaughter. I don't want to die... I don't...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Carlos. You're safe here. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 10. I feel like I'm right there, slipping away.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for facing this. Remember, you survived. Can you tell me what you see in my office right now?",
    "Client: (opens eyes, looks around) I... I see your bookshelf. The... the plant in the corner. Your degrees on the wall.",
    "Therapist: Good. Take another deep breath. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: A little better. My heart's still racing, but... but I know I'm here. SUDS is maybe an 8 now.",
    "Therapist: You did very well, Carlos. Would you like to continue, or take a break?",
    "Client: I... I think I can continue. It's hard, but... but I want to get through this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes again. What happens next in the ambulance?",
    "Client: I... I'm drifting in and out of consciousness. The paramedic keeps talking to me, but his voice seems far away. I feel cold... so cold. There's a moment where I think... I think this is it. I'm going to die here.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about all the things I never got to do. I never got to see my granddaughter graduate. I never got to visit my hometown in Mexico one last time. I feel... I feel so much regret.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Carlos. What happens next?",
    "Client: We arrive at the hospital. Everything's a blur of bright lights and loud voices. They're rushing me somewhere... an operating room, I think. I hear someone say my blood pressure is dropping. I'm trying to stay awake, but it's so hard...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm scared. My chest feels tight. SUDS is about a 9.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Carlos. Remember, you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (audible breath) Okay... The last thing I remember is the cold operating room. Then... then everything goes black. When I wake up, I'm in a hospital bed. My whole body hurts, but I'm alive. I see my daughter sitting beside me, crying. She's holding my hand, telling me everything's going to be okay.",
    "Therapist: That must have been a powerful moment. How do you feel, remembering it now?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel grateful. Overwhelmed. There's still fear there, but also this immense relief. I survived. I got to see my family again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing very well, Carlos. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down to about a 6. I still feel shaky, but not as intense as before.",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. Can you tell me more about those first moments of waking up?",
    "Client: I remember feeling so disoriented. Everything hurt. But seeing my daughter there... it grounded me. I couldn't speak because of the tube in my throat, but I squeezed her hand. I wanted her to know I was there, that I was fighting.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to remember that connection?",
    "Client: It's... it's powerful. I feel a lump in my throat. I was so close to losing everything, but in that moment, I knew I had something to live for.",
    "Therapist: That's a beautiful realization, Carlos. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. Drained. But also... also a little lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's often how people feel after processing trauma. You've done incredibly well today. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end the session.",
    "Client: (takes several deep breaths) Gracias, Dr. Rodriguez. This was hard, but... but I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: You showed great courage today, Carlos. How are you feeling about continuing this work in our next session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm nervous, but also hopeful. I want to keep going. I want to get better.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. We'll continue at your pace. For now, let's focus on some grounding techniques to help you transition out of this session."
