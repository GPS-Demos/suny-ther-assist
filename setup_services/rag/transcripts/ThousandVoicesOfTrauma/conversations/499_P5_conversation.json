    "Therapist: Welcome, Amira. Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm... honestly, I'm quite nervous. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of revisiting that day with the dog attack... it makes my heart race just thinking about it. Is it really necessary?",
    "Therapist: I understand your anxiety. It's a crucial step for healing. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried that reliving it will be too intense. What if I panic? Or what if it makes things worse instead of better? I've been trying so hard to avoid thinking about it, and now you're asking me to do the opposite. It feels counterintuitive.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How do you think facing the memory might help?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe it could help me process what happened? But I'm still scared. I've been having nightmares about it, and I'm afraid this will make them worse. Plus, I'm embarrassed about how I reacted during the attack. I don't want to feel that shame again.",
    "Therapist: Facing fears often reduces their power. What support do you need to feel safe?",
    "Client: I think... maybe if you could remind me that I'm here in the present, not back there? And perhaps we could have a code word if I need to stop? I'm also worried about judgment. Can you promise you won't think less of me, no matter what I say or how I reacted?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're brave for doing this. Shall we establish a safe word?",
    "Client: Yes, please. How about... \"pause\"? It's simple and easy to remember, even if I'm feeling overwhelmed. And... can you tell me a bit more about what to expect? Will I have to close my eyes? How long will it last?",
    "Therapist: \"Pause\" works well. You can choose to close your eyes. We'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: Okay, that helps. I appreciate your patience with all my questions. I guess I'm trying to prepare myself as much as possible. Is it normal to feel this anxious before starting?",
    "Therapist: It's very normal. Your courage is commendable. Any other questions before we begin?",
    "Client: Thank you, that's reassuring. I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Just one last thing - after we finish, will there be time to decompress? I'm worried about leaving here feeling raw and vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll end with grounding exercises. You're in control throughout.",
    "Client: Okay, thank you. That makes me feel a bit more at ease. I appreciate your guidance and support. I know this won't be easy, but I'm trying to remind myself that it's a step towards healing. I'm ready to try, even though I'm scared.",
    "Therapist: Your readiness shows strength. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm taking deep breaths to calm myself. Can you remind me one more time why we're doing this? I need to hear it to steel myself for what's coming.",
    "Therapist: It helps process the trauma, reducing its impact on your daily life.",
    "Client: Right, okay. That makes sense. It's for my own good, even if it's difficult. I'm trying to hold onto that. Okay... I think I'm ready now. Let's do this before I lose my nerve."
