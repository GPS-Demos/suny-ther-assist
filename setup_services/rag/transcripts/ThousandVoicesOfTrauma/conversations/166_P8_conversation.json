    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I'm back there, you know? The sounds, the smells... it's all so vivid. I can feel the heat on my skin, hear the choppers overhead. It's... overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... guilt? I keep thinking about the people we left behind. The faces of the civilians... they haunt me. And then there's this anger bubbling up inside me. Why did we have to be there in the first place? It all seems so pointless now.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a knot in my stomach. Tight and hot. My jaw is clenched, and I want to... I don't know, lash out somehow. But then I remember where I am, and I feel ashamed. I shouldn't still be feeling this way after all these years, should I?",
    "Therapist: There's no \"should\" about your feelings. What else comes up for you?",
    "Client: I... I feel so alone. Even here, even now. No one really understands what it was like. And being a woman, being Asian... it was different for me. The guys, they... they didn't always treat me like I belonged. And then coming home, it's like I don't fit anywhere anymore. I'm caught between worlds, you know?",
    "Therapist: How does that sense of not belonging affect you now?",
    "Client: It's... it's exhausting. I feel like I'm always on guard, always trying to prove myself. At work, in relationships... I can never just relax and be myself. And then there's this constant sadness, this heaviness. Sometimes I wonder if it would've been better if I'd never come back at all.",
    "Therapist: What do you mean by that?",
    "Client: I... I don't mean... I'm not suicidal or anything. It's just... sometimes I think about the others who didn't make it back. They don't have to deal with all this. They're at peace. And here I am, still fighting a war that ended decades ago. It's like I can't escape it, no matter how hard I try.",
    "Therapist: What helps you keep going despite these feelings?",
    "Client: I... I guess it's the little things. My work, sometimes. Helping others, it gives me a sense of purpose. And there are moments, rare as they are, when I feel... okay. Like when I'm out in nature, or when I manage to connect with someone who gets it. Those moments remind me that maybe, just maybe, there's still hope for me.",
    "Therapist: How do those moments of connection feel different?",
    "Client: They're... they're like a breath of fresh air. For a moment, the weight lifts, and I can see beyond the trauma. I feel... human again. Not just a collection of broken pieces and bad memories. It's like... like coming up for air after being underwater for so long. But then... then reality sets back in, and I'm drowning again.",
    "Therapist: What comes up when you think about those brief moments of relief?",
    "Client: I... I feel a mix of things. There's gratitude, definitely. But also fear. Fear that they won't last, that I'll lose them. And then there's this... this tiny spark of hope. Maybe if I can feel okay for a moment, I can feel okay for longer. But it's scary to hope, you know? What if I'm setting myself up for disappointment?",
    "Therapist: How does that fear of disappointment manifest?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a wall I've built around myself. I don't let people get too close. I don't make plans for the future. It's safer that way, or at least it feels safer. But then I end up feeling so isolated, so stuck. It's like I'm protecting myself from pain, but in doing so, I'm causing myself a different kind of pain. Does that make any sense?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it does. What would it be like to lower that wall a little?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. It's terrifying to think about. But also... maybe a little exciting? The idea of actually connecting with people, of not always being on high alert... it's appealing. But then I think about all the times I've been hurt, all the misunderstandings and judgment I've faced. And I'm not sure if I'm strong enough to risk that again.",
    "Therapist: What strength do you think you'd need?",
    "Client: I... I guess I'd need to believe in myself more. To trust that I can handle whatever comes my way. And maybe... maybe I'd need to believe that there are people out there who can understand, or at least try to understand. It's just... it's hard to have faith in that when you've seen the worst of humanity, you know?",
    "Therapist: How does talking about this now make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a lot. I feel drained, but also... maybe a little lighter? Like I've put down a heavy pack I've been carrying for miles. There's still so much to work through, so much pain and fear. But talking about it, really diving into these feelings... it's hard, but it also feels like maybe, just maybe, I'm taking a step forward. Is that... is that normal?",
    "Therapist: There's no \"normal\" in healing. What matters is your experience.",
    "Client: I... I guess you're right. It's just... it's all so overwhelming sometimes. But being here, talking about it... it feels like I'm not alone in carrying this burden anymore. And that's... that's something. It's not much, but it's something. I just hope... I hope I can keep moving forward, you know? Even if it's just baby steps.",
    "Therapist: What would a small step forward look like for you?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe reaching out to someone? There's a veterans' group I've been thinking about joining, but I've always talked myself out of it. Or maybe it's as simple as allowing myself to feel these emotions without judgment. To sit with the pain instead of running from it or numbing it. It's scary to think about, but... but maybe it's necessary.",
    "Therapist: How does the idea of taking that step make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of emotions. There's fear, definitely. Fear of being vulnerable, of being misunderstood. But there's also a tiny spark of... excitement? Hope? The idea that maybe, just maybe, things could get better. That I could find a way to live with this trauma instead of being consumed by it. It's a small feeling, but it's there. And that's... that's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What do you want to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I... I think I'd like to explore that idea of taking a small step forward. Maybe we could talk more about what that might look like, and how I can prepare myself for it. And... and maybe we could delve more into how my experiences as a woman and as an Asian American have shaped my trauma and my recovery. It's something I haven't really talked about much, but I think it's important.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. Emotionally drained. But there's also this sense of... I don't know, accomplishment? Like I've done something difficult but important. It's not a good feeling exactly, but it's not bad either. It's like... like I've taken a step on a long, hard journey. And even though I know there's still so far to go, at least I'm moving. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. We'll pick up here next time. Take care.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I appreciate your help. It's not easy, but... but I think it's worth it. I'll see you next week."
