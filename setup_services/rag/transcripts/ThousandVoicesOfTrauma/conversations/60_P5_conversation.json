    "Therapist: Mrs. Thompson, today we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: Oh, dear. I'm not quite sure what to expect. It sounds a bit daunting, to be honest. With my chronic pain acting up lately, I've been feeling rather anxious about trying new things. Could you explain a bit more about what we'll be doing?",
    "Therapist: Of course. It's a way to process your trauma memories. We'll go through it step-by-step. Any questions?",
    "Client: Well, yes. I'm worried about reliving that awful hostage situation. It was so terrifying, and I've tried so hard to push those memories away. Will this make things worse? I'm not as young as I used to be, and I'm not sure if I can handle the stress.",
    "Therapist: I understand your concerns. This can help reduce symptoms over time. We'll go at your pace. How does that sound?",
    "Client: I appreciate your reassurance, but I'm still feeling quite apprehensive. Since losing my husband, I've found it harder to face difficult situations alone. How will you support me during this process? And what if I become overwhelmed?",
    "Therapist: I'll be here throughout, guiding you. We can pause anytime. Your safety is my priority. Shall we start slowly?",
    "Client: Alright, I suppose we can give it a try. I do want to feel better and not let these memories control me anymore. It's been affecting my part-time work and my relationships with my grandchildren. I just hope I'm strong enough for this. Will you tell me exactly what I need to do?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll start with a calm memory, then gradually approach the difficult one. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm putting my trust in you, young man. It's not easy for someone my age to revisit such traumatic events. But I've always believed in facing challenges head-on, just like my late husband taught me. Alright, let's proceed. What's the first step?",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes, take deep breaths. Imagine a safe place. Describe it to me.",
    "Client: Okay, I'm trying to relax. Let's see... I'm picturing my childhood home in New Zealand. The smell of the ocean, the sound of waves crashing against the shore. The warm sun on my face as I sit on the porch. It's peaceful here. I can almost feel the gentle breeze. Is this what you meant?",
    "Therapist: That's perfect. How do you feel in this safe place?"
