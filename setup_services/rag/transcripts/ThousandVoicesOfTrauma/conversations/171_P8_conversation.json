    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I'm back there, you know? The memory feels so vivid. I can still hear the shouting, the sound of glass breaking. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's like a cold grip around my chest. I keep thinking about how helpless I felt, watching everything unfold and not being able to do anything. I was frozen in place, praying they wouldn't notice me.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly frightening. What physical sensations are you aware of?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking a little. I feel tense all over, especially in my shoulders and jaw. There's this knot in my stomach that won't go away. And I'm sweating, even though the room isn't hot.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"What if they had seen me?\" or \"What if it happens again?\" It's like my brain is stuck in a loop of worst-case scenarios. I know it's over, but part of me feels like I'm still in danger.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts and feelings compare to when the event first happened?",
    "Client: They're... they're not as intense as they were right after it happened. Back then, I couldn't sleep for days. I jumped at every little noise. Now, it's more like... like an echo of that fear. It's still there, but not as overwhelming. I guess that's progress, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm realizing that I feel angry too. Not just at the people who did this, but at myself. I keep thinking I should have done something, anything. Even though logically I know there was nothing I could've done. It's frustrating to feel so... powerless.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. How do you cope with these feelings now?",
    "Client: I try to remind myself that I survived. That I'm safe now. Sometimes I do those breathing exercises we practiced. They help a little. And talking about it, like this... it's hard, but it feels like it's loosening something inside me. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. What else comes up for you?",
    "Client: I'm thinking about how this has affected my life. I used to love going out, being around people. Now, I'm always on edge in crowded places. I hate feeling this way. But... I'm also proud that I'm here, talking about it. That feels like a small victory.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant insight. How does it feel to recognize that?",
    "Client: It's... bittersweet, I guess. I'm glad I'm making progress, but I'm sad that this is something I have to deal with at all. I wonder sometimes if I'll ever feel completely \"normal\" again. But then I think, maybe this is my new normal, and that's okay too. I'm learning to be kinder to myself.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm realizing that talking about it doesn't make it happen again. For so long, I avoided thinking about it because I was afraid I'd fall apart. But here I am, remembering it, feeling all these emotions, and I'm still okay. It's intense, but I'm handling it. That feels... empowering, in a way.",
    "Therapist: That's an important step. How do you see this affecting your future?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's making me stronger, in a weird way. I never wanted this experience, but I'm learning so much about myself through dealing with it. I'm more aware of my emotions, more appreciative of the good moments. And I'm starting to believe that if I can get through this, I can get through anything. It's tough, but I'm tougher.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful perspective. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a mix of things. There's still fear and sadness, but also hope. Hope that I can keep working through this, that it'll get easier. And gratitude, I guess. For surviving, for having the chance to heal. It's a long road, but I feel like I'm on the right path. And... I'm grateful for this space to talk about it. It helps more than I can express.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. How are you feeling as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but in a good way? Like after a hard workout. Emotionally exhausted but also... lighter, somehow. Like I've set down a heavy backpack I've been carrying. I know I'll have to pick it up again, but for now, I feel a little more at peace. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: It's a common experience. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to work more on coping strategies for when the memories hit unexpectedly. And maybe explore how to feel safer in public spaces again. Baby steps, you know? But I feel ready to keep moving forward.",
