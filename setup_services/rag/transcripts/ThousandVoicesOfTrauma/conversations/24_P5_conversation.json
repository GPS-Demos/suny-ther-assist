    "Therapist: Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: I'm not sure, to be honest. The idea of revisiting that hostage situation... it makes me uneasy. I've spent years trying to forget it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about losing control. What if I can't handle reliving those moments? I've worked hard to keep it all locked away. It's been my way of coping, you know?",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your honesty. How do you think revisiting might help?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe it could help me process what happened? But I'm scared it'll make things worse. I've been having more nightmares lately, just thinking about this session.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Let's discuss what to expect.",
    "Client: Okay, I'm listening. But I have to admit, my heart's racing a bit just talking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. We'll go at your pace. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: How detailed do I need to be? There are parts... I'm not sure I can talk about them.",
    "Therapist: Share what you're comfortable with. We'll build gradually.",
    "Client: Alright. And what if I panic? I mean, I've had moments where I feel like I'm right back there, and it's terrifying.",
    "Therapist: We have strategies to ground you. Your safety is priority.",
    "Client: Okay, that's reassuring. I guess I'm just worried about opening Pandora's box, you know? Once we start this, there's no going back.",
    "Therapist: True, but it's a step towards healing. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It's scary, but I think I'm ready. I'm tired of letting this control my life. My wife, she's been so supportive, but I know it affects her too. I want to do this for both of us.",
    "Therapist: Your motivation is powerful. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do it. I'm nervous, but I trust you. Just... promise you'll help me if it gets too intense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We're in this together. Ready when you are."
