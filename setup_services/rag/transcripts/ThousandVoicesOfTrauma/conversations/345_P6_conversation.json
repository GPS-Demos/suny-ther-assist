    "Therapist: Okay, Mr. Johnson, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the day your wife asked for a divorce.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Alright... I'm sitting in our living room. Sarah walks in, looking upset. She says, \"Tom, we need to talk.\" My stomach immediately knots up.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, about a 4 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue.",
    "Client: Sarah sits down across from me. She's twisting her wedding ring, not making eye contact. She says, \"I can't do this anymore. I want a divorce.\" I feel like I've been punched in the gut. My hands start shaking, and I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. My palms are getting sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Keep going.",
    "Client: I try to speak, but my throat feels tight. I manage to choke out, \"Why?\" Sarah starts crying. She talks about how we've grown apart, how she feels lonely. I'm in shock. The room seems to be spinning.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's an 8 now. My heart's racing, and I feel dizzy.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Breathes deeply) Sarah keeps talking, but I can barely hear her over the ringing in my ears. I feel like I'm falling apart. Forty years of marriage, and it's ending like this. I start to cry, and I hate myself for it.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's still an 8. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: I ask Sarah if there's someone else. She hesitates, then nods. That's when I lose it. I start yelling, asking how she could do this to us, to our family. I'm shaking all over.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's shot up to a 9. I feel like I'm reliving it all over again.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here now. You're safe.",
    "Client: (Nods) Sarah starts packing a bag. I follow her around the house, begging her to stay, to give us another chance. But she won't look at me. When she walks out the door, I collapse on the floor. I've never felt so alone.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's back down to an 8. I feel exhausted.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I stay on the floor for hours. Our kids call, but I can't bring myself to answer. The house feels so empty. I keep expecting Sarah to walk back in, to say it was all a mistake.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's a 7. I feel drained, but the panic is subsiding a bit.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's start winding down. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Tired. Sad. But... maybe a little relieved to have talked about it.",
    "Therapist: That's completely normal. Let's end here. Open your eyes when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Opens eyes slowly) That was intense.",
    "Therapist: You did very well. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Drained, but okay. My SUDS is probably around a 5 now.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. We'll process this more next time."
