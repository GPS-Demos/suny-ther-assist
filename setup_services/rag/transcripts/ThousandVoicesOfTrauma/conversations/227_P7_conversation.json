    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure exercise. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the traumatic event?",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. It was a summer evening, I was about 8 years old. My parents were arguing again. I was in my room, trying to block out the noise with my pillow...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: Suddenly, I heard a loud crash. I was scared, but I crept out of my room. When I got to the living room, I saw... I saw my father holding a broken bottle. My mother was on the floor, crying. There was blood on her arm...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The room smelled like alcohol. My father's face was red with anger. I wanted to help my mother, but I was frozen in place. I felt so helpless...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I remember my heart pounding so hard. I couldn't breathe properly. My father saw me and yelled at me to go back to my room. But I couldn't move...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What happened next?",
    "Client: My mother saw me too. She looked... terrified. She managed to get up and came towards me. She was limping. My father grabbed her arm...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: I... I can't. It's too much. I feel like I'm back there again. My chest feels tight...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're here with me, in a safe place.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm trying. My mother reached me and pushed me back towards my room. She told me everything would be alright. But I knew it wasn't true. I could see the fear in her eyes...",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. Sad. Angry. Why did this have to happen? Why couldn't I do anything to help?",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those feelings. Remember, you were just a child.",
    "Client: I know, but... I still feel guilty. I should have done something. Maybe if I had called for help or...",
    "Therapist: You're not responsible for what happened. You were protecting yourself.",
    "Client: Maybe you're right. It's just... hard to accept. I can still hear the shouting, the sound of glass breaking. It's like it happened yesterday...",
    "Therapist: Your reactions are normal. You're processing this trauma.",
    "Client: I guess so. It's just... overwhelming sometimes. I've never really talked about this before. I've always tried to push it away, to forget...",
    "Therapist: Talking about it is a big step. You're showing great courage.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's difficult, but... I think it's helping. I've carried this for so long. It feels... I don't know, like a weight is lifting, even though it hurts...",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. You're doing important work here.",
    "Client: I just... I wonder how different things could have been. If my father hadn't been drinking, if my mother had left him sooner... Maybe I wouldn't be struggling with my own addiction now...",

    "Client: I appreciate that. It's hard to face these memories, but... I want to get better. I don't want my past to control my future anymore...",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful goal. You're making progress towards it.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I need a break now. This has been intense. But... I'm glad I shared this with you.",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've done excellent work today. Let's take some time to ground ourselves."
