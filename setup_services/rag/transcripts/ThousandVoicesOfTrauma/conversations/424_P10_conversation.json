    "Therapist: Welcome, Mx. Singh. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a part of me that wants to face this, but another part that's terrified. My hands are a bit shaky.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a quick SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 6 out of 10. My heart's already racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay, yes. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes and take us to that day of the airplane crash.",
    "Client: I'm... I'm at the airport. It's bustling with activity. The smell of coffee and pastries fills the air. I'm waiting for my flight to visit my grandchildren. I haven't seen them in years, and I'm excited but also anxious about flying.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I board the plane. The seats are cramped, and I can feel my knees pressing against the seat in front of me. The air feels stuffy, and I'm starting to feel a bit claustrophobic. Oh god, my heart's racing just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Take a deep breath. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: I see... other passengers settling in. A young mother trying to calm her crying baby. The flight attendants are going through the safety demonstration, but I can barely focus on their words. My palms are sweating, and I'm gripping the armrests tightly.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... terrified. Like I can't breathe. The plane starts to move, and I can hear the engines roaring. It's so loud, and I can feel the vibrations through my entire body. I want to scream, to get off, but I'm frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. Maybe even a 9.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're safe here. Continue.",
    "Client: We're... we're in the air now. The plane is climbing, and I can feel my ears popping. Suddenly, there's a loud bang, and the plane lurches to the side. People are screaming, and oxygen masks drop from above. I'm fumbling with mine, my hands shaking so badly I can barely get it on.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What do you hear?",
    "Client: I hear... alarms blaring. The captain's voice comes over the intercom, but it's garbled. People are crying and praying. The plane is shaking violently, and I can see... oh god, I can see smoke coming from the wing outside my window.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: We're losing altitude fast. The flight attendants are strapped in, and their faces are pale with fear. I close my eyes and think of my family, my grandchildren. I never got to say goodbye. The plane is spinning now, and I can feel my stomach lurch. I'm certain we're going to crash.",
    "Therapist: What sensations are you experiencing in your body?",
    "Client: My... my whole body is tense. I can feel my heart pounding in my chest, and I'm breathing so fast I'm getting lightheaded. My fingers are numb from gripping the armrests so tightly. I feel like I might pass out.",
    "Therapist: Take a slow, deep breath. You're doing well.",
    "Client: *inhales shakily* The impact... it's deafening. Metal screeching, glass shattering. My body is thrown forward, and pain explodes everywhere. I can taste blood in my mouth. Everything goes dark for a moment, and when I open my eyes, the plane is in pieces around me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What do you see?",
    "Client: Chaos. Absolute chaos. There's smoke everywhere, and I can hear people moaning in pain. I'm still strapped to my seat, but it's been ripped from the floor. I can smell fuel and something burning. My leg is twisted at an odd angle, and I can't feel my left arm.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Terrified. In shock. I... I can't believe I survived. But the guilt... oh god, the guilt. Why me? Why did I survive when others didn't?",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm trying to unbuckle my seatbelt, but my hands are shaking too much. I can hear sirens in the distance. Someone nearby is calling for help. I want to help them, but I can't move. I'm trapped, and the smoke is getting thicker. I'm coughing, struggling to breathe.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 10. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Take a moment to ground yourself.",
    "Client: *takes several deep breaths* Okay... okay. I can hear rescuers now. They're calling out, asking if anyone can hear them. I try to shout, but my voice is weak. I'm fading in and out of consciousness. The pain is overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: Someone finds me. They're talking to me, but I can barely understand. They're cutting me free from the seat. The movement sends waves of pain through my body. I'm being lifted onto a stretcher, carried out of the wreckage. The sunlight is blinding after the darkness of the smoke.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel as you're being rescued?",
    "Client: Relief... but also guilt and confusion. I'm in so much pain, but I'm alive. I can see other victims being carried out, some covered in sheets. The enormity of what's happened is starting to sink in.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: I'm in the ambulance now. The paramedics are working on me, asking me questions. But all I can think about is the others. The young mother and her baby. The elderly couple across the aisle. Did they make it? Why am I alive when they might not be?",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those thoughts. What else do you remember?",
    "Client: The hospital is a blur of bright lights and urgent voices. I'm wheeled into surgery. When I wake up, I'm in a hospital bed. My family is there, crying, hugging me. But I feel... numb. Disconnected. Like I'm watching everything from outside my body.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, as you recall this?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm overwhelmed. My chest feels tight, and I'm crying. But it's... it's different. I feel like I'm finally letting go of something I've been holding onto for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 7 now. I feel drained, but also... lighter, somehow.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well. Let's take a moment to breathe and ground ourselves.",
    "Client: *takes several deep breaths* Thank you. I... I never thought I'd be able to talk about this in such detail.",
    "Therapist: You've shown immense courage. How are you feeling about the session?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... proud, I think. Like I've faced something I've been running from for years.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant achievement. Let's end here and discuss how you're feeling.",
    "Client: Okay. I... I think I need a moment to just sit with this. It's a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take your time. We'll debrief when you're ready."
