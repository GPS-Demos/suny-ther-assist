    "Therapist: Welcome, John. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling a bit on edge, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. How would you rate your anxiety from 0 to 100?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 60 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember to describe the event in present tense, as if it's happening now. Begin when you're ready.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm boarding the plane. It's a sunny day, but I can feel my heart racing already. The cabin feels so cramped, and I'm struggling to fit my carry-on in the overhead bin. A flight attendant offers to help, but I snap at her... I feel embarrassed, but also irritated. Why did I agree to this trip?",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What are you noticing in your body?",
    "Client: My palms are sweaty, and there's this tightness in my chest. I keep glancing at the other passengers, wondering if they can tell how anxious I am. I'm in my seat now, and the safety demonstration is starting. God, I hate this part. It just reminds me of all the things that could go wrong.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The plane starts taxiing, and I'm gripping the armrests so hard my knuckles are white. The engines rev up, and we're speeding down the runway. My stomach lurches as we lift off. I'm trying to breathe, but it feels like I can't get enough air. The plane banks to the left, and I can see the ground getting smaller through the window. It's... it's terrifying.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... probably around 75. This is harder than I thought it would be.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... We're at cruising altitude now, but I can't relax. Every little bump or sound makes me jump. The person next to me is trying to make small talk, but I can barely focus on what they're saying. I keep imagining what would happen if the engines failed, or if there was a hole in the fuselage. My mind is racing with worst-case scenarios.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those thoughts. What do you see happening?",
    "Client: I... I see the oxygen masks dropping down. There's a loud bang, and the plane starts shaking violently. People are screaming, and I can't breathe. The plane is nosediving, and I know we're going to crash. I'm frozen in my seat, unable to move or think. This is it. This is how I'm going to die.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Take a moment to ground yourself.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Right, okay. I'm here, in the office. But god, it feels so real.",
    "Therapist: I know it's difficult. What's happening next in the scene?",
    "Client: The plane is plummeting towards the ground. I can see trees and buildings getting closer through the window. The flight attendants are yelling instructions, but I can't make out what they're saying over the noise. My ears are popping from the rapid descent. I'm trying to brace myself, but I don't know if it'll make any difference.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: We hit the ground with a deafening crash. The impact throws me forward, and my seatbelt digs into my waist. There's smoke everywhere, and I can smell fuel. People are screaming and crying. I'm disoriented, but I manage to unbuckle my seatbelt. I'm stumbling towards the emergency exit, pushing past other passengers. I feel guilty, but I'm desperate to get out.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My heart is pounding so hard I can feel it in my throat. My hands are shaking, and I feel nauseous. It's like I can actually smell the smoke and fuel.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to breathe. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 90 now. This is intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... I've made it out of the plane. The heat from the fire is intense, and I can hear explosions behind me. I'm running as fast as I can, but my legs feel like jelly. I trip and fall, scraping my hands on the ground. I look back and see the plane engulfed in flames. There are still people inside, and I feel this overwhelming guilt that I can't help them.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I should go back. I should try to help. But I'm terrified. I can't make myself move towards the plane. I'm a coward. People are dying, and I'm just standing here, frozen. I can hear sirens in the distance, but they seem so far away. Will they get here in time? Why didn't I do more to help?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep describing what's happening.",
    "Client: Emergency vehicles are arriving now. Firefighters are rushing towards the plane, and paramedics are tending to the injured passengers who made it out. Someone wraps a blanket around my shoulders and leads me to an ambulance. I'm in shock, I think. Everything feels surreal, like I'm watching it happen to someone else.",
    "Therapist: What are you noticing about your surroundings?",
    "Client: There's chaos everywhere. People are crying, shouting for loved ones. The air is thick with smoke, and my eyes are stinging. I can hear the crackling of the fire and the sound of metal groaning as the plane's structure gives way. It's... it's overwhelming. I feel like I can't process everything that's happening.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My throat feels tight, and I'm fighting back tears. There's this crushing weight of guilt and relief mixed together. I survived, but others didn't. How am I supposed to deal with that?",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm being taken to the hospital. The ride in the ambulance is a blur. I keep replaying the crash in my mind, wondering if there was anything I could have done differently. At the hospital, doctors are checking me over, but I can barely focus on what they're saying. I just keep seeing the faces of the other passengers, hearing their screams.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still around 85. I thought it would have gone down by now.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. It's a difficult memory. Keep going.",
    "Client: Hours have passed, and I'm sitting in a waiting room. My family arrives, crying and hugging me. I should feel relieved, but I just feel numb. A police officer comes to take my statement, and I struggle to recount what happened. It's like my brain is trying to protect me by blurring the details, but at the same time, certain moments are crystal clear.",
    "Therapist: What are those clear moments?",
    "Client: The sound of the impact. The heat of the fire. The faces of the people I passed as I was escaping. They're burned into my memory. I keep wondering about their families, if they made it out too. There's this gnawing feeling that I should have done more, helped more people.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe now. Take a moment to ground yourself.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Yeah, okay. I'm here. It's... it's over.",
    "Therapist: Good. Can you describe how you're feeling as the memory ends?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Physically and emotionally drained. There's this hollow feeling in my chest, like something's been scooped out. I'm relieved that I survived, but also guilty about that relief. And there's this overwhelming sense of vulnerability. Like, if this could happen, what else could go wrong in my life?",
    "Therapist: Those are all normal reactions. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 70. Still high, but... better than before.",
    "Therapist: You've done an excellent job. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Honestly? Wrung out. But also... I don't know, maybe a little proud? That I got through it, I mean. It was tough, but I did it.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You showed great courage today. Let's take a few minutes to debrief and discuss some coping strategies before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay, yeah. That sounds good. I could use some grounding right about now.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's start with some deep breathing exercises..."
