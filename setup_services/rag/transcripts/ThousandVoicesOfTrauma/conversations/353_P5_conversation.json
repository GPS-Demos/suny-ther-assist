    "Therapist: Hello, Carlos. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Ramirez. I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. You mentioned last time we'd be trying something new?",
    "Therapist: That's right. We'll be starting imaginal exposure. How much do you know about it?",
    "Client: Not much, to be honest. I've heard the term, but I'm not sure what it involves. Is it... is it going to be difficult?",
    "Therapist: It can be challenging, but it's very effective. Shall I explain more?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I'm feeling a bit anxious about it, so understanding what we're doing might help.",
    "Therapist: Imaginal exposure involves revisiting your traumatic memory in a safe environment. We'll go through it step-by-step.",
    "Client: Revisit the memory? I... I don't know if I can do that. Just thinking about it makes my heart race.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. Remember, you're safe here. How else are you feeling?",
    "Client: Scared, honestly. And a little angry too. I've spent so long trying not to think about what happened, and now you want me to dive right into it?",
    "Therapist: I understand your hesitation. This process helps reduce the power those memories have over you.",
    "Client: I see. But what if I panic? Or get too overwhelmed?",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. I'll be here to guide and support you throughout. We can pause anytime.",
    "Client: Okay... that makes me feel a bit better. So, what exactly will we be doing?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the traumatic event in detail, in the present tense, as if it's happening now.",
    "Client: That sounds intense. Will I have to do this for the whole session?",
    "Therapist: We'll start with about 30 minutes, then process your experience. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It sounds scary, but... I trust you. If you think this will help, I'm willing to try. I just... I hope I can handle it.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable, Carlos. This is a big step towards healing.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your support. Can you tell me more about what I might feel during this?",
    "Therapist: You may experience strong emotions, physical sensations, or vivid memories. All are normal reactions.",
    "Client: I see. And you'll be here the whole time, right? You won't leave me alone with these memories?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'll be right here, guiding you through the entire process.",
    "Client: Okay. I think... I think I'm ready to try. Or as ready as I'll ever be. What do we do first?",
    "Therapist: Let's start with some deep breathing exercises to help you relax. Ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I'm ready. Let's do this."
