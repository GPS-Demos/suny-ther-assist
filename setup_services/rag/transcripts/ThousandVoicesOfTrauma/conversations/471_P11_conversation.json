    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. Going through that memory of the racial abuse I experienced at work... it brought up so many emotions. I felt angry, scared, and ashamed all at once. It's like I was right back there, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The feeling of powerlessness, I think. When my coworker made those racist comments and everyone just laughed... I wanted to stand up for myself, but I froze. I can still hear their laughter echoing in my head.",
    "Therapist: How did reliving that moment affect you physically?",
    "Client: My heart was racing, and I felt this tightness in my chest. My palms got sweaty, and I had this urge to run away, even though I knew I was safe here. It's frustrating that my body still reacts so strongly to a memory.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. How does this connect to your day-to-day life?",
    "Client: I guess... I've been avoiding social situations at work. I'm always on edge, expecting someone to say something hurtful. It's exhausting, and it's definitely affecting my performance and relationships with colleagues.",
    "Therapist: I see. What insights did you gain from this experience?",
    "Client: Well, I realized that I'm still carrying a lot of pain from that incident. But also... I survived it. I'm here now, talking about it. Maybe I'm stronger than I give myself credit for.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How might you use this strength?",
    "Client: I... I think I could start by speaking up more at work. Maybe set some boundaries. It's scary, but I don't want to feel powerless anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's tough, and sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. But then I think about how much this has been holding me back. I want to feel free, you know? To just be myself without all this fear and anger weighing me down. So yeah, I'm willing to keep going.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is admirable. What support do you need?",
    "Client: I think... maybe some strategies for managing anxiety in the moment? And... I don't know, maybe some affirmations or something to remind myself of my worth when I'm feeling low?",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent ideas. Shall we work on those next time?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I'm nervous but also kind of excited. It feels good to be taking action, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a positive attitude. How will you care for yourself this week?",
    "Client: I think I'll try that meditation app you recommended. And maybe reach out to my sister - she's always been supportive. Oh, and I promised myself a nice bubble bath after today's session.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a good plan. Any final thoughts before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm finally moving forward instead of being stuck in the past.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work. See you next week?",
    "Client: Definitely. See you then."
