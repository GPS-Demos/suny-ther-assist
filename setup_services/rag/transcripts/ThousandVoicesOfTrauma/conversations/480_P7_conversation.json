    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the animal attack?",
    "Client: Okay... I was walking in the park near my apartment. It was a sunny day, and I was listening to music. Suddenly, I heard growling behind me. I turned around and saw a large dog, maybe a German Shepherd, baring its teeth. My heart started racing immediately.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The dog lunged at me without warning. I tried to back away, but I tripped and fell. I could feel its hot breath on my face as it snapped at me. I raised my arms to protect myself, and that's when it bit me on the forearm. The pain was intense, and I screamed.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I... I can still feel the dog's teeth sinking into my arm. There was blood everywhere. I was terrified, thinking it might go for my throat next. People started shouting and running towards us. Someone grabbed the dog's collar and pulled it off me, but I was frozen in shock.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Continue.",
    "Client: My arm was throbbing, and I could see the puncture wounds. A woman helped me up and called an ambulance. I felt so helpless and embarrassed. People were staring at me, and I couldn't stop shaking. It reminded me of when I was bullied in school, that same feeling of being vulnerable and attacked.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: The paramedics arrived and started treating my wound. They were asking me questions, but I could barely focus. All I could think about was how close I came to being seriously injured or even killed. I kept replaying the attack in my mind, wondering if I could have done something differently.",
    "Therapist: You're processing it well. Keep going.",
    "Client: At the hospital, they cleaned and stitched my wound. The doctor said I was lucky it wasn't worse. But I didn't feel lucky at all. I felt violated and angry. Why did this happen to me? I've always been kind to animals. It wasn't fair.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: For weeks after, I couldn't sleep properly. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the dog's face, heard its growl. I became terrified of going outside, especially to parks or anywhere I might encounter dogs. It's like the bullying all over again - feeling constantly on edge, afraid of being attacked.",
    "Therapist: You're showing tremendous courage. Continue.",
    "Client: Even now, months later, I still get anxious when I hear a dog bark. I avoid walking alone and always scan my surroundings. Sometimes, I have nightmares about being chased by a pack of dogs. It's affected my relationships too. My partner doesn't understand why I get so nervous around animals now.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. You're doing well.",
    "Client: I feel like I've lost a part of myself. I used to love being outdoors, but now I'm always tense and hypervigilant. It's exhausting. And it brings back all those feelings from when I was bullied - the fear, the shame, the helplessness. I just want to feel normal again, to not be scared all the time.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. Keep going.",
    "Client: Sometimes I get angry at myself for not being able to \"get over it.\" People tell me it was just a dog, that I should move on. But they don't understand how it feels to relive that terror every day. It's not just about the physical attack; it's about feeling powerless and vulnerable. Just like when I was bullied, I feel like I can't protect myself.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are important. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I've started avoiding social situations where dogs might be present. I've turned down invitations to barbecues and park gatherings. I feel isolated and ashamed of my fear. It's affecting my studies too - I have trouble concentrating because I'm always on alert. I just want to feel safe again, to walk down the street without my heart racing at every bark or growl.",
    "Therapist: You're showing strength. Continue.",
    "Client: The worst part is how it's brought back all those memories of being bullied. The feeling of being singled out, of being prey. I thought I had moved past that, but now it's all fresh again. I find myself second-guessing everything, wondering if I'm somehow inviting these attacks. It's like I'm that scared kid again, always looking over my shoulder.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I want to heal, to move forward, but it feels so overwhelming. Every time I think I'm making progress, something triggers me and I'm back at square one. I'm tired of feeling this way, of letting this experience control my life. But I don't know how to let go of the fear and anger. I just want to feel like myself again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Let's pause here."
