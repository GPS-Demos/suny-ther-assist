    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the event we've been working on?",
    "Client: Okay... It was a hot summer day. I was walking home from work, taking my usual route through the park. I remember feeling tired but looking forward to getting home. Suddenly, I felt someone grab me from behind. I tried to scream, but a hand covered my mouth. I was dragged into a van... I can still smell the musty interior and feel the rough carpet against my skin.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: They blindfolded me and tied my hands. I could hear at least two men talking, but I couldn't understand what they were saying. The van started moving, and I felt so helpless. I kept thinking about my daughter, wondering if I'd ever see her again. After what felt like hours, we stopped. They pulled me out of the van and into a building. It smelled like mold and cigarettes. I was pushed into a small room and left alone. I was terrified...",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: I could hear other women crying in nearby rooms. It dawned on me that this was some kind of trafficking operation. I felt sick to my stomach. Hours passed, and then a man came in. He... he started touching me, telling me I was going to make him a lot of money. I tried to fight back, but he hit me hard across the face. The pain was intense, and I tasted blood in my mouth. I felt so powerless, so violated...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I don't know how long I was there. Days blurred together. They would bring different men to the room. I was forced to... to do things I never wanted to do. Every time I resisted, they would beat me. My body was covered in bruises. I lost all sense of time, of who I was. I felt like I was disappearing...",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Keep going.",
    "Client: One night, I heard a commotion outside. There were loud voices, shouting. Suddenly, my door burst open, and there were police officers. They were raiding the place. I remember feeling so overwhelmed - relief, fear, shame, all at once. An officer helped me up, wrapped me in a blanket. As they led me out, I saw other women being rescued too. Some were crying, others looked blank, shell-shocked. I couldn't stop shaking...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Reliving it is so hard. But there's also a part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe stronger? Like I survived something terrible, and I'm still here.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. We'll stop here for today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still difficult to talk about, but I think it's getting a little easier each time. I appreciate your support through this.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable courage. We'll continue next session."
