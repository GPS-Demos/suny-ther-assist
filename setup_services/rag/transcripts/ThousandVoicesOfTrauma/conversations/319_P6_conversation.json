    "Therapist: Alright, let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and describe the night of the home invasion.",
    "Client: Okay... I was working late in my home office. It was around 11 PM. I heard a strange noise downstairs. At first, I thought it might be the cat, but then I heard whispers. My heart started racing...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably a 4. I can feel my palms getting sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Continue.",
    "Client: I slowly got up from my desk, trying not to make any noise. I could hear footsteps downstairs, and then the sound of drawers being opened. I was frozen, unsure whether to hide or try to escape. My mouth went dry, and I felt like I couldn't breathe...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. My chest feels tight, and I'm starting to feel a bit shaky.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I decided to try and sneak out through the window. But as I was opening it, I knocked over a lamp. The crash seemed so loud in the silence. I heard someone shout downstairs, and then footsteps running up the stairs. I panicked and tried to hide in the closet, but I knew they'd find me...",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's an 8 now. I feel like I'm right back there. My heart is pounding, and I'm starting to sweat.",
    "Therapist: That's tough. You're handling it well.",
    "Client: Thanks. I... I remember hearing them enter the room. I was trying so hard not to breathe loudly. I could see shadows moving under the closet door. And then... the door opened. There were two men, both wearing masks. One of them grabbed me and threw me to the floor. I felt so helpless...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I can't catch my breath. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay... *deep breath* They were yelling at me, asking where I kept my valuables. I couldn't even speak. One of them had a knife... I thought they were going to kill me. I managed to point towards my safe, hoping they'd just take what they wanted and leave...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: Still a 9. I can feel my heart racing, just like that night.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: They forced me to open the safe. I fumbled with the combination, my hands were shaking so much. When I finally got it open, they shoved me aside and started grabbing everything. I just curled up on the floor, praying it would be over soon. I heard sirens in the distance, and they suddenly panicked...",
    "Therapist: SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down to a 7. Remembering the sirens makes me feel a bit of relief.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Continue.",
    "Client: The men grabbed what they could and ran out. I stayed on the floor, too scared to move. A few minutes later, the police arrived. I was still shaking when they found me. I felt so vulnerable, so violated. Even after they left, I couldn't sleep in my own home for weeks...",
    "Therapist: And your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's back down to a 5 now. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger for having talked through it all.",
    "Therapist: You did extremely well. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... okay. Better than I expected, actually. It's still hard to talk about, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming as before.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end."
