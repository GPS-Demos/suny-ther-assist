    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Johnson. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is terrified. My hands are a bit shaky.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to help you process this experience. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. As ready as I'll ever be, I guess.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that night. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I'm in my living room. It's dark, maybe around 9 PM. I'm watching the news, and... oh God, I hear a noise at the back door.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What's happening now?",
    "Client: My heart's racing. I... I turn off the TV. The house is so quiet. I can hear my own breathing, it's so loud. I'm frozen in my chair.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 60. I can feel my palms getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. What happens next?",
    "Client: There's a crash. Glass breaking. Oh God, they're inside. I... I can hear footsteps. Heavy boots on the kitchen tile.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking I need to call for help. But my phone's in the kitchen. I'm trapped. I... I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe now. This is just a memory. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I try to stand up, but my legs are shaking so bad. I knock over the side table. The lamp crashes to the floor.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 75. I can feel my heart pounding in my chest.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor. You're here, you're safe.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... okay. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, what happens after the lamp falls?",
    "Client: Everything goes quiet for a second. Then I hear them coming towards the living room. Fast. I... I try to run, but I'm too slow. My hip, you know? I barely make it two steps before they're on me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you see? What do you feel?",
    "Client: I see... a masked face. Dark clothes. He's big, so much stronger than me. I feel his hands on my shoulders, pushing me down. I hit the floor hard. My hip... it hurts so bad.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember to breathe. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I think this is it. This is how I die. Alone, on my living room floor. I... I think of my late wife. Our kids. I'm so scared.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's 90. Maybe higher. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe with me. In... and out. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *shaky breath* Okay... okay.",
    "Therapist: When you're ready, continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: He's... he's yelling at me. Asking where the safe is. I try to tell him I don't have one, but he doesn't believe me. He... he hits me. My jaw. I taste blood.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that sensation. What do you feel?",
    "Client: Pain. Sharp, throbbing pain. And... and shame. I feel so weak, so... useless.",
    "Therapist: Remember, this wasn't your fault. You did nothing wrong. What happens after he hits you?",
    "Client: I... I hear the other one calling from upstairs. They've found my wife's old jewelry box. The one I couldn't bear to get rid of. They... they start arguing about whether it's enough.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Angry. So angry. That was all I had left of her, and they... they just took it.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel angry. Let yourself experience that emotion. What do you do with that anger?",
    "Client: I... I try to get up. To stop them. But he pushes me back down. Hard. My head hits the floor. Everything goes fuzzy.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you experience?",
    "Client: Dizziness. Nausea. The room is spinning. I... I can hear them, but it's like they're far away. I'm... I'm so cold.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's 95. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here with me. You're safe. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *deep, shaky breath* Okay... okay.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: They... they're leaving. I hear the back door slam. I'm... I'm alone. It's so quiet. I can hear my heart pounding in my ears.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I... I need help. But I can't move. I'm in so much pain. I... I think I might die here. Alone.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel?",
    "Client: Heavy. So heavy. My hip is throbbing. My jaw... I can barely open my mouth. I'm... I'm so cold.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I try to crawl. To the phone. It feels like it takes hours. Every movement is agony. But I... I make it. I call 911.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel when you reach the phone?",
    "Client: Relieved. Exhausted. I... I start crying. I can't stop.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 80. I can feel myself shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a moment to breathe. Remember, you survived this.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Yeah... yeah, I did.",
    "Therapist: What happens after you call 911?",
    "Client: I... I wait. It feels like forever. I'm afraid they might come back. Every sound makes me jump. I... I keep thinking about my wife's jewelry. Gone.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What else are you experiencing?",
    "Client: Guilt. I... I couldn't protect our home. Our memories. I feel... I feel like I failed her.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you did everything you could. This wasn't your fault. What happens when help arrives?",
    "Client: I hear sirens. Then... then there's a knock at the door. A voice saying it's the police. I... I try to call out, but my voice is so weak.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel when you hear the police?",
    "Client: Relieved. So relieved. But also... ashamed. I don't want them to see me like this.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: They... they come in. There's so many of them. Paramedics too. They're talking to me, but I... I can't focus. Everything's a blur.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What sensations do you notice?",
    "Client: Hands. Gentle hands checking me. Voices asking questions. I... I feel myself being lifted onto a stretcher. The movement... it hurts so much.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 70 now. I'm starting to feel a bit detached from it all.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. It's a normal response. What happens as they take you out?",
    "Client: I... I see my house. It looks so different. Broken glass. Things thrown around. It doesn't feel like home anymore. I... I start crying again.",
    "Therapist: Allow yourself to feel that emotion. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: That... that everything's changed. I don't feel safe anymore. I... I don't know if I can ever go back there.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid feelings. Remember, healing takes time. How do you feel now, thinking about that moment?",
    "Client: Sad. So sad. But also... a little stronger. I... I survived it. I'm still here.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You are a survivor. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 60. I feel drained, but... but okay.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end the session.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Thank you. This... this was hard, but... I think it helped.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great courage. We'll continue to work through this together."
