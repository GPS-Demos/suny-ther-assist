    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Honestly, doc, I'm a bit on edge. Been having trouble sleeping lately, thinking about... you know, that night. It's like my mind won't shut off.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0-100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: Uh, probably around a 40? My hands are a bit clammy, but I'm here, you know?",
    "Therapist: Good. Remember, we'll go through this together. Start when you're ready.",
    "Client: Alright... It was a Tuesday night, about 11 PM. I remember because I'd just finished watching the late news. I was alone in the house, my ex had the kids that week. I... I was heading upstairs to bed when I heard this... this weird scratching sound coming from the back door.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: My heart... it's starting to race a bit. I remember feeling confused at first, then a spike of fear. I froze at the bottom of the stairs, just... listening.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The scratching got louder, more urgent. Then I heard a crack, like wood splintering. I... God, I can hear it so clearly right now. My mouth went dry, and I couldn't move. I knew someone was breaking in, but I couldn't make my body respond.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 60. My palms are really sweaty.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. So, I finally snapped out of it and ran to the kitchen. I grabbed a knife from the drawer, my hands shaking so bad I almost dropped it. I could hear footsteps now, heavy boots on the tile floor. I pressed myself against the wall, trying to make myself invisible.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay in the moment.",
    "Client: The footsteps got closer. I could hear whispering, at least two people. My heart was pounding so hard I was sure they could hear it. Then... then I saw a shadow in the doorway. A man, tall and bulky. He had a... a crowbar in his hand.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, like I can't get enough air. My legs feel weak, just like they did that night. I... I think I need a moment.",
    "Therapist: That's fine. Take a few deep breaths. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: (Takes several deep breaths) Okay... I'm okay. Where was I? Right, the man in the doorway. He turned and saw me. Our eyes met, and for a second, everything just... stopped. Then he yelled something, and suddenly he was coming at me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happened next?",
    "Client: I... I panicked. I swung the knife wildly, but he was so much bigger than me. He grabbed my wrist and slammed it against the wall. The knife clattered to the floor. I tried to fight back, but it was like hitting a brick wall.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 80. My heart's racing, I can feel myself shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're here in my office. You're safe.",
    "Client: Right, right. I'm here. I'm safe. (Takes a deep breath) So, the guy had me pinned against the wall. I could smell alcohol on his breath. He was yelling at me, asking where I kept my valuables. I couldn't even speak, I was so terrified.",
    "Therapist: What were you thinking in that moment?",
    "Client: I... I thought I was going to die. I kept thinking about my kids, how I might never see them again. It was like everything was moving in slow motion.",
    "Therapist: Continue. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Then I heard more voices, other men in the house. They were ransacking the place, I could hear things breaking. The guy holding me suddenly let go and shoved me to the ground. He told me to stay there or... or he'd kill me.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My throat feels tight, like I can't swallow. My SUDS is probably around 85 now.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. Remember, you survived this.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) Yeah, I did. I... I lay there on the kitchen floor, curled up into a ball. I could hear them moving through the house, taking things. It felt like hours, but it was probably only minutes.",
    "Therapist: What happened next?",
    "Client: Suddenly, there was a loud crash from upstairs. One of the men yelled something about the cops. They all started running. I heard the back door slam open, footsteps on the deck, then... silence.",
    "Therapist: And how did you feel in that moment?",
    "Client: I... I couldn't move at first. I was sure they were still there, waiting for me. It took me a long time to finally get up. When I did, my legs were so weak I almost fell.",
    "Therapist: What did you do then?",
    "Client: I grabbed my phone from the counter with shaking hands. Dialed 911. I remember the dispatcher's voice, how calm she sounded. It was... it was like an anchor, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a good observation. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 70. My heart's still racing, but I feel a little calmer.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The police arrived pretty quickly. I remember the flashing lights, how surreal everything felt. They asked me questions, but I was in such a daze. One of the officers, she... she put a blanket around my shoulders. That's when I realized I was shaking uncontrollably.",
    "Therapist: How did you feel as you were talking to the police?",
    "Client: I felt... numb, I guess. Like it was happening to someone else. But also angry. Angry that these people had invaded my home, my safe space.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. Continue.",
    "Client: The next few hours were a blur. The police took my statement, dusted for fingerprints. I couldn't stay in the house that night. My brother came to pick me up. I remember sitting in his car, staring at my house as we drove away. It didn't feel like mine anymore.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Reliving it all... it's exhausting. But also, I don't know, maybe a little relieved? Like I've been carrying this weight around, and now I've shared some of it.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 55. I'm feeling a bit shaky, but not as intense as before.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well today, Carlos. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Tired, mostly. But... maybe a little proud too? I didn't think I could talk about it like this.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. This was a significant step. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay, yeah. That sounds good.",
    "Therapist: Focus on your breathing. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: (Takes several deep breaths) That helps. I feel more... here, if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: That's good. We'll end here for today. Remember to practice your breathing exercises at home.",
    "Client: I will. Thanks, doc. This... this wasn't easy, but I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: You did great, Carlos. We'll continue next session. Take care."
