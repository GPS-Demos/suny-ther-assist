    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: It's about a 6. My heart's starting to race.",
    "Therapist: Keep going. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see the leader approaching. He's wearing this long, dark robe. His eyes... they're so intense. I feel frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: He starts speaking, telling us about the impending doom. My stomach's in knots. I... I can't believe I fell for this.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's up to an 8. My palms are sweating, and I feel dizzy.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The chanting is getting louder. People around me are swaying, eyes closed. I want to run, but I can't move. My legs feel like lead.",
    "Therapist: How's your breathing?",
    "Client: It's... it's shallow. I feel like I can't get enough air.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's happening now?",
    "Client: The leader is handing out cups. He says it's for purification, but... oh God, I think it might be poison.",

    "Client: It's a 9. I'm terrified. My whole body's shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. Remember, this is a memory.",
    "Client: (nods, breathing heavily) Right, right. I... I remember refusing the cup. Some people got angry, started yelling at me.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Guilty, but also... proud? I stood up for myself.",
    "Therapist: That's a strength. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 7. My heart's still racing, but I feel a bit calmer.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue with what happened next.",
    "Client: There was chaos. Some people drank, others didn't. I managed to slip away in the confusion. I ran into the night, not knowing where I was going.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you describe this?",
    "Client: Tense. My shoulders are tight, and my jaw is clenched.",

    "Client: Exhausted. Relieved. My SUDS is down to a 5. I'm... I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: You've done well. Let's start bringing you back to the present.",
    "Client: (opens eyes, looks around) That was... intense. But I got through it.",
    "Therapist: Yes, you did. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Drained, but... stronger? Like I faced something big.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. We'll end here for today."
