    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's a mix of emotions, really. There's this heaviness in my chest, and my hands are still a bit shaky. Going through that memory again, it's like I was right back there, you know? The sounds, the smells, the fear... it all felt so real.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The screaming. I can't shake the sound of people screaming. It was chaos, pure chaos. I remember feeling so helpless, like I couldn't do anything to stop what was happening. And the smell of smoke... it was everywhere. I keep thinking about how quickly everything changed, how one moment we were just going about our day, and the next... (pause) I'm sorry, it's still hard to talk about.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. How did it feel to revisit this memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. Honestly, part of me wanted to stop, to just push it all away again. But another part of me felt... I don't know, maybe relieved? Like I'm finally facing it instead of running from it. It's exhausting, though. I feel drained.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. How does this compare to your day-to-day experiences with these memories?",
    "Client: Well, usually I try to avoid thinking about it at all costs. I've become pretty good at distracting myself, keeping busy. But when the memories do come, they're usually fragmented, just flashes. This felt more... complete? Like I was really there again, but also somehow separate from it. It's hard to explain.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What insights, if any, did you gain from this experience?",
    "Client: I think... I realized how much I've been holding onto this. How much energy it takes to keep it all locked away. And maybe... maybe it's okay to let myself feel it sometimes? I don't know if that makes sense, but it's like, by facing it head-on, it loses a little bit of its power over me.",
    "Therapist: That's a valuable insight. How might this relate to your recovery goals?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe it's a step towards not letting this control my life anymore? I've been so focused on avoiding anything that might trigger these memories, but that's meant cutting myself off from a lot of things, a lot of people. If I can learn to process this, maybe I can start to engage with the world again without constantly being on guard.",
    "Therapist: That's a great connection. What strategies helped you get through today's session?",
    "Client: The breathing exercises we practiced definitely helped. When I felt myself getting overwhelmed, focusing on my breath brought me back to the present. And reminding myself that I'm safe now, that I'm here in this room with you, not back there... that helped too.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How do you feel about continuing with these exposures?",
    "Client: It's scary, I won't lie. But I also feel... hopeful? Like maybe this is the path to finally feeling like myself again. It's hard, but I think it's worth it. I want to keep going.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For guiding me through this, for creating a safe space. I know we have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work. We'll continue next session."
