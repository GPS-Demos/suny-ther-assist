    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my whole body is shaking, but on the inside. My heart's racing, and I feel... cold? But also sweaty. It's strange, like I'm right back there in that moment, you know? The hospital room, the beeping machines, the smell of antiseptic... It's all so vivid.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. I was just lying there, tubes everywhere, and I couldn't move. I couldn't speak. It was like... like being trapped in my own body. And the doctors and nurses, they were talking about me like I wasn't even there. I remember thinking, \"This is it. This is how I die.\" And I was so angry because I couldn't even say goodbye to my family.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly frightening. How are you coping with those memories now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. Sometimes I feel like I'm still there, you know? Like any moment, I could blink and be back in that hospital bed. But then I remind myself that I'm here, I'm safe. I'm talking to you. It helps to ground me, but... the fear is still there, lurking. It's like a shadow that follows me everywhere.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about that fear?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a weight on my chest. Sometimes it makes it hard to breathe. And it's not just physical. It's like this constant worry that something bad is going to happen. I find myself checking my pulse, my breathing... I'm always on edge, waiting for the next medical emergency. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: How does this experience compare to when you first started therapy?",
    "Client: Oh, it's... it's different. Before, I couldn't even talk about it without having a panic attack. Now, I can at least describe what happened without feeling like I'm going to pass out. But it's still so intense. I guess... I guess I'm learning to sit with the discomfort more? It's not easy, but I'm trying.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant change. What's helping you sit with those feelings?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's knowing that I'm not alone anymore. That you're here, listening. And the breathing exercises we've practiced, they help. Sometimes when I feel overwhelmed, I'll focus on my breath, and it brings me back to the present. It doesn't make the memories go away, but it makes them... manageable, I suppose.",
    "Therapist: I see. What else do you notice about your current experience?",
    "Client: Well, there's this... this anger that I didn't expect. I'm angry at the doctors for not explaining things better, angry at myself for not being stronger. And then I feel guilty for being angry because I know they saved my life. It's all mixed up, you know? One moment I'm grateful, the next I'm furious, and then I'm terrified all over again.",
    "Therapist: How do you make sense of those conflicting emotions?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure I do make sense of them. They're just there, all jumbled up. Sometimes I think maybe it's okay to feel all of it at once? Like, maybe I don't have to choose between being grateful and being angry. Maybe it's all part of processing what happened. But then I worry that if I let myself feel angry, I'll never stop being angry. And that scares me too.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to allow all those feelings?",
    "Client: I suppose... it would mean accepting that what happened to me was complex. That it wasn't all good or all bad. It would mean acknowledging that I'm still here, still fighting, even when it's hard. And maybe... maybe it would mean being kinder to myself? Allowing myself to have bad days without feeling like I'm failing at recovery. It's just... it's scary to think about opening that floodgate, you know?",
    "Therapist: Mm. What do you think might happen if you did?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me is afraid I'll fall apart completely. That I'll get lost in all those emotions and never find my way back. But another part... another part hopes that maybe it would be freeing. Like, if I could just let it all out, maybe I could finally start to heal. Maybe I could stop feeling like I'm constantly on guard, waiting for the next disaster.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea of healing feel to you?",
    "Client: It feels... distant. Like a mirage in the desert. I can see it, but I'm not sure if it's real or if I'll ever reach it. But at the same time, it gives me hope. The fact that we're even talking about healing... that's something I couldn't have imagined a few months ago. So maybe... maybe I'm closer than I think? It's just hard to see progress when you're in the middle of it all.",
    "Therapist: What small steps have you noticed towards that healing?",
    "Client: Well, I... I suppose I'm sleeping a little better. The nightmares aren't as frequent. And I've been able to go to my check-ups without having a full-blown panic attack. That's something, right? Oh, and last week, I actually went out for coffee with my neighbor. It was just an hour, but... it felt good to be normal for a bit. To talk about something other than my health or my trauma.",
    "Therapist: Those are significant steps. How do you feel about them?",
    "Client: I feel... proud, I guess? But also a little scared. Like, what if I'm jinxing it by acknowledging the progress? What if it all falls apart? But then I try to remind myself that even if I have setbacks, it doesn't erase the progress I've made. It's just... it's hard to trust that things can get better, you know? After everything that's happened.",
    "Therapist: What helps you hold onto that trust?",
    "Client: Honestly? These sessions. Talking to you, working through this. It reminds me that I'm not alone in this. And my family, even though they don't always understand, they're trying. Their support... it means everything. And sometimes, on good days, I can look in the mirror and see someone who's survived something terrible. Someone who's still here, still fighting. That... that gives me hope.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to recognize that strength in yourself?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming, in a good way. Like, for so long, I've felt weak and helpless. But when I can see that strength, even if it's just for a moment, it's like... it's like I can breathe again. Like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this. It doesn't take away the fear or the pain, but it gives me something to hold onto when things get tough.",
    "Therapist: What do you want to remember from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I want to remember that it's okay to feel everything I'm feeling. That healing isn't linear, and that's okay. And that even on my worst days, there's a part of me that's strong enough to keep going. I want to remember that I'm not alone in this, and that every small step counts. It's not much, but... it's something to build on, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I don't think so. This... this was intense, but good. I feel drained, but also... lighter? Like I've put down a heavy bag I've been carrying. Thank you for listening, for helping me make sense of all this. I know we still have a long way to go, but... I think I'm starting to see a path forward.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. How will you take care of yourself for the rest of the day?",
    "Client: I think I'll take a long walk in the park. The fresh air always helps clear my head. And maybe I'll call my daughter, just to chat. Nothing heavy, just... connection, you know? And definitely some chamomile tea before bed. It's become a bit of a ritual, helps me wind down. Is that... is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Those sound like wonderful self-care strategies. I'll see you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, definitely. Thank you again. I... I'm actually looking forward to our next session. That's progress too, right?",
    "Therapist: It certainly is. Take care, and I'll see you then."
