    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Hakim. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit anxious, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about the accident again, and it still makes me nervous.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'll try to keep that in mind. It's just... every time I think about that day, my heart starts racing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Okay, yes. I'm ready. So, it was a Tuesday afternoon. I was driving home from work, taking my usual route. The traffic was heavy, but moving. I remember feeling tired after a long day at the office. I was looking forward to getting home and relaxing with my husband. Then, out of nowhere, I heard a loud screeching sound. Before I could even process what was happening, there was a tremendous impact from behind. My car lurched forward, and I felt this intense whiplash. Everything seemed to move in slow motion. The airbag deployed, hitting me in the face. I remember the smell of burnt rubber and the sound of crunching metal. It was terrifying.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: I... I felt so helpless. My ears were ringing, and I could taste blood in my mouth. I tried to move, but my body wouldn't respond. I could hear people shouting outside, car horns blaring. Through the cracked windshield, I saw people running towards my car. I wanted to call out for help, but no words came out. I was trapped, and the fear... it was overwhelming. I thought I was going to die right there in my car.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (voice shaking) It's hard to talk about this. I can still feel that fear, that helplessness. After what seemed like an eternity, I heard sirens. The paramedics arrived, and they started working to get me out of the car. They were talking to me, trying to keep me calm, but I was in so much pain. When they finally got me out and onto a stretcher, I remember looking back at my car. It was completely crushed. That's when it really hit me how close I'd come to... to not making it.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage. Keep going.",
    "Client: The ride to the hospital was a blur. I kept thinking about my family, wondering if anyone had told them what happened. I was scared about the extent of my injuries. Would I be able to walk? To work? The uncertainty was almost as frightening as the accident itself. At the hospital, everything moved so quickly. Tests, scans, doctors asking questions. I felt so alone and vulnerable. It wasn't until my husband arrived that I finally broke down and cried. The reality of what had happened hit me all at once.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job describing your experience.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still so vivid in my mind. The physical recovery was difficult, but the emotional toll... that's been the hardest part. For weeks after, I couldn't even get into a car without having a panic attack. I still have nightmares about the accident. And now, with this cyber bullying situation... it's like I can't escape feeling vulnerable and afraid, even in my own home. It's bringing back a lot of those same feelings of helplessness and fear that I experienced during the accident.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but also a bit relieved. Talking about it is hard, but I know it's necessary. I just want to feel safe again, you know? To not jump at every loud noise or feel anxious every time I get behind the wheel. And now, dealing with this online harassment... it's like I can't even find peace in my own home. I feel constantly on edge, waiting for the next cruel message or comment. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: Your resilience is admirable. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your support. It means a lot to have someone listen and understand. I know I have a long way to go, but I'm committed to working through this. I want to reclaim my life, both from the trauma of the accident and from these cyber bullies. I refuse to let them have power over me, just like I refuse to let the accident define me. It's just... it's a daily struggle.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. Every step counts.",
    "Client: You're right. I need to remember that. It's just hard sometimes, especially on days when the memories feel so fresh or when I receive another hurtful message online. But I'm trying to focus on the positive changes I've made. I've started meditating, which helps with my anxiety. And I've been more open with my family about what I'm going through. Their support has been invaluable. I just hope that one day, I'll be able to look back on all of this and see how far I've come.",
    "Therapist: That's a great perspective. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. This session has been intense, but I feel like I've made some progress. Thank you for your guidance and support. I'm looking forward to our next session, even though I know it won't be easy. But I'm ready to keep working on this.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Take care, Mrs. Hakim."
