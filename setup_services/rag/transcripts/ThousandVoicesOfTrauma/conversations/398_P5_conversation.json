    "Therapist: Good morning, Carlos. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Morning, Dr. Smith. I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares lately about the crash, and I'm not sure I'm ready for this.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... I've spent so long trying to forget about that day. The idea of purposely bringing it all back up feels... wrong, somehow. Like I'm inviting the trauma back into my life. And honestly, I'm scared of how I might react. What if I completely fall apart?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How about we discuss the process?",
    "Client: Yeah, that would help. I mean, I trust you, doc, but this whole thing just seems counterintuitive. I've been avoiding thinking about the crash for so long, and now you want me to dive right into it? It's hard to wrap my head around.",
    "Therapist: I get that. Let's break it down. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Well, first off, why do we need to do this? And what exactly am I supposed to do during this... exposure thing? Am I just supposed to sit here and relive the worst day of my life?",
    "Therapist: Great questions. The goal is to process the memory safely. You'll describe the event in detail.",
    "Client: Describe it? Out loud? To you? I... I don't know if I can do that. Just thinking about it makes my heart race. And what if I start crying or something? This is embarrassing enough as it is.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel anxious. We'll go at your pace, and I'll support you throughout.",
    "Client: Okay... I appreciate that. But what if it makes things worse? I mean, I'm already struggling with depression on top of all this. What if diving into these memories pushes me over the edge?",
    "Therapist: Your safety is our priority. We'll monitor your reactions and adjust as needed.",
    "Client: Alright, I guess that makes sense. So, how long does this usually take? And will we have to do this multiple times?",
    "Therapist: Sessions typically last about an hour. We'll likely do this a few times over our treatment.",
    "Client: An hour? That's... a long time to be talking about something so painful. But I guess if it helps in the long run... Can you tell me more about what I might feel during this?",
    "Therapist: You may experience strong emotions or physical reactions. It's all part of the healing process.",
    "Client: Strong emotions I can handle, I think. But physical reactions? Like what? I don't want to feel like I'm back in that plane, doc. I can't handle that.",
    "Therapist: You might feel tense or anxious. We'll use coping strategies if it becomes overwhelming.",
    "Client: Okay... I think I'm starting to understand. It's still scary, but I can see how it might help. Is there anything I can do to prepare myself for this?",
    "Therapist: Just be open and honest. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: I... yeah, I think I'm ready. Or as ready as I'll ever be. Just... promise you won't judge me, okay? Some of what happened... it's not pretty.",
    "Therapist: No judgment here, Carlos. You're very brave. Let's start when you're comfortable.",
    "Client: Alright. Here goes... It was supposed to be a routine flight..."
