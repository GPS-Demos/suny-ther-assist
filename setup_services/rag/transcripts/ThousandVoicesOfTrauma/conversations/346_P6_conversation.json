    "Client: (Deep breath) I'm back in Afghanistan. The sun is beating down, and I can feel sweat trickling down my back. We're on patrol, and everything seems quiet. Too quiet. Suddenly, there's a deafening explosion. I'm thrown to the ground, my ears ringing. I can't... I can't see clearly through the dust...",

    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Panic. Pure panic. My mouth is dry, and I feel like I'm going to be sick. I want to run, but I can't leave them behind. I'm frozen...",
    "Therapist: SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: (Voice shaking) I force myself to move. I'm calling for a medic, but my voice sounds strange, like it's not mine. I reach Johnson, and I'm trying to stop the bleeding, but there's just so much... I keep looking around, expecting another attack. I feel so helpless...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. SUDS?",
