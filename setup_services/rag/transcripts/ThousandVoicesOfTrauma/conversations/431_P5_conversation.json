    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Johnson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I suppose. A bit nervous, to be honest. I've been thinking about this session all week, and I'm not sure what to expect.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We'll take it step by step.",
    "Client: Alright. I appreciate that. It's just... ever since that day at the beach, when I saw that shark attack... I can't seem to shake it off. I know it's been months, but it feels like yesterday.",
    "Therapist: Today, we'll use imaginal exposure. Ready to learn more?",
    "Client: Imaginal exposure? That sounds... intense. What exactly does that mean?",
    "Therapist: It's revisiting the memory in a safe space.",
    "Client: Revisit it? I... I don't know if I can do that. Every time I think about it, I feel like I'm right back there, hearing those screams, seeing all that blood in the water. It's terrifying.",
    "Therapist: I understand. It's challenging, but it helps reduce symptoms.",
    "Client: Really? How does reliving something so horrible actually help? I'm afraid it might make things worse.",
    "Therapist: It allows processing and reduces the memory's power over time.",
    "Client: I see. But what if I panic? Or what if I can't handle it? I'm worried about losing control.",
    "Therapist: I'll be here to support you throughout. We'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: Okay... that's somewhat reassuring. I trust you, but I'm still scared. Will this affect my sleep? I've just started to get some decent rest lately.",
    "Therapist: It might temporarily disrupt sleep, but improves it long-term.",
    "Client: I understand. It's just... this whole experience has changed me. I used to love the ocean, and now I can't even look at pictures of beaches without feeling anxious. Will this help with that too?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it can help reduce those anxieties over time.",
    "Client: That would be wonderful. I miss feeling carefree at the beach. Alright, I think I'm ready to try. What exactly will we be doing?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the event in detail. I'll guide you through.",
    "Client: In detail? Oh my... that's going to be tough. But I suppose that's the point, isn't it? To face it head-on? I'm willing to try if you think it will help.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. This is a big step forward.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot. I'm doing this for myself, but also for my family. They've been so supportive, but I know my anxiety has affected them too. I want to get better for all of us.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful motivation. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Just... please be patient with me if I struggle. This isn't easy, but I'm committed to working through it.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Your well-being is the priority here."
