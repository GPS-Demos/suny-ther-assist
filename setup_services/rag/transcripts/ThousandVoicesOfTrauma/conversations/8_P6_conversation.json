    "Therapist: Alright, Mar\u00eda. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember to tell me your SUDS rating when I ask. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the hurricane...",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm back in my house. The wind is howling outside, and the rain is pounding on the roof. It's so loud, I can barely hear myself think. The windows are rattling, and I'm afraid they might shatter at any moment. I'm huddled in the corner of my living room with my husband and our dog. We're all shaking...",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: Um... I'd say about a 6 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue...",
    "Client: The lights are flickering, and suddenly, we're plunged into darkness. I can hear things crashing outside, and I'm terrified that a tree might fall on our house. The dog is whimpering, and I'm trying to comfort him, but my hands are trembling so much. I feel so helpless...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My heart is racing, and I feel a tightness in my chest. It's like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's gone up to an 8.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep going...",
    "Client: (Voice quavering) There's a loud crack, and I realize part of our roof has been torn off. Water starts pouring in, and I'm panicking. I want to run, but I know we can't go outside. I'm sobbing, clutching my husband's arm so tightly. I can't stop thinking about how we might die here...",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: (Breathing heavily) It's... it's a 9 now. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Mar\u00eda. You're doing well. Remember, you're safe now.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) Okay... The storm seems to go on forever. Every crash makes me jump. I'm soaked from the rain coming in, and I'm shivering uncontrollably. I keep thinking about my children, wondering if they're safe. The guilt of not being with them is overwhelming...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: My muscles are so tense, especially in my shoulders and jaw. I feel nauseous, and there's a pounding in my head.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: Still a 9. It's not getting any easier.",
    "Therapist: That's alright. You're doing great. Keep going...",
    "Client: As the storm starts to die down, we venture out of our corner. The house is in ruins. Everything we've worked for is destroyed. I feel a deep sense of loss and despair. How will we ever recover from this? The streets outside are flooded, and I can hear people crying for help...",
    "Therapist: SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's dropped to about a 7. I feel drained, but the panic has subsided a bit.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're processing this well. Continue...",
    "Client: We manage to make our way to a shelter. It's crowded and chaotic. I'm exhausted, but I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I hear the wind and the crashing. I feel so vulnerable, like it could happen again at any moment. The uncertainty of what comes next is overwhelming...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel a heaviness in my chest. It's a mix of sadness and anxiety.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's about a 6 now. I'm feeling more distant from the memory.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're doing excellent work, Mar\u00eda. Let's start to bring you back to the present...",
    "Client: (Opens eyes, looks around) Wow, that was intense. I didn't realize how vivid those memories still were.",
    "Therapist: You did very well. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I'm tired, but also... I don't know, maybe a little proud? I got through it.",
    "Therapist: That's great. We'll end here for today. Well done, Mar\u00eda."
