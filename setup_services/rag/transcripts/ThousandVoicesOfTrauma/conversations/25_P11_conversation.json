    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Jake?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit shaken up, to be honest. It's always intense reliving that moment when the earthquake hit. My heart's still racing a bit. I can almost feel the ground moving under my feet again.",
    "Therapist: That sounds challenging. What stood out to you this time?",
    "Client: The sound. I hadn't remembered how loud it was before. The rumbling, the crashing of objects falling... and the screams. God, the screams from my neighbors. It's like they were right next to me again.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. How did it feel to experience those sounds again?",
    "Client: Terrifying. But also... different this time. I felt scared, but I also felt... I don't know, more in control? Like, I knew it was just a memory. I could remind myself that I survived, that I'm here now.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant observation. How does this relate to your everyday life?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... maybe it means I'm getting better at managing my anxiety? Like, when I hear loud noises now, I might still jump, but I can talk myself down faster. It's not consuming me like it used to.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Jake. What else did you notice?",
    "Client: I... I thought about Sarah. My ex. We broke up right after the earthquake, and I always blamed myself. But going through it again, I realized how much the trauma affected both of us. Maybe it wasn't all my fault.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful connection. How does that realization make you feel?",
    "Client: Relieved, I guess. And sad. But also... hopeful? Like maybe I can stop beating myself up about it and move forward. It's just... it's a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: It is. How might this new perspective impact your future relationships?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I'll be more open? More understanding of my own needs and others'. And maybe I won't be so quick to take all the blame when things go wrong. It's like... the earthquake shook everything up, literally and figuratively. But now I'm putting the pieces back together in a new way.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful metaphor. What's one thing you can do this week to reinforce this new understanding?",
    "Client: Hmm... Maybe I could write Sarah a letter. Not to send, just for me. To express my feelings and forgive both of us for how things ended. Is that... is that okay?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful idea. How do you think it might help?",
    "Client: I think it could help me let go of some guilt. And maybe help me see more clearly how the trauma affected our relationship. It's scary, but... I think it could be healing.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your willingness to explore this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... lighter? Like I've put down a heavy backpack I've been carrying. It's uncomfortable, but also a relief. And I'm proud of myself for getting through another session.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... maybe we could talk more about my anxiety? Especially how it relates to my work and living situation. The earthquake made me feel so unstable, and I think that's affecting how I interact with my housemates and colleagues.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good direction. Is there anything else you'd like to add before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. This is hard, but I feel like I'm making progress. For the first time in a long time, I feel like there's hope. Like I'm not just a victim of what happened, but I can shape my future too.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Jake. Your hard work is paying off. I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: See you then. Thanks again."
