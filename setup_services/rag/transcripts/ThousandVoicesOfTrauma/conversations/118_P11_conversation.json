    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also kind of foggy? That was really intense, reliving the earthquake like that. I could almost feel the ground shaking again, you know? And the sound... that horrible rumbling. It's bringing back a lot of anxiety.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. Just feeling so small and powerless against this massive force. I remember huddling under my desk, praying it would stop, and thinking about all the people I love who might be in danger. It's... it's overwhelming to go back there.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. How does your body feel now?",
    "Client: Tense. Really tense. My shoulders are all bunched up, and my heart is still racing a bit. I feel kind of shaky, like I might cry at any moment. It's weird because I know I'm safe here, but my body is reacting like I'm still in danger.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how unprepared I was. And how it could happen again at any moment. I know that's not rational, but I can't shake this feeling of constant threat. It's exhausting, always being on edge like this.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your daily life?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... I'm always scanning for danger, you know? Even here at school, I'm constantly looking for exits, planning escape routes. It's affecting my studies because I can't concentrate. And in my relationship... I feel like I'm not fully present sometimes because part of me is always on guard.",
    "Therapist: I see. What did you learn from today's session?",
    "Client: I... I realized how much this experience is still affecting me. But also, I made it through the imaginal exposure. That's something, right? I mean, it was tough, but I did it. Maybe that means I'm stronger than I thought.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: It's scary, but... I think I need to. I want my life back, you know? I don't want to be controlled by this fear anymore. So yeah, I'm willing to keep going with this, even though it's hard.",
    "Therapist: That's very courageous. What support do you need?",
    "Client: I think... maybe some more grounding techniques? Sometimes after these sessions, I feel really unsettled. And... is it okay if I call you between sessions if things get really bad?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's discuss some strategies now.",
    "Client: Thank you. That makes me feel a bit better. I've been trying that breathing exercise you taught me, but sometimes it's not enough. Do you have any other suggestions?",
    "Therapist: Have you tried the 5-4-3-2-1 technique?",
    "Client: No, I don't think so. What's that?",
    "Therapist: It's a sensory awareness exercise. Shall we practice it?",
    "Client: Yeah, that sounds good. I'm willing to try anything that might help at this point. It's just... sometimes the memories and the anxiety feel so overwhelming, you know? Like they're going to swallow me whole. But I'm trying to remind myself that I'm here, I'm safe, and I'm working on getting better. It's just... it's a process, right?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. You're making progress. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do it. I'm nervous, but... I trust you. And I trust this process, even when it's difficult. I just hope that one day, I'll be able to think about the earthquake without feeling like this. Without the panic, the helplessness, the fear. I want to be able to live my life without constantly looking over my shoulder, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. Ready to start?",
    "Client: Yeah, I'm ready. Let's give it a try. I appreciate you guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone who understands and can help me navigate all of these intense emotions and memories. Okay, deep breath... I'm ready."
