    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, you can stop at any time. What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4. I'm a bit nervous, but okay.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Start when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... I was walking home from work late one night. It was dark, and the streets were pretty empty. I heard footsteps behind me and started to walk faster. Suddenly, I felt a hand grab my shoulder. I turned around, and it was a police officer. He looked angry and started yelling at me, asking what I was doing out so late. I tried to explain, but he wouldn't listen. He pushed me against a wall and...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Maybe a 6? My heart's beating faster.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: He pushed me against the wall and started patting me down roughly. I felt so violated and scared. I kept saying I hadn't done anything wrong, but he just got angrier. He twisted my arm behind my back, and I cried out in pain. I could feel the rough brick scraping my face...",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. I can almost feel his hands on me again. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Take a deep breath if you need to.",
    "Client: *deep breath* He handcuffed me so tightly, I lost feeling in my fingers. I was sobbing, begging him to stop. He kept calling me names, saying I was resisting arrest. But I wasn't! I was just scared! He threw me to the ground, and I hit my head on the pavement. Everything went fuzzy for a moment...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I can't breathe. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Remember, this is just a memory.",
    "Client: *nods* I... I remember lying there on the cold ground, tasting blood in my mouth. Other officers arrived, and they were all talking over me like I wasn't even there. One of them finally noticed I was hurt and called an ambulance. But the whole time, I just felt so... so helpless and angry. Why did this happen to me? What did I do wrong?",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: Still a 9. My whole body feels tense.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing great. Keep going if you can.",
    "Client: The paramedics came and treated me. They were kind, at least. But I couldn't stop crying. I felt so humiliated and broken. When they took the handcuffs off, my wrists were bruised and bleeding. I kept thinking about how I'd have to explain this to my family, my clients... I felt like my whole world had been shattered in just a few minutes.",
    "Therapist: And now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe an 8? I still feel shaky, but talking about it... it helps, somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's good. How would you like to proceed?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need a break. This is intense.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take a moment. You've done really well today."
