    "Therapist: Mr. Singh, today we'll begin imaginal exposure. Are you ready to discuss this?",
    "Client: I suppose so, Doctor. But I'm not entirely sure what that means. Can you explain it to me?",
    "Therapist: Of course. It's a way to process traumatic memories safely. What are your thoughts on this?",
    "Client: Well, I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. After losing my wife, I've tried to avoid thinking about it. It's just been too painful. But I understand we need to address it somehow.",
    "Therapist: Your hesitation is natural. How do you feel about exploring these memories today?",
    "Client: I'm anxious, but I trust you. It's been affecting my sleep and mood. My children are worried. If this can help, I'm willing to try.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your courage. What concerns do you have about the process?",
    "Client: I'm worried about becoming overwhelmed. Sometimes when I think about her, I feel like I can't breathe. And with my depression... I just don't want to make things worse.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How can I support you during this exercise?",
    "Client: Perhaps we could have a signal if I need to stop? And maybe you could remind me to breathe? I tend to forget when I'm stressed.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll use hand signals and focus on breathing. Any other questions?",
    "Client: Will this bring back nightmares? I've just started sleeping better, and I'm worried this might set me back.",
    "Therapist: It's possible, but we'll work through any effects together. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I suppose we can't avoid it forever, can we? I do want to get better, for my family's sake as well as my own.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is admirable. Shall we begin with a relaxation exercise first?",
    "Client: Yes, please. That would help me feel more prepared. You know, my wife always said I needed to relax more. I guess she was right about that, wasn't she? It's funny how these things come back to you.",
    "Therapist: That's a lovely memory. Are you ready to start our breathing exercise?",
    "Client: I am. And thank you, Doctor. I know this won't be easy, but I'm grateful for your help. Let's begin."
