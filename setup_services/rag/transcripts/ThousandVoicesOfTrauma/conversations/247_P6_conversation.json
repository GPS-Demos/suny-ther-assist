    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Can you share your initial SUDS rating?",
    "Client: I'd say it's about a 4 out of 10. I'm feeling a bit anxious, but not overwhelmed yet.",
    "Therapist: Okay, thank you. Please start describing the memory.",
    "Client: Alright... I was in the hospital after my heart surgery. The room was so cold, and the beeping of the machines was constant. I remember feeling so vulnerable, lying there in that thin gown. My children had set up my iPad so I could stay connected, but that's when it all started...",
    "Therapist: Continue, you're doing well.",
    "Client: I got a notification from Facebook. When I opened it, I saw that someone had shared a photo of me in the hospital bed. I looked terrible - pale, with tubes everywhere. The comments were cruel. People I thought were friends were making jokes about my appearance, saying I looked like a corpse. I felt so exposed and betrayed.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. My heart is beating faster just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Keep going.",
    "Client: I tried to delete the post, but my hands were shaking so much I could barely hold the iPad. I felt so helpless. The nurse came in and saw me crying. She tried to comfort me, but I couldn't explain. I was too embarrassed. I just kept thinking about all those people seeing me like that, laughing at me when I was fighting for my life.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My SUDS is at an 8 now. I feel hot, and my chest feels tight. It's like I'm back there, feeling that same panic and shame.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) It's hard to shake off that feeling of betrayal. I trusted these people, and they turned my suffering into entertainment. I couldn't sleep that night, just kept checking my phone, seeing more and more cruel comments. I felt so alone, even with my family right there.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's still at an 8. My hands are clammy, and I feel a bit dizzy.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: The next day, my daughter noticed something was wrong. When I told her, she was furious. She helped me report the post and block those people. But the damage was done. I couldn't stop thinking about it. Every time a nurse came in, I wondered if they'd seen it too. I felt so exposed, so vulnerable. It was like the surgery had stripped away my physical defenses, and now this had stripped away my emotional ones too.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: The SUDS has come down a bit, maybe to a 7. I still feel shaky, but talking about it... it helps, somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing it.",
    "Client: You know, the worst part wasn't even the strangers' comments. It was seeing people I thought were friends joining in. It made me question every relationship I had. Who could I trust? Who was laughing behind my back? Even now, months later, I struggle to open up to people. I'm always wondering if they're genuine or if they're just waiting for a chance to mock me.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's back up to an 8. My throat feels tight, like I might cry.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to let those emotions out.",
    "Client: (voice breaking) I just... I don't understand how people can be so cruel. I was fighting for my life, and they turned it into a joke. It makes me angry, but mostly it just makes me sad. I've lost faith in people, in humanity. And I hate that. I hate that they took that from me too.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: The SUDS is at a 7 again. I feel drained, but also... lighter? Like talking about it is lifting some of the weight.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard, but being able to talk about it without judgment... it helps. I'm starting to see that while what happened was terrible, it doesn't define me. And maybe, just maybe, I can start to rebuild that trust in others, one step at a time.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5. I feel tired, but also a bit hopeful. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You've shown great courage today."
