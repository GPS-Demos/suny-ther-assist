    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure exercise. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the memory we're focusing on today?",
    "Client: Okay... It's about when I was diagnosed with leukemia two years ago. I remember sitting in the doctor's office, waiting for my test results. The room was so cold, and the chairs were uncomfortable. I was already feeling weak from the symptoms I'd been experiencing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: The doctor came in with a serious look on his face. He sat down across from me and said, \"I'm sorry, but the tests show you have leukemia.\" It felt like the world stopped. I couldn't breathe. I remember thinking, \"This can't be happening to me. I'm only 20.\"",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What were you feeling?",
    "Client: I felt... terrified. Overwhelmed. Like my life was over before it even started. I thought about all the things I might not get to do - graduate college, fall in love, have a family. It was crushing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The doctor kept talking, explaining treatment options and survival rates, but I could barely hear him. It was like I was underwater. I remember looking down at my hands, they were shaking. I felt so alone in that moment, even though my parents were right there with me.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I'm sorry, this is hard. I can feel my heart racing just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: Okay... After the doctor finished explaining everything, my mom started crying. That's when it really hit me. I felt this surge of anger - why me? What did I do to deserve this? I wanted to scream, to break something, but I just sat there, frozen.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job staying with the memory.",
    "Client: The worst part was leaving the office. Walking out into the world, everything looked different. People were going about their day, laughing, talking on their phones, and I felt like I was carrying this massive secret. Like I didn't belong in their world anymore.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... sad. Scared. But also a little relieved to be talking about it. It's like a weight I've been carrying for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's completely normal. You're very brave for sharing this.",
    "Client: Thank you. I've never really talked about that day in detail before. It's always been too painful. But now, even though it still hurts, it feels a little less overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You've done an incredible job. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: I think I can keep going. After we left the doctor's office, we went home. The car ride was silent. I remember staring out the window, watching the world go by, feeling like I was in a bubble. When we got home, I went straight to my room and just... broke down.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory very well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I cried for hours. I felt so many things - fear, anger, sadness, confusion. I kept thinking about all the plans I had, all the things I wanted to do. It felt like everything was slipping away from me.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I remember looking at myself in the mirror that night. I looked the same, but I felt completely different. Like I'd aged years in just a few hours. I touched my face, my arms, wondering how long I had left, if I would survive the treatment.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... intense. But I feel like I'm starting to process it better. It's still painful, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming as it used to.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Do you want to continue?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. The next few days were a blur of doctor's appointments and tests. I felt like I was on autopilot. My parents were trying to be strong for me, but I could see the fear in their eyes. That almost made it worse - seeing how scared they were.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory very well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I remember the night before I started treatment. I couldn't sleep. I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, thinking about all the what-ifs. What if the treatment didn't work? What if I didn't make it? I felt so small and helpless.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have felt that way. You're safe now.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's strange, but talking about it like this... it's helping. It still hurts, but it feels less like this big, dark secret I've been carrying around.",
    "Therapist: You've done an incredible job today. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... tired, but also a bit lighter. Like I've started to let go of some of the weight I've been carrying. It's still hard to think about, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming as it used to.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It's still difficult, but I feel like I'm starting to regain some control over the memory.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great strength today. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. This has been intense, but in a way, I'm glad we did it. I feel like I understand my feelings about that day a little better now.",
    "Therapist: You've made significant progress. We'll end here for today."
