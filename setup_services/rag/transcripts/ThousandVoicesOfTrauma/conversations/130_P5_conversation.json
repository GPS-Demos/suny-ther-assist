    "Therapist: Hello, Mr. Johnson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares lately about the cult experiences, and it's been affecting my sleep and my work. My wife's worried too.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you familiar with it?",
    "Client: Not really. Is it... is it going to make things worse? I'm already struggling to keep those memories at bay.",
    "Therapist: It might be challenging, but it's designed to help. Shall I explain more?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I need to know what I'm getting into here. I've spent years trying to forget all of this, and now you're asking me to remember? It doesn't make sense to me.",
    "Therapist: Imaginal exposure helps process traumatic memories. It may reduce PTSD symptoms over time. How does that sound?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. It sounds scary, to be honest. What if I can't handle it? What if I break down or have a panic attack right here in your office?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace, and I'll support you throughout. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Well, what exactly will we be doing? And how long will this take? I mean, there's so much that happened during those years in the cult. It's not just one incident we're talking about here.",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit one memory at a time. You'll describe it in detail while I guide you. It typically lasts 30-45 minutes.",
    "Client: That sounds like a long time to be reliving those memories. I'm not sure I can do this. What if I get too overwhelmed? Can we stop if it becomes too much?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're in control. We can pause or stop anytime. Your safety is my priority.",
    "Client: Okay, that's... that's good to know. I appreciate that. I guess I'm just scared of what might come up. Some of these memories, they're pretty intense. I've never really talked about them in detail before.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. This process can be powerful in reducing PTSD symptoms. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm still nervous, but maybe a little less so. I trust you, and I know I need to do something about these symptoms. They're really affecting my life. My business is suffering because I can't focus, and I'm snapping at my wife more often. I don't want to live like this anymore.",
    "Therapist: Your motivation is encouraging. Shall we begin with a relaxation exercise first?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would help. My heart's racing a bit just thinking about all this. A relaxation exercise sounds good. Can you tell me more about what to expect during the actual exposure part?",
    "Therapist: We'll start with a specific memory. You'll describe it in present tense, including thoughts and feelings.",
    "Client: Present tense? Like it's happening right now? That sounds intense. Will you be asking me questions throughout, or do I just... talk?",
    "Therapist: I'll guide you with questions. We'll focus on sensory details and emotions. Ready to try?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm scared, but I'm also ready to try to move past this. These memories have controlled my life for too long. Let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Your bravery is commendable. Let's begin with a deep breath..."
