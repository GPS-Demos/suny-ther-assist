    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. It's like I'm back there again, you know? My heart's racing, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's hard to breathe normally.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: It's just... I can see their faces so clearly. The way they laughed when they pushed me into the lockers. I can hear the metal clanging, feel the cold against my back. And then there's this overwhelming sense of shame, like I'm nothing. Worthless.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How does that shame feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like a heavy weight pressing down on me. My shoulders slump, and I want to curl up into a ball and disappear. My stomach feels sick, and there's this lump in my throat that won't go away.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why me? What did I do to deserve this?\" And then I start doubting myself, wondering if maybe I am as pathetic as they say. It's like their words become my own thoughts, you know? And I can't shake them off.",
    "Therapist: How do those thoughts affect you now?",
    "Client: They... they still haunt me. Even though I'm in college now, sometimes I catch myself thinking I don't belong here. Like I'm not good enough, and someone's going to figure it out and kick me out. It's exhausting, always second-guessing myself.",
    "Therapist: What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I feel angry too. Not just at them, but at myself for not standing up to them. I wish I could go back and be stronger, you know? Tell them off or something. But then I remember how scared I was, how alone I felt. No one stepped in to help me.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger feel?",
    "Client: It's hot, like a fire in my chest. My fists clench, and I want to hit something. But then it quickly turns into frustration and sadness. Because I can't change what happened, and I'm still dealing with the aftermath.",
    "Therapist: What do you mean by \"aftermath\"?",
    "Client: It's like... I struggle to trust people now. I'm always on edge, waiting for someone to turn on me or laugh at me. It's affected my relationships, especially romantic ones. I get so anxious about being vulnerable that I push people away before they can hurt me.",
    "Therapist: How does that relate to your recent breakup?",
    "Client: God, it's all connected, isn't it? When my ex broke up with me, all those old feelings came rushing back. The rejection, the shame, the feeling of not being good enough. It was like being bullied all over again, even though I know that's not what she intended.",
    "Therapist: Mm. What are you feeling as you make that connection?",
    "Client: I feel... sad. Really sad. And a bit overwhelmed. It's like I'm grieving not just the relationship, but also the person I could have been if I hadn't gone through all that bullying. I wonder how different I'd be, how much easier relationships would be.",
    "Therapist: What else comes up for you?",
    "Client: I guess... a bit of hope? Like, now that I can see how it's all connected, maybe I can start to work on it. Maybe I can learn to trust again, to not let those old experiences define me. But it feels like such a long road ahead.",
    "Therapist: How does that hope feel?",
    "Client: It's... warm. Like a small light in all this darkness. It makes me feel a bit lighter, like maybe I'm not completely broken. But it's also scary. What if I try and fail? What if I'm never able to have a healthy relationship?",
    "Therapist: What do you think about those fears?",
    "Client: They're... they're just fears, right? Not facts. I mean, I've already come this far. I made it to college, I'm living on my own. That's something my high school self wouldn't have believed possible. So maybe I can overcome this too. It's just... it feels so big sometimes.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also kind of relieved? Like I've unpacked a heavy bag I've been carrying around. My chest feels a bit looser, and my breathing is easier. I'm still sad and anxious, but it feels more manageable somehow.",
    "Therapist: What's helped make it feel more manageable?",
    "Client: I think... talking about it. Seeing how it all connects. And... and knowing that you're listening, that you understand. It makes me feel less alone in all of this. Like maybe I can face it after all.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How would you like to close our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to sit with this feeling for a moment. This mix of hope and sadness and possibility. And maybe... maybe make a promise to myself to be a little kinder to myself this week. To remember that I'm not that scared kid anymore, and that I have the power to shape my future.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a wonderful way to end. Thank you for your courage today."
