    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Patel. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit anxious, to be honest. Knowing we're going to dive into my experiences with bullying and that police brutality incident... it's making me uneasy.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We'll take it step by step.",
    "Client: Okay. I appreciate that. Where should I start?",
    "Therapist: Begin with the bullying memory we discussed last time.",
    "Client: Alright. I'm back in high school. I'm 15, and I've just moved to this new school. I'm the only South Asian kid in my class. It's lunch break, and I'm sitting alone in the cafeteria. A group of older boys approaches me. They start making fun of my accent, calling me names like \"curry boy\" and \"terrorist.\" I feel my face getting hot, and my hands are shaking. I want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: One of the boys, the leader I guess, grabs my lunch box. He opens it and starts laughing at my food. He says it smells like garbage and throws it on the floor. The others are laughing. I'm frozen. I can't move or speak. I feel so small, so powerless.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: It's hard. I feel the same shame and anger I felt back then. My throat feels tight, and my eyes are burning with tears I'm trying not to shed. I remember looking around, hoping someone would help, but everyone just turned away. No one wanted to get involved.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: The boys start pushing me, telling me to go back to where I came from. I stumble and fall off the bench. They're all standing over me, laughing. I can smell their breath, see the cruel amusement in their eyes. I feel so alone, so different. I wish I could just blend in, be invisible.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: I... I'm sorry, I need a moment. This is bringing back so many painful memories.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. Remember, you're in control here.",
    "Client: Thank you. Okay... I manage to get up and run out of the cafeteria. I can hear their laughter echoing behind me. I lock myself in a bathroom stall and cry silently. I'm terrified of anyone hearing me. I stay there until the bell rings, my food untouched, my hunger forgotten. All I can think about is how I'll face them tomorrow, and the day after, and the day after that.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's intense. I can feel my heart racing, just like it did back then. But... I also feel a strange sense of relief. Like I'm finally letting this out after holding it in for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. Would you like to continue?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I can. Is it okay if we move on to the police brutality incident? It's connected to these feelings of being targeted for my race.",
    "Therapist: Of course. When you're ready, start describing that memory.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm 45 now. I'm driving home from work late one night. I see police lights in my rearview mirror and pull over. As the officer approaches, I feel a familiar sense of dread. I've been stopped before for no reason, and I know where this might go.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The officer is aggressive from the start. He demands my license and registration, shining his flashlight in my eyes. I fumble with my wallet, my hands shaking. He starts yelling, accusing me of hiding something. Before I can explain, he's ordering me out of the car.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I step out, trying to stay calm. But he's shouting, telling me to get on the ground. I'm confused, scared. I start to kneel, but apparently I'm not moving fast enough. Suddenly, he grabs me, twists my arm behind my back. The pain is sharp, immediate. I cry out, but that only seems to make him angrier.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: He slams me against the car, then forces me to the ground. My face is pressed into the gravel. I can taste dirt and blood \u2013 I think my lip is cut. He's putting his knee on my back, and I can barely breathe. All I can think is, \"Why is this happening? What did I do wrong?\"",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I'm terrified. I keep thinking about my family, wondering if I'll see them again. The officer is shouting questions at me, but I can barely understand through the panic. I manage to gasp out that I have ID, that I live nearby, that I was just driving home from work. But he doesn't seem to care.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. My heart is pounding, and I feel like I can't catch my breath. But I also feel angry. Angry that this happened, angry that I still carry this fear with me every day.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are valid. You're processing this well.",
    "Client: Thank you. It helps to talk about it, even though it's painful. I've never really shared these experiences before, not even with my wife. I always felt like I had to be strong, to just move on. But carrying this alone... it's been so heavy.",
    "Therapist: Sharing is a sign of strength. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: I think I can go on. Is it okay if we discuss how these experiences have affected my daily life?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Whenever you're ready.",
    "Client: Well, ever since these incidents, I've struggled with constant anxiety. In crowds, I'm always on edge, worried someone might target me. When I see police, even if they're just driving by, my heart starts racing. I've become overprotective of my children, always worrying about their safety, especially my son. I want him to be proud of his heritage, but I'm terrified he'll face the same discrimination I did.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great insight. Keep going.",
    "Client: It's affected my work too. I'm always trying to prove myself, to be better than everyone else, just to feel equal. I work long hours, take on extra projects, anything to show I belong. But it's exhausting. And no matter how successful I am, there's always this nagging fear that it could all be taken away in an instant, just because of how I look.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this discussion very well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but also a bit lighter. It's like I've been carrying these heavy secrets for so long, and now I'm finally setting them down. I know talking about it won't change what happened, but it feels like a step towards healing. I just want to feel safe, you know? To walk down the street or drive my car without this constant fear hanging over me.",
    "Therapist: That's a very normal desire. You're making progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your support through this. It's not easy to revisit these memories, but I think it's important. Not just for me, but for my family too. I want to be able to talk to my kids about these issues, to prepare them without passing on my fears. And maybe, by working through this, I can start to reclaim some of the confidence I've lost.",
    "Therapist: That's an admirable goal. Shall we continue exploring these feelings?"
