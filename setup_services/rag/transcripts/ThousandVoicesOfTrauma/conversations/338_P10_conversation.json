    "Therapist: Welcome, Marcus. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to dive into some heavy stuff, and part of me wants to just bolt out of here.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Yeah, I guess so. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in our old apartment. The walls are this dingy yellow color, and there's a crack running down the corner of the living room. I can smell the musty carpet and... and something else. Something metallic.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's happening?",
    "Client: I hear shouting from the kitchen. It's my parents. Dad's voice is booming, and Mom sounds scared. I'm frozen in the hallway, peeking around the corner.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, about a 6... maybe 7.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're doing great. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Inhales shakily) Dad's towering over Mom. His face is red, and there's a vein bulging in his forehead. He's waving his arms, and... oh God, he's holding a knife.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Mom's backing away, her hands up. She's pleading, \"Please, not in front of Marcus.\" But he doesn't care. He lunges forward and... (voice breaks) and...",
    "Therapist: Take your time. Remember to breathe.",
    "Client: (Breathing heavily) He slashes at her arm. There's blood. So much blood. Mom screams, and I... I can't move. I want to help her, but I'm paralyzed.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My heart's racing. My palms are sweaty. I feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: Mom's clutching her arm, blood seeping through her fingers. Dad looks... shocked. Like he can't believe what he's done. He drops the knife, and it clatters on the linoleum. The sound... it's so loud in my memory.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe higher.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: (Takes a few deep breaths) Okay... okay. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Mom's sobbing now. Dad's just standing there, staring at his hands. I want to run to her, but I'm scared he'll hurt me too. I can smell the copper scent of blood, and it makes me gag.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I finally find my voice. I yell, \"Stop it!\" And suddenly, all eyes are on me. Dad looks... God, he looks furious. He starts towards me, and I think, \"This is it. He's going to kill me.\"",
    "Therapist: Remember, you survived this. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (Voice shaking) Right. Yeah. Um, Mom throws herself between us. She's still bleeding, but she stands tall. She says, \"Don't you dare touch him.\" And something in her voice... it stops Dad in his tracks.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Scared. Angry. Proud of Mom. It's... it's a lot.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. It's normal to have mixed emotions. What happens next?",
    "Client: Dad backs away. He looks... deflated. Like all the fight just drained out of him. He mumbles something about being sorry and stumbles out of the apartment. The door slams, and the silence after is deafening.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I run to Mom. I'm crying now, and so is she. We sink to the floor together, and I'm trying to help stop the bleeding with a dish towel. It's not working very well.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Marcus. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's still high. Maybe a 9.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here in the present.",
    "Client: (Inhales deeply) Right. Okay. Um, we sit there for what feels like hours. Mom's whispering that everything will be okay, but I don't believe her. How can it be okay after this?",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in that moment?",
    "Client: That... that our family is broken. That I should have done something sooner. That I hate Dad, but I'm also terrified he won't come back.",
    "Therapist: Those are very complex feelings. It's okay to have them.",
    "Client: Eventually, Mom stands up. She's pale, but she manages to call for help. I just sit there, feeling useless and scared.",
    "Therapist: You were a child in a traumatic situation. It's not your fault.",
    "Client: (Voice cracking) I know that now, but then... I felt so guilty. So responsible.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. What happens after the call?",
    "Client: We wait. I can hear sirens in the distance. Mom's trying to clean up the blood, but her hands are shaking too much. I want to help, but I can't move.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. Sad. Like I want to reach out and hug that scared little boy.",
    "Therapist: That's a very compassionate response. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down. Maybe a 7 now.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're doing really well. What happens when help arrives?",
    "Client: There's a flurry of activity. Paramedics, police. They're asking questions, but I can't speak. Mom's being taken care of, and someone's trying to talk to me, but it's like I'm underwater. Everything's muffled.",
    "Therapist: That's a common trauma response. How does the scene end in your memory?",
    "Client: We're in an ambulance. Mom's on a stretcher, and I'm holding her hand. She looks so small, so fragile. As we drive away, I see our apartment building shrinking in the distance, and I know nothing will ever be the same.",
    "Therapist: You've done an incredible job, Marcus. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: (Exhales slowly) Tired. Really, really tired. But... also kind of relieved? Like I've been carrying this weight for so long, and now I've set it down for a moment.",
    "Therapist: That's a very positive sign. What's your final SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 5, I think.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. You've made great progress today. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay. Yeah, that sounds good.",
    "Therapist: Take some deep breaths. Feel your feet on the floor. You're here, in the present, and you're safe.",
    "Client: (Breathing deeply) Thank you. This was... intense. But I think it helped.",
    "Therapist: You did incredibly well. We'll continue to work through this in our future sessions. For now, be kind to yourself. You've shown a lot of courage today.",
    "Client: Thanks, doc. I... I appreciate it.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Marcus. We'll end here for today. Remember to use the coping strategies we've discussed if you feel overwhelmed later.",
    "Client: I will. Thanks again.",
    "Therapist: Take care, Marcus. I'll see you next week."
