    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Johnson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm alright, I suppose. A bit nervous about today's session, to be honest.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We're here to support you.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's just... talking about my experiences as a refugee, it brings back so many difficult memories. I can feel my heart racing already.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm trying. It's just... I remember the day we had to flee. The sound of gunfire in the distance, the panic in everyone's eyes. We had to leave everything behind.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: We walked for days, my wife and I, with our young children. The heat was unbearable, and we had very little water. I kept thinking about the home we left behind, the life we had built. It felt like it was all crumbling away.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I... I can still smell the dust from the road, feel the weight of my youngest on my shoulders. My wife was so strong, but I could see the fear in her eyes. We didn't know if we'd make it.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this.",
    "Client: There was a moment when we reached a checkpoint. My heart was pounding so hard, I thought it might burst. The guards were shouting, and I was terrified they'd turn us away or worse.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're here now.",
    "Client: I remember clutching my children close, trying to shield them. One of the guards approached us, his gun raised. I thought... I thought that was the end for us.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Somehow, we were allowed through. The relief was overwhelming, but the fear didn't subside. We still had so far to go, and the unknown ahead of us was terrifying.",
    "Therapist: You're very strong. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel shaky. My hands are trembling. It's like I'm back there again, feeling that fear and uncertainty.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're safe here with me.",
    "Client: I know, I know. It's just... it's hard. We made it to the refugee camp, but life there was so difficult. The cramped conditions, the lack of privacy, the constant worry about our future.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible resilience.",
    "Client: Sometimes I wonder how we survived it all. The physical hardships were one thing, but the emotional toll... losing our home, our community, our sense of belonging. It was devastating.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to acknowledge those feelings.",
    "Client: I still have nightmares sometimes. I wake up in a cold sweat, thinking we're back there, running for our lives. It's hard to shake off that fear, even after all these years.",
    "Therapist: You're not alone in this. We're here to help.",
    "Client: Thank you. It means a lot to have someone listen. Sometimes I feel guilty for struggling when we're safe now, but the memories... they're so vivid.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. You've been through so much.",
    "Client: I worry about my children too. They were so young when it happened, but I know it affected them deeply. I see it in their eyes sometimes, that same fear we felt.",
    "Therapist: You're a caring father. It's natural to worry.",
    "Client: Yes, I try to be there for them. But sometimes I feel like I'm not enough, like I can't protect them from the memories or the lingering effects of what we went through.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the best you can. That's what matters.",
    "Client: I suppose you're right. It's just... it's a daily struggle sometimes. Trying to build a new life while carrying the weight of our past experiences.",
    "Therapist: Every step forward is progress. You should be proud.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm trying to focus on the positive, on how far we've come. But some days, like today, when we talk about it... it all feels so raw again.",

    "Client: I appreciate your kind words. It helps to talk about it, even though it's difficult. I just hope that one day, these memories won't have such a strong hold on me.",
    "Therapist: We'll work through this together. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also a bit lighter. Like I've let go of some of the weight I've been carrying. It's exhausting to revisit these memories, but I can see how it might help in the long run.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. We'll stop here.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm glad we had this session, even though it was challenging. I feel like I've taken a small step forward.",
    "Therapist: You absolutely have. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
