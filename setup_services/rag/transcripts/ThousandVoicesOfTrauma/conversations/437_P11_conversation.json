    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. Going through that hostage situation again in my mind was intense. I could almost smell the fear in the room, you know?",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you this time?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. I remember feeling so powerless, like my life wasn't my own anymore. And the uncertainty... not knowing if we'd make it out alive. It's strange, but I also noticed how quiet it was at times. Like this eerie silence between the shouting and threats.",
    "Therapist: How did reliving that quiet affect you?",
    "Client: It was... unsettling. In those moments of silence, my mind would race. I'd think about my family, my future, all the things I might never get to do. It made me realize how much I value my life and the people in it.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess it is. I've been so focused on the fear and trauma that I haven't really thought about how it's changed my perspective on life. It's like... I appreciate things more now, but I'm also more afraid of losing them.",
    "Therapist: How does this relate to your current symptoms?",
    "Client: Well, I think that's why I get so anxious when I'm separated from my loved ones. And why I'm always on edge in public places. It's like I'm constantly waiting for something bad to happen, you know? But at the same time, I feel this intense gratitude for every normal, peaceful moment.",
    "Therapist: That makes sense. How did today's session feel different?",
    "Client: It was... easier, I think? Not easy, but easier than before. I was able to stay with the memory longer without feeling like I needed to escape. And I noticed more details, like the color of the walls and the sound of traffic outside. It's weird, but it almost felt less scary when I could focus on those little things.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What do you think contributed to that?",
    "Client: Maybe it's because we've done this a few times now? I feel more prepared, I guess. And... I don't know, maybe I'm starting to believe that reliving it won't actually hurt me. It's still uncomfortable, but it's not overwhelming like it used to be.",
    "Therapist: That's an important shift. How might this help moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe it'll help me face other situations I've been avoiding. Like, if I can handle reliving the worst moment of my life, maybe I can handle going to the mall or taking the bus. It's still scary, but I feel a little braver now.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's your takeaway from today?",
    "Client: I think... I'm stronger than I thought. And maybe, just maybe, I can get through this. It's not going to be easy, but I feel like there's hope now. Like I'm not just a victim anymore, but someone who's fighting to get her life back. Is that... is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. It's a sign of healing.",
    "Client: That's... wow. That's kind of amazing to hear. I've felt stuck for so long, you know? Like this trauma was just going to define me forever. But now I can see that I'm changing, growing. It's scary, but it's also exciting. I want to keep pushing forward.",
    "Therapist: That's great. How will you care for yourself today?",
    "Client: I think I'll call my best friend. I've been avoiding social contact, but I miss her. And maybe I'll try that meditation app you suggested. I need to do something calm and grounding after all this. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Sounds perfect. You're doing great work.",
    "Client: Thank you. Really. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I might actually get there. Like I might be okay someday. That means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. Same time next week?",
    "Client: Definitely. I'll be here. Thanks again, doc. See you then."
