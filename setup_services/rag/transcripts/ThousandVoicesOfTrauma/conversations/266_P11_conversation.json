    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, John?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving that moment when the earthquake hit... it's like I was right back there in my office, feeling the ground shake beneath me. My heart's still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sound. I never realized how vivid the sound was in my memory. The creaking of the building, the shattering glass... it was deafening. And the helplessness I felt, not knowing if the structure would hold or if I'd make it out alive. It's... it's hard to shake that feeling.",
    "Therapist: How does that helplessness relate to your day-to-day life now?",
    "Client: Well, I... I guess I've been feeling that a lot at work lately. Like I'm not in control, like disaster could strike at any moment. It's probably why I've been so anxious about deadlines and presentations. I'm always waiting for something to go wrong.",
    "Therapist: I see. How did it feel to confront that memory today?",
    "Client: It was tough, really tough. But... there's also a part of me that feels a bit... I don't know, relieved? Like I've been carrying this weight around, and now I've finally set it down for a moment. It's exhausting, but also... freeing, in a way.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How might you use this experience?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I need to remind myself that I survived. That I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. Perhaps if I can face this memory, I can face the challenges at work too. It's not easy, but... maybe it's a start?",
    "Therapist: Excellent observation. What's your takeaway from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I'm realizing that avoiding these memories hasn't been helping. It's been holding me back. Facing them is scary, but it's also... empowering, in a way. I feel like I'm finally taking some control back. And that feeling of relief afterwards... it's like a weight lifting, even if just for a moment.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: I'm... nervous, but also determined. I want to get better, to feel more in control of my life again. If this is the path to get there, then... I'm willing to keep going. It's not easy, but I think it's worth it.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. Shall we schedule our next session?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I... I think I'm ready to tackle this head-on. It's time to stop letting the past control my present. I know it won't be easy, but... I'm ready to put in the work. Can we maybe focus on some strategies to manage the anxiety between sessions? I find myself getting overwhelmed sometimes, especially at work.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll address that next time. Anything else before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone who understands and can help me navigate these difficult memories. I feel like I'm finally making progress, even if it's small steps. It's... it's a good feeling.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, John. Your progress is significant. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, definitely. I'll be here. Thank you again."
