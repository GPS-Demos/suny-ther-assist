    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mr. Ramirez?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like I'm back there, you know? The sounds, the smells... it's all so vivid. My heart's racing, and I can feel the sweat on my palms. It's been years, but it feels like yesterday.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: Guilt. Overwhelming guilt. I see their faces, my buddies who didn't make it. I was the squad leader, I was supposed to protect them. But I couldn't... I couldn't save them all. It's like a weight pressing down on my chest, making it hard to breathe.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's heavy. Like a rock in my stomach. My shoulders are tense, and there's this tightness in my throat. I want to scream, but I can't make a sound. It's suffocating.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why them and not me?\" I should've been the one... I was responsible. And then I feel guilty for being alive, for having a life when they don't. It's a constant loop in my head.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts affect you?",
    "Client: They... they paralyze me sometimes. I find myself zoning out, reliving those moments. I push people away because I don't feel worthy of their love or friendship. It's like I'm punishing myself for surviving.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm angry. Angry at the situation, at the war, at myself. My fists are clenched, and I can feel this heat rising in my chest. But then the anger turns to sadness, and I just feel... empty.",
    "Therapist: How does that emptiness feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a void. Like a part of me is missing. I go through the motions of life, but I don't feel fully present. It's as if I left a piece of myself back there, with them.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Part of me wants to run away from these feelings, to forget. But another part knows I need to face them. I guess... I need to find a way to honor their memory without letting it consume me.",
    "Therapist: How might you do that?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe by living the life they can't. By being the best version of myself, for them. It's hard, though. Every happy moment feels like a betrayal.",
    "Therapist: What would they want for you?",
    "Client: They... they'd want me to be happy, I think. To live fully. We used to talk about our plans for after the war. They had such hopes and dreams. Maybe... maybe I can carry some of those forward for them.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... it's bittersweet. There's still guilt, but also a sense of purpose. Like maybe their deaths don't have to be in vain if I can make something positive out of it. It's scary, though. I've been holding onto this pain for so long.",
    "Therapist: What's scary about letting go?",
    "Client: I'm afraid I'll forget them. That if I'm not constantly remembering and feeling this pain, it means I didn't care. And... I'm afraid of who I am without this burden. It's been a part of me for so long.",
    "Therapist: How else could you remember them?",
    "Client: I... I could share their stories. Keep their memories alive in a positive way. Maybe volunteer with veterans, help others who are struggling. It wouldn't erase what happened, but it might give it some meaning.",
    "Therapist: How does that feel?",
    "Client: It feels... hopeful. Like a small light in the darkness. It's not easy, and the guilt is still there, but... maybe it doesn't have to control my life. Maybe I can honor them by living, really living.",
    "Therapist: What's this realization like for you?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. There's relief, but also fear. It's like standing on the edge of something new and unknown. I've been carrying this for so long, the idea of putting it down is both freeing and terrifying.",
    "Therapist: What do you need to take that step?",
    "Client: Support, I guess. Understanding. Patience. It's not going to be a quick or easy process. I need to learn to forgive myself, to believe that I deserve happiness. And... I need to find ways to keep their memory alive that don't involve punishing myself.",
    "Therapist: How can we work towards that?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe we could explore more positive ways to remember them. And work on challenging those guilty thoughts when they come up. I think I need to reconnect with the parts of myself I've been neglecting, too.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, honestly. Emotionally drained. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, possibility? Like maybe there's a way forward that I couldn't see before. It's scary, but also... hopeful.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. We'll continue working on this."
