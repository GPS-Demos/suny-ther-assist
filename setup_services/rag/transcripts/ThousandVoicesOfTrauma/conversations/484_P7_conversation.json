    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the event related to your experience with human trafficking?",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. It was a few years ago. I was working at a restaurant to save money for college. One night, a group of men came in. They seemed friendly at first, but something felt off. They kept asking me personal questions, like where I lived and if I had family nearby.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: After my shift, I noticed one of them following me. I tried to lose him, but suddenly, a van pulled up. They grabbed me and forced me inside. I was terrified. I couldn't breathe. I kept thinking about my family, my girlfriend... I didn't know if I'd ever see them again.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) They took my phone, my wallet... everything. I felt so helpless. They drove for what felt like hours. I was trying to memorize turns, street names, anything that could help me later. But I was so scared, I could barely think straight.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Keep going.",
    "Client: We arrived at some kind of warehouse. It was dark and cold. There were other people there, mostly young men and women. They all looked terrified. That's when I realized what was happening. Human trafficking. I'd heard about it, but never thought... (starts breathing heavily)",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) They separated us into groups. I was with three other guys. They told us we'd be working in construction, but we knew it was a lie. I kept thinking about ways to escape, but they had guards everywhere. I felt so trapped, so... worthless.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: The worst part was feeling like I'd disappoint my family. My mom always said I was smart, that I'd do great things. And here I was, trapped like an animal. I... I couldn't protect myself. I felt so weak.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength by sharing this.",
    "Client: Days went by. Maybe weeks, I'm not sure. They barely fed us. We were forced to work long hours, building things. If we complained or worked too slowly, they'd beat us. I saw one guy try to run. They... they shot him. Right in front of us. (starts crying)",
    "Therapist: It's okay to cry. You're processing a traumatic event.",
    "Client: I kept thinking about that moment. How easily it could have been me. I wanted to fight back, to do something, but I was paralyzed with fear. Every night, I'd pray for someone to find us, to save us. But as time went on, I started to lose hope.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an amazing job. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. Angry. Sad. It's like I'm reliving it all over again. But also... I don't know. Maybe a little relieved? Like I'm finally letting it out.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. You're very courageous.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to talk about, but I know it's important. I just... I still have nightmares sometimes. I see their faces, hear their voices. I wake up in a cold sweat, thinking I'm back there.",
    "Therapist: You're no longer there. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I know, logically. But emotionally... it's like a part of me is still trapped in that warehouse. I struggle with trusting people now. Even my girlfriend... she's so patient, but sometimes I push her away. I'm afraid of being vulnerable again.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to feel that way. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: I hope so. I want to move past this, to feel normal again. But sometimes it feels impossible. Like I'll always be that scared, helpless person in the van, watching my life slip away.",
    "Therapist: You've already shown immense strength. We'll continue at your pace.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I need a break now. This was intense, but... I'm glad I shared it. Maybe talking about it will help make it less powerful over time.",
    "Therapist: That's often the case. You did exceptionally well today."
