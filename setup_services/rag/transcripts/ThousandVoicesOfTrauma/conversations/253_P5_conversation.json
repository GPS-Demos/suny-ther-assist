    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Thompson. I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares about my time in the field hospital lately, and I'm not sure I'm ready to face all of that again.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Your feelings are valid. Shall we discuss the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: Yes, I suppose we should. But honestly, I'm terrified. The idea of reliving those moments... the chaos, the injuries, the constant fear of attack... it's overwhelming. How is this supposed to help me?",
    "Therapist: It helps by processing the trauma. Can you share your main concern?",
    "Client: My main concern is that I'll completely fall apart. I've worked so hard to keep it together for my family and my job. What if revisiting these memories undoes all of that progress? And... what if I can't handle it? What if I have a panic attack right here in your office?",
    "Therapist: That's a common worry. We'll go at your pace. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's... somewhat reassuring. But can you tell me more about what to expect? Will I have to close my eyes? Will you be asking me questions throughout? I'm trying to prepare myself mentally, but I feel like I'm walking into this blind.",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the memory aloud. I'll guide you. Eyes open or closed - your choice.",
    "Client: Okay, that helps a bit. I think I'd prefer to keep my eyes open, at least to start. It might help me feel more grounded in the present. But what about afterwards? I'm worried about how I'll feel when I leave here. Will I be able to function normally?",
    "Therapist: We'll debrief thoroughly. I'll ensure you're stable before leaving. Any other concerns?",
    "Client: Yes, actually. I'm worried about how this might affect my relationship with my husband. He's been so supportive, but he doesn't really understand what I went through. What if this process changes me? What if it makes me more distant or irritable with him?",
    "Therapist: Communication is key. We can discuss strategies for talking with your husband.",
    "Client: That would be helpful, thank you. I guess... I'm as ready as I'll ever be. But Dr. Thompson, I need you to promise me something. If it gets too intense, if I feel like I'm losing control, you'll help me stop and come back to the present, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Your safety is paramount. We can pause anytime. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay. Yes, I think I'm ready. Just... please be patient with me if I struggle. This is probably the hardest thing I've ever had to do in therapy.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Let's start. Describe where you were."
