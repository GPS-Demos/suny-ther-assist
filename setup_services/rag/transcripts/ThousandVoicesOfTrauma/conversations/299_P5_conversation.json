    "Therapist: Good morning, Mr. Johnson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Morning, Dr. Evans. I'm... I'm alright, I suppose. A bit on edge, to be honest. These sessions always make me nervous, especially when I don't know what to expect.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. Are you familiar with this?",
    "Client: Not really. I've heard the term, but I'm not sure what it entails. Is it... is it going to be difficult?",
    "Therapist: It can be challenging, but it's a crucial step in your recovery. Shall I explain more?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I'd like to know what I'm getting into. These cult experiences... they're not easy to talk about, you know? It's been years, but sometimes it feels like yesterday.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your openness. Imaginal exposure involves revisiting your traumatic memories in a safe environment.",
    "Client: Revisit them? You mean... I have to relive those experiences? I don't know if I can do that. Just thinking about it makes my heart race.",
    "Therapist: Your reaction is normal. We'll take it slow and I'll be here to support you throughout.",
    "Client: I understand, but... it's hard. Those years in the cult, the neglect, the isolation... it's like a dark cloud that follows me everywhere. Even now, living alone, sometimes I feel like I'm back there.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. This exercise aims to help you process these memories and reduce their impact.",
    "Client: I see. But what if I panic? What if it's too much? I've worked hard to keep these memories at bay.",
    "Therapist: If it becomes overwhelming, we can pause. Your safety and comfort are my priority.",
    "Client: Okay... I appreciate that. It's just... being a 54-year-old man, you'd think I'd have this under control by now. But here I am, still struggling.",
    "Therapist: Trauma doesn't have an expiration date. Your courage in facing this is commendable.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot. So, what exactly will we be doing? How does this imaginal exposure work?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount your experiences in detail, as if they're happening now. I'll guide you through it.",
    "Client: In detail? That's... that's daunting. Will it help with the anxiety too? Sometimes it's hard to separate the trauma from the constant worry.",
    "Therapist: Yes, it can help with anxiety too. Are you ready to begin, or do you have more questions?",
    "Client: I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. It's strange, you know? You're so young, and here I am, pouring out my life's darkest moments. But I trust you. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: I'm honored by your trust. Let's start. Close your eyes and take a deep breath..."
