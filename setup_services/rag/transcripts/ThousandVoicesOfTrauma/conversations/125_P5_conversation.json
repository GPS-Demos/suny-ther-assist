    "Therapist: Welcome back, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... a bit nervous, to be honest. I know we talked about doing something different this session, and I've been anxious about it all week.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's discuss the imaginal exposure we planned.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm listening, but I'm not sure I'm ready for this. The thought of reliving that airplane crash... it makes my heart race just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. This exercise is designed to help, not harm. Shall I explain more?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I need to understand why we're doing this. It feels counterintuitive to deliberately think about something I've been trying so hard to forget.",
    "Therapist: The goal is to process the memory safely, reducing its power over you. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It makes sense in theory, but I'm scared. What if I panic? What if I can't handle it? I've worked so hard to keep myself together, especially at work. I don't want to fall apart now.",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. I'll be here to support you throughout. What other concerns do you have?",
    "Client: I'm worried about how I'll feel afterward. Will this make my anxiety worse? And... I'm embarrassed to admit this, but I'm afraid of crying in front of you. I've always prided myself on being composed and professional.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are normal. Many clients share similar concerns. Shall I explain what to expect?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I need to know what I'm getting into. This whole process feels so foreign to me. I'm used to being in control, you know? In my job, in my life... and now I feel like I'm stepping into unknown territory.",
    "Therapist: You may experience strong emotions during and after. That's part of healing. How does that sit with you?",
    "Client: It's scary, but I understand. I've been feeling so stuck lately. My husband has been incredibly supportive, but I know he's worried about me too. I want to get better, not just for me, but for him as well. If this can help... I guess I'm willing to try.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Remember, this is a step towards recovery. Any questions before we begin?",
    "Client: I have a few, actually. How long will this take? Will we do this every session from now on? And... is it normal to feel this apprehensive? I keep second-guessing whether I'm ready for this.",
    "Therapist: Great questions. We'll start with 15-20 minutes today and adjust as needed. It's a regular part of treatment, but not every session. Your apprehension is completely normal.",
    "Client: Okay, that helps. I appreciate your patience with all my questions. I suppose... I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Can you just... can you promise me that if it gets too overwhelming, we can stop?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're in control. We can pause or stop anytime. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Alright. I trust you, and I'm trying to trust this process. I'm scared, but I'm also hopeful. Maybe this is the key to finally moving past that terrible day. I'm ready... I think. Let's do this."
