    "Client: Okay... I'm back in the hospital room. The lights are so bright, and there's that antiseptic smell. I can hear the beeping of machines. My husband is sitting next to me, holding my hand. The doctor walks in with a serious look on his face. I immediately feel my heart racing...",

    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",

    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to think about, but... I survived. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Yes, you are. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My SUDS is about a 3 now. I feel drained, but also... relieved, I guess?",
    "Therapist: That's common after processing trauma. Well done today."
