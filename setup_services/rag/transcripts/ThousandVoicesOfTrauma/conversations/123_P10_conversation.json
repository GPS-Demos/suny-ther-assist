    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Ah, well... to be honest, I'm a bit on edge. Been tossing and turning all night thinking about this. Not sure I'm ready to dig into all that old stuff, you know?",
    "Therapist: I understand. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Can you rate your distress on a scale of 0-100?",
    "Client: Hmm... I'd say about a 60. My stomach's in knots.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Let's begin when you're ready. Describe the workplace incident as if it's happening now.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Alright... I'm walking into the office. It's early, maybe 7:30. The fluorescent lights are flickering, and there's that smell of stale coffee. I'm heading to my cubicle, trying to keep my head down. But I can feel their eyes on me...",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you see? Who's there?",
    "Client: I see Tom and Steve by the water cooler. They're whispering, then they look at me and snicker. My face is getting hot. I... I want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: I sit at my desk, trying to focus on my computer screen. But my hands are shaking. I can hear them coming closer. Tom's voice, loud and mocking: \"Hey, old timer! Forget your hearing aid today?\" They laugh. God, I hate that laugh.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 75. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Inhales shakily) Okay... I'm trying to ignore them, but Steve slaps me on the back, hard. \"C'mon, grandpa, lighten up!\" I flinch, spilling my coffee all over my papers. They're howling with laughter now. I feel so... so humiliated.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My shoulders are hunched. I'm gripping the edge of my desk so hard my knuckles are white. I want to lash out, but I'm... I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. Keep going.",
    "Client: The boss walks by. For a moment, I think he'll say something, put a stop to it. But he just... he just walks on by. Like I'm invisible. And that's when it hits me - I'm alone here. No one's going to help me.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization make you feel?",
    "Client: Angry. So damn angry. But also... helpless. I've worked here for 30 years, and this is what it's come to? Being the office joke?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those emotions. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I stand up. My chair scrapes loudly against the floor. Everyone looks at me. I can feel tears pricking at my eyes, but I won't let them fall. Not here. I grab my coat and I... I just walk out. I can hear them laughing behind me, but I don't look back.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 85 now. My heart's racing.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Deep breaths) Okay... I'm in my car now. My hands are shaking so bad I can barely get the key in the ignition. I just sit there, staring at the steering wheel. I feel... I feel so small. So worthless.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... maybe they're right. Maybe I am just a useless old man. Why am I even trying anymore? I should just quit, disappear. No one would miss me anyway.",
    "Therapist: Those are painful thoughts. How does your body feel?",
    "Client: Heavy. Like there's a weight on my chest. My throat's tight, like I can't swallow. I... I think I'm going to be sick.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. Remember, this is a memory. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (Nods) Yeah... yeah, I know. But it feels so real. I can still hear their laughter, you know? It's like... it's like it never stopped.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I start the car. My vision's blurry with tears I won't let fall. I just drive. No destination in mind. I end up at the liquor store. I... I buy a bottle of whiskey. I know I shouldn't, but... but I need something to numb this pain.",
    "Therapist: How does that decision make you feel?",
    "Client: Ashamed. Weak. But also... relieved? Like I've found an escape, even if it's a bad one.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 80? My hands are clammy.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Take a deep breath. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Inhales deeply) I drive to the park. It's empty this time of day. I sit on a bench, staring at the bottle. I know I should go home, but... but I can't face being alone in that empty house. Not with these thoughts swirling in my head.",
    "Therapist: What are those thoughts?",
    "Client: That I'm... I'm worthless. That I've wasted my life. That no one would care if I just... disappeared. I open the bottle. The smell... it's both comforting and sickening.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those conflicting feelings. What do you do?",
    "Client: I take a swig. It burns going down. Part of me hates it, but another part... another part welcomes the burn. Like I deserve the pain. I sit there for hours, drinking, watching the sun go down. By the time it's dark, the bottle's half empty and I'm... I'm a mess.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel at this point?",
    "Client: Numb. Everything's fuzzy. My limbs feel heavy. But the pain in my chest... it's still there. The alcohol hasn't touched it.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind now?",
    "Client: I'm thinking about my late wife. How disappointed she'd be if she could see me now. That thought... it cuts through the haze. I start sobbing. Right there on the park bench. I can't stop.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, John. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually down a bit. Maybe 70? Crying... it helped, I think.",
    "Therapist: Good. Take a moment. Breathe. When you're ready, tell me what happens next.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) I... I manage to call a cab. I'm too drunk to drive. I get home somehow. The house is so quiet, so empty. I stumble to bed, still in my work clothes. I lie there, staring at the ceiling, feeling like a complete failure.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind as you lie there?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... how did I let it get this bad? Why didn't I stand up for myself? I'm angry at them, but... but I'm angrier at myself. For being weak. For running away. For turning to the bottle.",
    "Therapist: Those are difficult feelings. How does your body feel?",
    "Client: Sick. My head's pounding. My mouth's dry. I feel... hollow. Empty.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens in the morning?",
    "Client: I wake up feeling like death. The sunlight hurts my eyes. For a moment, I can't remember why I feel so awful. Then it all comes flooding back. The humiliation. The drinking. I... I call in sick. I can't face them. Not today.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that decision?",
    "Client: Part of me feels relieved. But mostly... mostly I feel like a coward. Like I'm letting them win.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 65. I feel drained.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Look around the room. What do you see?",
    "Client: (Looks around) I see... I see your bookshelf. The green plant in the corner. The sunlight coming through the blinds.",
    "Therapist: Good. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: A bit... a bit more present. My heart's not racing as much.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Do you want to continue, or shall we stop here for today?",
    "Client: I... I think I need a break. This... this was intense.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today, John. How would you rate your distress now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 50. I feel... wrung out. But also... I don't know. Maybe a little lighter?",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember to use your coping strategies. We'll process this more next time.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you. I... I didn't think I could do this. But I did.",
    "Therapist: Yes, you did. And you should be proud of yourself. We'll end here for today."
