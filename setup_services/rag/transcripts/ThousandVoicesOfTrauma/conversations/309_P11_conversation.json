    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. The memories of the earthquake were so vivid this time. I could almost feel the ground shaking beneath me again. It's strange because I've never really talked about this before, not even with my husband. I keep thinking about how helpless I felt, trapped under that rubble for hours.",
    "Therapist: What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The darkness. And the dust. It was everywhere, choking me. I remember thinking I was going to die there, alone in the dark. It brought back some... other memories too. Ones I've tried hard to forget.",
    "Therapist: How so?",
    "Client: Well, um... the feeling of being trapped. It... it reminded me of... of the sexual abuse. That same sense of helplessness, of not being able to escape. I've never made that connection before.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight, Sarah.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess it is. It's just... it's a lot to process, you know? I've always kept these experiences separate in my mind, but now I'm seeing how they're connected. It's scary, but also... I don't know, maybe a little liberating? Like I'm finally starting to understand why I react the way I do sometimes.",
    "Therapist: How does this understanding affect you?",
    "Client: It's like... pieces of a puzzle coming together. I've always struggled with feeling out of control, especially in tight spaces. And I guess that's why I turned to substances - to numb those feelings. But seeing the connection now, it's like... maybe I can start to address the root of it all?",
    "Therapist: That's very insightful.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's hard though. Part of me wants to just forget it all again, go back to numbing everything. But I know that's not the answer. I'm just... I'm tired of being afraid all the time, you know?",
    "Therapist: What gives you hope?",
    "Client: I guess... the fact that I'm here, talking about it. That's something I never thought I'd be able to do. And... I don't know, maybe the idea that understanding all this could help me get better? It's terrifying, but also... maybe a little exciting? Like, for the first time, I can see a path forward, even if it's still pretty blurry.",
    "Therapist: That's a big step, Sarah.",
    "Client: Yeah, it really is. I just... I want to be able to live my life without all this fear and anxiety hanging over me. I want to be able to enjoy my marriage, my job, without constantly looking over my shoulder or feeling like I'm about to fall apart. It's exhausting, living like that.",
    "Therapist: How can we build on this progress?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I need to keep facing these memories head-on? As scary as it is, I feel like I'm finally starting to understand myself better. And maybe... maybe I need to open up to my husband about some of this. He knows about the earthquake, but not about the abuse or my substance use. I've been so afraid of him seeing me differently, but keeping all these secrets... it's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: That sounds very brave, Sarah.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's scary, but... I think it's necessary. I can't keep living in fear of my own memories. And who knows? Maybe talking about it more will help me process it better. I just... I want to be free from all this, you know?",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about our next session?",
    "Client: I'm... nervous, but also kind of looking forward to it? Is that weird? It's like, now that I've started opening up, I don't want to stop. It's painful, but it also feels like... like I'm finally taking control of my life. I just hope I can keep this momentum going.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude, Sarah.",
    "Client: Thanks. I really appreciate your support through all this. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't judge me. I know we still have a long way to go, but for the first time in a long time, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this."
