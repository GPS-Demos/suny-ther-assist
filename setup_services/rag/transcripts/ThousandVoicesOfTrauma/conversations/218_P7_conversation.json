    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the day you lost your loved one?",
    "Client: It was a Tuesday morning. I remember waking up to my phone ringing. It was my mom, and she was crying. She told me that my brother had been in a car accident. I felt like my whole world stopped.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what happened next.",
    "Client: I rushed to the hospital. The waiting room was so cold and sterile. I kept hoping it was all a mistake, that he'd be okay. But when the doctor came out with that look on his face, I knew. I just knew.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What were you feeling?",
    "Client: I felt... numb. Like I couldn't breathe. My legs gave out, and I collapsed onto the floor. I remember screaming, but it felt like the sound was coming from someone else.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. It's okay to feel those emotions.",
    "Client: After that, everything's a blur. I remember bits and pieces. The funeral. People offering condolences. But I felt so detached from it all. That's when I started looking for answers, for something to make sense of it all.",
    "Therapist: And that led you to the cult experiences?",
    "Client: Yes. I was vulnerable, and they promised answers. At first, it felt comforting. They told me my brother's spirit was still around, that I could communicate with him. I wanted so desperately to believe it.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. How did you feel during those early cult experiences?",
    "Client: I felt... hopeful, at first. Like maybe there was a way to ease this pain. But as time went on, I started feeling trapped. They kept demanding more money, more time. I was losing myself.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to acknowledge those feelings. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The worst part was when they convinced me to cut ties with my family. They said my family was holding me back from spiritual growth. I believed them. I didn't speak to my parents for months.",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly difficult. How are you feeling as you recall this?",
    "Client: I feel angry. Angry at myself for falling for it. Angry at them for taking advantage of my grief. And I feel so much guilt for pushing my family away when we should have been grieving together.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to have those feelings. Stay with them.",
    "Client: I remember the day I finally decided to leave. They had organized this ceremony where they claimed we'd be able to speak to our departed loved ones. I was so excited, thinking I'd finally hear from my brother. But during the ceremony, I realized it was all fake. The \"messages\" were vague and could apply to anyone. That's when it hit me - they had been manipulating me all along.",
    "Therapist: You showed great strength in that moment. What happened next?",
    "Client: I left in the middle of the ceremony. Just stood up and walked out. They tried to stop me, saying I was betraying my brother's memory. But for the first time since his death, I felt like I was honoring him by leaving.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. How do you feel now, recalling that moment?",
    "Client: It's a mix of emotions. Pride for finally standing up for myself, but also shame for having been involved in the first place. And there's still this underlying sadness, knowing that leaving the cult didn't bring my brother back.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. You're processing a lot.",
    "Client: Yeah, I am. It's hard to talk about this, but I know it's necessary. I just... I miss my brother so much. And I feel like I wasted so much time with the cult when I could have been healing with my family.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. You're here now, working through it.",
    "Client: You're right. I am here now. And I'm trying to rebuild my relationship with my parents. It's not easy, but I know it's what my brother would have wanted. He always believed in family sticking together.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, but also... lighter? Like talking about it is helping to lift some of the weight I've been carrying. It's still painful, but it feels more manageable somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. We'll end here for today. You did very well.",
    "Client: Thank you. It wasn't easy, but I'm glad we did this. I feel like I'm finally starting to process everything that happened.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself. We'll continue next session."
