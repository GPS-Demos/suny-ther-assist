    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Carlos?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving those moments in the cult, it's like I was right back there, you know? I can still feel the weight of their expectations, the constant pressure to conform. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The isolation, I think. The way they slowly cut me off from my family, my friends... It was so subtle at first, you know? They'd say things like, \"Your family doesn't understand your spiritual journey\" or \"True believers don't need worldly connections.\" Before I knew it, I was completely alone, except for them.",
    "Therapist: How did that feel to revisit today?",
    "Client: It was... God, it was terrifying. I felt that same panic, that same desperation. Like I was drowning and couldn't reach the surface. But... but there was something else too. A kind of anger, I guess? Like, how could I have let this happen to me?",
    "Therapist: Anger is a common response. How does it relate to your recovery?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. I guess it makes me want to fight back, in a way? Not against them, but against what they did to me. To reclaim my life, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight, Carlos. How might you channel that?",
    "Client: I've been thinking about reaching out to my sister. We haven't spoken in years, not since... well, you know. But maybe it's time. It's scary though. What if she doesn't want to talk to me?",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel anxious. What's driving this desire?",
    "Client: I miss her. And I guess... I want to prove to myself that I can have relationships outside of what the cult allowed. That I'm not bound by their rules anymore. It's just... it's hard to shake that fear, you know?",
    "Therapist: Mm. How does this connect to your PTSD symptoms?",
    "Client: I think... I think a lot of my anxiety, my hypervigilance, it comes from that fear of being controlled again. Of losing myself. But reaching out to my sister, it's like... it's like taking back control, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: That's a great observation. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: Scared, but... kind of excited too? Like I'm finally doing something for me, not because someone else is telling me to. It's empowering, I guess. But also terrifying.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel both. What's your next step?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'm going to write her a letter. Not send it yet, maybe, but... just to get my thoughts out. To practice what I want to say. Is that... is that okay?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful approach. How does it feel to make that decision?",
    "Client: It feels... good. Like I'm taking action, you know? Not just letting things happen to me anymore. I'm still scared, but... I think I can do this. I want to do this.",
    "Therapist: You're showing real courage, Carlos. How can we support this in our next session?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe we could work on the letter together? Or at least talk about what I want to say? I'm worried I might... I don't know, fall back into old patterns or something.",
    "Therapist: That's a great idea. Anything else you want to discuss?",
    "Client: I... I just want to say thank you. For helping me through this. For the first time in a long time, I feel like... like maybe I have a future, you know? Like I'm not just stuck in that cult forever.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work, Carlos. How does it feel to recognize your progress?",
    "Client: It's... it's amazing, honestly. Scary, but amazing. Like I'm finally becoming myself again. Or maybe... maybe becoming myself for the first time. I don't know. It's overwhelming, but in a good way, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Shall we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I've got a lot to process. But... I'm looking forward to our next session. To working on that letter. To... to moving forward.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today, Carlos. Take care until next time.",
    "Client: Thank you. I will. See you next week."
