    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Singh. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a part of me that wants to do this, to face these memories, but another part that's terrified. My hands are a bit shaky.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to support you. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm ready. Where should I start?",
    "Therapist: Start by closing your eyes and describing the scene where you were imprisoned as a child.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm... I'm in a small, dark room. It's cold. The walls are made of rough stone, and there's a tiny window near the ceiling, but it's too high for me to reach. I'm sitting on the floor, my back against the wall. I can feel the dampness seeping through my thin shirt.",
    "Therapist: Good. What time of day is it?",
    "Client: It's... it's nighttime. I can see a sliver of moonlight coming through the window. It's the only light in the room. I'm... I'm so scared. I don't know why I'm here or what's going to happen to me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What do you hear?",
    "Client: I hear... I hear footsteps. They're coming closer. Heavy boots on stone. My heart is racing. I want to hide, but there's nowhere to go. The sound of keys jingling... oh god, they're opening the door.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The door creaks open. A man enters. He's tall, with a beard. I can smell alcohol on his breath. He... he grabs my arm, yanks me to my feet. I'm crying, begging him to let me go. But he just laughs. He drags me out of the room, down a long hallway. Other children are crying in the rooms we pass. I want to help them, but I can't even help myself.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he takes me to a larger room. There are other men there. They're talking, laughing. I don't understand what they're saying. One of them approaches me. He has a knife. I... I can't...",
    "Therapist: It's okay. Take a moment. Remember, you're here with me, you're safe.",
    "Client: I'm sorry. It's just... it's so vivid. I can feel the cold blade against my skin. They... they cut my clothes off. I'm shivering, both from cold and fear. I want to run, but my legs won't move. I feel so helpless, so small.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm there again.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Can you tell me something you see in this room right now?",
    "Client: I... I see the plant on your desk. The green leaves.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, can you continue with what was happening?",
    "Client: Yes... The men, they... they take turns. I close my eyes, try to pretend I'm somewhere else. But I can't escape the pain, the smell, the sounds. It feels like it goes on forever. I'm crying, but no one cares. They just laugh, call me names. I feel so dirty, so ashamed.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: When they're... done, they drag me back to the small room. They throw me inside. I curl up in the corner, hugging my knees. I'm in so much pain. I'm bleeding. I want my parents, but I know they won't come. No one's coming to save me. I feel so alone, so abandoned.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking at this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking that I must have done something wrong. That I deserve this. That I'm bad, worthless. I'm wondering if I'll ever get out of here, if this is my life now. I'm... I'm so scared.",
    "Therapist: Those are heavy thoughts. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's still... still a 9. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you survived this. You're here now.",
    "Client: Yes... yes, I did survive. But in that moment, I didn't know if I would. I spend the night drifting in and out of consciousness. Every sound makes me jump. I'm afraid they'll come back. The room smells of blood and sweat. I'm so thirsty, but there's no water. My whole body aches. I feel... broken.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Can you describe the next morning?",
    "Client: The light starts to come through the window. I haven't slept much. My eyes are swollen from crying. I hear movement outside the room. I'm terrified it's them coming back. But it's... it's a woman. She opens the door. She looks shocked when she sees me. She... she helps me up, wraps me in a blanket. She's speaking softly, but I don't understand her words. She leads me out of the building. I see other children being led out too. We're put into cars. I don't know where we're going, but anywhere is better than here.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling as you leave?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm relieved, but also numb. I can't believe it's over. But I also know that in many ways, it's not over. I'll carry this with me forever. I'm scared of what will happen next, but grateful to be out of that place.",
    "Therapist: You've done an amazing job. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. Emotionally and physically. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe release? Like I've finally let out something I've been holding in for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after these sessions. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6. I still feel shaky, but not as overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves. Can you tell me five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: I see... your plant, the clock on the wall, the painting of the ocean, your degrees hanging up, and the box of tissues.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Now, four things you can touch?",
    "Client: The armrest of the chair, my wedding ring, the fabric of my shirt, and my watch.",
    "Therapist: Good. Three things you can hear?",
    "Client: The ticking of the clock, traffic outside, and the hum of the air conditioner.",
    "Therapist: Two things you can smell?",
    "Client: The lavender air freshener and... coffee, I think?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's right. And finally, one thing you can taste?",
    "Client: The mint from the tea I had earlier.",
    "Therapist: Well done. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Better. More... present. My SUDS is down to a 4 now.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. You've shown incredible strength today. How do you feel about what we've accomplished?",
    "Client: It was... hard. Harder than I expected. But I also feel like I've faced something I've been running from for a long time. There's a part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe proud? Is that strange?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. You should be proud. You've confronted a deeply traumatic memory with courage and resilience.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I never thought I'd be able to talk about this. For so long, I've kept it buried. But now that I have... it's like a weight has been lifted. Not completely, but... it's a start.",
    "Therapist: It is indeed a start, and a significant one. How do you feel about continuing this work in our next session?",
    "Client: I'm... nervous, but also determined. I want to keep going. I want to heal.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. We'll take it step by step. For now, let's focus on self-care for the rest of the day. What will you do to take care of yourself?",
    "Client: I think I'll go for a walk in the park with my wife. Being in nature always helps me feel grounded. And maybe we'll watch a movie later, something light.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like excellent plans. Remember to be gentle with yourself. You've done challenging work today.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you... for everything.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. I'm here to support you on this journey. We'll pick this up next week. Take care, Mr. Singh.",
    "Client: Thank you. See you next week."
