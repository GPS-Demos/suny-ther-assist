    "Therapist: Welcome, Amina. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I... I think so. My stomach feels a bit tight, though. I'm not sure if I can do this.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember, we'll go at your pace. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, maybe a 5? It's not terrible, but I'm definitely on edge.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Let's start with some deep breaths. When you're ready, close your eyes and take us to that day at the refugee camp.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Alright... I'm there. It's hot, so hot. The sun is beating down on the tents. I can smell sweat and dust everywhere. There are so many people crowded around, and I'm... I'm trying to find my sister. We got separated when they were handing out water.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see... I see children crying. There's a woman yelling at one of the aid workers. My throat feels dry, and I'm so thirsty. I keep pushing through the crowd, calling out my sister's name, but it's like no one can hear me over all the noise.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Maybe a 7? My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Remember, you're safe here. Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: (Takes another deep breath) Okay... I'm still there, but I can feel the floor. I'm... I'm still looking for my sister. I spot a water station and push my way towards it, hoping she might be there. The crowd is pressing in on all sides, and I can barely breathe. I'm starting to panic...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I finally reach the water station, but she's not there. I'm gasping for air, feeling like I might pass out. A man shoves me aside to get to the water, and I stumble. I fall to the ground, and people are stepping over me, not even seeing me. I feel so... so invisible, so worthless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Amina. Remember, you survived this. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. Maybe an 8 or 9. I can feel my hands shaking.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. You're safe here in my office.",
    "Client: (Breathing deeply) Okay... I'm still on the ground. The dust is in my mouth, my eyes. I'm trying to get up, but people keep bumping into me. I finally manage to stand, and I'm dizzy from the heat and lack of water. I start calling out for my sister again, my voice cracking.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going. What do you hear?",
    "Client: I hear... I hear so many languages blending together. Arabic, Swahili, French... It's all a jumble. And then... then I hear my name. It's faint, but I know it's her. My sister.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel in that moment?",
    "Client: I feel... relief, but also fear. What if I can't find her? What if something's happened to her? I start pushing through the crowd again, following her voice. My heart is pounding so hard I can hear it in my ears.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: I keep moving, calling out to her. The sun is so bright, it's hard to see. People are jostling me, and I nearly fall again. But then... then I see her. She's by another tent, looking lost and scared. I run to her, pushing past everyone in my way.",
    "Therapist: What happens when you reach her?",
    "Client: I... I grab her and hold her tight. She's crying, and I realize I am too. We're both covered in dust and sweat, but I don't care. I just keep telling her it's okay, we're together now. But even as I say it, I know it's not true. Nothing is okay.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe a 6? I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger?",
    "Therapist: That's good. Can you describe what's happening around you now?",
    "Client: The crowd is still there, but it feels less overwhelming. I'm focused on my sister, making sure she's okay. We're both so thirsty. I look around and spot a aid worker nearby. I decide to approach them, hoping they can help us.",
    "Therapist: How does that feel, making that decision?",
    "Client: It's... it's scary. I don't know if they'll help or just ignore us like so many others have. But I have to try, for my sister's sake. I take her hand and we start walking towards the aid worker.",
    "Therapist: You're showing a lot of courage. Keep going.",
    "Client: As we get closer, I can see the aid worker looks exhausted. They're talking to someone else, and I hesitate. Maybe we should just wait our turn? But my sister is trembling beside me, and I know we need help now.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I clear my throat and speak up. My voice comes out shakier than I wanted, but I manage to ask for water. The aid worker looks at us, and for a moment, I'm afraid they'll just turn away. But then they nod and gesture for us to follow them.",
    "Therapist: How does that acknowledgment make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a weight lifting off my chest. Someone sees us. Someone is going to help. I feel tears in my eyes again, but this time it's from relief. We follow the aid worker, and I hold my sister's hand tightly.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to maybe a 4 or 5. I still feel shaky, but not as overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's stay with this moment a bit longer. What happens next?",
    "Client: The aid worker leads us to a small tent. It's cooler inside, and there are bottles of water. They hand us each one, and I... I almost drop mine because my hands are shaking so much. My sister opens hers immediately and starts gulping it down.",
    "Therapist: And how do you feel watching her?",
    "Client: I feel... protective. Grateful. But also angry that we're in this situation at all. I open my own water and drink slowly, even though I want to gulp it down like my sister. I know we need to make it last.",
    "Therapist: You're showing a lot of foresight there. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... I'm thinking about how we got here. About the life we left behind. About how uncertain everything is now. But mostly, I'm thinking about how I need to be strong for my sister. I need to figure out what we're going to do next.",
    "Therapist: That's a heavy responsibility. How does it feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's terrifying. I don't feel ready for this. I'm not sure I can do it. But what choice do I have? There's no one else to take care of us.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible resilience. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around a 3, I think. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little more in control?",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Take a few deep breaths.",
    "Client: (Breathes deeply) Okay... I'm here. Back in your office.",
    "Therapist: Well done, Amina. You did excellent work today. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... exhausted. But also, maybe a little proud? I didn't think I could get through that memory.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You showed great courage. Let's take a few minutes to decompress before we end our session.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I need that.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Remember, you're safe here. We'll work through this together."
