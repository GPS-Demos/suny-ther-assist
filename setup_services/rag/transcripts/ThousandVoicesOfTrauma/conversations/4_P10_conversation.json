    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a part of me that wants to dive in, you know? But another part is... well, it's terrified. This isn't easy stuff to talk about.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0-100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 40? My stomach's a bit in knots, but I'm here, right?",
    "Therapist: Good. Remember, we can pause anytime. Are you ready to begin the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm standing outside this rundown motel. The paint's peeling, and there's this flickering neon sign. It's late, maybe 11 PM? The air feels heavy, like it might rain soon. I can hear traffic from the nearby highway, but it feels distant, muffled.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I take a deep breath and walk towards room 14. My heart's pounding so hard I can feel it in my throat. I knock on the door, three quick raps. There's shuffling inside, then silence. God, my palms are so sweaty...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... I'm thinking, \"What if I'm too late? What if she's not even here?\" I... I can't shake the image of Sarah's face from my mind. She was so young when she disappeared...",
    "Therapist: Remember to use present tense. What's happening now?",
    "Client: Right, sorry. The door creaks open, just a crack. I can smell cigarette smoke and something sour. A man's face appears. He's... he's got these cold, dead eyes. My stomach lurches. I say, \"I'm here about the girl.\" My voice sounds strange, like it's not even mine.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe 60? My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: The man grunts and opens the door wider. I step inside, and... oh God, the smell. It's worse in here. Sweat and despair and... I don't know. My eyes adjust to the dim light. There's a girl on the bed. She's so thin, her arms are like twigs. But it's not Sarah. It's not her.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm devastated. Angry. This girl needs help, but she's not Sarah. I've failed again. I want to scream, to punch something, but I can't. I have to stay calm. I ask the man, \"Where did you get her?\" My voice is shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: He laughs. It's an ugly sound. He says, \"What's it to you?\" I... I can feel rage building in me. I clench my fists, trying to stay in control. The girl on the bed, she's watching us with these huge, terrified eyes. I want to grab her and run, but I know I can't. Not yet.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 75, maybe 80. My heart's racing.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor. You're here, you're safe.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... okay. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I tell the man I'm willing to pay for information. His eyes light up at that. He starts talking, but I can barely focus. All I can think about is Sarah, and this girl in front of me. How many others are there? How did I let this happen?",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What's happening in the room?",
    "Client: Right, sorry. The man's getting agitated. He wants money up front. I reach for my wallet, but my hands are shaking so badly I can barely grip it. The girl on the bed whimpers, and it's like a knife in my gut. I want to tell her it'll be okay, but I don't know if that's true.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I hand over some cash. The man counts it, then nods. He starts talking about a warehouse by the docks. Says there are more girls there. My mind is racing. Could Sarah be there? I'm trying to memorize every detail, but it's hard to focus. The girl on the bed is crying silently now.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My... my whole body is tense. My jaw is clenched so tight it hurts. I feel like I might throw up. But I have to stay calm, I have to get this information.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. Maybe 85? I feel like I'm about to snap.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here in the room with me. You're safe.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Okay... okay. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I thank the man for the information. It makes me sick to do it, but I have to play along. As I turn to leave, the girl on the bed catches my eye. There's a plea there, a desperation that breaks my heart. I want to promise her I'll come back, that I'll save her, but I can't. I don't know if I can.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about Sarah. About how I've let her down. About how I've let this girl down. I feel like a failure. Like no matter what I do, it's never enough. These monsters are always one step ahead.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're doing the best you can. What happens as you leave?",
    "Client: I... I step out of the room. The night air hits me, and I gasp like I've been underwater. I stumble to my car, my legs barely holding me up. As soon as I'm inside, I break down. I'm sobbing, pounding the steering wheel. I feel so helpless, so angry.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's maxed out. 100. I can barely breathe.",
    "Therapist: Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Feel the chair beneath you. Take some deep breaths.",
    "Client: *breathing deeply* Okay... okay. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. Can you continue?",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, I think so. I... I finally manage to calm down enough to start the car. As I drive away, I can't shake the image of that girl's eyes. Or the thought of Sarah, wherever she is. I feel like I'm carrying the weight of the world, and it's crushing me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. But there's also this fierce determination. I know I can't give up. I have to keep fighting, for Sarah, for that girl, for all of them.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe 70? I still feel shaky, but not as overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Take a few deep breaths.",
    "Client: *breathing deeply* Okay... I'm here.",
    "Therapist: When you're ready, open your eyes and come back to the room.",
    "Client: *opens eyes* Wow... that was intense.",
    "Therapist: You did very well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained, but also relieved in a way? Like I've let out something that's been bottled up for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after imaginal exposure. Let's take a few minutes to process what you experienced.",
    "Client: Yeah, I'd like that. It's... it's hard to face these memories, but I think it's helping. I just wish... I wish I could have done more.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're not responsible for the actions of others. You're doing important work now by processing these experiences.",
    "Client: I know, logically. It's just... it's hard not to feel guilty sometimes.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We'll continue to work on that. For now, how about we end with some grounding exercises?",
    "Client: That sounds good. I could use some centering right now.",
    "Therapist: Alright, let's start by focusing on five things you can see in this room..."
