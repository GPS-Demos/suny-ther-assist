    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure exercise. Can you describe the memory of your severe illness?",
    "Client: Okay... I remember being in the hospital. The room was so cold, and I felt so alone. The beeping of the machines was constant, like a reminder that I wasn't well. I had been diagnosed with pneumonia, but it was worse than anyone expected. I couldn't breathe properly, and every time I tried, it felt like my chest was on fire.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you experienced.",
    "Client: I remember feeling so scared. The doctors kept coming in and out, and their faces always looked worried. I could hear them whispering outside my room, but I couldn't make out what they were saying. It made me feel even more isolated, like I was trapped in this bubble of illness and fear.",
    "Therapist: That sounds very frightening. Keep going, you're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I remember thinking about my family. I wished someone was there with me, but I had pushed everyone away years ago. The loneliness was overwhelming. I kept thinking, \"What if I die here, all alone?\" The thought terrified me, and I started to panic. My heart was racing, and I couldn't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: A nurse came in when she heard me gasping. She tried to calm me down, but I was too far gone. They had to sedate me. When I woke up, I felt even weaker than before. I could barely lift my arms. I remember looking out the window and seeing the world go by, thinking I might never be part of it again. It was like I was already a ghost.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful image. How did that make you feel?",
    "Client: It made me feel... worthless. Like my life had amounted to nothing. I had no one to call, no one who cared if I lived or died. I started to think about all the choices I'd made that led me to this point - the drinking, pushing people away, neglecting my health. It all came crashing down on me in that hospital bed.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage. Keep going.",
    "Client: The days blurred together. I lost track of time. The only constant was the pain and the fear. I remember one night, I was in so much pain that I prayed for it to end, even if that meant dying. I felt so ashamed for thinking that, but I couldn't help it. The suffering seemed endless.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have felt that way. You're safe now.",
    "Client: As I started to recover, I realized how close I had come to dying. It was a wake-up call, but also incredibly depressing. I had to face the fact that I had no support system, no one to help me once I left the hospital. I felt so vulnerable and afraid of the future.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How did you cope with those feelings?",
    "Client: I... I didn't cope well at first. When I was discharged, I fell back into old habits. The loneliness and fear drove me to drink again. But a part of me remembered how it felt to be so close to death, and it scared me. That's when I decided I needed help. It took a while, but eventually, I reached out to a support group. It was the hardest thing I've ever done, admitting I needed help.",
    "Therapist: That took a lot of strength. You should be proud of that step.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to talk about. Sometimes I still have nightmares about being back in that hospital room, all alone and struggling to breathe. But I'm trying to use that experience as motivation to stay sober and rebuild my life. It's not easy, especially at my age, but I don't want to end up in that situation again.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable resilience. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also a bit lighter. Talking about it is hard, but it helps me process what happened. I'm still scared sometimes, especially when I'm not feeling well. But I'm trying to focus on the progress I've made since then. It's a daily struggle, but I'm not giving up.",
    "Therapist: That's an incredible attitude. We'll end here for today."
