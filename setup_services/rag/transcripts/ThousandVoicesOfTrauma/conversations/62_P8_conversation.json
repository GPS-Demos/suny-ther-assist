    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like my whole body is trembling from the inside. The memory feels so vivid, like it just happened yesterday. I can still hear the sound of glass shattering and my mother's muffled cries. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: There's this intense feeling of helplessness washing over me. I remember being frozen in place, watching my father's rage unfold. I... I wanted to step in, to protect my mother, but I couldn't move. My heart is racing just thinking about it. I feel like a coward for not doing anything.",
    "Therapist: How does that feeling of being a coward impact you today?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a weight I've carried all these years. Even now, at 76, I find myself second-guessing my actions in difficult situations. I wonder if I'm still that same scared little boy, unable to stand up for what's right. It's affected my relationships, my work... everything, really.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you noticing in your body?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, like there's a band constricting it. My hands are clammy, and there's this knot in my stomach. It's as if my body is preparing for something terrible to happen, even though I know I'm safe here. I can feel my jaw clenching, too. It's... it's exhausting, feeling this way.",
    "Therapist: How do these sensations compare to what you felt during the actual event?",
    "Client: They're... they're remarkably similar. It's like I'm right back there in that moment. The fear, the tension, the racing heart - it's all the same. But there's something different too. Back then, I felt completely paralyzed. Now, there's this urge to move, to do something, anything to change what happened. It's frustrating because I know I can't.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why didn't I do something? Why was I so weak?\" And then I start wondering about my mother, if she ever resented me for not helping her. I... I never talked to her about it. We just pretended it didn't happen. And now she's gone, and I'll never know. It's... it's eating me up inside.",
    "Therapist: How does reflecting on this memory now differ from before we started therapy?",
    "Client: It's... it's strange. Before, I would've done anything to avoid thinking about this. I'd push it down, try to forget. But now, as painful as it is, there's a part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe relieved? Like I'm finally facing something I've run from for so long. It hurts, but it also feels... necessary, if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: What do you think has changed to make it feel necessary now?",
    "Client: I suppose... I'm tired of carrying this burden alone. For years, I've felt isolated by this experience, like no one could understand. But talking about it here, painful as it is, makes me feel less alone. And... and I think I'm starting to realize that maybe it wasn't my fault. That I was just a child, caught in a terrible situation.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of emotions. There's a sense of relief, like a weight is being lifted. But there's also sadness, a deep sadness for that little boy who went through such trauma. And anger, too. Anger at my father for putting us through that, anger at the circumstances that led to it all. It's... it's overwhelming, but not in the same suffocating way as before. It feels... I don't know, maybe like I'm finally processing it?",
    "Therapist: What do you think this means for your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I think... I think it means I'm finally moving forward. For so long, I've been stuck in that moment, reliving it over and over. But now, it feels like I'm starting to see it from a different perspective. It's still painful, but it doesn't define me anymore. I'm... I'm hopeful, I suppose. Hopeful that I can work through this and maybe even find some peace.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's... it's daunting, to be honest. Part of me wants to retreat, to go back to pushing it all down. But I know that's not the answer. I've lived that way for too long. I'm... I'm ready to face this, as scary as it is. I want to understand myself better, to maybe finally let go of some of this guilt and shame I've been carrying. It won't be easy, but... but I think it's worth it.",
    "Therapist: What support do you need moving forward?",
    "Client: I... I think I need patience. From you, from myself. This isn't going to change overnight, and I need to remember that. And... and maybe some guidance on how to cope when these memories and feelings come up outside of our sessions. Sometimes they hit me out of nowhere, and I feel lost. But mostly, I just need someone to listen, to validate that what I went through was real and significant. I've spent so long minimizing it, telling myself it wasn't that bad. Having someone acknowledge it... it means more than I can say.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained, honestly. Emotionally and physically. But there's also this strange sense of... I don't know, maybe accomplishment? Like I've faced something I've been running from for decades. It's a small step, but it feels significant. I'm nervous about what comes next, but also... also a bit excited. For the first time in a long time, I feel like there might be a way forward, a way to live without this constant shadow over me. It's scary, but also... hopeful.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. We'll continue this journey together."
