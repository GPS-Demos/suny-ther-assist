    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a knot in my stomach. I know we're going to talk about the medical trauma, but it feels like opening Pandora's box.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. Where do I start?",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see the hospital corridor. It's so white, so sterile. The smell of disinfectant is overwhelming. I'm being wheeled down on a gurney, and everything feels like it's moving too fast.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's happening now?",
    "Client: They're pushing me into a room. It's cold, and I can hear the beeping of machines. There are so many people around me, all in scrubs and masks. I can't... I can't see their faces properly. It's terrifying.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling?",
    "Client: Maybe... 60? My heart's racing just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... They're prepping me for surgery. Someone's explaining something, but I can't focus. All I can think about is how I might not wake up. What if something goes wrong? What if I never see my family again?",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm panicking. I want to get up and run, but I can't move. My body feels heavy, and there's this crushing weight on my chest. I'm trying to speak, to tell them I've changed my mind, but no words come out.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's higher. Maybe 75?",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here in the room with me. Take a moment to ground yourself.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... I'm okay. The anesthesiologist is putting the mask on my face. The smell is awful, and I feel like I can't breathe. Everything's getting fuzzy, and I'm fighting to stay awake. I don't want to go under, I don't...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: It's... it's dark. I don't know how much time has passed. I'm waking up, but something's wrong. I can't move. I try to open my eyes, but they're so heavy. I can hear voices, muffled and distant.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: Pure terror. I'm trapped in my own body. I want to scream, to let them know I'm awake, but I can't make a sound. It's like being buried alive.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. 90, maybe higher.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe now.",
    "Client: *shaky breath* I... I can feel them touching me, moving my body. It hurts, but I can't tell them. I'm screaming inside my head, begging for someone to notice. But no one does. I feel so helpless, so alone.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: Time seems to stretch on forever. I drift in and out of consciousness, always trapped, always afraid. When I finally wake up properly, I'm in a different room. The relief is... overwhelming. But then the fear sets in. What if it happens again?",
    "Therapist: How do you feel now, thinking about that fear?",
    "Client: It's... it's still there. Like a shadow hanging over me. I'm afraid to sleep, afraid of any medical procedure. It's like I'm constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop.",
    "Therapist: Your current distress level?",
    "Client: It's come down a bit. Maybe 70?",
    "Therapist: That's progress. Let's continue.",
    "Client: The days after are a blur. I'm in pain, both physically and emotionally. I try to explain what happened, but no one seems to understand. They tell me it was just the anesthesia, that I was dreaming. But I know what I experienced.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Angry. Frustrated. Like I'm going crazy. I know what I felt, what I experienced. It wasn't a dream. It was real, and it was terrifying.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. They're valid.",
    "Client: I feel so isolated. Even my family doesn't seem to get it. They're just happy I'm okay. But I'm not okay. I'm scared all the time. I have nightmares about being trapped, about not being able to move or speak.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. My hands are shaking. But... but I also feel a little lighter? Like talking about it is releasing some of the pressure.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Your distress level?",
    "Client: Maybe... 60? It's coming down.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Let's continue.",
    "Client: I... I start avoiding anything medical. Doctor's appointments, even taking medication becomes a struggle. Every time I see a hospital on TV, I feel my chest tighten. It's like I'm right back there, helpless and afraid.",
    "Therapist: How has this affected your daily life?",
    "Client: It's... it's changed everything. I used to be so independent, but now I'm always on edge. I struggle to sleep, to concentrate at work. I've become withdrawn, afraid of putting myself in any situation where I might lose control.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really challenging. How are you coping?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure I am coping. Some days are better than others. I try to stay busy, to distract myself. But the fear is always there, lurking in the background.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 50, I think. Talking about it... it helps, even though it's hard.",
    "Therapist: You're making great progress. Keep going.",
    "Client: I've started having panic attacks. They come out of nowhere sometimes. The other day, I was in a crowded elevator, and suddenly I couldn't breathe. It felt like I was back on that operating table, unable to move or speak.",
    "Therapist: How did you handle that situation?",
    "Client: I... I managed to get out of the elevator. I found a quiet corner and just focused on breathing. It took a while, but I calmed down. It was embarrassing, though. I felt so weak, so out of control.",
    "Therapist: But you got through it. That's strength, not weakness.",
    "Client: I guess... I guess you're right. It's just hard to see it that way sometimes. I feel like I'm constantly fighting against my own mind, my own memories.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after trauma. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix. I'm tired, emotionally drained. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe relief? Like talking about it is helping to lift some of the weight.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's down to about 40 now. It's still there, but it feels more manageable.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today. How do you feel about the progress you've made?",
    "Client: I... I'm surprised, actually. I was so scared to talk about this, to relive it. But it feels like... like I'm starting to take back some control. It's still scary, still painful, but maybe... maybe I can learn to live with it.",
    "Therapist: That's a very positive outlook. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm okay for now. It's been intense, but... but good. Thank you for listening, for helping me through this.",
    "Therapist: You've done all the hard work. Well done. Let's end here for today."
