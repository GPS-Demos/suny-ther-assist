    "Therapist: How are you feeling after going through that memory today?",
    "Client: (sighs deeply) It's... it's a lot to process, honestly. I can still hear the screeching of metal and feel the plane shaking. My heart's still racing a bit. It's strange, you know? I've lived with this for so long, but reliving it... it brings everything back so vividly.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The smell. I hadn't remembered that before. The acrid scent of smoke and fuel... it was overwhelming. And the screams. God, the screams of the other passengers. I remember thinking, \"This is it. This is how I die.\" It's funny, I've always been afraid of flying since then, but I never connected it so directly to those sensory memories.",
    "Therapist: How does connecting those dots feel?",
    "Client: It's... clarifying, I suppose. Scary, but also... I don't know, validating? Like there's a reason for my fear, you know? It's not just me being irrational. I've been so hard on myself for years about my anxiety around flying. But now, reliving it, I understand why my body reacts the way it does.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. How might this understanding affect you moving forward?",
    "Client: (pauses, thinking) Well, I suppose it might help me be a bit kinder to myself. Instead of getting frustrated when I panic at the airport, maybe I can acknowledge that it's a normal response to what I've been through. And... maybe that will help me cope better? I'm not sure, but it feels like a step in the right direction.",
    "Therapist: It certainly sounds like progress. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much this experience has shaped my life. Not just the fear of flying, but... my reluctance to travel, to try new things. It's like I've been living in a small, safe bubble. And my depression... I wonder if it's connected to feeling so limited, so stuck.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it feel to make that connection?",
    "Client: It's... overwhelming. But also, oddly hopeful? Like, if I can work through this trauma, maybe I can expand my world again. I've missed out on so much, you know? Weddings, funerals, family gatherings... all because I couldn't bring myself to get on a plane. And now, at my age, I feel like time is slipping away.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to you to reclaim some of that freedom?",
    "Client: (voice cracking with emotion) It would mean everything. To see my grandchildren in person instead of just on video calls. To fulfill my dream of seeing the Northern Lights. To feel... normal again. Like I'm living, not just existing.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like meaningful goals. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: Scared, but determined. It's not easy, reliving all of this. But for the first time in years, I feel like there might be a light at the end of the tunnel. I want to keep going. I want my life back.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. What's one small step you can take this week?",
    "Client: (thinking) Maybe... maybe I could look at some travel websites. Not to book anything, just to... dream a little. To remind myself of what's out there in the world.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great idea. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. Thank you. This was hard, but... I think it was good. I feel drained, but also... lighter somehow. Like I've put down a heavy bag I've been carrying for years.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Take care of yourself this week.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you. See you next time."
