    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving that dog attack... it's like I was right back there in that moment. My heart's still racing a bit, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's strange because I know I'm safe here, but my body doesn't seem to believe it yet.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sound. I could hear the dog's growling so clearly. It was this deep, guttural noise that just... it filled me with terror. And then there was the pain when it bit my leg. I could almost feel it again, you know? That sharp, searing pain. It's funny, I thought I'd forgotten a lot of those details, but they all came flooding back.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. Scary, definitely. But also... I don't know, maybe a little empowering? I mean, I survived it once, and I survived reliving it just now. I'm still here, still breathing. It's hard, but I feel like I'm facing it head-on for the first time in years.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How does this connect to your day-to-day life?",
    "Client: Well, I guess it explains a lot. Why I get so anxious around dogs, even small ones. Why I avoid parks or anywhere I might encounter dogs off-leash. It's affected my life more than I realized. My kids have been asking for a dog for years, and I've always found excuses. But really, I've just been... terrified. And it's not just dogs. I think this fear has seeped into other areas of my life too. I'm always on high alert, always expecting the worst to happen.",
    "Therapist: You're making important connections. What's that like for you?",
    "Client: It's... enlightening, I suppose. And a bit frustrating. I've let this fear control so much of my life. But at the same time, I feel a glimmer of hope. If I can face this memory here with you, maybe I can start facing my fears out there in the real world too. It won't be easy, but... I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: That's a courageous stance. What's your next step?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I could start small. Like, looking at pictures of dogs online. Or watching videos. Just to get used to seeing them without feeling that immediate panic. And then maybe, down the line, I could work up to seeing a dog in person. From a distance, of course. Baby steps, right?",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a solid plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... tired, but in a good way. Like I've accomplished something important. My heart rate has settled down, and that tightness in my chest is easing up. I'm proud of myself for getting through this, even though it was tough. And I'm... I'm actually looking forward to our next session. Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It shows progress. Anything else you'd like to share?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For guiding me through this. For helping me see that I'm stronger than I thought. I know we have a long way to go, but for the first time in years, I feel like I might actually be able to overcome this. Like maybe one day, I'll be able to walk in a park without constantly looking over my shoulder. Or even... who knows, maybe we could get that dog my kids have been asking for. It seems impossible now, but... maybe it's not.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today, Sarah. How would you like to close our session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to take a few deep breaths. To remind myself that I'm here, I'm safe, and I'm moving forward. And maybe... could we end with something positive? Like, could you remind me of one of those grounding techniques we talked about? I think it would help me transition back into the rest of my day.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's try the 5-4-3-2-1 technique. Ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I'm ready. Thank you again, Dr. Thompson. This... this means more to me than I can express. I'm nervous about what's to come, but I'm also... excited? Is that the right word? I feel like I'm finally taking control of my life again. It's scary, but it's also... freeing."
