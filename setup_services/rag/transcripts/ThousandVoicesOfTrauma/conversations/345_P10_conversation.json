    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Johnson. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a lot on my mind. My hands are a bit shaky.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0-100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 60. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Let's begin the exposure. Close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back at the courthouse. It's the day of my divorce hearing. The building is so imposing, all granite and cold steel. I can smell the musty scent of old papers and floor polish. My stomach is in knots as I walk through the metal detector.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see my soon-to-be ex-wife across the lobby. She's with her lawyer, whispering. They both look at me, and I feel so... so small. Like I'm back in high school, being stared down by the bullies. My palms are sweating.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: We're called into the courtroom. The judge looks bored, like he's seen a thousand cases just like ours. I sit down, and the wood of the chair is hard and uncomfortable. My lawyer starts talking, but I can barely focus on the words. All I can think about is how I've failed... failed at my marriage, failed at being a husband.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I feel hot, like I might pass out. The room seems to be spinning a little.",
    "Therapist: Let's pause for a moment. Take a deep breath with me. In... and out. Good. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 75.",
    "Therapist: Okay. When you're ready, continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: Right... So, my wife's lawyer starts speaking. He's listing all the ways I've let her down, how I've been a disappointment. Each word feels like a punch to the gut. I want to defend myself, but my voice won't work. I'm frozen, just like when those bullies cornered me in the locker room all those years ago.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking, \"You're worthless. You couldn't even keep your marriage together. No wonder she's leaving you.\" It's like I'm hearing the voices of those bullies from my past, but now they're in my own head.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The judge is asking questions now. About our assets, our debts. It all sounds so clinical, like our whole life together is just being reduced to numbers on a page. I glance at my wife, and for a second, our eyes meet. There's no warmth there anymore, just... emptiness. And suddenly, I'm hit with this wave of loneliness. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: How does that loneliness feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a physical ache in my chest. Like someone's reached in and hollowed me out. I can barely breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. In... and out. What's happening now?",
    "Client: The judge is making his final statements. It's over. Just like that, decades of marriage, gone. I stand up, but my legs feel weak. As I walk out of the courtroom, I catch a glimpse of myself in a mirror. I look old, tired. I barely recognize myself.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 85. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: I know it is. You're very brave for facing this. What happens as you leave the courthouse?",
    "Client: I... I stumble out onto the steps. The sunlight is too bright, it hurts my eyes. People are rushing past me, going about their day like nothing's changed. But for me, everything's different now. I sit down on the steps, my head in my hands. I don't know what to do next. Where to go. Who I am anymore.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... lost. Completely and utterly lost. Like I'm adrift in a sea of uncertainty. And there's this crushing weight of failure pressing down on me. I start to cry, right there on the courthouse steps. I don't care who sees me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep breathing. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"This is it. This is rock bottom.\" But then... then I remember my kids. And I think, \"I can't let them see me like this. I have to be strong for them.\" But I don't know how. I don't know if I have any strength left.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I take out my phone. My hands are shaking so much I can barely dial. I call my sister. She answers, and I just break down. I can't even get the words out at first. She just listens, tells me she's coming to get me. And for a moment, I feel a tiny spark of... not hope exactly, but maybe just the tiniest bit less alone.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Let's take another pause. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. But also, maybe a little lighter? Like I've let something out that's been bottled up for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's common after an exposure. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 70, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You've done some hard work today. Let's take a few more deep breaths together before we end the exposure.",
    "Client: Okay... *deep breath* It's strange. Reliving it was awful, but I feel... I don't know. Like maybe I can face it now.",
    "Therapist: That's a great insight. How about we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think I need some time to process all this. It was more intense than I expected.",
    "Therapist: That's completely normal. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later. We'll discuss this more next session. You did very well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It wasn't easy, but... I'm glad I did it.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. Take care of yourself, and I'll see you next week."
