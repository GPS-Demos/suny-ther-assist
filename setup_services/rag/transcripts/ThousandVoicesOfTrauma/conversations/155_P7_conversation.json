    "Therapist: Welcome, Karim. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit anxious, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about my medical trauma, and it's making me nervous.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's just... every time I think about that day in the hospital, my heart starts racing.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Okay... So, it was about two years ago. I went in for what was supposed to be a routine surgery. But when I woke up, everything was wrong. The lights were too bright, there were alarms going off, and I couldn't move.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I... I remember feeling so helpless. I tried to call out, but there was a tube in my throat. I couldn't speak, couldn't move. It was like being trapped in my own body.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The worst part was the pain. It was excruciating, like nothing I'd ever felt before. And no one seemed to notice. I could see nurses walking by, but they didn't look at me. I felt so alone, so scared.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I kept thinking about my wife, my kids. What if I never saw them again? What if I died there, alone in that hospital bed? The thought was terrifying.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. Continue.",
    "Client: I don't know how long I was like that. It felt like hours. Finally, a doctor came in. He looked shocked when he saw me. There was a flurry of activity after that. People rushing around, adjusting things. The pain started to subside, but the fear... that lingered.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. My hands are shaking a bit. But I feel like I can breathe a little easier now that I've talked about it.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: Thank you. You know, the hardest part is that this experience changed me. I used to be so confident, especially in my business. Now, I second-guess everything. I'm always waiting for something to go wrong.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to acknowledge these changes. You're safe here.",
    "Client: My wife... she's been so patient. But I can see the strain it's putting on our relationship. I'm not the same person I was before, and I don't know how to get back to that.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great insight. Keep going.",
    "Client: Sometimes I wonder if it would be better for her if we just... ended things. Maybe she deserves someone who isn't so... broken. But the thought of losing her, on top of everything else... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. You're doing well.",
    "Client: I just want to feel normal again. I want to be able to go to a doctor's appointment without having a panic attack. I want to be able to support my wife and kids without this constant fear hanging over me.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. It takes time.",
    "Client: I know. It's just... hard. Every day feels like a struggle. But being here, talking about it... it helps. Even though it's painful, it feels like I'm doing something, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a positive outlook. You should be proud.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I need a moment. This has been a lot.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take your time. You've done well today."
