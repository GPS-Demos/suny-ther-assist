    "Therapist: Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. What exactly does that mean? It sounds a bit intimidating, to be honest. I've been dreading this session all week.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel apprehensive. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about reliving the trauma. I've spent so much time trying to forget what happened. The idea of purposely thinking about it... it makes my stomach churn. And with my recent health scare, I'm not sure if I can handle the stress right now.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How about we discuss the process first?",
    "Client: Yeah, that would help. I mean, I trust you, but I'm still scared. It's like... I know logically that talking about it might help, but emotionally, I'm terrified. Can you explain what we'll be doing exactly?",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit the memory gradually, in a safe environment. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: How long will it take? Will I have to describe everything in detail? What if I panic or can't continue? And... will you judge me for what happened?",
    "Therapist: It'll take about 30-45 minutes. We'll go at your pace. No judgment here, only support.",
    "Client: Okay... that's a bit reassuring. But still, with everything going on in my life right now, especially my health issues, I'm worried this might be too much. What if it makes things worse?",
    "Therapist: Your health is a priority. We can adjust our approach if needed. How else can I support you?",
    "Client: I appreciate that. Maybe... could we have a signal if I need to stop? And is it okay if I don't share every detail right away? I'm also wondering if this will actually help me move forward or if it'll just bring back all the pain.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll use a hand signal to pause. You control what you share. This helps process trauma.",
    "Client: That makes me feel a bit more in control. I guess I'm just scared of facing it all again. But at the same time, I'm tired of letting it control my life. I want to be able to trust people again, to not flinch at every touch. Do you really think this will help?",
    "Therapist: Many find it helpful. It's challenging but can reduce PTSD symptoms. Your courage is admirable.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot. I guess I'm ready to try, even though I'm scared. Can you walk me through exactly what we'll do? And... will you be here with me the whole time?",
    "Therapist: I'll be here throughout. We'll start slowly, focusing on breathing. Then gradually revisit the memory.",
    "Client: Okay. I think I can do this. It's just... it's hard to believe that facing something so painful could actually help. But I trust you, and I'm willing to try. I just hope it doesn't set me back with everything else going on.",
    "Therapist: Your resilience is inspiring. We'll take it step by step. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do this. I'm nervous, but I'm also hopeful. Maybe this could be the start of really healing. Thank you for being so patient with me.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Let's start with some deep breaths. Remember, you're safe here."
