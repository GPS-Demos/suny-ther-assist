    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is shaking on the inside, but I'm trying to stay still. The memory of the car accident, it's so vivid now. I can still hear the screeching tires and smell the burning rubber. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's like I'm right back there in that moment, frozen in my seat, watching everything unfold in slow motion. My heart is racing, and I feel this tightness in my chest. It's hard to breathe normally.",
    "Therapist: And what thoughts are accompanying that fear?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"This is it. I'm going to die.\" Even though I know I survived, in that moment, it feels so real. I'm also angry at myself for not being able to do anything. I just sat there, helpless. Why couldn't I react? Why didn't I do something?",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts relate to your everyday life now?",
    "Client: I guess... I'm always on edge, especially when I'm in a car. I'm constantly scanning for potential dangers, gripping the seat, ready to react. But then I remember how I froze during the actual accident, and I worry that if something were to happen again, I'd be just as useless.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you noticing?",
    "Client: My palms are sweaty, and I feel this knot in my stomach. It's like my whole body is tense, ready to spring into action. I'm also feeling a bit dizzy, like the room is spinning slightly. It's hard to focus on anything else.",
    "Therapist: How does this compare to how you felt immediately after the accident?",
    "Client: It's... it's very similar, actually. After the accident, I was in shock. I remember sitting on the curb, shaking uncontrollably. Everything felt surreal, like I was watching a movie of my life rather than living it. The dizziness, the nausea, the fear - it's all coming back now.",
    "Therapist: What's different about how you're experiencing it now?",
    "Client: Well, I... I guess I feel more in control now. Back then, I felt completely overwhelmed, like I was drowning in these sensations and emotions. Now, even though it's intense, I can recognize what's happening. I know I'm safe here, even if my body doesn't quite believe it yet.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about being able to talk through this memory?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. Really hard. But also, I don't know, maybe a little empowering? For so long, I've been avoiding thinking about the accident at all. Talking about it feels like I'm finally facing it head-on. It's scary, but there's a small part of me that feels... proud, I guess? Like I'm taking back some control.",
    "Therapist: What do you think this means for your recovery?",
    "Client: I think... I think it means I'm making progress. Slowly, but still progress. Before, I couldn't even think about the accident without having a full-blown panic attack. Now, I can talk about it. It's still painful and scary, but I'm doing it. Maybe this means I can start to move forward, to not let this trauma control my life so much.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization sit with you?",
    "Client: It's a mix of emotions, really. There's hope, definitely. Like maybe there's a light at the end of this very long, dark tunnel. But there's also fear. What if I can't keep this up? What if I hit a setback? And there's sadness too, for all the time I've lost, all the experiences I've missed out on because of this trauma. It's... it's complicated.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to work on coping strategies for when these memories and feelings come up unexpectedly. Like, what can I do when I'm driving and suddenly feel panicked? Or when I have nightmares about the accident? I want to feel more prepared to handle these situations.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling now, as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm feeling drained, to be honest. This was really intense. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a bit lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time. I'm exhausted, but there's also this tiny sense of relief. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: It's a common experience. What will you do to take care of yourself for the rest of the day?",
    "Client: I think I'll take a long, hot bath when I get home. Maybe listen to some calming music. And I'll call my sister - she's always been a good support. I just... I need some time to process everything we've talked about today.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good self-care plan. We'll pick up here next week.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you. This was hard, but... I think it was important. I'm glad we did this, even though it was difficult. I'll see you next week."
