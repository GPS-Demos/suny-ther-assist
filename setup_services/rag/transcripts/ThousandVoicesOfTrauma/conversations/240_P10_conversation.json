    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Patel. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I... I think so. It's always a bit daunting, you know? But I understand why we're doing this.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's start with a SUDS rating. How anxious do you feel right now, 0 to 100?",
    "Client: Uh, probably around a 40? My stomach's a bit tight, but I'm not panicking or anything.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we're here together. Start when you're ready.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm... I'm boarding the plane. It's a sunny day, but I can see dark clouds in the distance. The flight attendant greets me with a smile, but I can't shake this feeling of unease. I find my seat - it's by the window. As I sit down, I notice my hands are a bit clammy.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: More passengers are boarding. There's a family with young children sitting across the aisle. The kids are excited, but I'm... I'm starting to feel trapped. The cabin seems smaller somehow. I'm trying to take deep breaths, but it's not really helping.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Maybe 60? My heart's beating faster.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Keep going. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The plane starts to move. We're taxiing to the runway. I can hear the engines getting louder, and it's... it's making me more anxious. I grip the armrests tightly. The takeoff... it's always the worst part for me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you experiencing in your body?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. I'm... I'm holding my breath without realizing it. The plane starts to accelerate, and I can feel the vibrations through my seat. It's... it's overwhelming. I close my eyes tightly.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're doing great.",
    "Client: We're in the air now. I can feel the plane climbing. My ears are popping, and I'm... I'm trying to swallow to relieve the pressure. The seatbelt sign is still on. I keep checking it, hoping it'll turn off soon so I can... I don't know, feel less restricted maybe?",
    "Therapist: What's your anxiety level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's pretty high. Maybe 75? I'm... I'm really tense.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: We've reached cruising altitude. The seatbelt sign finally turns off, but I... I keep mine on. Just in case. The flight attendants start their service. I can smell coffee, but it's not comforting like usual. It's... it's making me feel a bit nauseous.",
    "Therapist: Focus on your senses. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I can hear the constant hum of the engines. It's usually soothing, but today it feels ominous. The air feels dry, and my mouth is parched. I ask for water when the attendant reaches me. My hand shakes a little as I take the cup.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: About an hour into the flight, we hit some turbulence. It's... it's mild at first, just a few bumps. But then it gets worse. The plane starts to shake more violently. I can hear things rattling in the overhead compartments. The captain's voice comes over the intercom, telling us to fasten our seatbelts. His voice sounds tense, which makes me even more anxious.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's really high. Maybe 90? I'm... I'm starting to panic.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here in my office.",
    "Client: Right, right... Okay. The turbulence is getting worse. The plane feels like it's dropping suddenly, then rising again. People are gasping. I can hear a child crying. I'm... I'm gripping the armrests so tightly my knuckles are white. My heart is racing, and I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud bang. The plane lurches to the side. Oxygen masks drop from the ceiling. Everything becomes chaotic. People are screaming. I'm... I'm fumbling with my mask, my hands shaking so badly I can barely put it on. The plane is losing altitude rapidly. I can see the ground getting closer through the window. It's... it's terrifying.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm trembling all over. My chest is so tight it hurts. I feel dizzy, like I might pass out. The noise is deafening - the engines, the wind, people crying and praying. I close my eyes, but I can still feel the violent shaking of the plane. I'm... I'm convinced we're going to crash.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're doing well.",
    "Client: The descent is so fast. I can hear the landing gear deploy, but it doesn't sound right. There's another loud bang, and the plane tilts sharply. We're... we're coming in too fast. I can see trees, then a field. The impact is... it's brutal. My body slams against the seat belt. There's a screeching sound of metal tearing. Then... then everything goes black.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What's your anxiety level?",
    "Client: It's... it's maxed out. 100. I'm... I'm shaking.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing great. Let's ground ourselves. Can you name five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: I... Okay. I see... your desk, the window, a plant, a clock, and... and your bookshelf.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, can you continue with what happened after the impact?",
    "Client: I... I come to, disoriented. There's smoke everywhere. It's hard to breathe. I can hear people moaning in pain. My head hurts, and I taste blood in my mouth. I'm... I'm still strapped to my seat, but the plane is tilted. I fumble with the seatbelt, my fingers clumsy and weak.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: I manage to get the seatbelt off. I'm... I'm dizzy as I stand up. The cabin is in chaos. There are... there are bodies. I try not to look too closely. I can smell fuel, and I know we need to get out. I help the woman next to me. She's injured but conscious. We make our way to the emergency exit.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm still very anxious, but there's also this... this strange calm. Like I'm moving on autopilot. My SUDS is maybe... 85?",
    "Therapist: That's common in emergency situations. Continue.",
    "Client: We manage to open the exit door. The slide deploys, but it's at an odd angle because of how the plane is positioned. I help the woman out first, then I follow. As I slide down, I can feel the heat from the engines. There's... there's a fire starting.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What do you experience once you're on the ground?",
    "Client: It's... it's surreal. We're in a field. I can see the trail the plane carved through it. There are people scattered around, some moving, some... some not. The air is thick with smoke and the smell of jet fuel. I hear sirens in the distance. My legs feel weak, and I... I collapse onto the ground.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm overwhelmed. Grateful to be alive, but also... guilty? Why did I survive when others didn't? I'm shaking uncontrollably. The adrenaline is wearing off, and everything hurts. I'm... I'm crying, but I can't stop looking at the wreckage of the plane.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. How's your anxiety now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high, but different. Maybe 70? I'm not panicking anymore, just... numb.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves again. Can you tell me three things you can hear right now in this room?",
    "Client: I can hear... the clock ticking, traffic outside, and... and my own breathing.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, two things you can feel.",
    "Client: The... the chair I'm sitting on, and my feet on the floor.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. One thing you can smell.",
    "Client: I smell... coffee. From your mug.",
    "Therapist: Great job. You've made it through the memory. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. But also... I don't know, maybe a little proud? That I got through it?",
    "Therapist: That's completely understandable. You did very well today. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's come down a lot. Maybe... 30?",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's take a few minutes to discuss what you experienced and how you feel about it now.",
    "Client: Okay... it's still hard to talk about, but... but I think it helps. Going through it like that, it's... it's intense, but I can feel the memory losing some of its power over me.",
    "Therapist: That's often the case with this therapy. You're doing excellent work.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's... it's not easy, but I'm starting to see why we do this. I think... I think I'm ready to end the session for today.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Let's do one final grounding exercise before we wrap up..."
