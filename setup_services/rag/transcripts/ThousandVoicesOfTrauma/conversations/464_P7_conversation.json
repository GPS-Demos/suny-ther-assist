    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the refugee experience you mentioned?",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. It was about five years ago when I had to leave my home country. The political situation was getting worse, and I feared for my safety. I remember the night I decided to leave. I was sitting in my small apartment, hearing shouting and gunfire in the distance. My hands were shaking as I packed a small bag with essentials.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I couldn't tell anyone I was leaving. Not even my closest friends. I was afraid word would get out, and I'd be stopped. The fear was overwhelming. I felt like I couldn't breathe properly. I kept looking over my shoulder, thinking someone was watching me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: It's hard to describe the mix of emotions. There was fear, of course, but also guilt for leaving others behind. And sadness... so much sadness. I knew I might never see my home again. As I walked to the bus station in the early morning darkness, every shadow made me jump. I was sweating, my heart racing.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: The bus ride to the border was tense. I tried to act normal, but inside I was a mess. When we reached the border, I thought my heart would explode. The guard looked at my papers for what felt like hours. I was sure he'd find out I was fleeing and send me back. But then... he stamped my passport. I couldn't believe it. I was out.",
    "Therapist: That must have been intense. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Recalling it... it's bringing back a lot. My palms are sweaty, and I feel a tightness in my chest. But it's also... I don't know, maybe a relief to talk about it? I've kept this bottled up for so long.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're doing great.",
    "Client: After crossing the border, I felt this strange mix of relief and dread. I was safe from immediate danger, but I had no idea what lay ahead. I didn't speak the language, I had very little money, and I knew no one. The loneliness hit me hard that first night in a strange city. I slept in a cheap hostel, surrounded by people, but feeling more alone than ever.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: The next few months were a blur of confusion and anxiety. Trying to navigate the asylum process, dealing with bureaucracy in a language I barely understood. I felt so helpless and small. There were nights I cried myself to sleep, wondering if I'd made a terrible mistake. The chronic pain I deal with now started during this time - I think from all the stress and sleeping on hard surfaces.",
    "Therapist: You've been through so much. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming to remember all this. My chest feels tight, and I have this lump in my throat. But there's also a part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe proud? I survived all that. I'm here now, talking about it. It's hard, but I'm doing it.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You're showing incredible strength.",
    "Client: Thank you. It means a lot to hear that. There's so much more to this story - the struggles to find work, to make friends, to build a new life. But this part, leaving home, it's the hardest to talk about. It's where it all began, you know? Sometimes I still have nightmares about that night, about being caught or sent back.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to have those feelings. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I know, logically, that I'm safe. But emotionally, it's still so raw. Even now, loud noises can startle me, reminding me of those nights with gunfire in the distance. And sometimes, when I'm stressed, I get this urge to pack a bag and run. It's like my body still hasn't fully accepted that I don't need to flee anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. You're doing well in recognizing it.",
    "Client: I guess... I guess I'm still learning to feel truly safe. To believe that I can put down roots here without them being ripped up again. It's a process, isn't it? Learning to live without that constant fear and uncertainty. Some days are better than others. Today, talking about it... it's hard, but I also feel like I'm facing it, you know?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're showing great courage.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I need a moment. This has brought up a lot. But I'm glad we're doing this. It feels like... like I'm finally starting to unpack not just my physical belongings, but all these emotions and memories I've been carrying around. It's exhausting, but also... maybe a little freeing?",
    "Therapist: Take all the time you need. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. You know, one of the hardest things about this whole experience has been feeling like no one really understands. Like I'm carrying this invisible weight that no one else can see. But talking about it here, feeling heard and validated... it helps. It doesn't erase what happened, but it makes it feel a little less lonely, a little more manageable.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant realization. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but also somewhat lighter. It's strange. My body feels tense from reliving those memories, but my mind feels clearer. Like I've taken a step towards understanding and accepting my own story. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. It's a common experience in therapy.",
    "Client: That's reassuring to hear. I think... I think I'm ready to end for today. This has been intense, but in a good way, I think. Is it okay if we pick this up next session? There's more I want to explore, but I feel like I need some time to process what we've talked about today.",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've done excellent work today. We'll continue next time."
