    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day. Where are you?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in my dorm room. It's late afternoon, and I've just finished classes for the day. The room feels stuffy, and there's this weird tension in the air.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: My phone rings. It's my mom's number, but it's not her voice when I answer. It's my aunt, and she's crying. She tells me there's been an accident... my mom... she... she didn't make it.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 6. My chest feels tight, and I'm starting to sweat a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Keep going. What do you do after hearing this news?",
    "Client: I... I don't believe it at first. I keep asking my aunt if she's sure, if there's been some mistake. My hands are shaking so badly I can barely hold the phone. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: The room is spinning a bit. My heart is racing. I feel like I might throw up.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's up to an 8 now. This is... this is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Take a deep breath. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I drop the phone. I can hear my aunt's voice, but it sounds far away. I stumble to my bed and just collapse. I'm sobbing uncontrollably, but it doesn't feel real. It's like I'm watching myself from outside my body.",
    "Therapist: And now? Your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's still an 8. My chest hurts, and I feel so... lost.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're safe here. Continue.",
    "Client: I don't know how long I lay there. My roommate comes in at some point. He sees me and freaks out. I can barely speak, but I manage to tell him what happened. He sits with me, but I feel so alone.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually down to a 7 now. Remembering my roommate being there... it helps a little.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens after that?",
    "Client: The next few hours are a blur. I remember calling my dad, hearing him break down on the phone. I start packing to go home, but I can't focus. I keep forgetting what I'm doing.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's back up to an 8. Remembering my dad's voice... God, it hurts so much.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The flight home is torture. Everyone around me is just going about their day, and I feel like screaming. When I get home, seeing my dad... he looks so broken. We just hold each other and cry.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. My chest still hurts, but it's more of an ache now. My SUDS is maybe a 6.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this well.",
    "Client: The funeral is the worst part. Seeing her... lying there. She looks like she's sleeping, but I know she's gone. I keep expecting her to open her eyes, to smile at me one last time.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually down to a 5 now. Talking about it... it still hurts, but it's not as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: I... I feel a bit surprised. And maybe a little guilty that it's not as intense now.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. Let's continue.",
    "Client: After the funeral, everyone leaves. The house feels so empty. Dad and I, we try to go through her things, but we can't. We just sit in her closet, surrounded by her clothes, her scent. It's like she's still there, but she's not.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's holding steady at a 5. I feel sad, but it's... it's manageable.",
    "Therapist: You're doing very well. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. But I also feel like a weight has lifted a bit. Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also... I don't know, freeing in a way?",
