    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not really sure. It's like my mind is racing but also blank at the same time. The memory of the airplane crash feels so vivid now. I can still hear the screeching of metal and smell the smoke. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What physical sensations are you noticing right now?",
    "Client: My heart is pounding, and my palms are sweaty. I feel a tightness in my chest, like I can't get enough air. It's similar to how I felt right after the crash, when I was struggling to breathe through the smoke. I keep clenching and unclenching my fists, trying to ground myself.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. And what thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt during the crash. How I couldn't do anything to stop it. And then I start wondering... what if it happens again? What if I'm on another plane and it goes down? I know it's not rational, but the fear feels so real. And then I feel guilty for even thinking about traveling when so many people lost their lives in that crash.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like a heavy weight in my stomach. Almost nauseous. And there's this voice in my head telling me I don't deserve to move on or be happy when others didn't get that chance. It's suffocating sometimes.",
    "Therapist: I see. What else comes up for you?",
    "Client: I... I find myself getting angry. Angry at the airline, at the pilot, at the universe for letting this happen. But then I feel bad for being angry because I know it wasn't anyone's fault. It's this cycle of anger and guilt that I can't seem to break out of. And underneath it all, there's this deep sadness. For the lives lost, for the person I was before the crash, for the carefree way I used to view the world.",
    "Therapist: How does acknowledging these emotions make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a bit of a relief. I've been trying so hard to push these feelings away, to act like I'm fine. But saying them out loud, it's like I'm finally admitting to myself that it's okay to not be okay. It's exhausting, though. Feeling all of this at once.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I think... I need to remember that I'm safe now. That I survived. Sometimes I feel like I'm still stuck in that moment, you know? Like part of me never left that crashed plane. I need to find a way to bring myself back to the present, to remind myself that I'm here, I'm alive, and it's okay to keep living.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How can we work on that?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe we could come up with some grounding techniques? Something I can use when the memories feel too overwhelming. And I think I need to work on accepting these feelings rather than fighting them. It's just... it's hard. Sometimes I feel like if I fully accept what happened, it makes it more real, you know?",
    "Therapist: I understand. What would accepting it mean to you?",
    "Client: I guess... it would mean acknowledging that my life has changed. That I can't go back to who I was before. And that's scary. But maybe it also means I can start moving forward instead of being stuck in that moment. It's just... the thought of letting go of that day, it feels almost disrespectful to those who didn't make it.",
    "Therapist: How might you honor them while still moving forward?",
    "Client: I... I never thought about it that way. Maybe I could find a way to give back? Volunteer with an organization that helps crash survivors or something? It might help me feel like I'm doing something positive with this experience. And maybe it would help me connect with others who understand what I'm going through.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a meaningful idea. How does thinking about that make you feel?",
    "Client: It actually makes me feel a bit hopeful. Like maybe there's a way to make something good come out of this terrible experience. It doesn't erase what happened, but it gives it some purpose, you know? And it makes me feel less alone. I've been isolating myself so much since the crash, afraid to connect with people because I felt like no one could understand. But maybe reaching out could help.",
    "Therapist: What's the first step you could take?",
    "Client: I think... I could start by researching some organizations online. Maybe even join an online support group for survivors. It's less intimidating than meeting people face-to-face right away. And it would give me a chance to hear other people's stories, to see how they've coped. Maybe it would help me feel less like a victim and more like a survivor.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive direction. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... a mix of things. Still anxious and sad, but also a little lighter. Like maybe there's a path forward that I couldn't see before. It's scary to think about confronting all of this, but also kind of exciting to think that I might be able to help others while helping myself. I'm exhausted, but it's a different kind of tired. More like I've done something important rather than just being drained by fear and memories.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant shift. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think I'd like to work more on those grounding techniques we mentioned. And maybe we could talk about how to start reaching out to others? I'm nervous about it, but I think it could be really helpful. And... I think I'm ready to start talking more about the details of that day. It's terrifying, but I know I need to face it to move forward.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How about we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think that's good. This session was intense, but I feel like I've made some progress. Thank you for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I'm starting to see that there might be a way through all of this. I'm looking forward to our next session, even though I know it'll be challenging.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Take care of yourself.",
    "Client: Thank you. I will. See you next time."
