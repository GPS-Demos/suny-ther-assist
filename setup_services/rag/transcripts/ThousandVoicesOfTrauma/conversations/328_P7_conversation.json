    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Can you describe the animal attack incident?",
    "Client: Okay... I was hiking in the mountains near my home. It was a beautiful day, sunny and warm. I remember feeling so peaceful and happy to be out in nature. Then, out of nowhere, I heard a growl. I turned and saw a large brown bear about 20 feet away. My heart started racing immediately.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: The bear stood up on its hind legs and roared. I was frozen in fear. I knew I shouldn't run, but every instinct in my body was screaming at me to flee. I slowly started to back away, trying to remember what to do in a bear encounter. But then it charged at me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What were you feeling?",
    "Client: Pure terror. I thought I was going to die. I turned and ran, even though I knew I shouldn't. I could hear the bear's heavy breathing behind me. My legs were burning, and I couldn't breathe. I stumbled over a root and fell hard onto the ground.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: As I hit the ground, I curled into a ball, covering my head and neck with my arms. I was shaking uncontrollably. I could smell the bear's hot breath as it got closer. It started swatting at me with its paws. The pain was excruciating. Its claws tore through my jacket and into my back.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: I... I don't know how long it lasted. It felt like hours, but it was probably only a minute or two. Suddenly, I heard shouting. Some other hikers had come across us and were yelling and throwing rocks at the bear. It finally backed off and ran away.",
    "Therapist: How were you feeling at this point?",
    "Client: I was in shock. My whole body was trembling, and I couldn't move. I was gasping for air, and my back was on fire from the cuts. The other hikers came to help me, but I couldn't speak. I just lay there, crying and shaking.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're doing well.",
    "Client: They called for emergency services, and a helicopter came to airlift me to the hospital. The whole time, I kept replaying the attack in my mind. I couldn't believe I had survived. At the hospital, they treated my wounds and kept me overnight for observation.",
    "Therapist: How did you feel in the following days?",
    "Client: I was a mess. I couldn't sleep without having nightmares about the bear. Every little sound made me jump. I felt so ashamed for running when I knew I shouldn't have. And I was angry at myself for putting myself in that situation. I haven't been able to go hiking since then, and I get anxious even thinking about the mountains.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to feel that way. You're very brave for sharing this.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to talk about. Sometimes I feel like I'll never be the same person I was before the attack. I used to love nature and outdoor activities, but now I'm constantly on edge, always looking over my shoulder. I feel like I've lost a part of myself.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. How do you cope with these emotions now?",
    "Client: I try to distract myself with work or spend time with my family. But it's not always effective. Sometimes the memories come flooding back, and I feel overwhelmed. I've been avoiding anything related to bears or hiking. I even get anxious watching nature documentaries now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well facing these memories. Let's continue working through this together.",
    "Client: Okay. I appreciate your support. It's just... sometimes I feel so helpless. Like that bear is still out there, waiting for me. I know it's irrational, but the fear feels so real. I want to get back to enjoying life without this constant anxiety, but I don't know how.",
    "Therapist: Your progress is commendable. We'll work on these feelings step by step.",
    "Client: Thank you. I hope so. I miss who I used to be - carefree and adventurous. Now I feel like I'm always on guard. Even talking about it now, my heart is racing, and my palms are sweaty. But I want to get better. I want to be able to go outside without feeling afraid.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage. Let's end here for today."
