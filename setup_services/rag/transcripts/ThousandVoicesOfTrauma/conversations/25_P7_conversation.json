    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Can you describe the event we've been working on?",
    "Client: Okay... It was the day of the earthquake. I was at home, getting ready for work. I remember feeling the ground start to shake...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: The shaking got stronger. I could hear things falling and breaking. I tried to get to the doorway, but I stumbled. The noise was deafening. I was terrified...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure I can do this. My heart is racing just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: Okay... The walls were creaking, and I thought the ceiling might collapse. I curled up in the doorway, covering my head. I felt so helpless...",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: I could hear screaming from outside. The power went out, and it was dark. I was alone, and I didn't know if it would ever stop. I kept thinking about my ex-partner, wishing they were there...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: But they weren't there. We had broken up just a month before. I felt so abandoned, so vulnerable. The shaking seemed to last forever...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. Continue.",
    "Client: When it finally stopped, I was too scared to move. I sat there, shaking, for what felt like hours. The aftershocks kept coming. I tried calling my ex, but the lines were down...",
    "Therapist: You're showing great strength. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... overwhelmed. My palms are sweaty, and my chest feels tight. But... I also feel a bit relieved to be talking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's completely normal. You're doing excellent work.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard, but... I want to continue. After a while, I finally got up. The apartment was a mess. Broken glass everywhere, furniture toppled. I made my way outside...",
    "Therapist: You're very courageous. Keep going.",
    "Client: The street was chaos. People crying, buildings damaged. I felt so alone in the crowd. I kept thinking if only my ex was there, I'd feel safer. But they weren't, and I had to face this alone...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have felt that way. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I know, but it's still hard. I found some neighbors I knew, and we huddled together. We were all in shock. The aftershocks kept coming, and each time, I felt that same terror...",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. My heart is still racing, but I feel like I can breathe a bit easier. Talking about it... it's helping, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Would you like to continue?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. We stayed outside for hours. Emergency services started arriving. I kept checking my phone, hoping for a message from my ex, but nothing came. I felt so abandoned...",
    "Therapist: It's understandable you felt that way. You're handling this memory well.",
    "Client: Thanks. As night fell, it got colder. We were told it wasn't safe to go back inside. I had to sleep in a makeshift shelter. I've never felt so alone and scared in my life...",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also a bit lighter. Like I've released some of the weight I've been carrying. It's still painful, but... maybe a bit less overwhelming?",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It's still hard, but... I think I'm starting to see that I can handle these memories.",
    "Therapist: You've done remarkable work today. How would you like to proceed?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to stop here for now. It feels like a good place to pause. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You've made significant progress today.",
