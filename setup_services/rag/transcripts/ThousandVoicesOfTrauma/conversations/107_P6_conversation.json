    "Therapist: Good morning, Mei. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure exercise today?",
    "Client: Good morning, Dr. Chen. Yes, I think I'm ready. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important for my progress.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with your SUDS rating. How distressed do you feel right now, on a scale of 0 to 100?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 40. My heart is beating a little faster than usual, and my palms feel slightly clammy.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Now, close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day of the animal attack. Describe what you see and feel.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm walking along the beach near my village. It's early morning, and the sun is just starting to rise. The air is humid, and I can smell the salt from the sea. Suddenly, I hear a low growl behind me. I turn around, and there's a large, wild dog snarling at me. Its teeth are bared, and its eyes... they're so fierce. I feel frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to about 60. My heart is racing faster now, and I feel a tightness in my chest.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: The dog lunges at me. I try to run, but my feet slip in the sand. I fall, and I feel its teeth sink into my leg. The pain is... it's excruciating. I'm screaming, but there's no one around to help. I can feel the warmth of my blood on my skin.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's 80. I feel like I'm back there. My leg is throbbing, and I'm shaking. I can hear my own screams in my head.",
    "Therapist: I know this is difficult. You're very brave. Take a deep breath. What happens after that?",
    "Client: I... I manage to kick the dog with my other foot. It yelps and lets go. I scramble to my feet, limping and crying. I'm in so much pain, and I'm terrified it will attack again. But it doesn't. It runs away, and I collapse on the sand, sobbing and clutching my injured leg.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's still at 80. I feel... I feel so helpless and scared. Even though I know I'm safe now, my body feels like it's still in danger.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're safe here. What happens next in your memory?",
    "Client: I... I lie there for what feels like hours. The sun is getting higher, and it's beating down on me. I'm dizzy from the blood loss and the shock. Finally, I hear voices. Some fishermen are coming to the beach. They find me and call for help. I remember feeling so relieved, but also so ashamed that I couldn't protect myself.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's come down a bit, maybe to 70. I still feel shaky, but talking about the rescue... it helps a little.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're doing great, Mei. How does your body feel right now?",
    "Client: My muscles are tense, especially in my shoulders and jaw. My breathing is fast, and I feel a bit lightheaded. But... but I also feel a sense of relief, like I'm starting to let go of something I've been holding onto for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive sign. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you tell me five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: Yes... I see your potted plant, the blue painting on the wall, my water bottle, the tissue box, and the clock on your desk.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, what's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to about 50 now. I feel more present, less caught up in the memory.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today, Mei. How do you feel about the exercise?",
    "Client: It was intense, but... I feel like I've taken a step forward. I didn't think I could face that memory, but I did. I'm proud of myself, even though I'm exhausted.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. We'll end here for today. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Chen. I will. I'm grateful for your support through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Mei. I'll see you next week."
