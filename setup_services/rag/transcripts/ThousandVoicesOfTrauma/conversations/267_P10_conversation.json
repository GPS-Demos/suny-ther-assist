    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Patel. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit apprehensive, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about the dog attack, and just thinking about it makes my heart race a little.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to help you process this experience. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Yes, let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm walking down the street near my shop. It's early morning, maybe around 7:30. The air is crisp, and I can smell fresh bread from the bakery down the road. I'm carrying my handbag and some papers for work.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear... I hear a growl. It's low at first, but then it gets louder. I turn and... oh god, there's this massive dog. It's a Rottweiler, I think. Its teeth are bared, and it's... it's coming right at me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm terrified. My heart is pounding so hard I can hear it in my ears. I want to run, but my legs won't move. I'm... I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about an 80. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Take a deep breath. What happens next?",
    "Client: The dog... it lunges at me. I try to use my bag as a shield, but it's too late. Its teeth sink into my arm. The pain is... it's excruciating. I'm screaming, but it feels like no sound is coming out.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What do you see and hear around you?",
    "Client: I see... I see people starting to come out of their shops. Someone's yelling for help. The dog is growling and shaking its head, and I can feel my skin tearing. There's blood... so much blood.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My arm hurts just thinking about it. But I'm here, I'm safe now.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You're safe here. Take another deep breath. What happens next?",
    "Client: A man... he comes running with a broom. He's hitting the dog, trying to get it to let go. The dog finally releases my arm, but then it turns on him. I collapse to the ground, holding my arm. Everything's a blur of pain and fear.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in that moment?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm going to die. The dog might come back for me. I'm thinking about my family, my grandchildren. Will I ever see them again?",
    "Therapist: How distressed are you feeling now, 0 to 100?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 90. This is really intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Remember, you're safe now. Can you feel your feet on the floor?",
    "Client: Yes... yes, I can. The carpet is soft. I'm here, not there.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's continue. What happens after you collapse?",
    "Client: Someone... a woman, I think... she's kneeling beside me. She's pressing something against my arm to stop the bleeding. I can hear sirens in the distance. The pain is... it's overwhelming. I feel dizzy, like I might pass out.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The concrete is cold beneath me. I can smell the metallic scent of blood. People are gathering around, their voices a jumble of concern and panic. Someone's holding my hand, telling me help is coming.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm scared, but also relieved. The dog is gone, and help is on the way. But I'm worried about how bad the injury is. Will I lose my arm? Will I be able to work again?",
    "Therapist: Those are natural concerns. What happens when the ambulance arrives?",
    "Client: The paramedics are quick and efficient. They're asking me questions, but I'm having trouble focusing. They're cutting away my sleeve, and I catch a glimpse of my arm. It's... it's a mess of blood and torn flesh. I feel nauseous.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here now, and you've healed. How distressed are you?",
    "Client: About an 85. It's... it's getting a bit easier to talk about.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. What happens in the ambulance?",
    "Client: They're putting an IV in my good arm. The pain medication starts to kick in, and things get a bit hazy. I'm still scared, but the edge is off. I keep thinking about my husband. Will someone tell him what happened?",
    "Therapist: It's natural to worry about your loved ones. What do you remember next?",
    "Client: We're at the hospital. It's all a blur of bright lights and voices. They're taking me to surgery. I remember feeling so alone and vulnerable. The anesthesiologist is talking to me, telling me to count backward from 10. I don't think I make it past 8.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, reliving this?",
    "Client: It's... it's strange. I feel a mix of fear and gratitude. Fear from remembering the attack, but grateful for the people who helped me.",
    "Therapist: That's a very normal response. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you?",
    "Client: About a 70 now. It's getting easier to talk about.",
    "Therapist: You're making great progress. Let's continue. What's the next thing you remember?",
    "Client: I'm waking up in the recovery room. My arm is heavily bandaged, and there's a dull ache. My husband is there, holding my hand. He looks so worried, but he's trying to smile for me. I feel safe seeing him there.",
    "Therapist: That must have been comforting. What happens next?",
    "Client: The doctor comes in to explain the surgery. They had to do a lot of stitches and repair some muscle damage. He says I was lucky \u2013 it could have been much worse. But then he mentions physical therapy, and I start to worry about my recovery.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Anxious, definitely. But also determined. I remember thinking, \"I will get through this. I have to.\"",
    "Therapist: That's a very resilient attitude. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. It's still hard to talk about, but I feel stronger. Like I'm taking back control by facing this memory.",
    "Therapist: You're doing excellent work. Let's continue. What was the recovery process like?",
    "Client: It was long and painful. The physical therapy was grueling. There were days I wanted to give up, but my family kept encouraging me. The hardest part was the fear. Every time I heard a dog bark, I'd freeze up. I couldn't walk down that street for months.",
    "Therapist: How did you cope with that fear?",
    "Client: I... I started seeing a therapist. She helped me work through the trauma. I also joined a support group for attack survivors. Hearing others' stories made me feel less alone.",
    "Therapist: That's great that you sought help. How are you feeling now, talking about your recovery?",
    "Client: I feel... proud, actually. I've come a long way. I can walk down that street now, even though my heart still races a bit. I'm not letting the fear control me anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's fantastic progress. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you now?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 50. It's much better than when we started.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredible work today. How do you feel about the progress you've made?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel stronger. Like I'm taking back pieces of myself that the attack took away. It's still hard, but I can talk about it without feeling overwhelmed now.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. Is there anything else about the experience you want to discuss?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'm realizing how much this attack affected my self-confidence. Not just in terms of being around dogs, but in general. I became more hesitant, more fearful of the world. But working through this, I'm starting to feel more like my old self again.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it feel to recognize that?",
    "Client: It feels... liberating, in a way. Like I'm understanding myself better. I want to keep working on this, to keep getting stronger.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent attitude. We'll continue to work on this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... tired, but in a good way. Like I've accomplished something important. My arm is a bit sore from tensing up, but I feel more at peace than when we started.",
    "Therapist: You've done exceptional work today. Let's take a few deep breaths together to close the session.",
    "Client: (Takes deep breaths) Thank you. This was hard, but I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself. We'll build on this progress in our next session."
