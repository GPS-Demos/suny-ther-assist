    "Therapist: Welcome back. Today we'll be doing an imaginal exposure session focused on your experience with severe illness. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm feeling a bit jittery, to be honest. But I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Let's start with your SUDS level.",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 5 or 6 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath and begin when you're ready.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm in the hospital room. The beeping of the machines is constant, and there's this antiseptic smell that's overwhelming. I'm lying in the bed, and I feel so weak. My body aches all over, and I'm sweating, but I'm also cold. The doctor just left after giving me the diagnosis. Cancer. Stage 3. I... I can't believe this is happening to me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. My heart is racing, and I feel like I can't breathe. The room seems to be closing in on me. I keep thinking about all the plans I had, all the things I wanted to do. Will I ever get to do them now? I feel so alone, even though there are nurses bustling around outside my room.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I reach for my phone with shaky hands. I need to call someone, anyone. But who? My parents are gone, and I don't want to burden my friends. God, I wish I had a partner right now. Someone to hold my hand and tell me it's going to be okay. But there's no one. I'm staring at the phone screen, and it's just a blur through my tears.",
    "Therapist: What's happening in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, and my stomach is in knots. I can feel my pulse in my ears, and my mouth is dry. I'm gripping the sheets so hard my knuckles are white.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... A nurse comes in to check on me. She's asking me questions, but I can barely focus. Her voice sounds muffled, like I'm underwater. I nod, pretending to understand, but inside I'm screaming. How can life just go on like normal when my world has just imploded?",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"This isn't fair. Why me?\" I've always tried to take care of myself, to be a good person. And now this? I'm angry, so angry at the universe. But I'm also scared. What if the treatment doesn't work? What if I die alone in this sterile room? I've never felt so vulnerable and exposed.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: The nurse leaves, and I'm alone again. The silence is deafening. I can hear my own ragged breathing. I close my eyes, trying to escape, but all I can see is a dark future stretching out before me. Chemo, radiation, surgery... will I even recognize myself at the end of this? I feel like I'm drowning in fear and uncertainty.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to an 8, I think. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... I'm looking out the window now. It's a beautiful day outside, sunny and bright. But it feels like a cruel joke. How can the world be so beautiful when my life is falling apart? I see people walking by, laughing, living their lives. And I'm stuck here, facing my mortality. I feel so disconnected from everything.",
    "Therapist: What do you want to do in that moment?",
    "Client: I... I want to run. Just rip out all these tubes and wires and run as far as I can. But I can't. I'm too weak. I'm trapped in this body that's betraying me. I want to scream, to rage against the unfairness of it all. But instead, I just lie there, silent tears rolling down my cheeks.",
    "Therapist: Allow yourself to feel those emotions. You're doing well.",
    "Client: It's overwhelming. The fear, the anger, the sadness... it's all swirling together. I'm thinking about all the milestones I might miss. Will I ever fall in love? Will I see my friends get married, have kids? Will I achieve my career goals? Everything feels so uncertain now.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What's happening right now in the room?",
    "Client: A doctor comes in with more test results. He's talking about treatment options, survival rates, side effects. But it's all just noise to me. I'm nodding, but I'm not really there. I'm somewhere else, imagining all the worst-case scenarios. I can feel panic rising in my chest again.",
    "Therapist: Remember your coping strategies. How can you ground yourself?",
    "Client: I... I try to focus on my breathing. In and out. I look around the room, trying to name five things I can see. The IV stand, the heart monitor, the window, the chair, my hands. It helps a little, but the fear is still there, lurking.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going with what happens next.",
    "Client: The doctor leaves, and I'm alone with all this information. It's too much. I feel like I'm drowning in it. I close my eyes, trying to make sense of it all, but my mind is racing. I'm thinking about how I'm going to tell my friends, my coworkers. How will this change how they see me? Will they treat me differently?",
    "Therapist: What's your biggest fear in that moment?",
    "Client: That I'll die before I've really lived. That I'll face all of this alone. That I'll suffer and it won't even matter in the end. I'm terrified of the pain, of losing my independence, of becoming a burden. And I'm scared of how this will change me. Will I still be me after all of this?",
    "Therapist: You're confronting very real fears. How does your body feel now?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted. My body feels heavy, like I'm sinking into the bed. My head is pounding from all the crying and stress. But there's also this restless energy, like I need to do something, anything, to fight this.",
    "Therapist: What do you do with that energy?",
    "Client: I... I reach for my phone again. This time, I manage to call my best friend. As soon as I hear their voice, I break down. I can barely get the words out through my sobs. They're saying they'll be right there, that I'm not alone. And for the first time since the diagnosis, I feel a tiny spark of hope.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful moment. How does it feel to reach out?",
    "Client: It's... it's a relief, but it's also scary. I feel vulnerable, exposed. But also supported. It's like I've been holding my breath, and now I can finally exhale. I'm still terrified, but I don't feel quite so alone anymore.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's come down a bit. Maybe a 6? It's still intense, but not as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's continue. What happens after the call?",
    "Client: I'm lying there, waiting for my friend to arrive. The room doesn't feel quite as oppressive now. I'm still scared, but there's a part of me that's starting to think about fighting this. I'm looking at the get-well cards on the nightstand, reminders that people care about me.",
    "Therapist: How does that shift your perspective?",
    "Client: It... it makes me feel less alone. Like maybe I can face this. I'm still terrified of what's to come, but I'm also starting to feel a spark of determination. I don't want this illness to define me. I want to fight.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Let's pause here. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm drained, emotionally and physically. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe accomplishment? Like I've faced something really difficult and come out the other side.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Let's take a few deep breaths together."
