    "Therapist: Good morning, Mr. Patel. Today, we'll be focusing on imaginal exposure. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Good morning, Dr. Thompson. I think so, but I'm feeling a bit nervous. Could you explain a little more about what we'll be doing?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Imaginal exposure involves revisiting your traumatic memory in a safe environment. It helps reduce PTSD symptoms over time.",
    "Client: I see. I'm worried about reliving those painful moments from my past. The bullying I experienced was quite intense, and I'm not sure how I'll react to bringing it all up again.",
    "Therapist: Your concern is understandable. We'll go at your pace and I'll support you throughout.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I appreciate your patience. I've been thinking a lot about recent events, especially the news about police brutality. It's bringing up some difficult emotions related to my own experiences with bullying. How do we address that?",
    "Therapist: We can incorporate those feelings into our session. Your current emotions are valid and relevant.",
    "Client: Thank you for acknowledging that. It's been weighing on me heavily. I find myself drawing parallels between the powerlessness I felt during bullying and what I see happening in these cases of police brutality. It's triggering some old fears and anxieties.",
    "Therapist: That's an important connection. We'll explore those feelings as part of the process.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm willing to try. What should I expect during the imaginal exposure? Will it be intense?",
    "Therapist: It may be challenging, but you're in control. We can pause anytime you need.",
    "Client: That's good to know. I'm curious about how this will help me in the long run. Will revisiting these memories really make a difference in how I feel day-to-day?",
    "Therapist: Yes. Over time, it can reduce the power these memories hold over you.",
    "Client: I hope so. I've been carrying this burden for so long. It affects my relationships, especially with my wife. She's been so supportive, but I know my PTSD symptoms strain our marriage at times. I want to get better for both of us.",
    "Therapist: Your motivation is admirable. This process can improve your relationships and overall quality of life.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm feeling a mix of hope and apprehension. But I trust you, Dr. Thompson. Your experience and our work together so far have been helpful. I'm ready to take this next step, even if it's difficult.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. Shall we begin the exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm ready. Just one more question - will we be focusing solely on the bullying incidents, or should I also bring up my thoughts about the recent police brutality cases?",
    "Therapist: We'll primarily focus on your bullying experiences, but you can mention current triggers if relevant.",
    "Client: Understood. I appreciate your flexibility. It helps knowing I can express all aspects of what I'm feeling. Okay, I'm ready to start whenever you are.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's begin. Close your eyes and take a deep breath..."
