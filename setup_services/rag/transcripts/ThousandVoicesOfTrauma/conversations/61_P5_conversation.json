    "Therapist: Welcome, Amir. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. A bit nervous, I suppose. Ever since my wife passed, these sessions have been my lifeline, but I still feel anxious about what we might uncover.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you familiar with it?",
    "Client: Not really. I've heard the term, but I'm not sure what it entails. Is it... is it going to be difficult?",
    "Therapist: It can be challenging, but it's a powerful tool. Shall I explain?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I want to understand what we're getting into.",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit your trauma memories in a safe environment. It helps process emotions and reduce symptoms.",
    "Client: Revisit the memories? You mean... the cult experiences? I'm not sure I'm ready for that. It's been years, but it still feels so raw.",
    "Therapist: Your hesitation is normal. We'll go at your pace. How does that sound?",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's just... those memories are intertwined with losing my wife. She was the one who helped me leave the cult, and now she's gone. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: I hear you. Your safety is my priority. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Will this bring back the nightmares? I've just started sleeping better, and I'm worried this might undo that progress. And what if I can't handle it? What if I break down completely?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. We'll work together to manage any effects. Your resilience is remarkable.",
    "Client: Thank you for saying that. It doesn't always feel that way. Sometimes I feel like I'm barely holding it together, especially at work. My colleagues have no idea what I've been through.",
    "Therapist: Your strength is evident. Shall we discuss what to expect during the exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I need to know what I'm getting into. Will it be like reliving everything all over again?",
    "Therapist: It may feel intense, but you're safe here. We'll pause if needed. Your control is crucial.",
    "Client: Okay, that's somewhat reassuring. I suppose I'm worried about losing control. In the cult, we were always told to surrender control, and that's a scary thought now.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. This process is about regaining control. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. Can we start with something small? Maybe just a brief memory to see how I handle it?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll start gradually. Your comfort is essential. What memory feels manageable?",
    "Client: Perhaps the day I first met the cult leader. It was before things got really bad, but it was the beginning of everything. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: That's a good starting point. Remember, you're in control. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I'm ready. Thank you for being so patient with me. It means more than you know.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your courage is admirable. Let's start when you're comfortable."
