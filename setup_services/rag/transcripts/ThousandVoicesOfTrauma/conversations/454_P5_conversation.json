    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more flashbacks about the car accident lately, and it's making me anxious just thinking about discussing it.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's talk about today's plan.",
    "Client: Alright. What exactly are we going to do? You mentioned something about imaginal exposure last time, but I'm not sure I fully grasp what that means.",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit the accident in your mind. It helps process trauma memories.",
    "Client: Revisit it? I'm not sure I can handle that. Just thinking about it makes my heart race. Is this really necessary?",
    "Therapist: It's challenging, but effective. We'll go at your pace. Any questions?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about losing control. What if I panic? Or what if I can't stop reliving it afterward? I've worked so hard to avoid thinking about the accident, and now you're asking me to dive right in. It feels counterintuitive.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll take breaks if needed. This helps reduce PTSD symptoms.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. Can you tell me more about how this is supposed to help? I mean, I understand the theory, but it's hard to believe that deliberately thinking about the trauma will make it better rather than worse.",
    "Therapist: Exposure reduces fear over time. It helps your brain process the memory safely.",
    "Client: That makes sense, I suppose. It's just... it's been so long since I've allowed myself to really think about what happened. I'm worried about what might come up. How do I know I'm ready for this?",
    "Therapist: Your progress shows readiness. We'll go slowly. Your bravery is admirable.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot. I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be. What should I expect during the session? Will you be guiding me through it?",
    "Therapist: I'll guide you. You'll describe the event. We'll manage emotions together.",
    "Client: Okay. And what if it becomes too overwhelming? Is it alright if I need to stop?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're in control. We can pause anytime.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I'm still nervous, but I think I understand better now why we're doing this. Is there anything I should do to prepare myself before we start?",
    "Therapist: Just breathe deeply. Remember, you're safe here. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do this. I know it won't be easy, but if it helps me move past this trauma, I'm willing to try. Thank you for your patience and for explaining everything so clearly.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your courage is commendable. Shall we start?",
    "Client: Yes, I'm ready. Let's begin the imaginal exposure. I trust you to guide me through this, and I'll do my best to face these memories head-on."
