    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, John?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, really. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. That memory... it was so vivid. I could almost smell the alcohol on my father's breath again. It's like I was right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The fear, I think. I remembered how small I felt, cowering in the corner as my father shouted at my mother. I could see the veins bulging in his neck, his face red with anger. And my mother... she looked so helpless. I wanted to protect her, but I was just a kid. I felt so... powerless.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was tough, really tough. But... different from before. I noticed that even though I felt scared, I also felt angry. Angry at my father for putting us through that, angry at the situation. And... I don't know, maybe a little proud of myself for facing it?",
    "Therapist: That's an important observation. How does this connect to your everyday life now?",
    "Client: I guess... I've always avoided confrontation, you know? I think that's why my marriage fell apart. I never stood up for myself. But going through this memory, feeling that anger... it's like I'm giving myself permission to have those feelings. Maybe I don't have to be that scared little boy anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How might this affect your goals moving forward?",
    "Client: I... I think I want to work on being more assertive. Maybe try to rebuild some relationships, especially with my kids. I've been so afraid of turning into my father that I've been distant. But I'm not him. I can be present without being violent.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent goal. What helped you get through today's session?",
    "Client: Honestly? Knowing you were here. And... reminding myself that I'm safe now. It's over. I'm an adult, and I have control over my life. It's hard to believe sometimes, but... it's true, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's scary, but... I think it's helping. Each time, it gets a little easier to face. And I want to be better, for myself and my kids. I'm ready to keep going.",
    "Therapist: That's commendable, John. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... maybe we could explore how these memories affect my relationships now? Especially with my ex-wife and kids. I want to understand why I push people away when things get tough.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a valuable direction. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: Um, yeah... I've been having some cravings lately. For alcohol. I know it's not good, especially given my family history, but... sometimes it feels like the only way to quiet the memories. I haven't given in, but it's been tough.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. How can we address this in our sessions?",
    "Client: Maybe we could talk about some coping strategies? Something to do instead of drinking when the memories get overwhelming. And... I think I might need to start going to those support group meetings again. I've been avoiding them, but I know they helped before.",
    "Therapist: That's a great plan. How are you feeling now, as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm tired, but... okay. Better than I expected, actually. It's like a weight has been lifted, you know? I know we have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe I can do this. Maybe I can actually get better.",
    "Therapist: That's fantastic, John. What will you do to take care of yourself until our next session?",
    "Client: I think I'll call my sponsor tonight. And maybe... maybe I'll reach out to my daughter. Just to say hi. Baby steps, right? Oh, and I'll keep doing those breathing exercises you taught me. They really help when I start feeling anxious.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. I look forward to our next session. Take care, John.",
    "Client: Thanks, Doc. See you next week."
