    "Therapist: Welcome back, Carlos. Are you ready to continue our imaginal exposure work today?",
    "Client: I think so... I'm a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with your SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 4 right now. Just thinking about it makes me a little tense.",
    "Therapist: Okay. When you're ready, close your eyes and describe that day at the hospital.",
    "Client: *deep breath* I'm walking into the emergency room. The smell of antiseptic hits me immediately. I... I can hear people talking in rapid Spanish and English. A nurse looks at me and asks, \"\u00bfQu\u00e9 necesitas?\" but before I can answer, she turns away to help someone else. I feel... invisible. My chest tightens as I try to explain why I'm there, but no one seems to be listening.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 6. My hands are getting sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Keep going.",
    "Client: I finally get to see a doctor, but he barely looks at me. He's rushing, clearly overworked. I try to explain my symptoms, but he cuts me off, saying something about how \"you people\" always exaggerate. I feel a mix of anger and shame washing over me. My heart's racing now, remembering how helpless I felt.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... *voice shaking* it's an 8 now. I can feel that same tightness in my chest, that same lump in my throat.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* The doctor orders some tests, but the way he looks at me... it's like I'm not even human. Just another number. I overhear him muttering to a nurse about \"these immigrants clogging up the system.\" I want to scream that I was born here, that I have rights, but... I can't. I just sit there, feeling small and worthless.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... *choking up* It's a 9. I can feel tears coming. God, I hate this feeling.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel. You're doing incredibly well.",
    "Client: *wiping tears* The test results come back, and they've found something serious. But the doctor... he doesn't even seem to care. He rattles off some medical jargon, hands me a prescription, and walks away. I'm left there, terrified and confused, with no one to explain what's happening to me. I've never felt so alone in my life.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's still a 9. My whole body feels hot and shaky.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this amazingly. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I leave the hospital feeling worse than when I came in. Not just physically, but... *voice breaking* emotionally destroyed. I trusted these people to help me, to treat me like a human being. Instead, I was just another brown face to them. Just another problem to get rid of. I get to my car and I just... I break down. I can't stop crying. I feel so angry, so hurt, so... worthless.",

    "Client: *exhales slowly* It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7? I still feel shaky, but... talking about it... it helps.",
    "Therapist: You did incredibly well. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves."
