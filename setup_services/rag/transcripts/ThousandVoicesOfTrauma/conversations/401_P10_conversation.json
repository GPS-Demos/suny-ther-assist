    "Therapist: Welcome, Jake. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to be diving into some heavy stuff today, and part of me wants to just bolt out of here.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess so. Let's do this before I change my mind.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I'm walking down this dimly lit street. It's late, maybe around 11 PM. I can hear distant traffic and... and there's this group of people ahead. They're arguing loudly.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: There's a chill in the air. I can see my breath. I... I pull my jacket tighter. The streetlights are flickering, casting weird shadows. I'm trying to decide if I should turn back or keep going.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I keep walking. My heart's racing a bit. As I get closer, I can make out four men and a young woman. She looks terrified. One of the men has her by the arm, and he's yelling at her in a language I don't understand.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm scared. My palms are sweaty, and I can feel my pulse in my throat. I want to help her, but I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you?",
    "Client: About a 70. It's... it's intense.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... The woman tries to pull away, but the man tightens his grip. She cries out in pain. I... I can see tears streaming down her face. The other men are laughing, jeering. It's... it's sickening.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you doing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm fumbling for my phone. My hands are shaking so bad I can barely unlock it. I'm trying to call the police, but I'm terrified they'll see me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's up to about 85. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. Feel your feet on the floor. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Right, right... Okay. I manage to dial 911. I'm whispering into the phone, trying to explain what I'm seeing. The operator is asking me questions, but I can barely focus. The scene in front of me is... it's horrifying.",
    "Therapist: What's happening with the group?",
    "Client: They're... they're forcing the woman into a van. She's struggling, screaming. I... I can see bruises forming on her arms where they're grabbing her. One of the men slaps her, and the sound... God, it echoes in the quiet street.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm furious. And ashamed. I want to run over there and help her, but I'm too scared. I feel like a coward.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're doing what you can. How's your distress?",
    "Client: It's... it's maxed out. 100. I can barely stand it.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're safe here in the office.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Okay... The van's engine starts up. I can smell the exhaust. The woman is still screaming, but it's muffled now. They've got her inside. I'm... I'm panicking. Where are the police?",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: The van starts to pull away. I'm... I'm running after it now, trying to get the license plate. My legs feel like lead. I'm gasping for air. The van turns a corner and... and it's gone. Just like that.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Helpless. Utterly helpless. I'm standing there in the middle of the street, panting. I can hear sirens in the distance, but... but it's too late. She's gone.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: Still pretty high. Maybe 90.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The police finally arrive. I'm... I'm a mess. I can barely get the words out to explain what happened. They're asking me questions, but all I can think about is that woman's face. Her terror. Her... her desperation.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those emotions. What else?",
    "Client: I feel sick to my stomach. I keep replaying it in my head, thinking of what I could've done differently. Maybe if I'd been braver, or faster, or... I don't know. Something.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you did what you could in a dangerous situation.",
    "Client: I know, but... it doesn't feel like enough. The cops are taking my statement, but I can tell they don't have much hope. One of them pats me on the shoulder, tells me I did the right thing by calling. But it doesn't feel right. Nothing about this feels right.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe 75?",
    "Therapist: Good. Take another deep breath. What happens after the police leave?",
    "Client: I... I just stand there for a while. The street is quiet again, like nothing ever happened. But I can still hear her screams in my head. I feel... I feel hollow. Empty. I start walking home, but every shadow makes me jump. Every car that passes... I wonder if it's them coming back.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I finally make it home. My hands are shaking so bad I can barely get my key in the lock. Once I'm inside, I just... I just collapse. I'm sobbing, but it's like I can't even feel it. I'm numb. I keep seeing her face, hearing her screams. I... I don't sleep at all that night.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. Emotionally exhausted. But there's this... this weight on my chest. Like I'm carrying around this secret, this horrible thing I witnessed.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's down to about 60 now. Still there, but... not as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well today, Jake. Let's start to bring you back to the present.",
    "Client: Okay... yeah. I'm... I'm here. In your office. It's... it's over.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You're safe here. Take a moment to ground yourself.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Alright. I'm... I'm back. That was... intense.",
    "Therapist: You showed a lot of courage today. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired. Really tired. But... maybe a little lighter? Like I've started to unpack some of this.",
    "Therapist: That's good. We'll end here for today. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later.",
    "Client: I will. Thanks... thanks for guiding me through that.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Jake. We'll continue working through this in our next session."
