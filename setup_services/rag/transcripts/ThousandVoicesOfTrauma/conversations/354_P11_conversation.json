    "Therapist: How are you feeling after today's imaginal exposure, Mr. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken up, to be honest. It's not easy revisiting that memory of losing Margaret. It's been five years, but it still feels so raw sometimes. During the exposure, I could almost smell the hospital disinfectant and hear the beeping of the machines. It's like I was right back there, holding her hand as she... (voice breaks) as she slipped away.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. I keep replaying those final moments, wishing I could've done something more. I was her husband for 52 years, and in the end, I couldn't protect her from... from dying. It's hard not to feel like I failed her somehow.",
    "Therapist: Mm. How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... difficult. My heart was racing, and I felt this tightness in my chest. But... (pauses) I noticed something different this time. The pain was there, but it didn't completely overwhelm me like it used to. I was able to stay present and breathe through it. Is that... is that progress?",
    "Therapist: What do you think?",
    "Client: I suppose it might be. It's just... for so long, I've been avoiding anything that reminds me of that day. Even looking at our old photos was too painful. But going through this exposure, as hard as it is, I'm starting to feel like maybe I can face these memories without falling apart completely. It's exhausting, but also... I don't know, maybe a little empowering?",
    "Therapist: That's an interesting observation. How does this relate to your goals?",
    "Client: Well, I've been wanting to be able to remember Margaret without feeling crushed by grief. To be able to talk about her with our grandkids and share happy memories. I think... I think this might be a step towards that. It's still painful, but maybe I'm learning to carry that pain in a different way?",
    "Therapist: Hmm. What else have you noticed?",
    "Client: I've been sleeping a bit better lately. The nightmares aren't as frequent. And yesterday, I actually looked at our wedding album for the first time in years. I cried, but it wasn't just sadness. There was some joy there too, remembering how happy we were. It felt... bittersweet, I guess, but in a way that I could handle.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about continuing with the exposures?",
    "Client: It's daunting, I won't lie. But I'm starting to see the value in it. For so long, I've been stuck in this cycle of grief and anxiety, barely living. Margaret wouldn't have wanted that for me. I want to honor her memory by learning to live again, you know? So yes, I'm willing to keep going. It's not easy, but I think it's worth it.",
    "Therapist: That's very insightful. What's helped you through this process?",
    "Client: The breathing exercises have been surprisingly helpful. And writing in that journal you suggested - it's allowing me to express things I've been bottling up for years. Oh, and my neighbor Tom - he's been checking in on me, making sure I get out for walks. It's good to have that support, even if it's hard to accept sometimes.",
    "Therapist: Mm. How else has this affected your daily life?",
    "Client: Well, I've started volunteering at the community garden. It gets me out of the house and... Margaret always loved gardening. It feels like a way to connect with her memory that's not just about loss. And I'm thinking about reaching out to our old friends. I've been so isolated, but I'm starting to realize that connection might be healing.",
    "Therapist: What do you want to focus on next?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to work on being able to talk about Margaret more openly. Maybe practice sharing some stories about her? And... (sighs) I know we've talked about this before, but I think I might be ready to start going through her things. Not to get rid of them, but to... to remember, I guess. To feel close to her in a way that's not just about that final day in the hospital.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Anything else?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For your patience and guidance through all this. I know I'm not an easy patient, with all my anxiety and resistance. But I'm grateful for this chance to work through my grief and trauma. It's hard, but I'm starting to see a glimmer of hope for the future. And that... that means everything."
