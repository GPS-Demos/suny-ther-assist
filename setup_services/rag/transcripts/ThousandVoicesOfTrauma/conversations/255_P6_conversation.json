    "Therapist: Alright, let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the memory.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in the hospital waiting room. The fluorescent lights are harsh, and there's that antiseptic smell. I can hear muffled voices and occasional beeps from machines. My partner is next to me, holding my hand tightly.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: Um, about a 4. I'm tense, but it's manageable.",
    "Therapist: Continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a commotion. I see medical staff rushing past us, pushing a gurney. There's blood... so much blood. The person on the gurney is thrashing, and I can hear them crying out in pain. My heart starts racing, and I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. My palms are sweating, and I feel dizzy.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I want to look away, but I can't. The person's face is contorted in agony. I hear a doctor shouting orders, and there's a sense of panic in the air. I start trembling, and my partner is asking if I'm okay, but their voice sounds far away.",
    "Therapist: What's happening in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, and my throat is constricting. I'm having trouble swallowing, and my legs feel weak. I'm afraid I might faint.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. This is really intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it.",
    "Client: The medical team is working frantically. I can see blood on their gloves and gowns. The person on the gurney goes limp, and I hear someone yell \"We're losing them!\" My vision starts to blur, and I feel like I'm going to be sick.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm shaking all over. My heart is pounding so hard it hurts. I feel like I can't get enough air.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: Still a 9. Maybe even a 9.5. I don't know how much more I can take.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: I... I need to sit down. My legs are giving out. My partner is helping me to a chair, but I can't take my eyes off the scene. The doctors are performing CPR now. I can hear the rhythmic compressions and see the person's chest rising and falling unnaturally. I feel completely helpless and overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's back down to an 8. I think I'm starting to feel a bit numb.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. What happens next?",
    "Client: They... they stop. The doctor looks at the clock and says something I can't hear. Everyone steps back from the gurney. There's a moment of heavy silence, and then they cover the person with a sheet. I feel a wave of nausea and grief wash over me.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm crying. My whole body feels heavy and drained. I can't stop thinking about that person's family, how they'll receive the news.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6 now. I feel exhausted and sad, but the panic is subsiding.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. Let's start to bring you back to the present.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm taking deep breaths. I can feel the chair I'm sitting on, hear the hum of the air conditioning in your office. My heartbeat is slowing down.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's a 3 now. I feel drained but... oddly relieved. Like I've released something.",
    "Therapist: That's common. How do you feel about the exercise?",
    "Client: It was intense, but... I think it helped. I've never talked about it in such detail before.",
    "Therapist: You showed great courage. We'll end here for today."
