    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I'm back there, you know? The sound of that bear's growl, it's so vivid in my mind. I can almost feel the ground shaking beneath my feet.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What physical sensations are you noticing right now?",
    "Client: My palms are sweaty, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's hard to breathe normally. I keep expecting to see the bear when I look up, even though I know I'm safe here. It's... it's unsettling.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. In the military, we're trained to handle so much, but nothing prepared me for that moment. I feel... I feel ashamed that I froze. I should have known what to do, but I just... couldn't move.",
    "Therapist: How does that shame feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like a heavy weight on my shoulders. My stomach feels knotted up. I guess... I guess I'm disappointed in myself. I've faced enemy fire, but this... this was different. I feel like I let myself down.",
    "Therapist: What else comes up for you as you reflect on this?",
    "Client: I... I'm angry. Angry at myself for being so unprepared, angry at the situation. But there's also this... this overwhelming sense of relief. I survived, you know? It's like my emotions are all over the place. One moment I'm reliving the terror, the next I'm just grateful to be alive.",
    "Therapist: How does that mix of emotions sit with you?",
    "Client: It's confusing, to be honest. I feel like I should be over this by now. I've been through worse in combat, haven't I? But this... this feels different. It's like it stripped away all my training, all my confidence. I feel... vulnerable, I guess. And that scares me more than the bear did.",
    "Therapist: What do you make of that vulnerability?",
    "Client: I... I don't like it. It reminds me of how I felt when I first joined the military - scared, unsure. But back then, I could train, prepare. This... this feels like something I can't control. What if it happens again? What if next time, I'm not so lucky?",
    "Therapist: How does that fear impact you now?",
    "Client: It's... it's always there, lurking in the background. I find myself avoiding nature trails, camping trips. Things I used to love. I'm constantly on edge, scanning for threats. It's exhausting. And it's not just about bears anymore. It's like my whole sense of safety has been shaken.",
    "Therapist: What does that loss of safety mean to you?",
    "Client: It means... it means I'm not who I thought I was. I always saw myself as this tough, capable guy. Now, I feel... I feel fragile. Like at any moment, something could happen that I can't handle. And that's not just about being in nature. It's affecting everything - my studies, my relationships. I'm struggling to trust myself.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your combat experiences?",
    "Client: I... I hadn't really thought about that. But now that you mention it, there are similarities. That feeling of constant vigilance, the hyperawareness. It's like I'm back in a war zone, but the enemy is... is everywhere and nowhere at the same time. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I need to feel safe again. To trust myself. To know that I can handle whatever comes my way. But I don't know how to get there. It feels so far away right now.",
    "Therapist: How might we work towards that together?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe by facing these memories head-on? It's terrifying, but I can't keep living like this. I want to be able to enjoy nature again, to feel confident in myself. I guess... I guess I need to learn how to integrate this experience into my life without letting it control me.",
    "Therapist: That's a brave goal. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. Drained. But there's also a small part of me that feels... hopeful? Like maybe, just maybe, I can work through this. It's not going to be easy, but... I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: What gives you that hope?",
    "Client: I guess... the fact that I'm here, talking about it. That's something, right? A few months ago, I couldn't even think about the attack without having a panic attack. Now, it's still hard, but... I'm doing it. And maybe that means I'm stronger than I thought. Maybe I can get through this.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I think... I think I want to keep pushing forward. Maybe we can work on more of these exposure exercises? And... and maybe I can start small, like taking short walks in the park. Baby steps, you know? I'm not ready to go camping or anything, but... I want to start reclaiming my life.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How do you feel about ending here today?",
    "Client: I feel... okay. Tired, but... good tired, if that makes sense. Like I've done something important. Thank you for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but... I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. We'll continue next session."
