    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure exercise. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the natural disaster experience?",
    "Client: Okay... It was a Category 5 hurricane. I remember the wind howling outside, and the news reports were getting more and more alarming. My wife and I were huddled in our bathroom, the only room without windows. The power had gone out hours ago, and we were sitting in the dark, listening to the portable radio.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: The noise was deafening. It sounded like a freight train was passing right over our house. We could hear things crashing outside - trees falling, debris hitting the walls. I was terrified that the roof would come off at any moment. My wife was crying, and I felt so helpless. I couldn't protect her, couldn't do anything but sit there and wait.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (voice shaking) The worst part was when water started seeping under the door. It was rising so fast. I thought we were going to drown in our own bathroom. I started having flashbacks to... to the abuse. Feeling trapped, helpless, like I couldn't breathe. It was all happening again.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. You're doing great.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay. As the water rose, I kept thinking about how I failed to protect my wife, just like I couldn't protect myself as a child. The shame and guilt were overwhelming. We were in there for hours, soaking wet, cold, and terrified. When the storm finally passed, and we opened the door, our entire house was destroyed. Everything we owned, gone. It felt like my life was washing away all over again.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. Scared. But also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I survived telling the story, just like I survived the hurricane and... and the abuse.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to talk about, but I think it's getting a little easier each time. I just wish I could shake this feeling of guilt and helplessness.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those feelings. We'll work through them.",
    "Client: I hope so. Sometimes I still wake up in the middle of the night, thinking I hear the wind or feeling the water rising. It's like my body can't forget, even when I want it to.",
    "Therapist: Your body is processing the trauma. It's part of healing.",
    "Client: I guess so. It's just... it's exhausting. And it brings back so many memories of the abuse too. Like, during the hurricane, I felt small and powerless, just like I did back then. But this time, I wasn't alone. I had my wife with me, even though I felt like I was failing her.",
    "Therapist: You weren't failing. You were both surviving.",
    "Client: (sighs) I know that logically, but it's hard to feel it. The hurricane just brought everything to the surface - all the fear, the shame, the feeling of being out of control. It's like it stripped away all my defenses and left me raw and exposed.",
    "Therapist: That exposure is helping you heal now. You're very courageous.",
    "Client: Thank you. It doesn't always feel that way, but I'm trying. I want to be able to move past this, to not let these experiences define me. I want to be strong for my wife, to be the husband she deserves.",
    "Therapist: You're already showing great strength. Let's continue next session.",
    "Client: Okay. I appreciate your support. It means a lot to have someone listen without judgment, to help me make sense of all this. I'm nervous about diving deeper, but I also feel like I'm making progress. Thank you.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
