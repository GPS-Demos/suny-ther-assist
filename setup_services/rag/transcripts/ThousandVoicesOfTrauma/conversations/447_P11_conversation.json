    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Ramirez?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving those moments in the cult... it's like I was right back there, you know? I can still feel the weight of it all.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The isolation. God, the isolation. They cut us off from everything and everyone. I remember thinking, \"This is my life now.\" It's suffocating, even just remembering it.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. How did your body react?",
    "Client: My chest felt tight, like I couldn't breathe properly. And my hands... they were shaking. I didn't even realize until now, but they're still trembling a bit.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts came up for you?",
    "Client: I kept thinking, \"Why didn't I leave sooner?\" It's... it's frustrating. I feel angry at myself for staying, for believing their lies. But then I remember how scared I was, how they threatened us if we tried to leave.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. How does it compare to your daily experiences?",
    "Client: It's... it's similar, actually. That feeling of being trapped, it's like when my chronic pain flares up. I feel helpless, like I can't escape. And the guilt... it's always there, in the background.",
    "Therapist: I see. How might this connect to your recovery goals?",
    "Client: I... I think it shows me that I need to work on forgiving myself. And maybe... maybe I need to reach out more, build connections. The isolation in the cult, it's not so different from how I've been living since... since Maria passed.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. What else?",
    "Client: I realized during the exposure that I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. I survived that. I got out. Maybe I can use that strength now, to face my fears, to... to live again.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How can you apply this moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to push myself to connect with others more. Maybe join that support group you mentioned. And... and I want to work on challenging those negative thoughts about myself.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like excellent goals. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... oddly hopeful? It's like, by facing this memory, I've reclaimed a bit of power over it. It's still painful, but... but I feel like I can handle it better now.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to delve into the sexual abuse aspect more. It's... it's terrifying, but I know it's important. And maybe we can discuss more strategies for managing my pain alongside the PTSD symptoms?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Is there anything else you'd like to share?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but... but I feel like I'm finally moving forward, you know? It's... it's a good feeling.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your courage is admirable. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm exhausted, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've done something important today. I'm... I'm actually looking forward to our next session, as scary as it might be.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive outlook. Take care, Mr. Ramirez.",
    "Client: Thank you, Doctor. I will. And... and I'll try to remember what we talked about today. About my strength, and the importance of connection. It's... it's going to be a process, but I'm ready to keep working at it."
