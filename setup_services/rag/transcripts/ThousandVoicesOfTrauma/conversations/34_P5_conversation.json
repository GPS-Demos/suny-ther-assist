    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Lee. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I suppose. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more anxiety lately, especially after our last session when you mentioned we'd be doing something called imaginal exposure.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's talk about that. What concerns you most?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about having to relive those painful experiences of being bullied because of my race. It's been years, but thinking about it still makes my heart race. I'm not sure I can handle it.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. Imaginal exposure can be challenging, but it's a powerful tool for healing. Shall I explain more?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I want to understand why we need to do this. It seems... counterintuitive to deliberately bring up painful memories.",
    "Therapist: The goal is to process the trauma in a safe environment. By facing these memories, we can reduce their power over you.",
    "Client: I see. But won't it make my anxiety worse? I've worked so hard to keep these memories at bay.",
    "Therapist: It may be uncomfortable initially, but over time, it often leads to decreased anxiety. How does that sound to you?",
    "Client: It makes sense, but I'm still scared. What if I panic during the session? Or what if I can't stop crying?",
    "Therapist: Those reactions are normal. I'll be here to support you throughout. We can pause anytime you need.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I appreciate your patience with me. It's just... being a 60-year-old woman, I sometimes feel silly still struggling with things that happened so long ago. And now, being divorced and living alone, these memories seem to creep up more often.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid, regardless of your age or life circumstances. Trauma doesn't have an expiration date.",
    "Client: Thank you for saying that. It helps to hear it. So, what exactly will we be doing in this imaginal exposure?",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit a specific memory related to your racial trauma. You'll describe it in detail, in the present tense.",
    "Client: Oh, that sounds intense. Will I have to close my eyes? I'm not sure I'd be comfortable with that.",
    "Therapist: You can keep your eyes open if you prefer. The most important thing is that you feel safe.",
    "Client: Okay, that's good to know. And you mentioned we can pause if it gets too overwhelming?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll go at your pace. Your comfort and safety are my top priorities.",
    "Client: Alright. I think I'm starting to feel a bit better about this. It's still scary, but I understand why it might be helpful. Is there anything I should do to prepare myself?",
    "Therapist: Just bring your courage, which you've already demonstrated. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. Yes, let's do this. I want to heal and move forward. Thank you for guiding me through this process.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your bravery is commendable. Shall we start with a breathing exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, that would be helpful. I can already feel my heart starting to race a bit. A breathing exercise sounds perfect right now."
