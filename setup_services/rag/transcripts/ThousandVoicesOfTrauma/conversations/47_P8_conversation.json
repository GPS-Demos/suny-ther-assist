    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing but also blank at the same time. My heart is still pounding, and I feel a bit shaky. The memory... it felt so real, like I was right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's like this cold grip around my chest. I can still hear the explosions, smell the smoke. I know I'm safe here, but my body doesn't seem to believe it. I keep thinking about my squad, wondering if they're okay, even though I know this happened years ago.",
    "Therapist: How does that fear feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a weight pressing down on me. My muscles are tense, especially in my shoulders and jaw. I notice I'm clenching my fists. There's this knot in my stomach that won't go away. I feel hyperaware of everything around me, like I'm still on high alert.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"I should have done more.\" I see their faces, my fellow soldiers. I wonder if I could have prevented some of the injuries if I had been faster, smarter, braver. And then I feel guilty for even being here, safe, when others weren't as lucky.",
    "Therapist: How do those thoughts impact your feelings?",
    "Client: They make the fear worse, but they also bring up a lot of anger. Anger at myself, at the situation, at the unfairness of it all. And then there's this deep sadness that comes in waves. It's overwhelming sometimes, like I'm drowning in these emotions.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about how you're coping with these feelings now?",
    "Client: I... I guess I'm not running away from them like I used to. Before, I'd try to numb myself with alcohol or just shut down completely. Now, it's still intense, but I'm able to sit with the feelings a bit more. It's hard, really hard, but I'm here, talking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant change. How does it feel to be able to talk about it?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of things. Part of me feels relieved, like I'm finally letting out something I've been holding in for so long. But it's also scary. Talking about it makes it real again, and sometimes I worry that if I start, I won't be able to stop. But... there's also a tiny part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe stronger? Like I'm facing this thing that's had so much power over me.",
    "Therapist: What do you think has allowed you to face these memories more directly?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's partly because I'm so tired of letting this control my life. I want to be able to sleep through the night, to not jump at every loud noise. And being here, in therapy, it feels... safer, I guess. Like I'm not alone with it anymore. It's still terrifying, but I have support now.",
    "Therapist: How does this experience compare to when you first started therapy?",
    "Client: God, it's so different. At first, I could barely talk about what happened without having a full-blown panic attack. I'd dissociate, lose chunks of time. Now, it's still intense, but I feel more... present, I guess? I can stay in the moment more, even when it's painful. And I'm starting to see that maybe, just maybe, I can get through this.",
    "Therapist: What helps you stay present during these difficult moments?",
    "Client: I try to focus on my breathing, like we've practiced. And I remind myself that I'm here, in this room, that I'm safe. Sometimes I look around and name objects I see, just to ground myself. And honestly, knowing you're here, listening without judgment... that helps a lot.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's scary, but... I think I'm ready. I want my life back, you know? I want to be able to form relationships, to not be afraid all the time. It's hard work, and sometimes I wonder if I can do it. But then I think about how far I've come already, and it gives me hope. I just... I want to feel like myself again.",
    "Therapist: What does feeling like yourself mean to you?",
    "Client: That's... that's a good question. I guess it means feeling joy again, without guilt. Being able to plan for the future without constantly looking over my shoulder. It means trusting people, forming connections. And maybe... maybe it means forgiving myself, too. That's the hardest part, I think.",
    "Therapist: How do you see that process of self-forgiveness?",
    "Client: It feels almost impossible sometimes. There's this voice in my head that keeps saying I don't deserve forgiveness, that I failed my team. But another part of me knows that's not true. I did my best in an impossible situation. I'm starting to see that maybe holding onto this guilt isn't honoring their memory... maybe moving forward, living a full life, that's how I can truly honor them.",
    "Therapist: What small step could you take towards that self-forgiveness?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe I could start by writing letters to my squad members. Not to send, just for me. To tell them how I feel, what I wish I could say. And maybe, in doing that, I can start to let go of some of this guilt. It's scary to even think about, but... I think it might help.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that idea?",
    "Client: It's... it's terrifying, honestly. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe relief? Like maybe it could be a way to finally express all these things I've been holding inside. And maybe, in getting it out, I can start to make peace with it. It won't be easy, but... I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: That's incredibly brave. We're almost out of time. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted, emotionally drained. But there's also this weird sense of... lightness? Like I've put down a heavy backpack I've been carrying. I know this is just one step, and there's still a long way to go, but... I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can do this. Thank you for being here with me through this.",
