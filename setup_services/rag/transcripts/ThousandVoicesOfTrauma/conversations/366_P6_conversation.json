    "Therapist: Alright, let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Can you tell me about the natural disaster you experienced?",
    "Client: It was a devastating hurricane that hit our coastal town five years ago. The wind was howling, and the rain was relentless. I remember watching the water rise, feeling helpless as it crept closer to our home.",
    "Therapist: I see. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10. I'm feeling a bit tense just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Please continue.",
    "Client: As the storm intensified, we heard a loud crash. A tree had fallen on our neighbor's house. I felt my heart racing, and my palms were sweating. The power went out, plunging us into darkness. I remember holding my breath, waiting for the next gust of wind, wondering if our roof would hold.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. My chest feels tight, and I'm starting to feel a bit shaky.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) The water kept rising. We could hear things floating and bumping against the house. I was terrified that we'd be swept away. The noise was deafening - wind, rain, things breaking. I felt so powerless, like nature was showing us how small and insignificant we really are.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's an 8 now. I feel like I'm back there. My heart's pounding, and I'm feeling dizzy.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here with me. You're safe. Keep going if you can.",
    "Client: (voice shaking) We spent hours in the dark, huddled together. The water eventually reached our knees inside the house. I kept thinking about all our memories, our possessions, being destroyed. When dawn finally broke, and we could see the devastation... God, it was like a war zone. Trees down everywhere, debris floating in the streets. Our home was damaged, but still standing. Others weren't so lucky.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm at a 9. I feel overwhelmed, like I can't breathe. It's all so vivid.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, it's a memory. You survived this.",
    "Client: (taking deep breaths) Yeah, you're right. We did survive. It was tough in the aftermath. No power, limited supplies. But the community came together. Neighbors helping neighbors. It was both heartbreaking and inspiring.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7. I'm still anxious, but I feel a little calmer talking about the recovery.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Keep going.",
    "Client: The cleanup took months. Every time it rained after that, I'd get anxious. But slowly, we rebuilt. Not just our homes, but our sense of security. It changed me, though. I'm more aware of how fragile life can be, how quickly things can change.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling as we wrap up? Final SUDS?",
    "Client: I'm down to a 5 now. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I've faced it again and survived.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves."
