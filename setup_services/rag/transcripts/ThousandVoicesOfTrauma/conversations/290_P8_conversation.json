    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I'm right back there, you know? I can still hear the sound of glass breaking downstairs. It's so vivid.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: My hands are clammy, and there's this tightness in my chest. I keep thinking about how helpless I felt, hiding in the closet. I was so sure they were going to find me. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What thoughts are coming up for you now?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking about how stupid I was. Why didn't I call the police right away? Why did I freeze? I should have done something, anything. And then I think about how it could happen again. What if I'm not so lucky next time? It's like I can't feel safe anywhere anymore.",
    "Therapist: How does that belief affect you day-to-day?",
    "Client: It's exhausting. I'm constantly on edge, checking locks, jumping at every little noise. I barely sleep anymore. And it's affecting my relationships too. I don't want to burden my friends with this, but I also don't want to be alone. It's like I'm stuck between wanting to isolate myself and desperately needing support.",
    "Therapist: I see. What else comes up for you?",
    "Client: I... I feel angry. Not just at the intruders, but at myself. I've always prided myself on being strong and independent, and now I feel so... vulnerable. It's like I've lost a part of myself. And I'm angry that I can't just \"get over it,\" you know? I want to move on, but I don't know how.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger manifest?",
    "Client: It comes out in weird ways. I snap at people for no reason. I've become impatient and irritable. The other day, I yelled at my coworker for something so trivial. I felt terrible afterwards. It's like I'm not in control of my emotions anymore.",
    "Therapist: Mm. What do you make of that loss of control?",
    "Client: It scares me. I've always been the one people rely on, you know? The strong one. And now, I feel like I'm falling apart. I'm afraid people will see me differently, that they'll think I'm weak or damaged. And part of me wonders if they're right.",
    "Therapist: How does that fear impact you?",
    "Client: It makes me want to withdraw. I've been canceling plans, making excuses not to see people. I'm afraid they'll see through me, see how broken I feel. But then I get lonely, and the fear gets worse when I'm alone. It's this vicious cycle I can't seem to break out of.",
    "Therapist: I hear you. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I... I feel guilty. Like I should be handling this better. My friend went through something similar a few years ago, and she seemed to bounce back so quickly. Why can't I do that? Am I just weak? And then I feel guilty for feeling guilty. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with these feelings?",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I am coping, to be honest. I try to keep busy, throw myself into work. But then I'll hear a noise or see a shadow, and I'm right back there. I've started leaving lights on all night, which I know is ridiculous, but I can't help it. I've thought about moving, but then I think, what if it happens again in a new place? I just don't know what to do.",
    "Therapist: It sounds overwhelming. What gives you hope?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. I guess the fact that I'm here, talking about it. That's something, right? And my daughter, she's been so supportive. She calls me every day, just to check in. It helps, knowing someone cares. And... and I suppose the fact that I survived. I'm still here. Maybe that means I'm stronger than I think.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it feel to acknowledge that strength?",
    "Client: It's... it's strange. Part of me wants to dismiss it, to say I just got lucky. But another part... it feels good to recognize that I did survive. I did get through it. Maybe I am stronger than I've been giving myself credit for. It doesn't fix everything, but... it's something to hold onto, I guess.",
    "Therapist: Indeed. What else comes to mind?",
    "Client: I'm thinking about the future. I know I can't go on like this forever. I want to feel safe again, to enjoy life. I miss laughing with my friends, going out without constantly looking over my shoulder. I want to be me again, you know? Not this anxious, jumpy version of myself. I just... I'm not sure how to get there.",
    "Therapist: How might you start that journey?",
    "Client: I... I suppose talking about it here is a start. Maybe... maybe I could try talking to my friends about it too. Not all at once, but gradually. And perhaps I could look into some self-defense classes? Not because I think it'll happen again, but... it might help me feel more in control. And I've been thinking about volunteering at a crisis center. Maybe helping others could help me too?",
    "Therapist: Those sound like thoughtful steps. How do you feel about them?",
    "Client: It's scary, but... also a little exciting? Like maybe there's a way forward. I know it won't be easy, and I'll probably have setbacks. But for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this. Is that... is that normal?",
    "Therapist: It's a positive sign. What else?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm starting to see that this doesn't have to define me. Yes, it happened, and yes, it changed me. But maybe not all of those changes are bad. I'm more aware of my surroundings now, which isn't always a bad thing. And I've realized how much my family and friends mean to me. Maybe I can use this experience to become stronger, more compassionate. It's a long road ahead, but... I think I'm ready to start walking it.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful perspective. How does it feel to voice that?",
    "Client: It feels... liberating, in a way. Like I'm taking back some control. Don't get me wrong, I'm still scared and anxious a lot of the time. But there's this tiny spark of hope now. And maybe that's enough to start with. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time since it happened, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I'll be okay.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I think... I think I want to focus on small steps. Maybe I'll start by having coffee with a friend this week. And I'll look into those self-defense classes we talked about. I also want to work on my sleep - maybe I'll try some relaxation techniques before bed. And... and I want to keep coming here, talking about it. It's hard, but I think it's helping. Is that... is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How do you feel about our session today?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but in a good way? Like I've let out some of the poison. It's still scary to talk about, but I feel a bit lighter. And I'm proud of myself for getting through it. I know we have more work to do, but... I think I'm ready for it. Thank you for listening, for helping me see things differently. It means more than I can say.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I feel like I have a lot to process, but in a good way. Thank you again. I... I'm actually looking forward to our next session. Is that strange?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. Take care, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. See you next week."
