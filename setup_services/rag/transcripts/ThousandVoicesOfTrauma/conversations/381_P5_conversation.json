    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. Today we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this all week. The idea of reliving that earthquake... it's terrifying. I've spent so long trying to forget it all. Why do we have to do this?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. Imaginal exposure helps process trauma. Ready to learn more?",
    "Client: I guess so. But I'm not sure I can handle it. What if I have a panic attack? Or what if it makes everything worse? I've been managing okay lately, and I'm worried this might set me back.",
    "Therapist: Those are common worries. We'll go at your pace. How about I explain the process?",
    "Client: Okay, that might help. I just... I'm really scared. I've never talked about this in detail before. Not even to my closest friends. It's like opening Pandora's box, you know?",
    "Therapist: Understandable. Facing trauma is courageous. Shall we discuss the benefits?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I need to understand why this is necessary. Because right now, it just feels like unnecessary pain.",
    "Therapist: It helps reduce PTSD symptoms by processing memories. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Well, how exactly does it work? Do I just... start talking about what happened? And what if I can't remember everything clearly? Some parts are vivid, but others are just a blur.",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the experience in present tense. Gaps are normal. Ready for more details?",
    "Client: I think so. It's just... the idea of putting myself back there... I can already feel my heart racing. Will you be there the whole time? What if it gets too overwhelming?",
    "Therapist: I'll be here throughout. We can pause anytime. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's a relief. I guess knowing I can stop if needed helps. But what about afterwards? I'm worried I'll be a mess and won't be able to function.",
    "Therapist: We'll debrief and use grounding techniques. How about we practice one now?",
    "Client: Yes, please. That would be helpful. I've been using some breathing exercises at home, but sometimes they're not enough when the memories hit hard.",
    "Therapist: Let's try a quick grounding exercise. Focus on five things you see.",
    "Client: Okay... I see your plant in the corner, the blue painting on the wall, my shoes, the tissue box, and the clock. That does help a bit. My heart rate's slowing down.",
    "Therapist: Great job. We'll use similar techniques during our session. Any other concerns?",
    "Client: I guess I'm worried about how this will affect my studies and my roommates. Will I be able to focus after these sessions? And what if I have nightmares?",
    "Therapist: Valid concerns. We'll discuss coping strategies. Shall we set some goals?",
    "Client: Goals might help, yes. I want to be able to think about the earthquake without panicking. And maybe... maybe to stop feeling so guilty about surviving when others didn't.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent goals. Imaginal exposure can help address both. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm still scared, but I trust you. And if this can help me move forward and maybe even help me with my substance use... I'm willing to try. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Remember, we're in this together. Shall we start?",
    "Client: Yes, let's start. I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Thank you for being so patient with me. It means a lot to have someone I can trust guiding me through this."
