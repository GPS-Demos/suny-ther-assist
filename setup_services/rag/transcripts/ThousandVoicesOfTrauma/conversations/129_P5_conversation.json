    "Therapist: Good morning, Mr. Johnson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Oh, hello Dr. Carter. I'm... well, I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. The folks at the assisted living home reminded me about our session today, and I've been on edge ever since. My anxiety's been acting up something fierce.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll be discussing imaginal exposure. Are you familiar with it?",
    "Client: Not really, no. Is it... is it going to be difficult? I'm not sure I'm up for anything too challenging at my age.",
    "Therapist: It can be emotionally intense, but I'll guide you through it. Shall I explain more?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I'd like to know what I'm getting myself into. Ever since that dog attack in the park last year, I've been struggling to feel safe. It's why I moved into assisted living, you know. I just couldn't manage on my own anymore with all this fear.",
    "Therapist: Imaginal exposure involves revisiting the traumatic memory in a safe environment. How does that sound to you?",
    "Client: Revisit it? Oh my... I don't know if I can do that. Just thinking about those snapping jaws and those terrible growls... it makes my heart race. Are you sure this is necessary?",
    "Therapist: It's a proven method for reducing PTSD symptoms. Would you like to hear how it might help you?",
    "Client: I suppose so. But I'm still not sure about this. It's hard enough dealing with these memories when they pop up uninvited. To purposely think about them... well, that seems like torture.",
    "Therapist: I understand your hesitation. The goal is to process the memory and reduce its power over you. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Well, what exactly will I have to do? And what if I panic? I'm not as young as I used to be, you know. My heart can't take too much stress.",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the memory while I guide you. We can stop anytime. How does that sound?",
    "Client: I suppose that's a bit of a relief. Knowing we can stop if it gets too much. But still, the idea of willingly putting myself through this... it's daunting. I've spent so long trying to avoid thinking about that day. The way that dog came out of nowhere, the pain, the helplessness... it's all so vivid still.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. This process takes courage. How can I support you today?",
    "Client: I appreciate that, Dr. Carter. I guess... maybe just be patient with me? And perhaps remind me that I'm safe here if I start to get too worked up? It's hard to remember sometimes that I'm not back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'll be here with you every step. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. As ready as I'll ever be, I suppose. It's strange, you know. I've faced a lot in my 74 years - losing my wife, retiring, moving into assisted living. But this... this feels like one of the hardest things I've had to do. But if you think it'll help, I'll give it my best shot.",
    "Therapist: Your bravery is commendable. Let's start slowly. Remember, you're in control here.",
    "Client: Okay. I'll try to remember that. It's just... it's been so long since I've felt in control of anything, especially when it comes to these memories. But I trust you, Dr. Carter. And I want to get better. I want to be able to go for walks again without constantly looking over my shoulder. I want to be able to play with my grandkids without flinching at every sudden movement. So... I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Where do we start?",
    "Therapist: We'll begin with a relaxation exercise. Then, when you're ready, describe the memory."
