    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I'm... I don't know. A mix of things, I guess. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is terrified. My stomach's in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to help you process this at your own pace. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yeah, let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm walking home from the library. It's late, maybe 10 PM. The streetlights are on, casting this weird orange glow. I can hear my footsteps echoing off the buildings.",
    "Therapist: Good. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: There's a chill in the air. I'm hugging my books to my chest, walking faster than usual. I keep looking over my shoulder because I feel... I don't know, watched or something.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Um, maybe a 40? I'm tense, but okay.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what happens next.",
    "Client: I turn the corner onto my street, and that's when I see the police car. It's just... sitting there, engine running. I try to act normal, but my heart starts racing. As I get closer, the door opens and an officer steps out.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm thinking, \"Don't look suspicious. Just keep walking.\" But my legs feel heavy, like I'm moving through molasses. The officer calls out, \"Hey, you! Stop right there!\" And I... I freeze.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's higher... maybe 60? My palms are sweating just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: The officer approaches me. He's tall, intimidating. I can smell the leather of his uniform. He asks for my ID, and I fumble with my bag. My hands are shaking so much I can barely get my wallet out.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: He takes my ID, looks at it, then back at me. His eyes... they're cold. He starts asking questions: where I'm coming from, where I'm going. I try to answer, but my voice comes out all squeaky and weak.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. I can feel my heart pounding. It's hard to breathe.",
    "Therapist: Let's take a moment. Focus on your breath. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... okay.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: The officer, he... he suddenly grabs my arm. Hard. Says I'm acting suspicious. I try to pull away, tell him he's hurting me, but he just grips tighter. I drop my books, papers scatter everywhere.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 80 now. God, I can almost feel his hand on me.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Sarah. Remember, this is a memory. You're in control.",
    "Client: Right, right. Um... He starts to pull me towards the car. I'm begging him to let me go, trying to explain I'm just a student. But he's not listening. He slams me against the hood of the car.",
    "Therapist: What do you see? Hear?",
    "Client: I see the reflection of the streetlights on the car's surface. I hear my own desperate voice, pleading. And then... and then I hear the click of handcuffs.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. How does your body feel?",
    "Client: It hurts. My chest is pressed against the cold metal. I can't breathe. I'm crying now, mascara running down my face. I keep saying, \"Please, I didn't do anything wrong.\"",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he starts patting me down. Roughly. His hands... *voice breaks* His hands are everywhere. I feel so violated, so helpless. I'm sobbing, can barely catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe with me. In... and out.",
    "Client: *shaky breath* Okay... okay.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's at 90. I feel sick.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. This is just a memory. You're in control.",
    "Client: Right. I'm... I'm trying to remember that. Um... Another officer arrives. They're talking, but I can't make out what they're saying over the sound of my own crying. Finally, the first officer uncuffs me.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel in that moment?",
    "Client: Relieved, but also... angry. Humiliated. They tell me I \"fit the description\" of someone they were looking for. No apology, nothing. Just, \"You're free to go.\"",
    "Therapist: What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I gather my scattered books and papers. My hands are shaking so badly I can barely hold onto them. I stumble away, not even looking back. I just want to get home.",
    "Therapist: And then?",
    "Client: I make it to my apartment. I slam the door, slide down to the floor, and just... break down. I'm sobbing, hyperventilating. I feel so... so violated, so powerless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Sarah. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's still high... maybe 85? My heart's racing.",
    "Therapist: Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you name five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: Um... the blue chair, the plant by the window, your desk lamp, the clock on the wall, and the painting of the ocean.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, four things you can touch.",
    "Client: The couch cushion, my jeans, my hair, and... the bracelet on my wrist.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Three things you hear?",
    "Client: The ticking of the clock, cars outside, and the hum of the air conditioner.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Two things you smell?",
    "Client: Your lavender air freshener and... coffee, I think?",
    "Therapist: And finally, one thing you can taste?",
    "Client: The mint from the gum I was chewing earlier.",
    "Therapist: Wonderful job, Sarah. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: A bit better. My heart's not racing as much. Maybe... maybe a 70 on the distress scale?",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. Can you tell me what thoughts or feelings are coming up for you now?",
    "Client: I just... I feel so angry. And scared. I keep thinking about how easily it could have gone worse. What if they had arrested me? What if... what if they had hurt me more? I don't feel safe anymore.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid feelings. Let's explore them.",
    "Client: It's like... I used to trust that if I followed the rules, I'd be okay. But now? I'm always looking over my shoulder. I'm terrified every time I see a police car. I feel like I can't trust anyone in authority.",
    "Therapist: How has this experience changed your daily life?",
    "Client: I don't go out at night anymore. I've missed classes because sometimes I just can't bring myself to leave my apartment. I'm jumpier, always on edge. It's affecting my grades, my relationships... everything.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really challenging. How do you cope?",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I am coping, really. I try to distract myself with studying, but then I'll have a flashback and lose hours just... staring at the wall, reliving it. Sometimes I drink to numb myself, which I know isn't healthy, but... I don't know what else to do.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. We'll work on healthier coping strategies.",
    "Client: I just... I want to feel normal again. I want to be able to walk down the street without feeling like I'm going to have a panic attack. Is that... is that possible?",
    "Therapist: It is possible, Sarah. It takes time, but we'll work towards that goal together.",
    "Client: I hope so. Because right now, it feels like this fear and anger are eating me alive. I'm tired of feeling like a victim.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. We'll work on processing them constructively.",
    "Client: Okay. I... I think I'm ready to stop for today. This was... a lot.",
    "Therapist: You did incredibly well, Sarah. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. Emotional. But also... maybe a little relieved? Like I've let out some of the poison.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. What's your final distress level?",
    "Client: I'd say... maybe a 50? I'm calmer, but still shaky.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I am. A little bit, at least.",
    "Therapist: We'll end here for today. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you... for listening, for helping me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Sarah. I'll see you next week."
