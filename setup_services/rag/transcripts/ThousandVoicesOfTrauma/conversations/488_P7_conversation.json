    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Abdel. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit anxious, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about the earthquake again, and it's not easy for me.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's just... every time I think about it, my heart starts racing. The ground shaking, the sounds of buildings crumbling... it's all so vivid.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take your time.",
    "Client: I remember waking up to the violent shaking. At first, I thought I was dreaming, but then I heard the crashing sounds. My bed was moving, and I could hear people screaming outside. I froze for a moment, unable to move.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that memory. You're safe now.",
    "Client: The power went out, and everything was pitch black. I fumbled for my phone to use as a light, but my hands were shaking so much I could barely hold it. I kept thinking, \"This is it. This is how I die.\"",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I managed to get out of bed and stumbled towards the door. The floor felt like it was moving under my feet. I could hear things falling and breaking all around me. When I got to the hallway, I saw my neighbors also trying to escape. We were all in shock, just trying to make it out alive.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My heart is pounding, and I feel a bit dizzy. It's like I'm back there again. I can almost smell the dust and feel the fear.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: Okay... *takes a deep breath* As we made it outside, the ground was still shaking. I saw buildings collapsing in the distance, and there was so much dust in the air. People were crying, calling out for their loved ones. I felt so helpless and alone.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: In the days that followed, it was chaos. No electricity, limited food and water. The aftershocks kept coming, and each one brought back that terror. I couldn't sleep, always afraid another big one would hit. It's been years, but sometimes I still wake up in a panic, thinking it's happening again.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You survived something traumatic.",
    "Client: I did survive, but sometimes I feel guilty about that. Why me? Why did I make it when others didn't? And now, with all this cyberbullying... it's like I can't escape trauma, even in the digital world.",
    "Therapist: You're not alone in those feelings. Can you tell me more about the cyberbullying?",
    "Client: It started a few months ago. Someone found out about my past and started posting cruel comments online. They said I was lying about the earthquake for attention, that I should have died instead of others. It brings back all those feelings of helplessness and fear.",
    "Therapist: That must be incredibly difficult. How are you coping?",
    "Client: Not well, to be honest. I've been avoiding social media, but it's affecting my business. I feel trapped, just like I did during the earthquake. I can't escape it, and I don't know how to make it stop.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's just... the earthquake was a natural disaster. I could understand it, even if it was terrifying. But this cyberbullying... it's deliberate cruelty. How can people be so heartless?",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. People can be cruel, especially online.",
    "Client: I know, but it still hurts. Sometimes I wonder if there's something wrong with me, why I keep experiencing these traumatic events. First the earthquake, now this. It's like I can't catch a break.",
    "Therapist: You're not to blame. These are external events.",
    "Client: I try to tell myself that, but it's hard. The bullying brings back all those feelings of helplessness and fear from the earthquake. I find myself constantly on edge, waiting for the next attack, just like I was waiting for the next aftershock.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great strength by talking about this.",
    "Client: Thank you. It helps to talk about it, even though it's painful. Sometimes I feel like I'm back in that moment, with everything crumbling around me. Only now, instead of buildings, it's my sense of safety and self-worth that's being shaken.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful analogy. How does it make you feel?",
    "Client: Scared, angry, and sad. I survived a natural disaster, but now I'm being torn down by other people's words. It makes me question everything - my experiences, my memories, even my right to have survived.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. We'll work on coping strategies.",
    "Client: I hope so. I want to feel strong again, like I did when I made it through the earthquake. But right now, I feel so vulnerable and exposed. Every notification on my phone makes me flinch, wondering if it's another attack.",
    "Therapist: You've shown resilience before. We'll build on that.",
    "Client: I want to believe that. It's just... the earthquake was a one-time event. This cyberbullying feels never-ending. How do I find closure when it keeps happening?",
    "Therapist: That's a great question. Let's explore that next session.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you for listening. It helps to talk about it, even though it's difficult. I feel a bit lighter, somehow.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad. Remember, you're not alone in this journey.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'll try to hold onto that thought. It's comforting to know I have support, even when things feel overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive outlook. We'll end here for today."
