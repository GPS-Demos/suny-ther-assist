    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Ahmed?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving those moments in the cult, especially the day I found out about my wife's passing... it's like reopening an old wound. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? It's hard to explain.",
    "Therapist: Mm. What stood out to you?",
    "Client: The guilt, I think. I keep wondering if I could have done something differently, you know? If I hadn't been so caught up in the cult's teachings, maybe I would have noticed her health declining. It's... it's hard not to blame myself.",
    "Therapist: How did that feeling of guilt show up during the exposure?",
    "Client: It was like a weight on my chest. I could feel it physically, pressing down on me. And there was this voice in my head, just repeating over and over, \"You should have known. You should have done something.\" It's exhausting, carrying that around all the time.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does this connect to your day-to-day experiences?",
    "Client: Well, I... I guess I've been avoiding a lot of things that remind me of her or the cult. I haven't been able to look at old photos or visit places we used to go together. And I've been isolating myself more, afraid to get close to people in case I... in case I fail them too.",
    "Therapist: Mm. What did you learn from today's session?",
    "Client: I... I realized that maybe I've been too hard on myself. When I was describing what happened, I could hear how manipulated we all were by the cult. It wasn't just me. And... and maybe my wife's passing wasn't something I could have prevented, no matter what I did. It's... it's a strange thought. I'm not sure how to feel about it.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. How might this change things for you?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe I could try to be a little kinder to myself? And perhaps... perhaps it's time I started reconnecting with some old friends. I've been pushing everyone away for so long, but maybe that's not the answer. It's scary to think about, but... but maybe it's time.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a positive step. How can you support yourself in this?",
    "Client: I... I could start small, I suppose. Maybe call my old friend, Rashid. We used to meet for coffee every week. I've been avoiding his calls, but... but maybe I could reach out. And I could try looking at one old photo, just to see how it feels. It's terrifying, but... but maybe it's time to try.",
    "Therapist: Good. How do you feel about continuing these exposures?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. Really hard. But I think it's helping. I feel like I'm starting to understand things better, even if it's painful. I... I want to keep going. I want to find a way to live with this grief without letting it control me. So... so yes, I want to continue.",
    "Therapist: That's courageous. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I... I think I'd like to explore more about the day I decided to leave the cult. It's all tangled up with my grief, but... but I think there might be some strength there too. Maybe understanding that decision better could help me move forward now.",
    "Therapist: Alright. We'll work on that. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but... but I feel like I'm finally starting to see a path forward. It's dim and scary, but... but it's there. And that means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, Ahmed."
