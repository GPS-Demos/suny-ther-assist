    "Therapist: Good morning, Mr. Singh. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Good morning, doctor. I'm feeling a bit anxious, to be honest. This weather reminds me of that terrible day...",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll focus on imaginal exposure. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Imaginal exposure? I'm not sure what that means. Can you explain it to me? I'm already feeling uneasy just thinking about the disaster.",
    "Therapist: Of course. It's a technique to process traumatic memories. We'll revisit the event safely.",
    "Client: Revisit it? I've spent years trying to forget! Won't that make things worse? I'm worried about losing control of my emotions.",
    "Therapist: Your concern is valid. This approach actually helps reduce symptoms over time. How do you feel about trying?",
    "Client: I'm scared, but I trust you. I've been struggling with nightmares and flashbacks for so long. If this can help, I'm willing to give it a shot. What exactly will we be doing?",
    "Therapist: We'll start slowly. You'll describe the event while I guide you. We can pause anytime. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It sounds challenging, but I appreciate your support. I've been carrying this burden for years, affecting my work and marriage. Will this really help me move forward?",
    "Therapist: Many find it beneficial. Your courage is commendable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Alright, I'm ready. But please, if I start to feel overwhelmed, can we stop? The memories are so vivid, sometimes it feels like I'm right back there in the middle of the chaos.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Your comfort is priority. Let's start when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm taking a deep breath. Where should I begin? The day started like any other, but then the ground began to shake...",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue at your own pace. Remember, you're safe here."
