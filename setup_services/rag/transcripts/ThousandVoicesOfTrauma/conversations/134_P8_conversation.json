    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. My heart's still racing, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's like I'm right back there in that moment, you know? The screeching tires, the smell of burning rubber... it's all so vivid.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how close I came to... to not making it. There's this voice in my head saying, \"You could have died.\" And then I start wondering, what if I had? What would happen to my partner, my family? It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does your body feel as you have these thoughts?",
    "Client: My muscles are tense, especially in my shoulders and neck. I notice I'm clenching my jaw too. There's this knot in my stomach that won't go away. It's like my body is still bracing for impact, even though I know I'm safe here.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are coming up for you?",
    "Client: Fear, definitely. A lot of fear. But also... anger? Yeah, I'm angry. Angry at the other driver for not paying attention. Angry at myself for not being more vigilant. And there's this underlying sadness too, like mourning for the sense of safety I used to have.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to right after the accident?",
    "Client: They're... they're not as intense now. Right after the accident, I was in shock. I couldn't process anything. Now, it's like I can actually feel the emotions. It's uncomfortable, but somehow it feels... I don't know, maybe healthier? Like I'm actually dealing with it instead of just being numb.",
    "Therapist: What's different about experiencing these emotions now?",
    "Client: Well, for one thing, I'm actually acknowledging them. Before, I tried to push everything down, pretend I was fine. But now, even though it's hard, I'm letting myself feel. And... and I'm here, talking about it. That's huge for me. I've always been the type to handle things on my own, you know?",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to be sharing this experience?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of things. Part of me feels vulnerable, exposed. But there's also this sense of... relief? Like I'm not carrying this burden alone anymore. And maybe... maybe a little proud of myself for facing this head-on.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your breathing now?",
    "Client: Oh, wow. I didn't even realize... it's slower now. More steady. When we started, I was practically panting. Now it's... it's calmer. My chest doesn't feel as tight either.",
    "Therapist: How might this experience impact your daily life?",
    "Client: I think... I think it might help me feel more in control. Like, if I can face this memory here, maybe I can handle those moments when I get anxious on the road. And maybe I'll be more open with my partner about what I'm going through. I've been keeping a lot from them, trying to be strong.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you consider being more open?",
    "Client: There's some fear there. What if they think I'm weak? Or what if it's too much for them to handle? But... but there's also hope. Maybe sharing this will bring us closer. Maybe they can help me through this in ways I haven't let them before.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your experiences with emotional abuse?",
    "Client: I... I never thought about that connection before. But I guess... in both situations, I felt powerless. Like things were happening to me that I couldn't control. And in both cases, I've tried to handle it all on my own, to appear strong. Maybe that's not serving me anymore.",
    "Therapist: What feels different now compared to when you first came in?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel more present. Like I'm actually here in my body, not just floating through life. And there's this small spark of... I don't know, maybe hope? Like maybe I can get through this, maybe I can feel safe again. It's scary, but also... exciting?",
    "Therapist: What do you want to remember from today's session?",
    "Client: I want to remember that I can face these memories and come out okay on the other side. That feeling them doesn't make them worse, it actually helps. And... and that it's okay to let others in, to not always be the strong one. That vulnerability can be a strength too.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but in a good way? Like after a really intense workout. There's this sense of accomplishment mixed with exhaustion. And a bit of nervousness about what comes next, but also... readiness? Yeah, I think I'm ready to keep working on this.",
    "Therapist: What will you do to take care of yourself for the rest of the day?",
    "Client: I think I'll take a long walk in the park near my house. Being in nature always helps ground me. And maybe I'll call my partner, let them know how the session went. Not all the details, but... just open up a bit. Oh, and definitely some chamomile tea before bed. I have a feeling I'll need some extra help relaxing tonight.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. We'll continue next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. This was... intense, but I'm glad we did it. I feel like I've taken a big step today. It's scary, but also... hopeful. I'm looking forward to seeing where this leads."
