    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the natural disaster you experienced?",
    "Client: It was a terrible flood that hit our village in Ghana. I remember waking up in the middle of the night to the sound of rushing water. At first, I thought it was just heavy rain, but then I heard screaming from outside.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: I rushed to wake up my husband and children. The water was already seeping under our door. We grabbed what we could and tried to leave, but when we opened the door, the force of the water almost knocked us over. It was so dark, and the water was rising so fast.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What were you feeling?",
    "Client: I was terrified. My heart was pounding so hard I could hear it over the roar of the water. I held onto my youngest child so tightly, afraid the current would sweep her away. The water was so cold, and I could feel things bumping against my legs as we waded through.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: We managed to get to higher ground, but so many others weren't as lucky. I saw houses collapsing, people screaming for help. There was a woman clinging to a tree with her baby, and I couldn't do anything to help her. I felt so helpless.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The sound of the water and the screams... it still haunts me. We spent hours on that hill, watching as our village was destroyed. Everything we had worked for, gone in a single night. When dawn finally came, the devastation was... (voice breaks) I'm sorry, this is still so hard to talk about.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: Thank you. (deep breath) The village was unrecognizable. Mud and debris everywhere. Bodies... there were bodies. People we knew, our neighbors. The smell was awful. We lost everything, but we were alive. So many others weren't as fortunate.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's overwhelming. My heart is racing, and I feel like I'm back there. But... I also feel a bit lighter, like talking about it is helping somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. You're doing excellent work.",
    "Client: The aftermath was almost as bad as the flood itself. The lack of clean water, food shortages, disease... We had to rebuild everything from scratch. It took years to feel safe again, to not panic every time it rained heavily.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible resilience. How did you cope during that time?",
    "Client: We relied on each other. Our community came together in ways I never expected. We shared what little we had, helped each other rebuild. It was hard, but it also showed me how strong we could be when united.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. You've come so far.",
    "Client: Yes, I suppose I have. But sometimes, especially during storm season, I still get so anxious. I check the weather constantly, and any heavy rain sends me into a panic. I know it's irrational, but I can't help it.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are understandable. We'll work on managing them.",
    "Client: I hope so. I want to be able to enjoy rainy days again, to not feel this constant fear. It's exhausting always being on edge, always waiting for the next disaster.",
    "Therapist: Your awareness is the first step. We'll get there together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I really appreciate your support. It's not easy talking about this, but I do feel it's helping. Each time we discuss it, it becomes a little less overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're making great progress. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel drained, but also a bit relieved. It's like I've been carrying this weight for so long, and now I'm finally starting to put it down. It's still there, but it's getting lighter.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent way to describe it. Well done today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I know we still have a long way to go, but for the first time in years, I feel hopeful that I can overcome this. That I won't always be defined by that terrible night.",
    "Therapist: That hope is crucial. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: I am. It's not easy facing these memories, but I'm determined to work through them. I want to be free from this fear, for myself and for my family.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is admirable. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. This session was intense, but I'm glad we did it. Thank you for your guidance and support.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care of yourself this week."
