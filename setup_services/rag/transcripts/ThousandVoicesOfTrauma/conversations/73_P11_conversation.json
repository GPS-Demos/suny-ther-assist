    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. The memory of that workplace incident feels so vivid now. I can still hear my supervisor's harsh words, see the disappointment on my colleagues' faces. It's like I'm right back there, you know?",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The overwhelming sense of shame, I think. It's like this heavy weight pressing down on my chest. I keep replaying the moment when my project failed, and everyone just... stared. God, I felt so small, so insignificant.",
    "Therapist: How does that feeling connect to your daily life now?",
    "Client: It's... it's everywhere. I second-guess every decision at work. I'm constantly on edge, waiting for the next failure. Even at home, I find myself withdrawing from my family, afraid I'll disappoint them too. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: I hear you. How did it feel to confront that memory today?",
    "Client: Terrifying, honestly. But also... I don't know, maybe a little empowering? Like, I survived it once, and I survived reliving it just now. That's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What do you make of that realization?",
    "Client: I guess it shows I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. Maybe... maybe I can handle more than I think. It's just hard to believe that sometimes when the anxiety hits.",
    "Therapist: How might this insight impact your recovery goals?",
    "Client: Well, I've been avoiding certain tasks at work, afraid of messing up. But if I can face this memory, maybe I can start tackling those tasks bit by bit. It's scary, but... I want to try.",
    "Therapist: That's a great connection. What support do you need?",
    "Client: I think... maybe some strategies for managing the anxiety when it spikes? And... and maybe some help in rebuilding my confidence? It's been so long since I felt sure of myself.",
    "Therapist: We can definitely work on that. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, but... okay. Like I've climbed a mountain or something. There's this weird mix of exhaustion and accomplishment. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Many clients report similar feelings. What else?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm proud of myself, I think. For facing this. It's not easy, and there were moments I wanted to stop. But I didn't. That means something, doesn't it?",
    "Therapist: It certainly does. How will you care for yourself today?",
    "Client: I think I'll take a long bath when I get home. Maybe listen to some calming music. And... I might tell my partner about this session. They've been so supportive, and I want to share this progress.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For guiding me through this. It's tough, but I feel like I'm finally moving forward instead of being stuck in that moment. There's still a long way to go, but... I think I can do this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. See you next week?",
    "Client: Definitely. I'll be here. Thanks again."
