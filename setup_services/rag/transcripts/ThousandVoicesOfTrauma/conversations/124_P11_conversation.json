    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Chen?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving those moments in the cult, especially the day I found out about my brother's death... it's bringing up a lot of emotions I've tried to bury for years.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The guilt, I think. I keep replaying the last conversation I had with my brother before he... before he died. I was so angry at him for not leaving the cult with me. I said some terrible things. And now... now I can never take them back.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... painful. But also, in a strange way, somewhat liberating? I've avoided thinking about it for so long, but facing it head-on... it's like I'm finally allowing myself to grieve.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. How does this connect to your daily life?",
    "Client: I realize now that I've been carrying this weight around constantly. It's affected my relationships, my work... I'm always on edge, waiting for the next bad thing to happen. I push people away because I'm afraid of losing them too.",
    "Therapist: I see. What insights have you gained from this process?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to forgive myself. My brother's death wasn't my fault. The cult manipulated both of us, and I was just trying to protect him in my own way. It's time I stop punishing myself for something I couldn't control.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How might this change things for you?",
    "Client: Maybe I can start opening up more to my wife. She's been so patient with me, but I've kept her at arm's length. And at work, I might be able to focus better if I'm not constantly replaying these memories in my head.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like positive steps. What else?",
    "Client: I... I think I want to honor my brother's memory in a healthier way. Maybe volunteer at a cult awareness organization or something. Turn this pain into something constructive, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a wonderful idea. How are you feeling about continuing with the therapy?",
    "Client: It's tough, really tough. But for the first time in years, I feel like there's hope. Like maybe I can actually move past this and have a life that isn't dominated by what happened.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. What's your takeaway from today's session?",
    "Client: That facing my fears head-on, as terrifying as it is, is the only way I'm going to heal. And that... that it's okay to feel all these emotions. They're part of the process, not something I need to run from anymore.",
    "Therapist: Excellent insight. How will you care for yourself this week?",
    "Client: I think I'll try that mindfulness exercise you taught me. And maybe... maybe I'll finally take my wife up on her offer to visit that support group for trauma survivors. I've been avoiding it, but I think I'm ready now.",
    "Therapist: Those are great self-care strategies. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For guiding me through this. I know we have a long way to go, but for the first time in a long time, I feel like I might actually be able to get through this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredible work, Mr. Chen. See you next week?",
    "Client: Definitely. I'll be here."
