    "Therapist: Welcome back. Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm honestly quite nervous. I've been dreading this all week. The idea of revisiting those cult experiences... it's overwhelming. I'm not sure I can handle it.",
    "Therapist: Your apprehension is understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I've worked so hard to put those memories behind me. I'm afraid that bringing them up will undo all the progress I've made. Plus, I'm worried about how I'll react. What if I completely fall apart?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How might we address them?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. I guess I need to know that I'll be safe and that this won't make things worse. Can you explain why we're doing this and how it's supposed to help?",
    "Therapist: Certainly. Imaginal exposure helps process traumatic memories. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: I understand the theory, but it still feels scary. How will this be different from just remembering on my own? And what happens if I get too overwhelmed during the process?",
    "Therapist: Great questions. We'll guide you through safely. What coping strategies have helped you before?",
    "Client: Deep breathing has been helpful, and sometimes grounding exercises. But I'm not sure if that'll be enough for this. It feels like I'm about to jump off a cliff without knowing what's at the bottom.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent tools. We'll use them today. What else might help you feel more secure?",
    "Client: Maybe if we had a safe word or signal I could use if things get too intense? And... I know this might sound silly, but could I hold onto something comforting, like a stress ball or a small plush toy?",
    "Therapist: Not silly at all. Both are great ideas. Anything else you need?",
    "Client: I think that helps. I'm still nervous, but I feel a bit more prepared now. Can you walk me through exactly what we'll be doing?",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll start with relaxation, then you'll describe the memory. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm trying to remind myself that this is important for my healing. It's just... confronting these memories feels like I'm betraying my former self, the one who was so devoted to the cult. There's still a part of me that feels guilty for leaving, even though I know it was the right thing to do.",
    "Therapist: That internal conflict is common. How can we honor that part of you today?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe we could acknowledge that my involvement in the cult came from a place of seeking belonging and purpose? Even if it turned out to be harmful, my intentions were genuine. Is it okay to hold space for that?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll approach this with compassion. Shall we start our relaxation exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm ready. Thank you for being so patient and understanding. I know this process isn't easy, but I'm grateful to have your support through it. Let's begin.",
    "Therapist: You're very welcome. Take a deep breath, and let's start..."
