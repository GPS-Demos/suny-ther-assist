    "Therapist: Welcome, Rahul. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. Talking about the cyclone... it still feels raw, you know? But I'm here, and I want to work through this.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's start with a SUDS rating. How would you rate your distress from 0 to 100?",
    "Client: Uh, probably around a 60 right now. My heart's already beating faster just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Remember, we're here to help you process this. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see the sky. It's this sickly, greenish-gray color. The wind is picking up, and I can hear it howling around the corners of our house. My parents are rushing around, trying to secure everything. I'm standing by the window, and I can see the trees bending at impossible angles.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... God, I'm feeling terrified. My hands are shaking, and there's this pit in my stomach. I want to help, but I'm frozen. I can't move.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Take a deep breath. What happens next?",
    "Client: The... the rain starts. It's not just rain, it's like sheets of water slamming against the house. The noise is deafening. I can barely hear my mother shouting at me to move away from the window. But I can't. I'm... I'm transfixed.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"This is it. We're not going to survive this.\" I'm... I'm remembering all the times my father belittled me, told me I wasn't strong enough. And now, when it really matters, I can't even move to help.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's happening in your body?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, like I can't breathe properly. My legs are weak, and I'm... I'm shaking all over. I feel so useless, so... pathetic.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe now. Take a moment to ground yourself. What do you notice around you?",
    "Client: I... I can feel the chair I'm sitting on. It's solid. I can hear the hum of the air conditioner. I'm... I'm here, in your office. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, let's go back. What happens as the storm intensifies?",
    "Client: The wind... it's getting stronger. There's a horrible cracking sound, and I see our neighbor's roof just... just peel off like it's made of paper. Debris is flying everywhere. I hear my mother scream, and that finally snaps me out of it. I turn and run to the bathroom where they're huddled.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? Give me a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 75 now. My heart's racing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going. What happens in the bathroom?",
    "Client: We're all crammed in there. My father's holding the door shut, and I can see the fear in his eyes. That... that scares me more than anything. He's always been this... this pillar of strength, you know? But now he looks terrified. My mother's praying, and I'm... I'm just sitting there, useless.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in that moment?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... I'm thinking that if we die here, the last thing my father will remember is how disappointed he is in me. How I couldn't even help when it mattered most. I'm... I'm feeling like such a failure.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What does it tell you about yourself?",
    "Client: It... it tells me that I'm weak. That I'm not the son my father wanted. That when push comes to shove, I can't be relied upon. God, it hurts to admit that.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, these are thoughts, not facts. What happens next?",
    "Client: The storm... it feels like it goes on forever. The house is shaking, and we can hear things breaking. At some point, water starts seeping under the door. My mother's crying, and I... I finally snap out of it. I start using towels to block the water. It's not much, but it's something.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix. Part of me feels a tiny bit better for doing something, anything. But another part feels like it's too little, too late. Like I should have been helping from the start.",
    "Therapist: I see. What happens as the storm begins to subside?",
    "Client: Slowly, the wind dies down. The rain lessens. We... we don't move for a long time. When we finally do, and we open the bathroom door... God, it's like a war zone. There's water everywhere, broken glass, parts of the roof are just... gone.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling as you survey the damage?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel numb at first. Then this overwhelming sense of guilt washes over me. If I had helped from the beginning, maybe we could have saved more. Maybe... maybe my father wouldn't be looking at me with that mix of disappointment and relief.",
    "Therapist: Can you give me another SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 80 now. Remembering that look on his face... it's almost worse than the storm itself.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Let's stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: We... we start to clean up. It's automatic, robotic almost. No one's talking much. I keep trying to catch my father's eye, to show him I'm helping now, but he's focused on assessing the damage. My mother's crying softly as she picks up broken photo frames.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind as you're cleaning?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... I keep thinking that I've let everyone down. That if I had been stronger, braver, we might have been better prepared. I'm... I'm angry at myself. And I'm scared that this has just confirmed everything my father's ever thought about me.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel right now, remembering this?",
    "Client: My shoulders are tense. I feel... I feel small, like I'm shrinking into myself. There's this heaviness in my chest that won't go away.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to acknowledge those feelings. They're valid, but they don't define you. What happens in the days following the cyclone?",
    "Client: It's... it's a blur of cleanup and repair. The whole neighborhood is a mess. People are helping each other, and I throw myself into the work. I'm trying so hard to prove myself, to make up for freezing during the storm. But it feels like too little, too late.",
    "Therapist: How does your father react to your efforts?",
    "Client: He... he doesn't say much. There's a moment, when we're clearing debris from the yard, where he puts his hand on my shoulder. It's brief, but it's... it's something. I want to talk to him, to apologize, but the words don't come.",
    "Therapist: What would you have said if you could?",
    "Client: I... I would have told him I'm sorry. That I was scared, but that I want to be stronger. That I want to be someone he can rely on. But... but part of me is also angry. Angry that his disappointment in me made the whole experience so much worse.",
    "Therapist: That's a complex mix of emotions. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. I'm sad, angry, ashamed... but there's also this tiny part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe a bit lighter? Like talking about it is releasing something.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Can you give me a final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe to a 65? My heart's not racing as much anymore.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today, Rahul. How do you feel about the session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, honestly. But I also feel like I've faced something I've been avoiding for a long time. It's... it's a strange mix of drained and accomplished.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember to be kind to yourself. We'll continue working through this. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we end?",
    "Client: I... I think I want to try talking to my father about this someday. Not right away, but... but maybe it would help. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Rahul. Take care of yourself this week, and we'll pick up here next session."
