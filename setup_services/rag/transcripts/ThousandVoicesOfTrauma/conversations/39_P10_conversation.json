    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Johnson. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a mix of emotions. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is... well, terrified of revisiting those memories.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0-100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 40. My heart's beating a bit faster than usual.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Where should I start?",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes if you're comfortable. Take us back to that day at the refugee camp.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Alright... I'm there. It's hot, unbearably hot. The sun is beating down on the makeshift tents. I can smell sweat and... something else. Fear, maybe? There are so many people crammed into this small space.",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: I see... I see children. They're everywhere, looking lost and confused. Their eyes... God, their eyes are so hollow. I'm twelve, but I feel ancient compared to some of these little ones. There's dust in the air, making everything hazy.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... overwhelmed. Scared. There's this knot in my stomach that won't go away. I'm worried about my little sister. I can't see her in the crowd.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's gone up. Maybe 60?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: I start pushing through the crowd, calling out for my sister. \"Amina! Amina!\" But it's so noisy. Everyone's shouting, crying. I can barely hear my own voice. My heart is racing now, just like it was then.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Inhales shakily) Right, yes. I'm... I'm still looking for Amina. Then I hear it - gunshots in the distance. Everyone starts panicking. People are running, pushing. I'm knocked to the ground.",
    "Therapist: What do you feel as you're on the ground?",
    "Client: I... I can't breathe. The dust is choking me. People are stepping on me, over me. I'm terrified. I think I'm going to die here, trampled and alone.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. 85, maybe 90.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you survived this. You're here now, safe.",
    "Client: (Nods) Yes, I... I did survive. Somehow, I manage to crawl to the edge of the crowd. I pull myself up against a tent. My ribs hurt. I think they're bruised. But I'm still frantically searching for Amina.",
    "Therapist: What do you see as you look around?",
    "Client: Chaos. Pure chaos. People are grabbing whatever they can carry and running. The aid workers are trying to maintain order, but it's useless. I see a woman cradling a baby, both of them covered in dust. She looks... she looks just like my mother.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that image. What emotions come up?",
    "Client: Grief. Overwhelming grief. My mother... she didn't make it out of our village. And now I might lose Amina too. I feel so... so helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: Still high. Maybe 80.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. Remember, you're here now, telling the story.",
    "Client: (Breathes deeply) Okay. I... I start moving again. My legs are shaky, but I force myself forward. I'm calling for Amina, my voice getting hoarse. Then... then I hear it. A faint cry. \"Brother!\"",
    "Therapist: What happens when you hear her?",
    "Client: I spin around so fast I nearly fall. And there she is, huddled under a table. Her face is streaked with tears and dirt. I've never felt such relief in my life.",
    "Therapist: Allow yourself to feel that relief.",
    "Client: (Tears forming) It's... it's overwhelming. I rush to her, pull her into my arms. She's shaking, but she's alive. I hold her so tight, promising I'll never let go again.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's lower. Maybe 60? I feel drained, but also... lighter somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's good. What happens next?",
    "Client: We... we stay there for a moment, just holding each other. The chaos continues around us, but it feels distant now. I know we need to move, to get to safety, but for just a second, I let myself feel grateful.",
    "Therapist: Take us through leaving the camp.",
    "Client: Right. I... I stand up, keeping Amina close. We start making our way towards the edge of the camp. It's slow going. There are still people running, pushing. I keep Amina in front of me, shielding her with my body.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you're moving?",
    "Client: Tense. Every muscle is coiled, ready to react. My ribs are throbbing, but I ignore it. All that matters is getting Amina out safely.",
    "Therapist: What do you see as you near the edge of the camp?",
    "Client: I see... I see trucks. Big UN trucks. There are soldiers helping people climb in. For a moment, I hesitate. Can we trust them? But then I see a family I recognize from our village being helped aboard.",
    "Therapist: What do you decide to do?",
    "Client: I... I take a deep breath and start moving towards the trucks. I lift Amina up, passing her to one of the soldiers. She starts crying, reaching for me. \"It's okay,\" I tell her. \"I'm right behind you.\" I climb up after her, my heart pounding.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel once you're in the truck?",
    "Client: Relieved, but still scared. The truck is crowded, hot. People are pressed against us from all sides. But Amina is in my lap, safe. I hold her close, whispering that everything will be okay, even though I'm not sure I believe it myself.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down. Maybe 50? I feel exhausted, but also... I don't know. Proud, maybe? That I managed to keep us safe.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant improvement. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Drained. Emotionally and physically. But... there's something else. A sense of... I don't know, maybe closure? Talking about it like this, it feels different.",
    "Therapist: Different how?",
    "Client: Like... like I'm not just reliving it, but processing it. Seeing it from the outside, almost. It's still painful, but it doesn't have the same power over me.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Look around the room and name five things you see.",
    "Client: (Opens eyes) Okay. I see... the blue chair in the corner. The painting on the wall. Your desk. The clock. And the plant by the window.",
    "Therapist: Good. How do you feel now, back in the present?",
    "Client: Better. Calmer. It's like... the memory is still there, but it's not overwhelming me anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. What's your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: I'd say about 30 now. It's... it's manageable.",
    "Therapist: You've done remarkable work today. How do you feel about the session?",
    "Client: I feel... proud, I guess. And grateful. It wasn't easy, but I feel like I've taken a step forward. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Remember, you did the hard work. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we end?",
    "Client: No, I think... I think I'm good for now. Just tired. But a good kind of tired, if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: It does. Let's end here for today. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later. I'm proud of the work you've done.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'll see you next week.",
    "Therapist: Take care, Mr. Johnson. See you next week."
