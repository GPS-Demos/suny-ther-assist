    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Patel. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to do this, but another part is terrified. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0-100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: Um... probably around 60? My hands are a bit shaky.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we can pause anytime. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day at work. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in the office. It's early, maybe 8:30 AM. I can smell coffee from the break room. I'm at my desk, organizing files for a big presentation later. The fluorescent lights are buzzing softly overhead.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear voices approaching. It's Tom and Sarah from marketing. They're laughing about something. As they pass by my desk, I hear Tom say, \"...yeah, and then she tried to pronounce 'quarterly projections.' God, it was hilarious.\" My cheeks start burning. I know they're talking about me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My throat feels tight. My hands are clammy. I... I want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Maybe 75?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I try to focus on my work, but my vision is blurry. I can hear them still laughing at the water cooler. I stand up, thinking I'll go to the restroom to compose myself. But as I walk past them, Sarah says loudly, \"Oh, hi there! We were just talking about your amazing presentation skills.\" Her voice is dripping with sarcasm.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Humiliated. Angry. I... I want to yell at them, but I can't find my voice. My legs feel weak.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens in your body?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I feel hot all over. I... I think I'm starting to sweat. I mumble something and practically run to the restroom.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take another deep breath. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. Maybe 85 or 90.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. What do you do in the restroom?",
    "Client: I lock myself in a stall. I'm shaking. Tears are streaming down my face. I can hear my pulse pounding in my ears. I... I feel so alone. So different. Why can't I just fit in?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with those emotions.",
    "Client: I'm trying to calm down, but all I can think about is how they see me. As this... this foreigner who can't speak properly. Who doesn't belong. I've worked so hard to get here, and it feels like none of that matters. I'm just... just a joke to them.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I'm thinking maybe I should quit. Maybe I don't belong here. Maybe I'll never belong anywhere in this country. I'm wondering if my parents were right, if I should have stayed in Singapore. But then I feel angry at myself for even thinking that. I've worked so hard to build a life here.",
    "Therapist: Those are difficult thoughts. How does your body feel now?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. It's hard to breathe. I'm... I'm trying to stop crying, but I can't.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... okay. I'm trying.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I hear the restroom door open. Someone comes in. I hold my breath, trying to be quiet. I don't want anyone to know I'm crying. I hear them washing their hands, then leaving. I feel so... exposed. Like everyone can see my weakness.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Vulnerable. Scared. I... I don't want to go back out there. I don't want to face them.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 80?",
    "Therapist: Okay. You're doing well. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I take some deep breaths. I splash water on my face. I'm trying to gather myself. I have that presentation in an hour. I can't let them see how much they've affected me. I... I start repeating to myself, \"You can do this. You belong here.\"",
    "Therapist: That's good. How does that feel?",
    "Client: It... it helps a little. But I still feel shaky. Uncertain.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens when you leave the restroom?",
    "Client: I... I walk back to my desk. My legs feel like jelly. I can feel eyes on me. I don't know if I'm imagining it or not. Tom and Sarah are back at their desks. I hear them whispering, but I can't make out what they're saying. I sit down, trying to focus on my presentation notes, but the words are swimming on the page.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: My stomach is in knots. My mouth is dry. I... I feel like I might throw up.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 75 now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. What happens as the time for your presentation approaches?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm trying to rehearse in my head, but all I can hear is Tom's mocking voice. I keep imagining myself stumbling over words, everyone laughing. My hands are shaking as I gather my materials. I... I consider telling my boss I'm sick, that I can't do the presentation.",
    "Therapist: But what do you actually do?",
    "Client: I... I force myself to stand up. My legs feel weak, but I make myself walk to the conference room. With each step, I'm telling myself, \"You can do this. You're smart. You know this material.\" But my voice in my head sounds small, unconvincing.",
    "Therapist: You're showing a lot of courage. How does your body feel as you enter the conference room?",
    "Client: I feel like I might faint. My heart is racing. I... I can see Tom and Sarah already seated, smirking at each other. I fumble with my papers, nearly dropping them. Someone asks if I'm okay, and I just nod, not trusting my voice.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I start the presentation. My voice is shaky at first. I stumble over a few words, and I see Tom roll his eyes. But... but then something changes. As I get into the material, I start to feel more confident. I know this. I've prepared for this.",
    "Therapist: That's great. How does that feel?",
    "Client: It... it feels empowering. Like I'm reclaiming something. I still feel nervous, but there's a strength building inside me.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down. Maybe 60?",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. What happens as you continue the presentation?",
    "Client: I... I start to find my rhythm. I'm explaining complex data, answering questions confidently. I see my boss nodding approvingly. Even Tom and Sarah look less smug. I... I feel like I'm proving something, not just to them, but to myself.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel now?",
    "Client: I... I feel more grounded. My hands have stopped shaking. There's still a knot in my stomach, but it's smaller.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. What happens when you finish the presentation?",
    "Client: There's... there's applause. My boss congratulates me on a job well done. A few colleagues come up to ask follow-up questions. I... I feel a mix of relief and pride. But I'm also exhausted. Emotionally drained.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's lower. Maybe 40?",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How do you feel as you return to your desk?",
    "Client: I... I feel a bit stronger. Like I've faced something and come out the other side. But I'm also aware that this isn't the end. That there will be other days, other moments of feeling like an outsider.",
    "Therapist: Those are very insightful observations. How are you feeling right now, back in the present moment?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little proud? It was hard to go through that again, but I did it.",
    "Therapist: You did do it, and you did very well. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end the session.",
    "Client: (Takes deep breaths) Thank you. I... I think I needed this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Remember, you showed great strength today, both in the memory and in revisiting it. We'll continue to work on this in our next session."
