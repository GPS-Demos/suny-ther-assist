    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling pretty shaken up, to be honest. My heart's still racing, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's like I'm right back there, you know? The smell of jet fuel, the screaming... God, the screaming. I can't seem to shake it.",
    "Therapist: What's the most vivid part for you right now?",
    "Client: The chaos. Everything was happening so fast. One minute we were in the air, and the next... I remember the violent shaking, and then this deafening crash. The plane split open like a tin can. I was thrown from my seat, and suddenly I was outside, surrounded by wreckage and... and bodies. It's the bodies that haunt me the most. They were everywhere, some moving, some... not.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you recall this?",
    "Client: Tense. Really tense. My shoulders are up to my ears, and I'm clenching my jaw. I feel cold, but I'm sweating. It's like my body's stuck between fight and flight, you know? I can feel my pulse in my temples, and my breathing is shallow. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... why did I survive? Why me? There were so many others - families, children. I was just some guy on a business trip. It doesn't make sense. And then I feel guilty for even thinking that because I should be grateful, right? But instead, I'm... I'm angry. Angry at the universe, angry at myself for feeling this way. It's all so messed up.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to right after the crash?",
    "Client: It's... it's different, but similar in some ways. Back then, I was in shock. Everything felt surreal, like I was watching a movie of someone else's life. Now, it's more... raw. The emotions are sharper, more defined. I didn't let myself feel much back then - I was too focused on survival, on helping others. Now, it's like all those suppressed emotions are bubbling up, demanding to be felt.",
    "Therapist: What's the hardest part to sit with right now?",
    "Client: The guilt. Definitely the guilt. I keep seeing the faces of those who didn't make it. There was this little girl... couldn't have been more than seven or eight. I tried to help her, but... I couldn't. Her eyes, man. They were so scared, so confused. And now, every time I do something enjoyable or feel happy, I think of her. Of all of them. It feels... wrong, somehow. Like I'm betraying their memory by moving on with my life.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your everyday life now?",
    "Client: It's... it's everywhere. I avoid flying at all costs, which has impacted my career. Loud noises make me jump. I have trouble sleeping - nightmares, you know? And relationships... they're hard. I feel disconnected, like there's this invisible wall between me and everyone else. How can they understand? How can I explain what it feels like to cheat death, to be surrounded by so much loss? It's isolating.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Part of me wants to run away from these feelings, to forget it all. But another part... I think I need to face this head-on. I'm tired of feeling stuck, of letting this define me. I want to find a way to honor those who were lost without sacrificing my own life in the process. Does that make sense? I just... I want peace. I want to be able to remember without feeling like I'm drowning.",
    "Therapist: How can we work towards that peace?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to keep doing this. Talking about it, facing it. It's hard, and it hurts like hell, but I can feel something shifting. Maybe if I can learn to sit with these memories, to accept them as part of my story without letting them consume me... maybe then I can start to heal. I want to find a way to use this experience, as horrible as it was, to do some good in the world. To make their deaths mean something, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful goal. How does it feel to voice that?",
    "Client: It's... it's both terrifying and liberating. Terrifying because it means confronting all of this head-on, which is daunting. But liberating because for the first time in a long time, I feel like there might be a way forward. Like maybe I'm not doomed to be trapped in this trauma forever. It's a small spark of hope, but it's there. And that... that feels good. Scary, but good.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you can take this week?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I could start a journal. Write down my memories, my feelings. Not to dwell on them, but to acknowledge them. And maybe... maybe I could look into support groups for survivors. I've been avoiding that, but hearing others' stories might help me feel less alone. It's a small step, but it's something, right?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great start. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted, to be honest. Emotionally drained. But there's also this sense of... I don't know, release? Like I've been carrying this weight for so long, and now I've set it down for a moment. It's still there, still visible, but I'm not actively holding it right now. And that... that feels like progress. It's a glimmer of what life could be like if I can work through this. It's not much, but it's something to hold onto.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. We'll end here for today.",
    "Client: Thank you. This... this helps. It's hard, but it helps. I'm grateful for the support and the chance to work through this. I know it's a long road ahead, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can navigate it. Thank you for guiding me through this process."
