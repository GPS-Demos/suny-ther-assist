    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to be talking about the earthquake, and just thinking about it makes my heart race a little.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 6 out of 10. My palms are already getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. When you're ready, close your eyes and describe the earthquake.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Alright... I'm in my apartment. It's early morning, still dark outside. I'm... I'm sleeping, and suddenly there's this loud rumbling. The whole building starts to shake. I... I can hear things falling off shelves, glass breaking. I'm frozen in bed, my heart's pounding so hard I can feel it in my throat.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: The room is moving, like... like I'm on a boat in rough seas. My lamp falls off the nightstand and shatters. I can see cracks forming on the walls, and... oh god, the ceiling is starting to crumble. Bits of plaster are raining down.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to an 8. This is really intense.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I finally snap out of it and try to get out of bed, but I fall because the floor is shaking so violently. I'm crawling towards the door, and I can hear screaming from other apartments. The power goes out, and now it's pitch black. I'm fumbling around, trying to find my phone for light, but my hands are shaking so badly...",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My chest is so tight, it hurts to breathe. My legs feel weak, like jelly. I'm... I'm sweating, but I also feel cold. And there's this overwhelming sense of... of helplessness. Like the world is ending and there's nothing I can do.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Take another deep breath. What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: I know it's difficult. You're very brave. What happens as you search for your phone?",
    "Client: I... I finally find it under some books that fell. The light from the screen is so bright in the darkness. I can see dust floating everywhere. The shaking is still going on, and I'm terrified the building might collapse. I'm trying to decide if I should stay or try to get out.",
    "Therapist: What do you decide?",
    "Client: I... I decide to try and get out. I grab my shoes and a jacket, nearly falling again as I put them on. The door is jammed, and I have to throw my whole body against it to open it. In the hallway, it's chaos. People are running, crying. Someone's dog is barking frantically.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling as you make your way through the hallway?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm scared out of my mind, but also weirdly focused. Like everything is in slow motion. I can feel my heart pounding in my ears. The stairwell is dark, and I'm using my phone as a flashlight. I'm gripping the railing so tightly my knuckles are white.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: Still... still a 9. My stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor here in my office.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... okay. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, continue with what happens as you're in the stairwell.",
    "Client: Right. I'm... I'm making my way down. The building is still shaking, and I can hear creaking and groaning noises. Pieces of the wall are falling off. I'm trying to move quickly, but it's hard to keep my balance. I nearly trip over someone who's fallen. I help them up, and we continue down together.",
    "Therapist: That was very brave of you. What are you thinking at this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking that I might die here. That this might be it. But I'm also determined to get out. There's this... this primal survival instinct kicking in.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: We finally reach the ground floor. The lobby is a mess of broken glass and fallen ceiling tiles. The front door is blocked by debris. Someone's shouting to use the back exit. We're all pushing and shoving, trying to get out. I can smell dust and... and something burning.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still at a 9. My hands are shaking just talking about this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Sarah. Take another deep breath. What happens as you try to get out?",
    "Client: We... we manage to get through the back door. Outside, it's absolute chaos. Car alarms are blaring, people are screaming. I can see buildings with huge cracks in them, some partially collapsed. There's a fire a few blocks away. The ground is still shaking, and I'm struggling to stay on my feet.",
    "Therapist: What do you do once you're outside?",
    "Client: I... I join a group of people running towards an open area, a park nearby. We're all in shock, looking around at the destruction. Some people are crying, others are trying to call loved ones. I realize I left my phone in the building. I feel so alone and scared.",
    "Therapist: How does that feeling of being alone affect you?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. I feel lost, like a child. I want my mom, but she's thousands of miles away. I'm surrounded by people, but I've never felt more isolated.",
    "Therapist: That sounds very difficult. What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe an 8 now.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this well. What happens next in the park?",
    "Client: We're all huddled together, strangers becoming instant companions in crisis. The aftershocks keep coming, and each time, there's a collective gasp. I'm sitting on the grass, hugging my knees to my chest. I can't stop shaking. Someone offers me a bottle of water, and I realize how thirsty I am.",
    "Therapist: How does that act of kindness make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a tiny moment of comfort in all this chaos. For a second, I feel less alone. But then I look around at all the destruction, and the fear comes rushing back.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about how everything can change in an instant. How fragile our lives are. I'm worried about my apartment, my belongings, but mostly, I'm just grateful to be alive. And I'm... I'm angry too. Why did this have to happen?",
    "Therapist: It's normal to have all those feelings. What happens as time passes in the park?",
    "Client: Emergency services start to arrive. There are sirens everywhere. People are being treated for injuries. I see a woman crying hysterically because she can't find her child. I want to help, but I feel paralyzed. The sun is starting to come up, and in the light, the full extent of the damage becomes clear. It's... it's like a war zone.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 7. Talking about it is hard, but I feel like I'm starting to process it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing very well, Sarah. How does the memory end for you?",
    "Client: I... I end up staying in the park for hours. Eventually, officials come and start organizing us, setting up temporary shelters. I find out that my building is too damaged to return to. I'm... I'm essentially homeless. But I'm alive. As night falls again, I'm in a school gym with hundreds of others, on a cot, staring at the ceiling. I'm exhausted, but too wired to sleep. And that's... that's where the vivid memory ends.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Sarah. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. Emotionally and physically. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe relief? Like I've let something out that I've been holding in for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after processing trauma. What's your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: I'd say... maybe a 5 now. I'm still shaky, but I feel more in control.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today, Sarah. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay... thank you. This was hard, but... I think it was good. I feel like I understand my experience better now.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's practice some deep breathing to help you transition out of this memory."
