    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. I can still see the images so clearly, you know? My husband's face, contorted with anger, his fist raised... I can feel my heart pounding in my chest, just like it did that night.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you experiencing right now?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking a bit. And there's this tightness in my chest, like I can't quite catch my breath. It's... it's almost like I'm back there again, frozen in that moment of fear and disbelief.",
    "Therapist: And what thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... why didn't I leave sooner? Why did I let it get to that point? I feel so stupid, so weak. And then I feel angry - at him, at myself, at the whole situation. It's like this swirling mess of emotions that I can't seem to untangle.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts and feelings compare to when you first experienced the trauma?",
    "Client: They're... they're less intense now, I suppose. Back then, it was like being hit by a tidal wave. Now it's more like... ripples on a pond. Still there, still affecting me, but not as overwhelming. But God, it's still so hard to face.",
    "Therapist: What's the hardest part for you right now?",
    "Client: The guilt, I think. I keep replaying that night, wondering if I could have done something differently. If I had just been quieter, or more agreeable, or... I don't know. And then I feel guilty for even thinking that way, because I know it wasn't my fault. But it's like my brain can't quite accept that.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt affect you in your daily life?",
    "Client: It... it makes me hesitant, I guess. In my relationships, in my work. I second-guess everything I do, wondering if I'm making the right choices. And sometimes, when things get tough, there's this little voice in the back of my head saying, \"See? You deserve this. This is what happens when you make bad decisions.\"",
    "Therapist: What would you say to that voice if you could?",
    "Client: I... I'd want to tell it to shut up, honestly. That it's wrong, that I didn't deserve what happened to me. That I'm stronger than it thinks I am. But it's hard, you know? It's like that voice has been with me for so long, it's become a part of me.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to express that?",
    "Client: It's... liberating, in a way. Scary, but also kind of empowering. Like I'm finally standing up for myself, even if it's just in my own head. But it's also exhausting. Fighting against that voice, those memories... it takes so much energy.",
    "Therapist: What helps you find that energy to keep fighting?",
    "Client: My kids, I think. They're grown now, but... I want to be strong for them. And my work, too. It gives me purpose, you know? And... and these sessions, actually. As hard as they are, I can feel myself making progress. It's slow, but it's there.",
    "Therapist: What does that progress look like to you?",
    "Client: It's... it's like I'm reclaiming pieces of myself. Bits of confidence, moments of peace. There are days now where I don't think about it at all. And when I do, it doesn't always send me into a tailspin. I'm learning to... to sit with the discomfort, I guess. To acknowledge it without letting it consume me.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: Scared, but determined. It's like... it's like I'm climbing a mountain. Sometimes I look up and the peak seems so far away, and I wonder if I'll ever make it. But then I look back and see how far I've come, and it gives me the strength to keep going. I want to see what's on the other side, you know?",
    "Therapist: What do you hope is on the other side?",
    "Client: Peace, I think. Not the absence of the memories - I know they'll always be a part of me. But... peace with them. The ability to look back without feeling like I'm being dragged under. And... and happiness, too. Real, genuine happiness that isn't overshadowed by fear or guilt. I want to feel whole again.",
    "Therapist: How can we work towards that in our sessions?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to keep pushing myself. To face these memories head-on, as terrifying as that is. And maybe... maybe we could work on that voice in my head? Finding ways to challenge it, to make it quieter. And I want to learn more coping strategies, for when things get tough outside of these sessions.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, but... oddly hopeful. Like I've run a marathon, but I can see the finish line in the distance. It's still hard, still painful, but... I feel like I'm moving forward. And that's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I just... I want to say thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. I know I have a long way to go, but... I feel less alone in this journey now. And that means more than I can express.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue this work next session. Take care."
