    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Take a deep breath and begin when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in the hospital room. The beeping of machines is constant, and the smell of disinfectant is overwhelming. My mom is lying in the bed, looking so small and frail. Her skin is pale, almost yellow. I'm holding her hand, but it feels cold and lifeless.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably a 6. My heart is starting to race a bit.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The doctor comes in, and I can tell by his face that it's not good news. He starts talking about liver failure and how the treatment isn't working. I feel like I can't breathe. My mom squeezes my hand weakly, and I see tears in her eyes. I want to be strong for her, but I'm terrified.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. My palms are sweating, and I feel dizzy.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can. This feels so real.",
    "Therapist: I understand it's difficult. You're safe here. Try to stay with the memory.",
    "Client: Okay... The doctor is still talking, but I can barely hear him. All I can focus on is my mom's labored breathing. She looks at me and whispers, \"I'm sorry.\" I want to tell her it's not her fault, that I love her, but the words won't come out. I feel so helpless and angry. Why is this happening to us?",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's a 9. I feel like I'm going to be sick.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here in a safe place.",
    "Client: I... I need a moment. Can we pause?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take a few deep breaths.",
    "Client: (After a pause) Okay, I think I can continue. The next few days are a blur. I barely leave the hospital. I'm exhausted, but I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see my mom getting worse. The doctors keep talking about options, but I know they're running out of ideas. I feel so alone and scared.",

    "Client: It's still high, maybe an 8. My chest feels tight.",

    "Therapist: Take a moment. Focus on your breathing.",
    "Client: (After a pause) The doctor comes out and tells me she's gone. I collapse to the floor, sobbing. I feel like my whole world has shattered. I keep thinking about all the things I didn't get to say, all the moments we'll never have. It's not fair. She was too young.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7. I feel drained.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well. Let's start wrapping up.",
    "Client: Okay. I... I didn't think I could get through that.",
    "Therapist: You showed great courage. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... maybe a little lighter? Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a common experience. Let's take a few minutes to process what you've just been through."
