    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Can you describe the event we've been working on?",
    "Client: Okay... It was about two months ago. I was walking home from work, just minding my own business. It was getting dark, and I remember feeling a bit uneasy. Then I saw the police car slow down next to me. At first, I thought nothing of it, but then they suddenly pulled over and two officers got out.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: They approached me aggressively, asking what I was doing in the neighborhood. I tried to explain that I lived nearby, but they didn't seem to believe me. One of them grabbed my arm and pushed me against the wall. I felt so helpless and scared. It reminded me of... of when I was abused as a child. That same feeling of powerlessness came rushing back.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I couldn't breathe properly. My heart was racing. I kept thinking, \"Why me? What did I do wrong?\" They started searching me roughly, patting me down, and emptying my pockets. I felt so violated, so exposed. I wanted to cry, to scream, but I was too afraid to make a sound.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: They kept asking me questions, their voices getting louder and more aggressive. I tried to stay calm, but inside I was panicking. I thought about my wife, my kids... what if something happened to me? What if I never saw them again? The fear was overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can keep going. It's too much.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: Okay... After what felt like an eternity, they finally let me go. No apology, no explanation. Just a warning to \"stay out of trouble.\" I walked home feeling shaken, humiliated, and angry. I couldn't stop trembling. When I got home, I broke down in tears. I felt so powerless, just like when I was a child. It brought back all those memories I've tried so hard to forget.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved? It's still painful to talk about, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming as before. I'm surprised I managed to get through it without completely falling apart.",
    "Therapist: You've done an excellent job. Let's take a moment to breathe.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without having a panic attack. It's still hard, but I feel like I'm making progress. Is it normal to feel this exhausted afterward?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's very common. How would you like to proceed?",
    "Client: I think I need a break. Can we talk about some coping strategies for when these memories come up outside of our sessions? I want to be better prepared to handle them in my daily life.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's discuss that next time.",
    "Client: Okay. I appreciate your support through this. It means a lot to have someone listen without judgment. I'm starting to believe that maybe I can work through this trauma and not let it control my life anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. We'll end here for today."
