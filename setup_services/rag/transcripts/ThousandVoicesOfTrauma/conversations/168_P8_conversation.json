    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's like I was right back there, you know? The tremors, the sounds of things falling and breaking... It's all so vivid in my mind now. I can feel my heart racing, just like it did during the earthquake.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, definitely fear. But also... a sense of helplessness. I remember feeling so powerless when the ground started shaking. I couldn't protect my family, couldn't do anything to stop what was happening. It's... it's overwhelming to relive that.",
    "Therapist: I see. Can you tell me more about that feeling of helplessness?",
    "Client: It's like... being trapped in a nightmare, you know? I keep thinking about how I froze when the shaking started. My wife was calling out to me, but I couldn't move. I should have been able to do something, anything. But I just stood there, paralyzed. It makes me feel... weak, I guess. Like I failed them somehow.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you're describing this?",
    "Client: Tense. Very tense. My shoulders are all bunched up, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's hard to take a deep breath. And my hands... they're trembling a bit. It's almost like my body is preparing for another earthquake, even though I know I'm safe here.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to breathe. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"What if it happens again?\" I know it's not rational, but I can't shake this fear that we'll be caught off guard again. And then I start thinking about all the people who lost everything in that disaster. We were lucky, relatively speaking, but so many others... It makes me feel guilty for being so shaken up when others had it so much worse.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts and feelings compare to right after the earthquake?",
    "Client: They're... they're similar, but maybe not as intense. Right after, I was in a constant state of panic. Every little noise made me jump. I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat. Now, it's more... manageable, I guess? But still there, lurking under the surface. It's like I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop.",
    "Therapist: I understand. What's different now compared to then?",
    "Client: Well, I've learned some coping strategies since then. Deep breathing, grounding techniques... they help a bit. And I think... I think I'm starting to accept that I can't control everything. That's hard for me, you know? I've always prided myself on being in control, being the one my family can rely on. But the earthquake... it showed me how little control we really have.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's scary, but also kind of liberating in a way? Like, if I can't control everything, maybe I don't have to be perfect all the time. Maybe it's okay to be vulnerable sometimes. That's not easy for me to admit, though. In my culture, men are supposed to be strong, unshakeable. Showing weakness isn't really... accepted.",
    "Therapist: I see. How has this experience affected your relationships?",
    "Client: It's been... complicated. On one hand, I feel closer to my family. We went through this traumatic experience together, and that's created a bond. But on the other hand, I sometimes feel like I'm letting them down by not being as strong as I think I should be. My wife... she's been incredibly supportive, but I worry that she sees me differently now. And my kids... I don't want them to see their father as weak or scared.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean if they did see that side of you?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me thinks it would be terrible, that they'd lose respect for me. But another part... maybe it would show them that it's okay to be human? That even adults get scared sometimes? I don't know. It's hard to reconcile these conflicting thoughts.",
    "Therapist: How do you think this experience has changed you?",
    "Client: It's made me more... aware, I guess. Of how fragile life can be, of how quickly things can change. I think I appreciate the small moments more now. A quiet evening with my family, a peaceful walk in the park... these things mean more to me now. But it's also left me with this underlying anxiety that I can't seem to shake. It's like I'm always waiting for the next disaster.",
    "Therapist: What helps you manage that anxiety?",
    "Client: Talking about it helps, actually. Sessions like this, where I can be honest about what I'm feeling without judgment. And... I've been trying to focus more on the present. Mindfulness, I think you call it? It's not easy, but when I can really be in the moment, it helps quiet those anxious thoughts.",
    "Therapist: That's great. How else has your perspective changed?",
    "Client: I think I'm more empathetic now. When I hear about natural disasters in other parts of the world, it hits differently. I understand the fear, the uncertainty in a way I never did before. And I find myself wanting to help more, to do something for others who are going through what we went through. It's like... the experience opened my eyes to how connected we all are, how vulnerable we all are.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How do you feel now, after sharing all this?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, somehow. Like I've put down a heavy burden, even if just for a moment. It's still there, all these feelings and memories, but talking about them makes them feel less overwhelming. And there's a part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe proud? That I can face these memories now, that I'm working through this instead of trying to bury it.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful. What's your main takeaway from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's that it's okay to not be okay sometimes. That facing these memories, as hard as it is, is helping me process what happened. And maybe... maybe being vulnerable isn't a weakness. Maybe it's actually a kind of strength. I'm not there yet, but I feel like I'm moving in the right direction.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. How would you like to close our session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to take a moment to just breathe and ground myself. To remind myself that I'm here, I'm safe, and I'm making progress. And maybe... maybe to express some gratitude. For my family, for this opportunity to heal, and for the strength I'm finding in myself that I didn't know I had.",
