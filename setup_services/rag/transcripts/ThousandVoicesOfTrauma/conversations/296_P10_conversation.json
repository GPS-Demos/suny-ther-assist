    "Therapist: Welcome back. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm feeling a bit jittery, to be honest. But I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Let's start with your SUDS level.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 6 out of 10. My stomach feels kind of tight.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. When you're ready, close your eyes and describe the cyberbullying incident.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Alright... I'm sitting in my dorm room. It's late, maybe around midnight. I'm scrolling through social media, and suddenly I see a post about me. It's... it's a photo someone took without my knowledge. I'm at a party, and I look... well, not great. The caption is cruel. It says, \"Look at this loser trying to fit in.\" My heart starts racing.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel exposed. Vulnerable. Like everyone's laughing at me. My cheeks are burning, and I can't stop staring at the screen. The comments start rolling in, each one worse than the last. People I thought were my friends are joining in, adding their own insults. It's like... like I'm drowning in this sea of hate.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe an 8? My palms are sweaty.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. Ground yourself. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I want to defend myself. My fingers are shaking as I type a response, but it comes out all wrong. Autocorrect messes it up, and now they're mocking my spelling too. I delete it quickly, but screenshots are already circulating. I feel so stupid, so powerless.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What's happening in your body?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. It's hard to breathe. I want to run, to hide, but I can't look away from the screen. More notifications keep coming. Ding, ding, ding. Each one feels like a punch to the gut.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I start to cry. Silent tears at first, but then I'm sobbing. I feel so alone in this tiny room. The walls are closing in. I want to call someone, anyone, but who can I trust? What if they've all seen it? What if they're laughing at me too?",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. Maybe higher. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Take a moment to look around the room.",
    "Client: *opens eyes briefly, then closes them again* Okay... okay. I'm here. I'm safe. But in the memory, I'm not. I slam my laptop shut, but my phone keeps buzzing. I turn it off, but the damage is done. I can't unsee those comments, those laughing emojis. I curl up on my bed, hugging my knees to my chest. I feel so small, so insignificant.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I'm thinking, \"Why me? What did I do to deserve this?\" I'm replaying every interaction, trying to figure out who took that photo, who started this. I'm angry, but mostly I'm hurt. These are people I see every day on campus. How am I supposed to face them now?",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: My stomach is in knots. I feel nauseous. My head is pounding from crying so hard. I can barely breathe. It's like there's this heavy weight on my chest.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I don't sleep that night. I keep imagining everyone's reactions when I show up to class the next day. Will they laugh? Point? Whisper behind my back? I consider dropping out, changing schools, anything to escape this humiliation. The sun starts to rise, and I haven't moved from my bed. I feel... broken.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8? My heart is racing just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Can you tell me about the next day?",
    "Client: I... I don't want to go to class. I feel sick to my stomach. But I force myself to get up, to get dressed. My hands are shaking as I put on my clothes. I choose something baggy, something I can hide in. I keep my head down as I walk across campus. Every laugh, every whisper feels directed at me. I'm hyperaware of everyone around me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What are you noticing?",
    "Client: My palms are sweaty. I'm clutching my backpack like it's a shield. My heart is pounding so loud I can hear it in my ears. I feel like everyone's staring at me, judging me. I want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I make it to class, but I can't focus. The words on the board blur together. I feel eyes on me, but when I look up, no one's watching. Or are they just pretending? I start to doubt everything. Was it really as bad as I thought? But then I see someone giggle while looking at their phone, and I'm sure it's about me. The anxiety is overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hovering around a 7. It's intense, but I'm... I'm starting to feel a little disconnected from it.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Stay present if you can. What happens after class?",
    "Client: I... I rush out as soon as it's over. I can't bear the thought of talking to anyone. But as I'm hurrying across the quad, someone calls my name. It's... it's one of my friends. Or someone I thought was my friend. I freeze, not sure what to do.",
    "Therapist: What do you do in that moment?",
    "Client: I... I turn slowly. My heart is racing. I'm bracing for more humiliation. But... but they look concerned. They ask if I'm okay, say they saw the post and reported it. They tell me it's been taken down. I... I start to cry again, but this time it's from relief. I'm not alone.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. I feel a mix of gratitude and embarrassment. I'm glad someone's on my side, but I'm ashamed that they saw me like that. I stammer out a thank you, but I can't meet their eyes.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those emotions. What happens next?",
    "Client: We... we end up sitting on a bench, talking. They tell me about their own experience with cyberbullying. I hadn't known. I start to feel less alone, less singled out. It doesn't fix everything, but it's... it's a start.",
    "Therapist: That's really positive. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. But also... maybe a little hopeful? My SUDS level has dropped to maybe a 5. It still hurts, but it feels less overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you name five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: *opens eyes* Um... the blue chair, the plant in the corner, your desk lamp, the clock on the wall, and the painting of the ocean.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How are you feeling now that we're back in the present?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. But I feel like I've let go of something heavy. It's still there, but it's not crushing me anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. You've shown immense courage today. How would you like to close our session?",
    "Client: Can we... can we just sit quietly for a moment? I need to catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take a few deep breaths together.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. How are you feeling as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but also lighter. Like I've faced something I've been running from for a long time. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Remember to be kind to yourself this week. We'll continue to work through this in our next session.",
    "Client: Okay. I... I think I'm ready to face the week now. It's still scary, but... but I feel stronger.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful to hear. Take care, and I'll see you next time.",
    "Client: Thank you. See you then."
