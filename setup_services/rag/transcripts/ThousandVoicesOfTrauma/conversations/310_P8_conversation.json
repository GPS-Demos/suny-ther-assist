    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mr. Rodriguez?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken up, to be honest. It's like I was right back there, you know? Watching my ex-wife pack her bags, the sound of the zipper echoing in our bedroom. I can still smell her perfume lingering in the air. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: It's a mix of emotions. There's this deep sadness, like a heaviness in my chest. But there's also anger, you know? I keep thinking, \"How could she do this to us? To our family?\" I've spent decades building this life, and in a moment, it feels like it's crumbling around me. I... I feel lost.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What physical sensations are you noticing?",
    "Client: My hands are... they're shaking a bit. My throat feels tight, like I'm trying to hold back tears. And there's this knot in my stomach, like I've been punched. It's... it's hard to breathe normally.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when it first happened?",
    "Client: They're... they're not as intense as they were then, but they're still pretty strong. Back then, it felt like my world was ending. Now, it's more like... like I'm watching a movie of my life falling apart. I'm both in it and outside of it, if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep wondering if I could have done something differently. Maybe if I had been a better husband, or if I had seen the signs earlier. And then I think about my kids, how this affects them. I'm supposed to be their rock, you know? But I feel so... so vulnerable. It's like I've failed them somehow.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your experience of witnessing violence?",
    "Client: I... I hadn't thought about that, but now that you mention it... There's a similar feeling of helplessness, I guess. When I witnessed that violence years ago, I felt frozen, unable to act. And now, with this divorce, I feel that same paralysis. Like I'm watching my life fall apart and I can't do anything to stop it.",
    "Therapist: What's that helplessness like for you?",
    "Client: It's... it's terrifying, really. I've always prided myself on being in control, on being able to fix things. But this... this I can't fix. It makes me feel small, insignificant. Like everything I've worked for doesn't matter. And it brings back those same feelings from when I witnessed the violence - that the world isn't safe, that terrible things can happen at any moment.",
    "Therapist: How are you coping with these feelings?",
    "Client: I... I'm trying to stay busy, to focus on work and my hobbies. But it's hard. Sometimes I find myself just staring into space, replaying memories in my head. I've been spending more time with my children, which helps. But then I see the pain in their eyes, and it all comes flooding back. I'm trying to be strong for them, but... but it's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to curl up and hide from the world. But another part knows I need to keep going, for my kids if nothing else. I guess... I guess I need hope. Hope that this pain will ease, that I'll find a way forward. And maybe... maybe I need permission to not be okay for a while. To acknowledge that this hurts, that it's changing me, and that's... that's alright.",
    "Therapist: How does talking about this make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. Really hard. But there's also a sense of relief, I suppose. Like I'm letting out a breath I've been holding for months. Talking about it makes it real, which is scary. But it also makes me feel less alone. Less like I'm going crazy for feeling this way. It's... it's painful, but also... necessary, I think.",
    "Therapist: What's giving you strength right now?",
    "Client: My kids, definitely. Their resilience amazes me. And... and oddly enough, my work. It gives me a sense of purpose, a reminder that I'm still capable and valued. There's also this... this stubborn part of me that refuses to give up. It's battered and bruised, but it's still there, telling me to keep going.",
    "Therapist: How do you see yourself moving forward?",
    "Client: I... I'm not entirely sure. It feels like I'm navigating in the dark right now. But I know I want to be there for my kids, to show them that we can get through this. I want to rebuild, to find a new normal. It won't be easy, and I know there will be tough days ahead. But I also know that I've survived difficult times before. I just... I just need to take it one day at a time, I guess.",
    "Therapist: What have you learned about yourself through this?",
    "Client: That's... that's a tough question. I suppose I've learned that I'm more resilient than I thought. That even when it feels like everything is falling apart, I can still get up each day and face the world. I've also learned that it's okay to ask for help, to lean on others. That vulnerability isn't weakness. It's... it's been a painful lesson, but an important one.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's both comforting and scary. Comforting because it means I'm not alone in this, that I don't have to carry this burden by myself. But scary because it means letting my guard down, showing parts of myself that I've always kept hidden. It's like... like I'm learning to be a different version of myself. One that's more open, more honest about my struggles. It's uncomfortable, but also... freeing, in a way.",
    "Therapist: What do you want to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I want to explore more about how this divorce connects to my past experiences with trauma. There seems to be a link there that I hadn't fully realized before. And maybe... maybe we could talk more about strategies for coping with these intense emotions. I want to be able to process this in a healthy way, for my sake and for my kids.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired, emotionally drained. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe clarity? Like I've taken a step back and can see things a bit more objectively. The pain is still there, but it feels... manageable, I guess. Like I can carry it without being completely overwhelmed by it. It's a small step, but... but it feels important.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing, Mr. Rodriguez. We'll continue next week.",
    "Client: Thank you, Doctor. I... I appreciate your help. It's not easy, but I think... I think it's making a difference. I'll see you next week."
