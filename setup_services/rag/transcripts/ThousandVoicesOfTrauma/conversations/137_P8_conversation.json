    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky. My heart's still racing, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's like I'm right back there, you know? In that small, dark room. I can almost smell the musty air and feel the cold concrete beneath me.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. How I thought I'd never get out of there. It's like... like I'm still that scared little girl, even though I know I'm safe now. I can't shake this feeling of dread, like something bad is about to happen.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: My hands are clammy, and I feel this knot in my stomach. It's hard to breathe normally. I keep telling myself it's over, but my body doesn't seem to believe it. I'm also feeling... I don't know, maybe ashamed? Like I should have done more to prevent it or to escape.",
    "Therapist: How does that shame feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a heavy weight on my shoulders. And there's this heat in my face. I feel small, like I want to disappear. It's frustrating because logically, I know it wasn't my fault, but emotionally, I can't seem to shake this feeling.",
    "Therapist: What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I... I think I need reassurance. That it's okay to feel this way, that I'm safe now. And maybe... maybe I need to remind myself that I survived. That I'm stronger than I sometimes give myself credit for.",
    "Therapist: You are safe, and your feelings are valid.",
    "Client: Thank you. It helps to hear that. It's just... sometimes the memories feel so real. Like when I was describing the cold floor and the darkness, I could almost feel it on my skin. And the fear... it was so intense. I remember thinking I'd never see my family again, never feel the sun on my face. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: How does talking about it now feel different from being in that moment?",
    "Client: It's... it's strange. There's still fear, but it's not as paralyzing. I can recognize it's a memory, not my current reality. And there's also... I don't know, maybe a sense of pride? That I can face this memory and not completely fall apart. It's hard, but I'm doing it.",
    "Therapist: What does that pride feel like?",
    "Client: It feels... warm. Like a small flame in my chest. It's not huge, but it's there. It's giving me a bit of strength, you know? Like maybe I can get through this, maybe I can heal. It's a new feeling, to be honest. Usually, I just feel scared or angry when I think about what happened.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful shift. How might you build on that?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe I could try to focus on that feeling more? Like, when the memories come up, instead of just feeling scared, I could try to remind myself that I survived, that I'm strong. It's hard though. The fear and shame are so automatic.",
    "Therapist: What would it be like to practice that?",
    "Client: It would be challenging, but... maybe empowering? I imagine it would take a lot of effort at first. Like, actively reminding myself that I'm safe now, that I'm strong. Maybe I could even have a mantra or something? Like, \"I survived, I'm healing, I'm strong.\" It feels a bit cheesy saying it out loud, but it might help.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to consider that approach?",
    "Client: It feels... hopeful, I guess. Like maybe there's a way forward that doesn't involve being controlled by these memories forever. But it's also a bit scary. What if it doesn't work? What if I try and I still end up overwhelmed by fear? I worry that I'll disappoint myself or... or you.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are understandable. What might help you feel more confident?",
    "Client: Hmm... maybe setting small, achievable goals? Like, trying this approach once a day for a week and seeing how it goes. And maybe... maybe knowing that it's okay if it doesn't always work. That healing isn't linear, and setbacks are normal. I think I need to be patient with myself.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a compassionate approach. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... calmer. Still a bit shaky, but the intense fear has subsided. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little proud? Like we've done some important work today. And I'm feeling grateful for this space to process everything. It's hard, but I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on for the rest of our session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to talk more about strategies for coping with flashbacks. The imaginal exposure is helpful, but I still struggle when memories come up unexpectedly in daily life. Maybe we could discuss some grounding techniques or something? I want to feel more prepared to handle those moments.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's explore some strategies together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate that. It's... it's a relief to know we're working towards something concrete. Sometimes the healing process feels so abstract, you know? But having specific tools to use, that feels tangible. It gives me hope that I can regain some control over my reactions and my life.",
    "Therapist: That's a great insight. Where would you like to start?",
    "Client: Maybe we could begin with some simple grounding techniques? Like, things I can do quickly and discreetly if I'm in public and start feeling overwhelmed. And then perhaps we could discuss some longer-term strategies for managing anxiety and intrusive thoughts? I'm open to your suggestions too. You're the expert here.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent ideas. Let's begin with grounding techniques."
