    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Rahul?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. The memory of that police encounter... it's still so vivid. I can feel my heart racing just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. When the officer pushed me against the wall, I felt so... powerless. It reminded me of how I felt as a child when my parents would ignore me for days. That same sense of being invisible, yet scrutinized at the same time.",
    "Therapist: How did reliving that memory feel today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. I noticed my palms getting sweaty, and I felt this tightness in my chest. But, um, it wasn't as overwhelming as I thought it would be. I mean, don't get me wrong, it was still difficult, but... I didn't feel like I was going to completely fall apart this time.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress, Rahul.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess it is. It's strange, you know? I've spent so long trying to avoid thinking about these things, and now here I am, voluntarily remembering them. It's... it's hard, but I think it's helping. I'm starting to see how these experiences have shaped me, how they've fed into my anxiety.",
    "Therapist: How so?",
    "Client: Well, I've always been hyper-vigilant, especially around authority figures. I realize now that it's not just about the police incident. It goes back to my childhood, feeling like I always had to be on guard, never knowing when my parents would suddenly pay attention to me and if it would be positive or negative. I think that's why I struggle so much with uncertainty in my professional life too.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How does this understanding affect you?",
    "Client: It's... liberating, in a way. And scary. I feel like I'm seeing myself clearly for the first time in years. But it also makes me wonder... how do I move forward from here? How do I stop letting these experiences control me?",
    "Therapist: What ideas do you have about that?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to start challenging some of my assumptions. Like, not every authority figure is out to get me. And maybe... maybe I can start taking more risks in my personal life. I've been so isolated, you know? Always afraid of rejection. But if I can face these memories, maybe I can face the possibility of forming new relationships too.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a meaningful goal. How might you start?",
    "Client: I've been thinking about joining a local South Asian professional network. I've always avoided it because of my anxiety, but... maybe it's time to give it a try. And, um, I think I want to start practicing some self-compassion too. I've been so hard on myself for so long.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent steps, Rahul. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's daunting, but... I'm ready. For the first time in a long time, I feel like there's hope. Like maybe I don't have to be defined by my past. It's not going to be easy, but... I think I'm stronger than I realized. And, well, having your support helps too.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to delve deeper into my childhood experiences. I'm starting to see how much they've influenced my adult life, and I want to understand that better. And maybe we could talk more about strategies for managing my anxiety when I'm in social situations? I want to be prepared when I try to expand my social circle.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Is there anything else you'd like to add?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. I know I was skeptical about this therapy at first, but it's really making a difference. I feel like I'm finally starting to understand myself, and that's... that's huge for me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work, Rahul. I'm here to support you.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's nice to feel like someone's in my corner, you know? I'm looking forward to our next session, even if it's going to be challenging. I feel like I'm finally on the right path."
