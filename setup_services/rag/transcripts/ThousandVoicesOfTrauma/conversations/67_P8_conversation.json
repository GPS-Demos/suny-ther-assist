    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also feels foggy at the same time. The memory of that day in combat... it's so vivid now. I can still hear the explosions, smell the smoke. My heart's pounding, and I feel this tightness in my chest.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about my squad mates. Their faces, their voices. We were so young, you know? Just kids, really. And then suddenly, we're in the middle of this chaos. I remember feeling so scared, but also trying to stay focused, to remember our training. But it wasn't enough... it wasn't enough to save everyone.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What emotions are you experiencing as you recall this?",
    "Client: Guilt. Overwhelming guilt. And sadness. I made it out, but some of my friends didn't. I keep wondering if I could have done more, you know? If I had been faster, or more alert, maybe things would have been different. And then there's this anger too. At the situation, at the war, at myself. It's all mixed up together.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you're talking about this?",
    "Client: It's... it's tense. My shoulders are tight, and I notice I'm clenching my jaw. My palms are sweaty, and I feel this knot in my stomach. It's like my body is preparing for a fight, even though I'm just sitting here. And I'm aware of my breathing - it's shallow and quick.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to push these feelings away, to forget about it all. But another part of me knows that's not the answer. I guess I need... understanding? Acceptance? The idea that it's okay to feel this way, that it doesn't make me weak or broken. And maybe... hope. Hope that I can learn to live with this, that it won't always be so overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: How does sharing this experience make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. Really hard. But there's also a sense of relief, I think. Like I'm finally letting out something I've been holding in for so long. It's scary, but also... I don't know, maybe freeing in a way? I've spent so many years trying to push these memories down, to act like they didn't affect me. But talking about it, as painful as it is, feels like I'm finally acknowledging what happened.",
    "Therapist: What's different about discussing it now compared to before?",
    "Client: Well, before, I'd get lost in the memory. It was like I was right back there, unable to separate past from present. Now, it's still intense, but I can... I can see it more clearly, if that makes sense. I'm aware that I'm here, in this room, talking about it. It's not consuming me the same way. And I'm noticing things I hadn't before - not just the fear and the chaos, but also the moments of bravery, of connection with my fellow soldiers.",
    "Therapist: How might this new perspective impact your daily life?",
    "Client: I... I'm not entirely sure yet. But I think... maybe it could help me feel less isolated? For so long, I've felt like no one could understand, so I've kept people at arm's length. But if I can talk about this and not completely fall apart, maybe I can start opening up more in other areas of my life. And perhaps... perhaps I can start to forgive myself a little. Not forget, but... learn to live with what happened without it defining every moment of my life.",
    "Therapist: What strengths have you discovered through this process?",
    "Client: Strengths? I... I guess I never really thought about it that way. But now that you mention it, maybe there is strength in facing this head-on. It takes courage to confront these memories, doesn't it? And resilience. I've carried this for so long, and I'm still here, still trying to work through it. That's something, I suppose. And maybe there's strength in vulnerability too - in being willing to open up and share these experiences, even when it's terrifying.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's... it's daunting, to be honest. Part of me wants to run away, to go back to pushing it all down. But I also feel a glimmer of... hope, maybe? Like maybe there's a way through this that I couldn't see before. It's exhausting, and painful, but I think... I think it might be worth it. If there's a chance I can learn to live with these memories without them controlling me, I want to try. It's scary, but I'm starting to believe that maybe I'm strong enough to face this.",
    "Therapist: What support do you need moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I need patience. From myself, and from others. This isn't going to be a quick or easy process, and I need to remember that it's okay to have setbacks. I also need... understanding, I guess. People who can listen without judgment, who can be there even when I'm struggling. And maybe... maybe some help in reconnecting with the world? I've isolated myself for so long, and I think part of healing might be learning how to engage with life again, how to find moments of joy even with everything I've been through.",
    "Therapist: How has today's session impacted your view of recovery?",
    "Client: It's... it's changed things, I think. Before, recovery seemed impossible. Like this huge mountain I could never climb. But now, I can see that it's more of a journey. There might not be a point where I'm suddenly \"fixed,\" but each step, each session like this, is moving me forward. It's still overwhelming at times, but I feel like I have a bit more... agency, maybe? Like I'm not just a passive victim of my memories, but actively working to understand and process them. It's hard work, but for the first time in a long while, I feel like there might be a way through this.",
    "Therapist: What's one thing you'd like to remember from today?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to remember that I'm not alone in this. That even though my experiences are unique to me, the process of healing is something many people go through. And that it's okay to struggle, to have good days and bad days. But most importantly, I want to remember this feeling - this tiny spark of hope that maybe, just maybe, I can learn to live with my past without being controlled by it. That there's strength in facing these memories, and that by doing so, I'm taking steps towards reclaiming my life.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. How would you like to close our session?",
    "Client: I... I think I'd like to take a moment to just breathe. To acknowledge how far I've come today, even if it doesn't always feel like progress. And maybe... maybe to set an intention for the week ahead. Something small, like allowing myself to feel whatever comes up without judgment, or reaching out to a friend when I'm struggling instead of isolating myself. Is that... is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's do that.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay. I'm setting an intention to be a little kinder to myself this week. To remember that healing isn't linear, and that's okay. And to try, even if it's hard, to connect with someone when I'm having a tough day. Thank you for... for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I think... I think it's important.",
