    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not really sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. The memory of that car accident... it's so vivid now. I can still hear the screeching of tires, the crunch of metal. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What physical sensations are you noticing right now?",
    "Client: My heart is pounding. I feel tense all over, especially in my shoulders and neck. There's this tightness in my chest, like I can't quite catch my breath. And my hands... they're clammy and shaky.",
    "Therapist: I see. And what thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"Why did this happen to me?\" It's not fair. I was just driving home from work, like any other day. And then suddenly, everything changed. I feel angry, but also... guilty? Like maybe I could have done something differently. Maybe if I had left work earlier or later, or taken a different route... God, it's exhausting to keep second-guessing everything.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts compare to your combat experiences?",
    "Client: It's... it's similar in some ways. The suddenness, the feeling of helplessness. But in combat, I was prepared for danger. This... this came out of nowhere. It's like it shattered my sense of safety in everyday life. I find myself constantly on edge now, even doing simple things like driving to the grocery store.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are you experiencing as you reflect on this?",
    "Client: Fear, definitely. A lot of fear. But also... shame? I feel like I should be handling this better. I've been through worse in combat, right? So why is this affecting me so much? And there's this underlying sadness too. It's like I've lost something... my peace of mind, maybe?",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your depression?",
    "Client: I... I hadn't really thought about that connection before. But I guess it does tie in. The accident has made me feel so helpless, so out of control. And that feeds into the depression, you know? It's like, what's the point of trying if everything can change in an instant? Some days it's hard to even get out of bed, let alone face the world.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your body now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm starting to relax a bit. The tightness in my chest is easing up. But I feel drained, like I've run a marathon. My eyes are heavy... I think I might cry, actually. It's just... a lot.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Let's sit with that for a moment.",
    "Client: (After a pause) You know, it's strange. As difficult as this is, there's also a sense of... I don't know, relief? Like I'm finally facing this head-on instead of trying to push it away. It's painful, but maybe... maybe it's necessary?",
    "Therapist: How does this compare to your previous coping strategies?",
    "Client: It's completely different. Before, I was just trying to avoid anything that reminded me of the accident. I'd have a drink or two to numb myself, throw myself into work, anything to keep busy. But it was always there, just under the surface. This... this feels more real. More honest, I guess.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you make that connection?",
    "Client: A mix of things. There's fear, definitely. Fear of what else might come up if I keep digging. But also... hope? Like maybe there's a way through this that doesn't involve hiding or numbing myself. It's scary, but also... exciting? Is that weird to say?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. Can you elaborate on that feeling?",
    "Client: It's like... for the first time since the accident, I feel like I'm doing something proactive. Instead of just being a victim of my circumstances, I'm actively working to understand and process what happened. It's hard, really hard. But it also feels empowering in a way.",
    "Therapist: How does this relate to your experiences in combat?",
    "Client: That's... that's an interesting parallel. In combat, we had to face our fears head-on. There was no running away. This feels similar. It's like I'm finally facing this trauma with the same courage I had to muster in combat. It's different, of course, but... maybe I can draw on that strength?",
    "Therapist: What do you think that might look like?",
    "Client: I'm not entirely sure. But maybe... maybe it means being more open with my family about what I'm going through. Maybe it means gradually facing situations I've been avoiding, like driving on the highway. It's scary to think about, but... I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, as we wrap up?",
    "Client: Exhausted, honestly. But also... lighter? Like I've set down a heavy burden, even if just for a moment. There's still a long way to go, I know that. But for the first time in a while, I feel like I might actually get there.",
