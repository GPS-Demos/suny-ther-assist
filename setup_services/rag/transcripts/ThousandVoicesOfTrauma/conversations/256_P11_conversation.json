    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Ahmed?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also kind of numb? That was really intense. I could almost feel everything happening again, you know? The hospital smell, the beeping machines, the doctor's voice when he told me about the diagnosis. It's all so vivid.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: I think... the fear. The overwhelming fear when I realized how serious it was. And then the shame. I felt so exposed and vulnerable in that hospital gown, knowing what had happened to me. It's like everything came crashing down at once.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was hard. Really hard. I felt my heart racing, and my palms got all sweaty. For a moment, I thought I might panic. But... I also felt something else. Like, maybe a tiny bit of strength? I mean, I survived that, right? As horrible as it was.",
    "Therapist: You did survive. What do you make of that feeling of strength?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe I'm stronger than I thought? It's weird because I've always felt so weak and helpless when I think about what happened. But going through it again, I realized I handled it somehow. I didn't fall apart completely.",
    "Therapist: How does this relate to your recovery goals?",
    "Client: Well, I've been so afraid of dealing with any of this. I've avoided thinking about it, talking about it. But maybe... maybe I can face it? If I could get through the actual experience, perhaps I can get through remembering it too. It's still terrifying, but... I don't know. Maybe there's hope?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How might this affect your daily life?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe I could try to be a bit braver in other areas? Like, I've been avoiding doctor's appointments because they remind me of that day. But if I can face this memory here, maybe I can handle a check-up. And maybe... maybe I could try opening up to my friend about some of this. I've been so isolated.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like positive steps. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted, honestly. But also... kind of proud? Is that weird? I mean, it was awful to go through that again, but I did it. I actually did it. And I'm still here, still talking. That's... that's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... maybe we could explore more of how this experience has affected my relationships? I've pushed everyone away, and I want to start changing that. If that's okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll work on that next session. How will you take care of yourself today?",
    "Client: I think I'll call my sister. Just to hear her voice. And maybe take a long shower. I feel like I need to wash this all away, you know? And then probably sleep. I'm so tired.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like good ideas. Remember to use your coping strategies if you need them.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you... for guiding me through this. It's tough, but... I think it's helping. I hope it's helping.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work, Ahmed. See you next week."
