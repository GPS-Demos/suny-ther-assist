    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Thompson. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is terrified. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0-100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably around 60? My hands are a bit shaky.",
    "Therapist: Okay, thank you. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Where do I start?",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes and take us back to that day. Describe what you see, hear, and feel.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm in our old house. It's early morning, and I can smell coffee brewing. I'm sitting at the kitchen table, waiting for Tom to come down. I... I know something's wrong. He's been distant lately, and I'm dreading what's coming.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What's happening in your body?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. I'm gripping the mug so hard my knuckles are white. I hear his footsteps on the stairs and my heart starts racing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: Tom walks in. He looks... tired. Defeated. He sits across from me and says, \"We need to talk.\" And I just... I know. Everything's about to fall apart.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... God, I feel sick. Like the floor's dropping out from under me. He starts talking about how we've grown apart, how he's not happy anymore. And all I can think is, \"How did I not see this coming?\"",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 75 now. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a deep breath. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Okay... He's still talking, but I can barely hear him over the roaring in my ears. I want to scream, to beg him to stay, but I'm frozen. All those years together, and it's ending like this.",
    "Therapist: What do you want to say to him?",
    "Client: I... I want to ask him why. Why now? Why wasn't I enough? But the words won't come out. I just sit there, feeling small and... and worthless.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you are safe now. This is a memory. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking. I feel... hollow. Like everything good has been sucked out of me.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he stands up. Says he's already packed a bag. That he'll be staying with a friend for a while. And I just... I can't move. Can't speak. It's like I'm watching everything fall apart in slow motion.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... is this my fault? Did I do something wrong? Maybe if I'd been a better wife, if I'd paid more attention... God, it hurts so much.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 85. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a moment. Breathe with me.",
    "Client: (Deep breaths) Okay... okay. I'm... I'm watching him walk out the door. And it's like... it's like my whole world is collapsing. Twenty-five years of marriage, and he's just... gone.",
    "Therapist: What do you do after he leaves?",
    "Client: I... I just sit there. For hours, maybe. I can't move. Can't think. It's like I'm underwater, everything's muffled and distant. The house feels so empty, so... wrong.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's happening in your body?",
    "Client: My chest aches. It's like there's this... this gaping hole where my heart should be. I feel cold, even though it's summer. And I'm so, so tired.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. I haven't let myself think about this day in so long. My SUDS is probably around 90 now.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you've survived this. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I finally get up. My legs feel like lead. I walk through the house, and everything reminds me of him. Our wedding photo on the mantle, his favorite chair, even the stupid magnets on the fridge we bought on vacation. And I just... I start crying. I can't stop.",
    "Therapist: Allow yourself to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Sobbing) It hurts so much. I... I loved him so much. How could he just... leave? Like I meant nothing?",
    "Therapist: It's okay to cry. Let it out. You're doing well.",
    "Client: (Continues crying for a moment) I... I end up in our bedroom. And I just... I collapse on the bed. His side is still made, and I can smell his cologne on the pillow. And I think... I think this is when it really hits me. He's gone. He's not coming back.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: Heavy. So, so heavy. Like I'll never be able to move again. My chest hurts, my eyes are burning from crying. I feel... broken.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 95. This is... this is really hard.",
    "Therapist: I know it is. You're very brave. Take a moment to breathe.",
    "Client: (Deep breaths) Okay... I'm... I'm lying there, and I start thinking about the future. About having to tell our friends, our family. About being alone. And it's... it's terrifying.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... what did I do wrong? Was I not good enough? Will anyone ever love me again? And then I get angry. How could he do this to me? After everything we've been through?",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel angry. How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's hot. Like this burning in my chest. My hands are clenched so tight my nails are digging into my palms. I want to scream, to break something, to... to make him feel as hurt as I do.",
    "Therapist: Allow yourself to feel that anger. It's a natural response.",
    "Client: I... I end up grabbing one of his shirts from the closet. And I just... I rip it. I tear it to shreds, sobbing and screaming. It's like... like all the pain and anger is pouring out of me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Drained. My SUDS is... maybe down to 80? I feel wrung out, like I've got nothing left.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I curl up on the floor, surrounded by the pieces of his shirt. And I just... I lie there. I don't know how long. Hours, maybe. The light changes, and I realize it's getting dark.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm wondering how I'm going to survive this. How I'm supposed to go on when my whole life has fallen apart. I feel so... so lost. So alone.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you did survive. You're here now. How does that realization feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's strange. Part of me still feels that pain so intensely. But another part knows I got through it. I'm... I'm stronger than I thought.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You are strong. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe 70? I feel... drained, but also... I don't know. Like I've faced something I've been avoiding for a long time.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Okay... I'm... I'm here. In your office. It's... it's over.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You're safe here. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. But also... I don't know. There's a sense of relief, I guess? Like I've finally let out something I've been holding in for years.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after imaginal exposure. You've done great work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was... it was hard. But I think... I think it helped. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Many find relief in processing these memories. How are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: My body feels heavy, but... relaxed, I guess? The tightness in my chest is gone. I feel... drained, but in a good way?",
    "Therapist: That's good. Let's do some grounding exercises before we end.",
    "Client: Okay. I... I appreciate your guidance through this. It was intense, but... I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: I'm proud of your courage. We'll continue to work through this together."
