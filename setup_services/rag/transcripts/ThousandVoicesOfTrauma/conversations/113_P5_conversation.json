    "Therapist: Mr. Lee, today we'll be starting imaginal exposure. Are you ready to discuss this?",
    "Client: I suppose so, Dr. Chen. To be honest, I'm feeling a bit nervous about it. Can you explain what exactly we'll be doing?",
    "Therapist: Of course. It involves revisiting your trauma memory in a safe environment. How does that sound?",
    "Client: Revisiting the memory? That sounds... challenging. I've spent years trying to forget those experiences. The bullying I endured, and later, what I witnessed with human trafficking... it's all so painful. I'm not sure I can handle reliving it.",
    "Therapist: I understand your hesitation. What concerns you most?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried that bringing up these memories will make things worse. Since my wife passed away, I've struggled with substance use to cope. I'm afraid this might push me back into those habits. Plus, at my age, is it really worth stirring up old traumas?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How do you think facing these memories might help?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. I guess maybe it could help me process what happened? But I'm scared of the emotions it might bring up. Since retiring and living alone, I've felt more vulnerable to these old fears.",
    "Therapist: That's insightful. Can you share what you hope to gain from this process?",
    "Client: Well, I suppose I'd like to feel more at peace. Maybe be able to sleep without nightmares, or go out without constantly looking over my shoulder. It would be nice to enjoy my retirement without these ghosts from the past haunting me.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent goals. Shall we discuss what to expect during the exposure?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I'd like to know what I'm getting into. Will it be very intense? How long will it last? And what if I can't handle it?",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. You can pause anytime. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's somewhat reassuring. But what if I become overwhelmed? Or if I have a panic attack? I've had those before when thinking about these events.",
    "Therapist: I'll be here to guide you. We have grounding techniques ready. Feeling apprehensive?",
    "Client: Yes, very much so. But I also feel a glimmer of hope. If this could help me move past these traumas, it might be worth trying. I just hope I'm strong enough to face it all.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Shall we start with a relaxation exercise?",
    "Client: That would be helpful, thank you. I'm feeling quite tense just thinking about this. A relaxation exercise might help calm my nerves a bit. How does it work?",
    "Therapist: We'll focus on breathing and muscle relaxation. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I appreciate your patience with me, Dr. Chen. It means a lot to have someone guiding me through this process. I'll do my best to follow your instructions."
