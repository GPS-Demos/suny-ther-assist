    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. I can still feel my heart racing a bit. Going through that memory of being bullied and then connecting it to the human trafficking situation... it's intense. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've let something out that I've been holding onto for a long time.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The feeling of helplessness, I think. Both in the bullying situation from my past and in the trafficking scenario. It's like... I was transported back to that vulnerable place, you know? I could feel the same tightness in my chest, the same urge to run away or disappear. But this time, I stayed with it. I didn't try to push it away or numb it out. That feels... significant, somehow.",
    "Therapist: How did staying with those feelings impact you?",
    "Client: It was tough, really tough. But... I think it helped me realize that I'm stronger now. I mean, I survived those experiences, right? And here I am, facing them head-on. It's scary, but it's also... empowering? Is that weird to say?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. Can you elaborate on that feeling of empowerment?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... for so long, I've been running from these memories, these feelings. They've had this power over me, you know? But today, I looked them in the eye. I remembered the details, felt the emotions, and I'm still here. I'm okay. It makes me think that maybe I can handle more than I've been giving myself credit for.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How might this relate to your overall recovery?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe it means I don't have to be so afraid all the time? Like, if I can face these memories here, in this safe space, maybe I can start facing other things in my life that I've been avoiding. My depression, my relationships... maybe I can approach them with a bit more courage now.",
    "Therapist: Mm. What's one small step you could take with that courage?",
    "Client: Hmm... Maybe I could try talking to my partner about some of this? I've been keeping so much bottled up, afraid of being vulnerable. But if I can be vulnerable here, maybe I can start opening up there too. It's scary, but... I think it might be worth it.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a meaningful goal. How do you feel about continuing with the exposures?",
    "Client: It's... intimidating, for sure. Part of me wants to run away and never come back. But another part of me is curious, you know? Like, what else might I discover about myself? What other strengths might I uncover? It's hard, but I think... I think I want to keep going. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Your commitment is commendable. Any questions before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I don't think so. Just... thank you. For guiding me through this. For helping me see things I couldn't see on my own. It means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and we'll continue next session."
