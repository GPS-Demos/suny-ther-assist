    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Patel?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. It's hard to revisit those memories of being in that trafficking situation. The fear and helplessness... it's overwhelming. I keep thinking about how vulnerable I felt in that hospital room, not knowing if I'd ever see my family again.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The smell. It's strange, but I could almost smell the antiseptic again. It reminds me of when I was first brought in, confused and in pain. I remember thinking, \"This isn't right. Hospitals are supposed to be safe.\" But it wasn't safe at all.",
    "Therapist: How did your body react during the memory?",
    "Client: My heart was racing, and I felt so tense. My hands are still shaking a bit. It's like... like I'm right back there, you know? I can feel the cold metal of the bed rails, hear the beeping of machines. It's all so vivid.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. How are you coping with these sensations now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm trying to use those breathing exercises we practiced. It helps a little. But I can't shake this feeling of dread, like something bad is about to happen. I know I'm safe here, but my body doesn't seem to believe it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how I should have known better. I was 65 when it happened - I should have been wiser, more cautious. But I trusted them when they said they were taking me for tests. I feel so foolish.",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. How does this connect to your daily life now?",
    "Client: I... I struggle to trust medical professionals. Even going for a check-up is terrifying. And I isolate myself more. I'm afraid of being taken advantage of again. It's like I'm always on guard.",
    "Therapist: That makes sense. What have you learned from today's session?",
    "Client: I realize now how much that experience still affects me. But... I also see that I'm stronger than I thought. I got through it then, and I'm facing it now. Maybe... maybe I can start to trust again, little by little.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's scary, and it hurts. But I want my life back. I want to be able to visit my doctor without panicking. I want to feel safe in my community again. So... yes, I want to keep going. It's hard, but I think it's worth it.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. What support do you need moving forward?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to talk to my daughter. I've kept so much from her, but maybe sharing this burden would help. And... could we practice more grounding techniques? Sometimes the memories feel so real, I forget where I am.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: I... I'm worried about my depression. These sessions bring up so much, and sometimes I feel like I'm drowning in sadness. How do I balance processing this trauma with managing my mood?",
    "Therapist: That's a valid concern. How can we address this?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe we could talk about some positive coping strategies? And... is it okay if we check in about my mood at the start of each session? I'm afraid of slipping into a deep depression without realizing it.",
    "Therapist: Of course. How are you feeling now, as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted, but... there's a small part of me that feels relieved. Like I've started to unburden myself. It's a tiny spark of hope. I just hope I can hold onto it.",
    "Therapist: That spark is important. What will you do for self-care today?",
    "Client: I think I'll call my daughter, just to hear her voice. And maybe take a long, warm bath. Oh, and I'll try that mindfulness exercise we talked about last time. I need to remind myself that I'm here, now, and safe."
