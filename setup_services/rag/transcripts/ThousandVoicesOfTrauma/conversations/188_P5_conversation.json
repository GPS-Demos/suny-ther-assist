    "Therapist: Good morning, Mr. Johnson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Morning, Doc. I'm... well, I've been better. These nightmares about the violence I witnessed... they're getting worse. I barely slept last night.",
    "Therapist: I'm sorry to hear that. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you ready to discuss it?",
    "Client: Imaginal exposure? That sounds... intimidating. What exactly does that mean?",
    "Therapist: It's a technique where you'll revisit the traumatic memory in a safe environment. Shall I explain further?",
    "Client: I guess so, but... I'm not sure I want to relive that. It was horrible seeing my neighbor beaten like that. I still hear her screams sometimes.",
    "Therapist: I understand your hesitation. How do you feel about trying this approach?",
    "Client: Honestly? Terrified. But I'm tired of feeling this way. If it'll help, I'm willing to give it a shot. What should I expect?",
    "Therapist: You'll describe the event in detail. It may be distressing, but I'll be here to support you. Any questions?",
    "Client: Will this make the nightmares worse? I'm already struggling to sleep as it is. And... what if I can't handle it? What if I break down?",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel anxious. We'll go at your pace, and you can stop anytime. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's a relief. I appreciate your patience with me. I've never talked about this in detail before. It's... it's not easy, you know?",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. This process can significantly reduce PTSD symptoms over time. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm nervous, but I trust you. And if it'll help me sleep better and stop reliving that night... then I'm ready to face it. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Remember, you're in control. Shall we start with some deep breathing exercises?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I could use something to calm my nerves a bit before we dive into this. It's bringing up a lot of emotions already, just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take a deep breath in..."
