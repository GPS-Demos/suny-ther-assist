    "Therapist: Good morning, John. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Morning, Dr. Thompson. I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been thinking about it since our last session, and I'm not sure I'm ready for this imaginal exposure thing you mentioned.",
    "Therapist: I understand. It's normal to feel apprehensive. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... I've spent so long trying not to think about what happened. The idea of deliberately bringing it all back feels... wrong, somehow. Like I'm inviting the pain back in. And with everything else going on in my life right now - the depression, work stress, living with roommates at my age - I'm worried this might push me over the edge.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. Let's discuss the purpose of this exercise.",
    "Client: Okay, I'm listening. But I have to be honest, I'm still skeptical. After losing Sarah, I've been struggling to find any sense of normalcy. The thought of revisiting that trauma... it's terrifying. And then there's this whole human trafficking topic we're supposed to discuss. It just feels like too much.",
    "Therapist: The goal is to process the trauma, not relive it. How does that sound to you?",
    "Client: I guess that makes sense. But how can we process it without reliving it? It feels like opening Pandora's box. I'm afraid once I start talking about it, I won't be able to stop the flood of emotions. And with my depression already being an issue, I'm worried about spiraling.",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace and pause whenever you need. You're in control here.",
    "Client: That's... reassuring. I appreciate that you're not pushing me to dive in headfirst. It's just, you know, being self-employed, I can't afford to fall apart. My work is all I have left sometimes. And living with roommates at 54, it's not like I have a safe space to fall apart in private. I'm worried about how this might affect my daily life.",
    "Therapist: Your resilience is admirable. Shall we set some specific goals for today's session?",
    "Client: Goals... okay, that might help. I guess one goal could be to just get through the session without having a complete breakdown. Maybe another could be to actually understand how this is supposed to help me in the long run. And... I don't know, maybe to find a way to talk about Sarah without feeling like my heart is being ripped out all over again. Is that the kind of thing you mean?",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent goals. How about we start with a brief relaxation exercise?",
    "Client: A relaxation exercise? Yeah, that might be good. My heart's already racing just thinking about all this. It's funny, you know. I came to you originally because of the trafficking issue, but it's Sarah's death that seems to overshadow everything. I guess that's why they call it complex PTSD, right? Everything gets all tangled up together.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. Let's begin. Close your eyes and take a deep breath.",
    "Client: Okay, I'm trying. It's not easy to relax, but I'm doing my best. You know, this reminds me of when Sarah used to try to get me to meditate with her. I always thought it was a bit silly back then. Now I'd give anything to have one more of those moments with her. Sorry, I'm getting off track, aren't I? Deep breaths, right?",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Now, imagine a safe, calming place.",
    "Client: A safe place... okay. I'm picturing the lake where Sarah and I used to go camping. The water's so still, it's like a mirror. I can almost smell the pine trees. It's... it's nice. But it also hurts, you know? Remembering the good times.",
    "Therapist: That's natural. Hold onto that peaceful feeling as we proceed.",
    "Client: I'll try. It's strange how something can be comforting and painful at the same time. I guess that's what this whole process is about, isn't it? Finding a way to hold those memories without being overwhelmed by them. I just hope I'm strong enough to do this.",
    "Therapist: You are. Remember, we're here to help you heal, not hurt you.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot. I know you're just doing your job, but it helps to hear that. Sometimes I feel so alone in all this. Like no one could possibly understand what I'm going through. But you... you seem to get it, at least a little. I'm still scared, but I think I'm ready to try this imaginal exposure thing. What do we do next?",
    "Therapist: We'll start slowly. Just describe the setting of the memory we're exploring.",
    "Client: Okay. Here goes..."
