    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like my whole body is trembling on the inside. Remembering that day in the hospital, when I got the diagnosis... it's bringing up so much.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: It's a mix of emotions. Fear is the strongest one. I can still see the doctor's face, you know? The way he looked at me with this... this pity in his eyes. It takes me right back to feeling so small and vulnerable, like when I was bullied in school. There's this overwhelming sense of powerlessness.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. Can you tell me more about that feeling of powerlessness?",
    "Client: It's... it's suffocating. Like the walls are closing in on me. I remember sitting in that sterile room, the smell of disinfectant burning my nostrils, and feeling like my whole world was crumbling. I couldn't breathe properly. My hands were clammy, and I kept thinking, \"This can't be happening to me.\" It's the same feeling I had when those bullies cornered me in the school bathroom. That sense of... of having no control, no escape.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you recall this?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, like there's a weight pressing down on it. My stomach is in knots, and I'm feeling a bit nauseous. It's like my body is reliving that moment all over again. I can even taste that metallic flavor in my mouth \u2013 you know, the one you get when you're really scared?",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep hearing the doctor's words echoing in my head. \"It's serious, but we'll fight this.\" And then my mind jumps to all the worst-case scenarios. What if I don't make it? What about my family? Will I be strong enough to handle the treatment? It's... it's overwhelming. And then I feel guilty for thinking like this, for not being more positive. It's a vicious cycle.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts and feelings compare to when you were bullied?",
    "Client: God, it's... it's eerily similar. That same feeling of being singled out, of being different. When I was bullied, I felt like I had this invisible target on my back. With the diagnosis, it's like life itself is bullying me. In both cases, I feel... marked. Like I'm not normal, not like everyone else. And there's this deep shame that comes with it, you know? Like somehow, it's my fault.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your ability to cope now compared to then?",
    "Client: That's... that's an interesting question. I guess... I have more resources now. Back then, I felt so alone. Now, I have my wife, my kids, my career. But there's still this part of me that feels like that scared kid. It's like... like I'm stronger, but also more aware of how much I have to lose. It's a strange mix of feeling more capable but also more vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: How does sharing this memory make you feel right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. There's a part of me that feels relieved, like I'm letting out a breath I've been holding for years. But there's also this raw, exposed feeling. Like I've just peeled back a layer of myself and everything's sensitive to the touch. I'm surprised by how vivid these memories still are, how much emotion they still carry. It's exhausting, but... but I also feel a tiny bit lighter. Like maybe, just maybe, talking about this is helping me process it all.",
    "Therapist: What do you think this experience means for your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I... I'm not entirely sure. It's making me realize how much these past experiences have shaped me, how they're all connected. The bullying, the illness... they're different, but they feed into this same core fear of being vulnerable, of not having control. I guess... I guess facing this head-on is a step towards reclaiming some of that control. It's scary as hell, but maybe it's necessary. Maybe by confronting these memories, I can start to see them for what they are \u2013 just memories, not my current reality. It's a long road ahead, but... but I think I'm ready to walk it.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained, to be honest. Emotionally and physically. But there's also this tiny spark of... I don't know, hope maybe? Like I've just climbed a mountain and even though I'm exhausted, I can see a bit further than I could before. My heart's still racing, and I feel a bit shaky, but it's different now. It's like... like I've faced something I've been running from for a long time. It's terrifying, but also... also kind of liberating? I don't know if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: It makes perfect sense. What would you like to focus on next?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to explore more about how these experiences have affected my relationships. Especially with my wife and kids. I've always tried to be strong for them, you know? But maybe... maybe that's not always the best approach. I'm starting to see how keeping all this bottled up has impacted how I interact with them. It's scary to think about being vulnerable with them, but... but I think it might be necessary.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a valuable direction. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think that's a good idea. This session has been... intense. I feel like I need some time to process everything we've talked about. But I'm... I'm glad we did this. It's hard, but I think it's important. Thank you for guiding me through it.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and we'll continue next time."
