    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is buzzing, you know? My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel this tightness in my chest. The memory of seeing my colleague collapse at work, it's so vivid now. I can smell the coffee from the break room, hear the gasps of shock from everyone around. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... what if I had noticed something was wrong earlier? Maybe I could have prevented it. And then I feel guilty for even thinking that because I know logically there's nothing I could have done. But still, the image of her lying there, so pale and still... it haunts me. I feel helpless all over again.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How does that helplessness feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like... a heaviness in my stomach. Almost nauseous. And my shoulders feel tense, like I'm bracing for something. I guess I'm still carrying that weight of responsibility, even though it's been months. It's exhausting, really.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much this incident has affected my daily life. I'm constantly on edge at work now, watching everyone, looking for signs of distress. It's like I'm waiting for the next emergency to happen. And that anxiety... it follows me home. I find myself checking on my husband more often, worrying about his health. It's like the world suddenly feels so fragile.",
    "Therapist: How does sharing this make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... oddly relieving, actually. I haven't really talked about these feelings in depth before. I've been trying to be strong, you know? Especially at work, where everyone's still a bit shaken up. But saying it out loud, it's like I'm acknowledging how much this has affected me. It's scary, but also... I don't know, validating in a way?",
    "Therapist: What do you mean by validating?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... I've been downplaying my own reactions, telling myself I shouldn't be so affected because I wasn't the one who got sick. But talking about it, I'm realizing it's okay to be impacted by what I witnessed. It was traumatic, and my feelings are... they're valid, aren't they?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How does that realization sit with you?",
    "Client: It's a mix of emotions, really. There's some relief, like a weight lifting. But also a bit of sadness. I think I'm grieving not just for what happened to my colleague, but for the sense of safety I lost that day. The world feels different now, more unpredictable. And that's scary, but... I don't know, maybe accepting that fear is part of moving forward?",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. What else?",
    "Client: I'm also noticing... there's a part of me that feels stronger. Like, yes, this was a horrible thing to witness, but I got through it. I'm here, talking about it, facing these memories. That's not nothing, right? Maybe I'm more resilient than I give myself credit for.",
    "Therapist: How does that strength feel?",
    "Client: It feels... grounding, I suppose. Like a small spark of hope. I've been so focused on the fear and anxiety, I haven't really acknowledged my own capacity to cope. It doesn't make the memories less painful, but it does make them feel a bit less overwhelming. Like maybe, with time, I can learn to carry this experience without it weighing me down so much.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you say that?",
    "Client: A mix of things. There's some hope, definitely. But also a bit of... I don't know, maybe guilt? Like, is it okay to feel hopeful when something so terrible happened? And then there's this underlying anxiety - what if something like this happens again? Will I be strong enough to handle it? It's all swirling together, these conflicting emotions.",
    "Therapist: How do these conflicting emotions manifest physically?",
    "Client: It's interesting, now that you ask. The hope feels like a warmth in my chest, kind of expanding. But the guilt and anxiety, they're more like a knot in my stomach. And as I'm talking about it, I notice my breathing has gotten a bit shallower. It's like my body is physically struggling with these opposing feelings.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I think... I need to remind myself that it's okay to feel all of these things at once. That healing isn't linear, and some days will be harder than others. And maybe... maybe I need to be a little kinder to myself. To acknowledge that yes, this was a traumatic experience, and it's okay that it's taking time to process.",
    "Therapist: How can you show yourself that kindness?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe I could start by not judging my reactions so harshly. Allowing myself to feel what I feel without trying to push it away or rationalize it. And perhaps... talking more openly with my husband about this. I've been trying to protect him from my fears, but maybe sharing this burden would help both of us.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive step. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, honestly. But also, there's a sense of... I don't know, maybe clarity? Like I've unpacked some of this emotional baggage I've been carrying around. It's still there, but it feels a bit more manageable now. And there's a tiny part of me that feels proud for facing this head-on today. It wasn't easy, but I did it.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to take away from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... the main thing is that it's okay to have complex, sometimes contradictory feelings about this experience. That healing is a process, and I'm in the middle of it. And maybe, that I'm stronger than I thought. Not in a way that denies the pain or fear, but in a way that acknowledges them and keeps moving forward anyway. Is that... does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How would you like to close our session?",
    "Client: I think... maybe with a moment of quiet reflection? Just to sit with these realizations for a bit. And perhaps... to set an intention for the week ahead. Something about being gentler with myself, and more open with my loved ones about what I'm going through. It feels like a good place to start.",
    "Therapist: That sounds perfect. Let's take that moment now."
