    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my whole body is buzzing. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of nauseous. That memory... it's so vivid. I can still hear the shouting, you know? The sound of glass breaking. I keep seeing my mom's face, how scared she looked.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: It's like... I'm angry, but also scared. I keep thinking, \"Why didn't I do something?\" I was just a kid, but... maybe I could've stopped it somehow. And then I think about how unfair it all was. We didn't deserve that. No one does. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you're talking about this?",
    "Client: Tense. Really tense. My shoulders are all bunched up, and my jaw feels tight. I notice I'm clenching my fists too. It's like my body's getting ready to... I don't know, fight or run or something. And there's this heaviness in my chest, like it's hard to breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are coming up for you?",
    "Client: It's a mix. Anger, definitely. Lots of anger. But also... shame? Yeah, shame. And fear. It's like I'm right back there, feeling helpless all over again. And guilt. God, so much guilt. I know logically it wasn't my fault, but emotionally? It's like I'm still that kid who couldn't protect his mom.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when it first happened?",
    "Client: They're... they're intense, but different. Back then, it was all fear and confusion. Now, it's like I understand more, but that almost makes it worse? I'm angry at my dad, at the situation, at myself even. And the guilt... that's definitely stronger now. I didn't really feel guilty as a kid, you know? But now, as an adult, I keep thinking of all the things I could've or should've done.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about how you're coping with these feelings now?",
    "Client: Well, I'm... I'm here, talking about it. That's something, right? I'm not running away or trying to numb it like I used to. It's hard, really hard, but I'm facing it. And I'm... I'm breathing. Trying to, at least. I notice I'm using some of those grounding techniques we talked about. Focusing on the chair I'm sitting in, the sound of your voice. It helps a little.",
    "Therapist: How does discussing this memory affect your view of yourself?",
    "Client: It's complicated. Part of me feels stronger for being able to face this. But there's also this... vulnerability? Like I'm that scared kid again. And I guess... I'm realizing how much this has shaped me. My anxiety, my trust issues... they all trace back to this. It's like I'm seeing myself more clearly, but I'm not sure I like everything I see.",
    "Therapist: What's the hardest part about revisiting this memory?",
    "Client: The helplessness. Definitely the helplessness. It's... it's suffocating. And the realization that this wasn't just a one-time thing, you know? It was our life. Day after day of walking on eggshells, never knowing when the next explosion would come. It's like... it's like I'm grieving for the childhood I never had. The safety I never felt. And I'm scared... I'm scared that I'll never fully heal from this.",
    "Therapist: How do you see this experience connecting to your current life?",
    "Client: It's... it's everywhere, honestly. My anxiety, always waiting for the other shoe to drop. My difficulty with relationships, always expecting people to hurt me or leave. Even at work, I'm always trying to be perfect, to control everything, because as a kid, I had no control. It's like this memory, this experience, it's woven into the fabric of who I am. And that's... that's terrifying. But also... maybe it explains a lot?",
    "Therapist: What strengths do you see in yourself as you work through this?",
    "Client: I... I guess I'm resilient. I mean, I survived that, right? And I'm here, trying to work through it. That takes courage, doesn't it? And maybe... maybe I'm more empathetic because of what I've been through. I can relate to other people's pain in a way I might not have otherwise. And I'm learning to be kinder to myself, to that scared kid inside me. It's hard, but... I'm doing it. I'm facing this.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's scary. Really scary. But also... necessary? Like, I can't keep living with this weight, you know? I want to be free of it. Or at least, learn to carry it better. It's painful, and sometimes I want to quit. But then I think about the life I want, the relationships I want to have, and I know I need to keep going. It's like... it's like I'm finally fighting back, in a way. Not against my dad, but against what he did to me. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: What do you need moving forward?",
    "Client: Support, I guess. Patience. Both from you and from myself. I need to remember that this is a process, that it's okay to struggle. I need... I need to feel safe. To know that I can face these memories without being overwhelmed by them. And I need hope. Hope that I can heal, that I can have the life and relationships I want. That this... this trauma doesn't define me. That I'm more than what happened to me.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, as we wrap up?",
    "Client: Drained. Really drained. But also... lighter? Like I've set down a heavy backpack I've been carrying for years. I'm shaky, and part of me wants to curl up and cry. But there's also this tiny spark of... I don't know, maybe pride? That I did this, that I faced it. And a bit of hope. It's small, but it's there. Like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this and come out stronger on the other side.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for your courage today. We'll continue next session.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's... it's hard, but I'm glad I'm doing this. I'll see you next week."
