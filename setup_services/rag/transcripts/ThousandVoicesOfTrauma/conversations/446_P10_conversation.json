    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to be talking about the earthquake, and just thinking about it makes my stomach churn.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 6 out of 10 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath, and when you're ready, close your eyes and describe the earthquake experience.",
    "Client: (inhales deeply) Alright... I'm in my office. It's a normal Tuesday afternoon. I'm working on some designs for a client when suddenly, everything starts to shake. At first, I think it's just a truck passing by, but then... oh God, the shaking gets stronger.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: The computer monitor is wobbling. Papers are falling off my desk. I can hear people in the hallway starting to shout. My heart is racing, and I'm frozen in my chair. I should move, but I can't...",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My hands are sweating. I feel this tightness in my chest, like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) Okay... The shaking is getting worse. The bookshelf next to my desk starts to topple. I finally snap out of it and dive under my desk. I can hear glass shattering somewhere. People are screaming. I'm curled up in a ball, and I'm... I'm crying. I'm so scared.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. This feels so real.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: The shaking seems to go on forever. I can hear things crashing all around me. Dust is filling the air, and I'm coughing. I'm thinking about my family, wondering if they're okay. Oh God, what if the building collapses? What if I die here?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those thoughts. What do you see?",
    "Client: It's dark under the desk. I can see debris on the floor. My phone has fallen nearby, but I'm too scared to reach for it. The lights are flickering, and there's this horrible creaking sound.",
    "Therapist: How long does the shaking last?",
    "Client: It feels like an eternity, but I think it's only about a minute. When it finally stops, I'm shaking so hard I can barely move. I'm afraid to come out from under the desk.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I stay there for a while, just listening. I can hear alarms going off, people calling out to each other. Finally, I crawl out. The office is a mess. There's broken glass everywhere, fallen ceiling tiles. I see my coworker, Lisa, she's bleeding from a cut on her forehead.",
    "Therapist: How does seeing Lisa make you feel?",
    "Client: Guilty. Scared. I should have checked on others sooner, but I was so paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: Still an 8. My heart is pounding just talking about this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: We start to make our way out of the building. The stairwell is crowded, and people are panicking. I'm holding onto the railing so tightly my knuckles are white. We finally get outside, and... oh my God, the city looks like a war zone.",
    "Therapist: Describe what you see.",
    "Client: There's dust everywhere. I can hear sirens in the distance. Some buildings have partially collapsed. There are people crying, hugging each other. I see someone trapped under a car, and people are trying to help. I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking at this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking this can't be real. It's like a nightmare. I'm worried about aftershocks, about my family, about where I'm going to go. My apartment might not be safe. I feel so alone in this crowd of people.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel now?",
    "Client: I'm trembling. My legs feel weak, like they might give out. I have this knot in my stomach, and I feel nauseous.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe now. What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 7, I think. Talking about it is hard, but... I don't know, maybe it helps a little?",
    "Therapist: That's good. Continue with what happened next.",
    "Client: I manage to get my phone working and try to call my sister. The lines are jammed. I start walking, not really knowing where I'm going. I see a woman crying, holding a photo of her child. I want to help, but I don't know how. I feel so useless.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel overwhelmed. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I join a group of people who are setting up a makeshift first aid station. It gives me something to focus on. We're using whatever we can find \u2013 torn shirts for bandages, water bottles to clean wounds. I'm still shaking, but helping others... it helps me feel less powerless.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive action. How does it affect your emotions?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. I feel a bit better because I'm doing something, but I'm still terrified. Every little noise makes me jump. I keep expecting another quake to hit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What happens as time passes?",
    "Client: Hours go by. It's getting dark. We hear reports of buildings that have collapsed completely. The death toll is rising. I finally get through to my sister \u2013 she's okay, but her house is damaged. I feel relieved but also guilty for feeling relief when so many others are suffering.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Emotionally drained. My SUDS is probably down to a 6 now. Talking about it... it's hard, but it's like the fear loses some of its power when I put it into words.",
    "Therapist: That's often the case. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. What do you see in this room right now?",
    "Client: (opens eyes) I see... your bookshelf. The plant in the corner. My jacket on the chair.",
    "Therapist: Good. How do you feel physically?",
    "Client: My shoulders are tense, but my breathing is steadier. I feel... present, I guess.",
    "Therapist: You did very well today, Sarah. How do you feel about the session?",
    "Client: It was tough, but... I think it helped. I've never really talked about it in such detail before. It's like... facing it head-on, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's the goal of these exercises. Is there anything else you'd like to add before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. I know I have a long way to go, but I feel like I've taken a step forward today.",
    "Therapist: You absolutely have. We'll continue working through this in our next session. For now, let's do a quick relaxation exercise before you leave.",
    "Client: Okay, I'd like that.",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes and take a deep breath..."
