    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart's still racing, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. The memories... they felt so real, like I was right back there in the middle of it all.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: It's the smell, you know? The acrid smoke, the dust... I can still smell it. And the sounds... the constant barrage of gunfire, explosions. It's like my senses are on overdrive. I keep seeing flashes of my buddies, their faces... God, some of them didn't make it back.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. How are you managing those sensations?",
    "Client: It's... it's difficult. I'm trying to remind myself that I'm here, safe in this room. But part of me is still there, you know? My hands are shaking a bit. I feel this surge of adrenaline, like I need to be ready for anything. It's exhausting, really.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... could I have done more? Should I have reacted differently? There's this guilt, this heaviness. I made it back, but others didn't. And then there's anger too. At the situation, at myself, at the whole damn war. It's a mess of emotions, really.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts and feelings compare to when you first returned home?",
    "Client: They're... they're not as overwhelming now. Back then, it was constant. I couldn't sleep, couldn't function. Every loud noise sent me into a panic. Now, it's more... contained, I guess? But it's still there, lurking. It's like I've learned to live with this weight, but sometimes, like now, it all comes rushing back.",
    "Therapist: What helps you cope in these moments?",
    "Client: I try to ground myself. Focus on my breathing, like you've taught me. Sometimes I'll hold onto something solid, like the arms of this chair. And I try to remind myself that I'm not there anymore. It's over. But... it's hard. Sometimes I feel like I'll never truly leave that place behind.",
    "Therapist: How does sharing this experience make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix. Part of me feels relieved, like I'm finally letting out something I've held in for so long. But there's also shame. I worry about being judged, about people thinking I'm weak. And there's fear too. Fear that talking about it will make it all real again, that I'll lose control.",
    "Therapist: What do you think about that fear now?",
    "Client: I... I guess it's not as bad as I thought it would be. Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also... freeing, in a way. Like I'm finally acknowledging this part of me instead of trying to bury it. It's still painful, but maybe... maybe it's a step towards healing?",
    "Therapist: How do you see this affecting your daily life?",
    "Client: I think... I think it might help. Maybe if I can face these memories here, in this safe space, they won't have as much power over me out there. Maybe I won't be so jumpy, so on edge all the time. It's exhausting, you know? Always being on alert. If I could let some of that go... maybe I could start really living again, not just surviving.",
    "Therapist: What would that look like for you?",
    "Client: God, I don't know. Being able to go to crowded places without panicking. Enjoying fireworks with my family instead of hiding inside. Maybe even sleeping through the night without nightmares. Just... normal things, I guess. Things I used to take for granted before... before all this.",
    "Therapist: How does imagining that future make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's hopeful. And scary. Part of me wants that so badly, but another part... it's like I don't know who I am without all this. The hypervigilance, the memories... they've been a part of me for so long. But I want to try. For my family, for myself. I want to find out who I can be on the other side of all this.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you could take towards that?",
    "Client: I... I think maybe I could try talking to my wife more about this stuff. She's always been supportive, but I've kept her at arm's length. Maybe... maybe letting her in a bit more could help. And... and maybe I could try that veterans support group you mentioned. I've been avoiding it, but... maybe it's time.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... it's uncomfortable. But also... kind of exciting? Like maybe there's a chance things could actually get better. I'm scared, but... I think I'm ready to try. I can't keep living like this, always on edge, always haunted. I want to move forward, even if it's just a little bit at a time.",
    "Therapist: What feelings come up as we wrap up today?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. But also... lighter, somehow. Like I've set down a heavy pack I've been carrying. I know it's not over, that there's still a long way to go. But for the first time in a while, I feel... I don't know... maybe hopeful? Like maybe there's a path forward, even if I can't see the whole thing yet.",
