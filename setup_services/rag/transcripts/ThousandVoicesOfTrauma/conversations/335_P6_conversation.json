    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",

    "Therapist: That's normal. Just close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in the park near our house. It's a warm day, and I'm walking my neighbor's dog as a favor. The path is lined with trees, and I can hear birds chirping. Suddenly, I see a large, unleashed dog running towards us. Its teeth are bared, and it's growling...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, about a 4. I'm starting to feel tense, remembering it.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue, please.",
    "Client: The dog is getting closer, and I freeze. My heart is pounding, and I can feel sweat on my palms. The neighbor's dog starts barking, and then... oh god, the big dog lunges at us. I can hear snarling and yelping, and I'm screaming...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 7. I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: That's alright. Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) The dogs are fighting, and there's blood. I'm trying to pull them apart, but I'm so scared. My hands are shaking, and I feel dizzy. People are running towards us, shouting...",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's an 8 now. My chest feels tight, and I'm trembling.",

    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating at this point?",
    "Client: It's still an 8. I feel overwhelmed with shame and fear.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are understandable. Keep going.",
    "Client: We rush to the vet. I'm holding the injured dog, trying to comfort it. My clothes are stained with blood. At the clinic, everything's a blur. I keep replaying the attack in my mind, wondering if I could have done something differently...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down a bit. Maybe a 6? I feel drained.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing the memory.",
    "Client: The vet tells us the dog will be okay, but needs stitches. I'm relieved but still shaken. I can't stop apologizing to my neighbor. I feel like I've failed them and the poor dog. I'm afraid to go back to that park now...",
    "Therapist: What's your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: I think it's a 5 now. I feel exhausted, but a little calmer.",
    "Therapist: You did very well. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm surprised I got through it. It was hard, but... I feel a bit lighter, I think.",
