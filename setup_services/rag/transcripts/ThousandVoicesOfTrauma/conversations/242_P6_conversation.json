    "Therapist: Alright, James, let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Take a deep breath. Start when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm sitting in my dorm room, scrolling through my phone. Suddenly, I see a notification. It's another message from that anonymous account. My heart starts racing. I can feel my palms getting sweaty. The message says, \"You don't belong here. Go back to where you came from.\" I feel a lump in my throat, and my chest tightens.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 6 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Continue.",
    "Client: I try to ignore it, but more messages keep coming. They're calling me names, making fun of my accent, my skin color. I feel so alone and scared. I want to tell someone, but I'm embarrassed. What if they think I'm weak? The messages keep coming, and I can't stop reading them. My hands are shaking now.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's gone up to an 8. I can feel my heart pounding in my chest.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I start to feel dizzy. The room seems to spin a little. I'm remembering all the times this has happened before. It's like I can't escape it. I want to throw my phone across the room, but I feel paralyzed. My breathing is getting faster, and I feel like I might cry. Why me? Why can't they just leave me alone?",
    "Therapist: SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it.",
    "Client: I close my eyes, trying to block it out, but the words are burned into my mind. I feel so small, so insignificant. My roommate walks in, and I quickly hide my phone. I don't want him to see. I feel ashamed, like maybe it's my fault somehow. My throat feels tight, and I'm fighting back tears.",
    "Therapist: Current SUDS?",
    "Client: Still a 9. It's really intense.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I lie in bed that night, unable to sleep. The messages keep replaying in my head. I feel so alone, so far from home. I miss my family, my friends back home. I wonder if coming here was a mistake. Maybe they're right, maybe I don't belong. I feel a deep ache in my chest, a mixture of sadness and anger.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down a bit. Maybe a 7 now.",
    "Therapist: Good. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. It's hard to talk about, but I feel a bit lighter somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, James. Let's take a break."
