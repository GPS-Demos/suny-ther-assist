    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like my body is trembling on the inside, even though I know I'm safe here. The memories of being in that cult... they're so vivid. I can still smell the incense they used to burn during our \"cleansing\" rituals. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how young and vulnerable I was. I was only eight when my parents joined the cult. I remember feeling so confused and scared, but also... excited? They made everything seem magical and special at first. But then... (voice breaks) then things changed. I'm angry at myself for ever feeling excited about it.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to have mixed feelings. What else comes up for you?",
    "Client: Shame. So much shame. I feel like I should have known better, should have resisted more. But I was just a child. I remember one particular night when the leader... (pauses, takes a deep breath) when he came to our family's quarters and said I was chosen for a special blessing. My parents were so proud, but I was terrified. I can still feel that fear in my stomach.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How does your body feel as you recall this?",
    "Client: My stomach is in knots. My hands are clammy, and I feel a tightness in my chest. It's like I'm right back there, frozen in fear. I want to run, to scream, but I can't move. It's suffocating.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Thank you. It's hard to remember sometimes. I keep thinking about how this experience has affected my whole life. My anxiety, my trust issues... even my relationship with my husband. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever truly be free from this.",
    "Therapist: How do you see your progress in therapy relating to these feelings?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. Some days I feel stronger, like I'm finally taking back control. Other days, like today, it all feels so raw and present. But I guess the fact that I can talk about it now, that I can sit with these memories without completely falling apart... that's progress, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much anger I have. Not just at the cult leaders, but at my parents too. They were supposed to protect me, but they handed me over to those monsters. (voice rises) How could they do that? How could they be so blind? (pauses, then softer) But then I feel guilty for being angry at them. They were victims too, in a way.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have conflicting emotions. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to remind myself that I survived. That I'm here, I'm safe, and I'm working through this. (takes another deep breath) I'm not that helpless little girl anymore. I have a good life now, a loving husband, a successful career. Sometimes I forget that when I'm caught up in the memories.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful reminder. How does it feel to acknowledge that?",
    "Client: It feels... empowering, actually. Like I'm reclaiming my narrative. The cult took so much from me, but they didn't take everything. I'm still here, still fighting. And every time I face these memories, every time I talk about them, it's like I'm chipping away at their power over me.",
    "Therapist: That's a great perspective. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm noticing that the physical sensations are starting to subside a bit. The knot in my stomach is loosening, and my breathing feels easier. It's like... the more I talk about it, the more distance I can put between myself and the memories. They're still there, still painful, but they don't consume me like they used to.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. How do you want to move forward from here?",
    "Client: I want to keep working on this. It's hard, and it hurts, but I can feel it helping. I want to be able to think about my childhood without feeling like I'm drowning in fear and shame. I want to be able to trust people more easily, to not always be waiting for the other shoe to drop. And I want to forgive myself. I think that's the hardest part, but maybe the most important.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful goal. How do you feel about ending our session here?",
    "Client: I think I'm ready. This was intense, but I feel... lighter, somehow. Like I've set down a heavy burden, even if just for a moment. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know we have more work to do, but I feel hopeful.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Take care of yourself this week.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again. See you next week."
