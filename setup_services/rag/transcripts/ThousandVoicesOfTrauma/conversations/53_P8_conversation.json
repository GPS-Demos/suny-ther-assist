    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mrs. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling shaky. My hands won't stop trembling. It's like I'm right back there, you know? I can still hear the sirens, smell the tear gas. It's all so vivid.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: (deep breath) It's... it's anger. So much anger. I keep seeing that officer's face, the way he looked at me like I wasn't even human. I've never felt so... so powerless. And scared. God, I was terrified.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. Can you tell me more about those feelings of powerlessness?",
    "Client: It's... it's like being a child again. Helpless. I couldn't do anything to stop it. I keep thinking, \"Why me? What did I do wrong?\" But I know I didn't do anything wrong. I was just... existing. Being Black. And that was enough for them to... (voice breaks)",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly painful. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. Like I can't breathe properly. And there's this knot in my stomach. I feel... ashamed. Like maybe if I had done something differently, it wouldn't have happened. But then I get angry at myself for thinking that way because I know it's not my fault.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when the incident first happened?",
    "Client: They're... they're not as overwhelming now. Before, I couldn't even talk about it without breaking down completely. Now, it still hurts, but... I can breathe through it. I can recognize that I'm safe now, even when the memories feel so real.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant change. What do you make of that?",
    "Client: I guess... I'm stronger than I thought. Or maybe I'm learning to be stronger. It's like... like I'm reclaiming a part of myself that was taken away that day. But it's hard. Sometimes I feel guilty for moving forward, like I'm betraying my younger self or something.",
    "Therapist: Can you say more about that guilt?",
    "Client: It's... it's like I should stay angry. Like if I heal, I'm saying what happened was okay. But it wasn't okay. It will never be okay. And yet... I want to heal. I want to feel joy again without this... this shadow hanging over me.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to express that desire?",
    "Client: Scary. But also... liberating? Like I'm giving myself permission to live again. To not let them win by keeping me trapped in that moment forever. It's... it's a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to sit with these feelings for a bit. To acknowledge them without letting them consume me. And... and maybe to remind myself that healing doesn't mean forgetting. It doesn't mean what happened was okay. It just means I'm choosing to live.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How can we support that choice?",
    "Client: I think... I think talking about it helps. Even when it's hard. And maybe... maybe finding ways to channel this anger into something positive. To use my voice to speak out against police brutality. To help others who've been through similar experiences.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like meaningful goals. Shall we explore them further?",
    "Client: Yes, I'd like that. It feels good to have a direction, you know? Like I'm taking back some control. I know it won't be easy, but... I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: I hear your determination. What's the next step you'd like to take?",
    "Client: I think... I think I want to write about my experience. Maybe start a blog or something. Get it all out there. Not just for me, but for others who might be struggling too. Is that... is that something we could work on together?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How does the idea of sharing your story make you feel?",
    "Client: Nervous. Excited. A little scared. But mostly... hopeful. Like maybe something good can come out of all this pain. Like maybe I can turn this trauma into something meaningful.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful perspective. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I feel... drained, but in a good way? Like I've done some important work. Thank you for... for helping me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and we'll continue next week."
