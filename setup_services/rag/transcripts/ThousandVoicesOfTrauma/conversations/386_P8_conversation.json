    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not really sure. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I can still hear their voices, you know? The taunts, the laughter. It's all so vivid.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What physical sensations are you noticing right now?",
    "Client: My hands are clammy, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's like I can't take a full breath. And my stomach feels like it's in knots. It's bringing me right back to those moments in the hallway, feeling so small and helpless.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... why me? Why did they target me? Was there something wrong with me? I know logically that it wasn't my fault, but emotionally, I still struggle with that. And then I feel angry, both at them and at myself for still letting it affect me after all these years.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like a heat rising from my stomach to my throat. My jaw is clenched, and I want to scream or punch something. But then I also feel this overwhelming sadness, like a heavy weight on my shoulders. It's exhausting, really.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you notice these feelings?",
    "Client: I... I guess I'm realizing how much I've been holding onto this. It's like I've been carrying this burden around for years, and it's affecting everything - my relationships, my studies, even how I see myself. I'm tired of feeling this way, but I'm also scared of letting go. What if I can't move past this?",
    "Therapist: How does that fear manifest for you?",
    "Client: It's like... a constant buzzing in the back of my mind. Always on alert, always waiting for the next attack. I find myself second-guessing everything I say or do, worried that I'll give someone a reason to target me again. It's exhausting, really. And it makes it hard to trust people, even my boyfriend sometimes.",
    "Therapist: I hear you. How does this connect to your current relationships?",
    "Client: I guess... I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop. Like, even when things are good with my boyfriend, there's this part of me that's waiting for him to turn on me, to start making fun of me like those bullies did. It's not fair to him, I know, but I can't seem to shake it.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much this has affected my self-esteem. Like, even now, sitting here talking about it, there's this voice in my head telling me that I'm weak for still being affected by this. That I should just 'get over it'. But another part of me is angry that I even have to deal with this at all.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to acknowledge that anger?",
    "Client: It's... liberating, in a way. Like, for so long I've been blaming myself, thinking I should have done something differently. But now I'm realizing that anger isn't just towards myself, it's towards them too. They had no right to treat me that way. No one deserves that.",
    "Therapist: What's it like to stand up for yourself in this way?",
    "Client: It's... empowering, I think. But also a little scary. It's like I'm finally allowing myself to feel all these emotions I've been pushing down for so long. There's relief, but also this overwhelming sadness for the girl I was, who had to go through all that.",
    "Therapist: How does that sadness feel?",
    "Client: It's like a deep ache in my chest. I want to reach back in time and protect that younger version of myself. Tell her it's not her fault, that she's worthy of love and respect. I guess... I'm realizing that maybe I need to start telling myself those things now.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to start believing those things?",
    "Client: It would be... transformative, I think. Like, if I could truly believe that I'm worthy, that what happened wasn't my fault... maybe I could start trusting people more. Maybe I could stop constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop in my relationship. Maybe I could even start standing up for myself more in other areas of my life.",
    "Therapist: How does that possibility feel?",
    "Client: It feels... hopeful. Like maybe there's a way forward that doesn't involve carrying all this pain and fear around with me all the time. But it also feels a bit overwhelming. I've been living with these beliefs for so long, the idea of changing them is both exciting and terrifying.",
    "Therapist: What's scary about it?",
    "Client: I guess... it's the unknown. These feelings, as painful as they are, are familiar. They're what I know. The idea of letting them go, of potentially opening myself up to being hurt again... it's frightening. But at the same time, I'm so tired of living this way. I want to be able to trust, to love, to just... be, without this constant fear and self-doubt.",
    "Therapist: What do you need to move towards that?",
    "Client: I think... I need to keep doing this work. To keep facing these memories and feelings, as hard as it is. And maybe... maybe I need to start practicing being kinder to myself. To challenge that critical voice in my head that still sounds like those bullies. It won't be easy, but I think it might be worth it.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but also lighter somehow. Like I've put down a heavy backpack I've been carrying for years. There's still a lot to work through, but for the first time in a long time, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this.",
