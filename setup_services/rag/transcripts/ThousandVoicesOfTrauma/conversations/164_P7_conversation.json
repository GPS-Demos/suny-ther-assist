    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and take a deep breath. When you're ready, describe the airplane crash scene.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm at the airport. It's a sunny day, and I'm boarding the plane for my business trip. I find my seat, 14C, and settle in. The flight attendants are going through their safety instructions, but I'm not really paying attention. I'm thinking about my meeting later that day.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: The plane takes off, and everything seems normal at first. But about 30 minutes into the flight, there's a sudden jolt. The plane starts shaking violently. People are screaming. I can hear the engines making a terrible noise. My heart is racing, and I'm gripping the armrests so tightly my knuckles are white.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The oxygen masks drop down, and there's chaos all around me. I'm fumbling with my mask, trying to put it on, but my hands are shaking so much. The plane is nosediving now, and I can see the ground coming up fast through the window. I'm terrified, thinking about my family, my children... I don't want to die.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: There's a deafening crash, and everything goes dark for a moment. When I come to, I'm upside down, still strapped to my seat. There's smoke everywhere, and I can hear people crying and screaming. I'm in so much pain, but I manage to unbuckle my seatbelt and fall to what used to be the ceiling of the plane.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: I'm crawling through the wreckage, trying to find a way out. The smoke is getting thicker, and I can barely breathe. I see... I see bodies, some not moving. I'm calling out, asking if anyone can hear me. My legs are cut up from the debris, and I think my arm might be broken. I'm so scared, but I keep pushing forward.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel scared. You're safe now.",
    "Client: Finally, I see a crack of light. I push towards it, and suddenly I'm outside. The plane is in pieces around me, and there's a field on fire. I collapse on the ground, gasping for air. I can hear sirens in the distance. I'm alive, but I can't stop shaking. I'm overwhelmed with relief and guilt at the same time. Why did I survive when others didn't?",
    "Therapist: You've done an excellent job describing the scene. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. My heart is still racing, and I can feel tears on my cheeks. It's like I was right back there again. But... I also feel a bit lighter, like I've let something out that I've been holding in for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You've shown incredible strength.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still so vivid in my mind. The sounds, the smells, the fear... But talking about it like this, it feels different somehow. Like I'm starting to process it rather than just reliving it.",
    "Therapist: That's exactly what we're aiming for. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I guess I am. It's still hard, though. Sometimes I feel guilty for surviving when others didn't. And I'm still terrified of flying. Every time I see a plane or hear one overhead, I get anxious.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are understandable. We'll work through them together.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It helps to know I'm not alone in this. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel normal again, you know? Like, will there ever be a time when I can think about this without feeling overwhelmed?",
    "Therapist: It's possible. You're already showing remarkable resilience.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot to hear. I know it's a long process, but I'm committed to working through this. I want to be able to travel again without panic, to not let this experience define me. It's just... it's hard to imagine right now.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is admirable. Shall we continue?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm ready. There's more I want to share about what happened after I got out of the plane. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Whenever you're ready.",
    "Client: Alright. So, after I collapsed on the ground outside the plane, I remember looking around and seeing other survivors. Some were wandering around in shock, others were crying or calling out for help. The heat from the fires was intense, and the air was thick with smoke.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I tried to stand up, but my legs were weak. I crawled away from the wreckage, towards a group of people who seemed to be gathering. As I got closer, I realized they were other survivors, huddling together. Someone helped me up, and we all just stood there, watching the chaos around us.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel emotional. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I remember feeling so... helpless. We could hear people still trapped in the plane, but the fires were too intense to get close. The wait for emergency services felt like an eternity. When they finally arrived, it was a flurry of activity. Paramedics were checking everyone, firefighters were battling the blaze. I was put on a stretcher and taken to an ambulance.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. Continue.",
    "Client: In the ambulance, reality started to sink in. I was alive, but I was injured and in shock. They were asking me questions, but I could barely focus. All I could think about was my family, wondering if they knew what had happened. I wanted to call them, to hear their voices, but everything was so chaotic.",
    "Therapist: That must have been overwhelming. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard to describe. Reliving it is painful, but there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe relief? Like I'm finally letting it out instead of keeping it bottled up inside. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's a common and healthy response.",
    "Client: That's good to hear. I've carried this with me for so long, it's almost become a part of me. But talking about it like this, it feels like I'm starting to separate myself from the event. It happened to me, but it doesn't define me. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're making great progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still a struggle, but I feel like I'm moving forward. There are still nights when I wake up in a cold sweat, reliving the crash. But they're less frequent now. And talking about it like this, it feels like I'm taking back some control.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. You're doing well.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel hopeful. Like maybe one day, I'll be able to think about this without feeling overwhelmed by fear and anxiety. It's a small step, but it feels significant.",
    "Therapist: It is significant. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think I am, a little bit. It's not easy to face this, but I'm doing it. And even though it's painful, I can see how it's helping. I'm grateful for your guidance through this process.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. This session has been intense, but in a good way. I feel drained, but also a bit lighter. Thank you for your support and patience.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Take care of yourself."
