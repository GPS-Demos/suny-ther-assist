    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure exercise. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the airplane crash scene?",
    "Client: Okay... I was sitting in my seat, fastened in. The plane started to shake violently. People were screaming. I... I can feel my heart racing just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that memory.",
    "Client: The oxygen masks dropped down. I fumbled to put mine on, my hands were shaking so much. The plane was falling fast. I could see the ground getting closer through the window. I thought... I thought I was going to die.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: The impact was... it was like nothing I've ever felt before. The noise was deafening. Metal twisting, people crying out. I was thrown forward, the seatbelt cutting into my waist. Everything went dark for a moment.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: When I came to, there was smoke everywhere. I could barely breathe. I unbuckled my seatbelt and tried to stand, but my legs were so weak. People were pushing, trying to get to the emergency exits. I was so disoriented.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. What happened next?",
    "Client: I managed to stumble towards an exit. The slide had deployed, but it was chaos. People were jumping, falling. I hesitated for a moment, terrified of getting hurt again. But then I just... I just went for it.",
    "Therapist: That took courage. How did you feel?",
    "Client: Scared out of my mind. But also... determined, I guess? As I slid down, I hit the ground hard. My ankle twisted, but the adrenaline was pumping so much I barely felt it. I just started running away from the plane as fast as I could.",
    "Therapist: You showed incredible strength. Continue.",
    "Client: I ran until I couldn't anymore. When I finally stopped and looked back, I saw the plane engulfed in flames. The reality of what had just happened hit me like a ton of bricks. I started shaking uncontrollably, and I couldn't stop crying.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel overwhelmed. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I remember feeling so guilty. Why did I survive when others might not have? I kept replaying the crash in my mind, wondering if I could have done something differently, helped someone else.",
    "Therapist: Those thoughts are common. You did your best.",
    "Client: The wait for rescue felt like an eternity. Every noise made me jump. I was hyper-aware of everything around me. When the rescue teams finally arrived, I felt a mix of relief and dread. Relief that help was here, but dread about what they might find.",
    "Therapist: You've come so far. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still hard to talk about. My heart is racing, and I feel a bit shaky. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I can face this memory without completely falling apart.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without having a full-blown panic attack. It's still scary, but it feels... manageable now. Like I'm starting to process it instead of just reliving it.",
    "Therapist: That's exactly the goal. You should be proud.",
    "Client: I am, actually. It's weird to say that, but I am proud of myself. This whole experience has been so isolating. Being able to talk about it, even though it's hard, feels like I'm reclaiming a part of myself.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How else has this affected you?",
    "Client: It's changed everything. My relationships, my work, how I see the world. I'm more anxious now, especially about traveling. But I'm also more appreciative of life, of the small moments. It's a strange mix of fear and gratitude.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response to trauma. You're healing.",
    "Client: I hope so. Some days are better than others. Sometimes I still have nightmares or find myself avoiding anything that reminds me of flying. But being able to talk about it like this... it gives me hope that I can move forward.",
    "Therapist: That hope is crucial. You're making progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. I know we're nearing the end of our session, and I just want to say how much I appreciate your support through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm finally starting to see a way forward.",
    "Therapist: You've done the hard work. I'm here to support you.",
    "Client: I'm grateful for that. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I might actually be okay someday. That's... that's huge for me.",
    "Therapist: It is huge. You should be very proud of yourself."
