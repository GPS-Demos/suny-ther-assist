    "Therapist: Mrs. Ahmadi, today we'll begin imaginal exposure. Are you ready to discuss this?",
    "Client: I suppose so, but I'm not entirely sure what that means. Can you explain it to me?",
    "Therapist: Of course. It's revisiting your trauma memory in a safe space. How does that sound?",
    "Client: Oh my... That sounds quite daunting. I've spent years trying to forget about my childhood and my recent divorce. The idea of bringing those memories back... it's frightening.",
    "Therapist: I understand your hesitation. What concerns you most?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about feeling overwhelmed. At my age, I don't know if I can handle reliving those experiences. And with my depression... I fear it might make things worse.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace and I'll support you throughout.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. But how exactly will this help me? I've managed to function for years by avoiding these thoughts.",
    "Therapist: It helps reduce PTSD symptoms by processing the memory safely. What do you think?",
    "Client: I see. It makes sense, but it's still scary. Will I have to share every detail of what happened?",
    "Therapist: You control what you share. We focus on key aspects that trouble you most.",
    "Client: Alright, that makes me feel a bit better. I appreciate your patience with my questions. It's not easy to confront these things at my age.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. How are you feeling about starting?",
    "Client: I'm nervous, but also... hopeful? Maybe this will help me find some peace finally. My husband has been so supportive through everything, but I know my past affects our relationship too.",
    "Therapist: That hope is important. Shall we begin with a breathing exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would help calm my nerves. You know, it's strange. I've lived through so much - immigrating here, building a life, raising children - yet these old wounds still feel so fresh.",
    "Therapist: That's common with trauma. Ready for the breathing exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, I'm ready. Thank you for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't judge.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Let's start. Breathe in slowly..."
