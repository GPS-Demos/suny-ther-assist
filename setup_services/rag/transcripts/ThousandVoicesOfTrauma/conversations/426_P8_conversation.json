    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. My heart's still racing a bit. It felt so real, you know? Like I was right back there in the car, hearing the screeching tires and feeling that jolt. I can still smell the burnt rubber and feel the airbag against my face.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I think. No, maybe it's more like... anxiety? Yeah, anxiety. It's like this tight knot in my chest that won't go away. I keep thinking about what could have happened if the crash had been worse. What if I had died? Or what if I had hurt someone else? It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Where do you feel that anxiety in your body?",
    "Client: It's mainly in my chest, but also in my stomach. It's like this heavy weight pressing down on me. My hands are a bit shaky too. I notice I'm clenching my jaw... I didn't even realize I was doing that until now.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep replaying the accident in my head. I see the other car coming towards me, and I feel so helpless. I think about how I should have been more careful, maybe if I had left a few minutes earlier or later, it wouldn't have happened. And then I feel guilty because I know it wasn't really my fault, but I can't shake this feeling that I could have prevented it somehow.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts and feelings compare to right after the accident?",
    "Client: They're... they're not as intense now. Right after the accident, I was in shock. I couldn't think straight. I remember feeling numb at first, and then this overwhelming panic set in. Now, it's more of a constant worry. Like, I'm always on edge when I'm in a car. But I guess it's not as paralyzing as it was immediately after.",
    "Therapist: What's different about how you're coping now?",
    "Client: Well, I'm here talking about it, for one. That's something I couldn't do before. I used to just shut down when anyone mentioned the accident. And I'm starting to recognize when I'm having these anxious thoughts. I still have them, but I can sometimes catch myself and try to... I don't know, rationalize them a bit? It's hard, though.",
    "Therapist: What's challenging about rationalizing those thoughts?",
    "Client: It's like... logically, I know that accidents happen and that I can't control everything. But emotionally, I still feel responsible. There's this disconnect between what I know and what I feel. And sometimes, the feelings are just so strong that they overpower any logical thinking. It's frustrating because I want to move past this, but my emotions keep pulling me back.",
    "Therapist: How does this experience relate to other areas of your life?",
    "Client: I've noticed I'm more hesitant in general now. Like, I second-guess a lot of my decisions, even small ones. It's affecting my studies too. I'm always worried about making mistakes, which makes it hard to focus sometimes. And socially, I've been withdrawing a bit. It's hard to explain to my friends why I'm so anxious all the time. I feel like they don't really understand.",
    "Therapist: What do you think could help bridge that gap with your friends?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe if I could explain it better? But it's hard to put into words. Sometimes I think about telling them about the therapy, about how I'm working on it. But then I worry they'll think I'm weak or something. I know that's probably not true, but it's a fear I have.",
    "Therapist: How does that fear of being seen as weak connect to your experience?",
    "Client: I guess... I've always tried to be the strong one, you know? Even before the accident. I'm the first in my family to go to university, and there's a lot of pressure to succeed. The accident made me feel vulnerable in a way I've never felt before. It's like it exposed this part of me that I've always tried to hide - the part that's scared and unsure. And now I'm worried that if people see that part, they'll think less of me.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to allow that vulnerability?",
    "Client: That's... that's a tough question. I've never really thought about it that way. I suppose it would mean admitting that I'm not always in control, that I can be affected by things. Maybe it would mean letting people see the real me, not just the version I think they want to see. But that's scary. What if they don't like what they see? What if I don't like what I see?",
    "Therapist: How might showing vulnerability change things?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe it would take some of the pressure off? Like, I wouldn't have to pretend to be okay all the time. And maybe... maybe my friends would understand me better. They might even share some of their own struggles. I guess it could bring us closer. But it's hard to imagine actually doing it. It feels like such a big risk.",
    "Therapist: What small step could you take towards that?",
    "Client: Hmm... Maybe I could start by telling my closest friend about the therapy? Not everything, just that I'm going and why. That feels scary, but also kind of... relieving? Like it might be a weight off my shoulders. Yeah, I think I could try that.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that idea?",
    "Client: It's a mix of nervous and... hopeful, I guess? Nervous because it's new and scary, but hopeful because it feels like a step forward. Like maybe it's a way to start taking back some control, you know? Not by pretending everything's fine, but by actually dealing with it. It's a weird feeling, but not entirely bad.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing about yourself right now?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, somehow? Like talking about all this has released some of the tension I've been carrying. My chest doesn't feel as tight. I'm still anxious, but it's not as overwhelming. And I feel... I don't know, maybe a little proud? Like I've faced something difficult and come out the other side. It's a small thing, I know, but it feels significant.",
    "Therapist: How might you use this experience going forward?",
    "Client: I think... I think I can use it as a reminder that I can face my fears and survive. That talking about things, even when it's hard, can help. Maybe I can try to be more open with my friends, bit by bit. And when I'm feeling overwhelmed by memories of the accident, I can remember that I've worked through those feelings before and I can do it again. It's not easy, but it feels possible now.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How are you feeling as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... tired, but in a good way? Like I've done something important. I'm still nervous about the future, about dealing with all this, but I feel a bit more equipped to handle it. And I'm grateful, you know? For this space to talk and work through things. It's hard, but I think it's helping.",
