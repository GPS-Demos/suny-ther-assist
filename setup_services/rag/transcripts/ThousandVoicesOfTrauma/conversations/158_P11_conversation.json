    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Patel?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving that moment when I heard about the crash... it's bringing up so many emotions. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved? It's strange.",
    "Therapist: What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The silence. When I first got the call, there was this... deafening silence. I remember thinking, \"This can't be real.\" My son, my beautiful boy... gone in an instant. I keep replaying that moment over and over in my mind.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. My heart was racing, and I felt that same panic rising in my chest. But, you know, it wasn't as overwhelming as I thought it would be. I mean, it was still difficult, but I felt more... in control, I suppose. Like I could observe the memory without being completely consumed by it.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant observation.",
    "Client: Yes, I suppose it is. It's just... I've been avoiding thinking about it for so long. Always keeping busy, you know? But facing it head-on like this... it's scary, but also... I don't know, maybe necessary? I've been having these nightmares about planes crashing, and I can't even watch the news anymore without panicking. Do you think this will help with that?",
    "Therapist: How do you see this connecting to your symptoms?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... by facing the memory, I'm not letting it control me anymore? It's like... I'm acknowledging what happened instead of pretending it didn't. Maybe that's why I've been so anxious all the time. I've been trying to run from something that's a part of me now.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's... it's not easy. Sometimes I feel guilty for even trying to move forward. Like I'm betraying my son's memory somehow. But I know he wouldn't want me to live like this, constantly afraid and sad. I just... I miss him so much.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those feelings.",
    "Client: I know, but it's hard. My husband, he's been so patient with me, but I can see the worry in his eyes. He misses our old life too, you know? We used to travel so much, and now... now I can't even think about getting on a plane without having a panic attack. I want to be able to live again, to honor my son's memory by embracing life. But it feels so... insurmountable sometimes.",
    "Therapist: What small step could you take towards that goal?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe I could start by looking at some of our old family photos? The ones from our trips together. I've been avoiding them, but perhaps it's time to remember the good times too, not just the loss.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful approach.",
    "Client: Yes, I think so too. It's scary, but... I want to try. And maybe... maybe I could talk to my husband about it? Share some memories with him? We've both been so caught up in our grief, we've hardly talked about the happy times we had with our son.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that idea?",
    "Client: It's... bittersweet. But I think it might be healing, for both of us. And who knows? Maybe someday we'll be able to travel again, to visit the places he loved. It's a long way off, but... for the first time in a while, I feel like it might be possible.",
    "Therapist: That's a hopeful perspective.",
    "Client: It is, isn't it? I didn't expect to feel this way after reliving such a painful memory. But it's like... by facing it, I'm reclaiming a part of myself. The pain is still there, of course, but it doesn't feel quite so... suffocating anymore. Is this... is this normal?",
    "Therapist: Everyone's journey is unique. How do you feel about your progress?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm proud of myself. It's been so hard, and I know there's still a long way to go, but... I feel like I've taken a step forward today. It's tiny, but it's there. And that gives me hope.",
    "Therapist: Your effort and insight are commendable.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I appreciate your guidance through this. It's not easy, but I'm starting to see why it's important. I want to keep working on this, to keep facing these memories. I want to be able to think of my son and smile again, not just cry. Do you think that's possible?",
    "Therapist: What do you think?",
    "Client: I... I think it is. It might take time, and a lot more work, but... yes, I believe it's possible. And I'm willing to do whatever it takes to get there. For my son, for my husband, and for myself.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful commitment.",
    "Client: It is, isn't it? I feel... I feel stronger somehow. Still scared, still sad, but... stronger. Like I can face this, one step at a time. Thank you for helping me see that."
