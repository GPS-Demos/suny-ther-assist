    "Therapist: Welcome, Marcus. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a lot on my mind. I've been dreading this, but I also know it might help. It's just... hard to face, you know?",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's start slowly. Can you tell me about the memory we'll be working with today?",
    "Client: Yeah... it's about my ex-girlfriend breaking up with me. It happened a few months ago, but it still feels so raw.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Before we begin, let's check your SUDS level. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed do you feel right now?",
    "Client: I'd say... maybe a 40? My stomach's a bit in knots just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember, you're safe here. Close your eyes if you're comfortable, and describe the scene as if it's happening now.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm... I'm in my dorm room. It's late afternoon, and the sun's casting this orange glow through the window. I'm sitting on my bed, scrolling through my phone, when I get a text from Amara. She... she wants to talk. My heart starts racing immediately because I can just tell something's off.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My palms are getting sweaty, and there's this tightness in my chest. I... I can barely breathe. I text her back, asking if everything's okay, but deep down, I already know it's not.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: She... she says she's coming over. God, the wait is agonizing. I keep pacing around my tiny room, checking my phone every few seconds. When I finally hear the knock, I almost jump out of my skin.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe a 60? My heart's pounding just like it did that day.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing great. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I open the door, and there she is. Amara looks... sad, but determined. She doesn't even hug me like she usually does. She just walks in and sits on the edge of my bed. I... I can barely look at her. The silence is deafening.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking, \"This is it. She's going to leave me.\" And I feel so... so small. So worthless. Like I'm that kid back in high school getting picked on all over again.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're describing it as if it's happening now. What does Amara say?",
    "Client: She... she takes a deep breath and says, \"Marcus, we need to talk about us.\" Her voice is shaking a little. \"I... I don't think this is working anymore.\" And just like that, my world starts crumbling.",
    "Therapist: How does your body react to hearing those words?",
    "Client: It's like... like I've been punched in the gut. I can't breathe. My vision gets blurry, and I feel dizzy. I... I want to say something, anything, but no words come out.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. Maybe 75? I feel like I'm right back there, reliving it all over again.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: Amara starts talking about how we've grown apart, how she needs to focus on her studies, how it's not my fault. But I... I can barely hear her over the roaring in my ears. I keep thinking, \"Not again. Please, not again.\" It's like every rejection, every taunt from those bullies in high school is flooding back.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What do you want to say to Amara?",
    "Client: I... I want to beg her to stay. I want to promise I'll be better, I'll be whatever she needs. But... but I also feel this surge of anger. I want to lash out, to hurt her like she's hurting me. Instead, I just... I just sit there, frozen.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot of conflicting emotions. How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: My... my fists are clenched so tight my nails are digging into my palms. My jaw is clenched, and I can feel this tension headache starting. I'm... I'm shaking, but I don't know if it's from anger or fear or both.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Marcus. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's really high. Maybe 85? I feel like I'm about to explode or break down.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here. What happens as Amara continues talking?",
    "Client: She... she keeps talking, but her words start to blur together. I catch phrases like \"still care about you\" and \"hope we can be friends,\" but they just... they just make it worse. Each word feels like another punch. And then... then she starts crying.",
    "Therapist: How do you react to her tears?",
    "Client: I... I feel torn. Part of me wants to comfort her, to hold her one last time. But another part is... is almost glad she's hurting too. And that makes me feel awful, which just adds to the mess of emotions.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have conflicting feelings. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I finally find my voice. It comes out all choked and broken. I ask her, \"Is there someone else?\" And the way she hesitates before saying no... it's like another knife in my heart. I don't know if I believe her.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about all the times I thought things were going well. All the plans we made. And now it's all... it's all crumbling. I feel so stupid, so naive. Like I should have seen this coming.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still really high. Maybe 80? My chest feels so tight, like I can't get enough air.",
    "Therapist: Take a few deep breaths with me. In... and out. You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: Amara stands up. She... she says she should go. And I... I can't even look at her. I hear her whisper \"I'm sorry\" before she leaves. The sound of the door closing behind her is... it's so final. And then I'm alone.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling of being alone. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I break down. I slide off the bed onto the floor, and I just... I just sob. It's like everything I've been holding back just comes pouring out. I can't breathe, I can't think. I just cry until I'm exhausted.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Marcus. How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. Empty. My eyes are burning, my throat is raw. My whole body aches, like I've run a marathon. And there's this... this hollow feeling in my chest.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down a bit. Maybe 70? I just feel... numb.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've been through a lot. What do you do after crying?",
    "Client: I... I just sit there on the floor for a long time. The room gets dark as the sun sets, but I don't bother turning on the lights. I keep checking my phone, hoping for a message from Amara saying it was all a mistake. But... there's nothing.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about the lack of messages?",
    "Client: It's... it's like another blow. Part of me is relieved because I don't know what I'd say to her. But mostly, it just reinforces that it's really over. That she's really gone.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Marcus. We're going to start winding down now. Can you bring yourself back to the present moment?",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, I can do that. It's... it's hard, though. The memory feels so vivid.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Take a few deep breaths. Remember where you are now. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down. Maybe a 50 now? I still feel shaky, but... but I'm here, in your office. Not back in that dorm room.",
    "Therapist: You did very well today, Marcus. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. But also... I don't know. There's a part of me that feels... lighter? Like I've let something out that I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after these sessions. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves before we end.",
    "Client: Okay... yeah, that sounds good. I... I appreciate you guiding me through this. It was tough, but... but I think it helped.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. Let's focus on some grounding exercises now."
