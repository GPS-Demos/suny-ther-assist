    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is still there, you know? My heart's racing, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. The memory of that day at the refugee camp, it's so vivid now. I can almost smell the dust and hear the chaos around me.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. All those people, crammed together, waiting for something, anything to happen. And then when the fight broke out... God, I thought we were going to die right there. It's like I'm reliving it all over again.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly intense. How are you managing those feelings in this moment?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. I'm trying to remind myself that I'm here, safe in this room. But part of me is still there, you know? I can feel my hands shaking, just like they did that day. I'm trying to take deep breaths, but it feels like I can't get enough air.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Can you tell me more about what you're experiencing physically?",
    "Client: My muscles are so tense, especially in my shoulders and neck. There's this knot in my stomach, like I'm about to be sick. And my legs... they feel weak, like they might give out if I try to stand. It's as if my body is preparing to run or fight, even though there's no real danger here.",
    "Therapist: How does this compare to how you usually feel day-to-day?",
    "Client: It's... it's much more intense. Usually, I can push these memories away, keep them at a distance. But now, it's like I'm right back there. The fear, the uncertainty, it's all so real. And yet, there's also this strange sense of... I don't know, maybe relief? Like I'm finally facing it instead of running away.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What do you make of that feeling of relief?",
    "Client: I... I never thought about it that way before. Maybe it's because I've been carrying this weight for so long, you know? Always trying to keep it locked away. But now that I'm talking about it, really experiencing it... it's terrifying, but also... freeing, in a way? Like I'm finally acknowledging what happened to me, what I went through.",
    "Therapist: How does that acknowledgment feel?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. On one hand, it hurts. It hurts so much to remember, to feel all of this again. But on the other hand, there's this small voice inside me saying, \"You survived this. You made it through.\" And that voice... it gives me strength, even in the midst of all this pain.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm starting to feel a bit calmer now. My breathing is slowing down a little. And I'm becoming more aware of the room around me, the chair I'm sitting in. It's like... like I'm coming back to the present, bit by bit. But the memory, it's still there, just not as overwhelming as before.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that shift?",
    "Client: It's... it's a relief, honestly. But also a bit scary. Part of me is afraid that if I let go of this intensity, I'll forget. Forget how bad it was, forget the people who didn't make it out. Is that... is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Many people experience similar concerns. How would you like to honor those memories?",
    "Client: I... I never thought about it like that. Honoring the memories... Maybe by sharing my story? By helping others who've been through similar experiences? It feels important to keep the memory alive, but not let it control me. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How might that look in your daily life?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I could volunteer at a refugee support center. Use my experiences to help others who are going through what I went through. And maybe... maybe I could start writing about it. Not just for others, but for myself too. To process it all, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a meaningful approach. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, to be honest. But there's also this sense of... I don't know, maybe hope? Like I've taken a step forward today. It's small, but it feels significant. And even though I know this journey is far from over, I feel a bit stronger, a bit more ready to face what comes next.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful reflection. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to explore more about how I can use my experiences to help others. And maybe... maybe we could work on some strategies for managing the intense emotions when they come up outside of our sessions? I want to be able to face these memories without being completely overwhelmed by them.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm finally moving forward instead of just treading water. And that... that means more than I can say.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredible work today. How would you like to ground yourself before leaving?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to take a few deep breaths, maybe focus on the present moment for a bit. Feel my feet on the ground, my body in the chair. Just... just be here, now, you know? And maybe... maybe remind myself that I'm safe, that I've survived, and that I'm on a path towards healing.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent idea. Let's do that together."
