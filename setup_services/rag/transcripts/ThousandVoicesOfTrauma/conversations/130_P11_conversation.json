    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's always intense revisiting those memories of my time in the cult. My heart's still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: Understandable. What stood out to you this time?",
    "Client: The sense of isolation, I think. I remembered how cut off we were from the outside world. It's like we were in this bubble, and everything outside was... dangerous, or corrupt. I can still feel that fear of the \"outside\" sometimes, even now.",
    "Therapist: Hmm. How does that connect to your daily life now?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... I still struggle with trusting people sometimes. It's like I'm always waiting for someone to try and manipulate me or control me. Even simple things, like my wife suggesting we try a new restaurant, can make me anxious. I start wondering if there's some hidden agenda.",
    "Therapist: I see. What helps you cope with that anxiety?",
    "Client: I've been trying to remind myself that I'm not in that situation anymore. I have choices now. Sometimes I'll take a deep breath and ask myself, \"What's the worst that could happen if I try this new thing?\" Usually, the answer is nothing too terrible.",
    "Therapist: That's a great strategy. How else has this affected you?",
    "Client: It's... it's made it hard to form close friendships. I'm always second-guessing people's motives. And sometimes, I feel this overwhelming guilt about the things I did or said while I was in the cult. I know I was being manipulated, but... it's still hard to forgive myself.",
    "Therapist: That's a common struggle. What helps with the guilt?",
    "Client: Talking about it helps, actually. Both here and with my wife. She's been so patient and understanding. And... I've started volunteering at a local community center. Helping others, being part of something positive... it helps balance out some of that guilt, I guess.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful. How did today's session compare to previous ones?",
    "Client: It was... easier, I think. Still intense, but I didn't feel as overwhelmed as I have before. I was able to stay more present, if that makes sense. I could observe the memories without getting completely sucked in.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. What do you attribute that to?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I'm starting to believe that these memories can't hurt me anymore. They're just memories, not my current reality. And I think the breathing exercises we've been practicing have helped too. I caught myself using them during the exposure without even really thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. What's your takeaway from today?",
    "Client: I think... I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. And maybe, just maybe, I'm starting to let go of some of that fear and guilt. It's a process, but... I feel like I'm moving forward.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How will you carry this forward?",
    "Client: I want to keep practicing those breathing exercises. And maybe... maybe I'll try to be a little more open with people. Not everyone is out to get me, right? It's scary, but I think it might be worth it.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a good plan. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm finally starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel. I'm not there yet, but... I think I can get there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work. See you next week?",
    "Client: Definitely. I'll be here."
