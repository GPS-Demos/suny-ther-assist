    "Therapist: Welcome, Margaret. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Oh, hello Dr. Thompson. I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. I know we've been working up to this, but now that we're here, I'm not sure I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate that. It's just... these memories, they've been locked away for so long. I'm afraid of what might come out.",
    "Therapist: We're here together. Let's start with some deep breaths.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... okay. I think I can do this.",
    "Therapist: Good. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed do you feel right now?",
    "Client: I'd say... about a 60. My heart's racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Let's begin. Close your eyes and describe what you see.",
    "Client: (Closes eyes) I... I'm in our old house. The living room. It's dark, but I can see the outlines of the furniture. The air feels heavy, like a storm is coming. I'm small, maybe six or seven years old. I'm hiding behind the big armchair, the one Dad always sat in. I can smell the lingering scent of his cigarettes.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What's happening?",
    "Client: I hear shouting from the kitchen. Mom and Dad are fighting again. Their voices are getting louder, angrier. I'm squeezing my teddy bear so tight, my knuckles are white. I... I want to cover my ears, but I'm afraid to move.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What do you hear?",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) I hear... I hear the sound of glass breaking. Mom screams. There's a thud, like something heavy falling. Oh God, I'm so scared. I want to run, but my legs won't move.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 75. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Let's ground ourselves. Feel your feet on the floor. Now, continue.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) Okay. I... I peek around the chair. I can see into the kitchen now. Mom's on the floor, surrounded by broken dishes. Dad's standing over her, his fists clenched. He's yelling something about her being worthless. Mom's crying, trying to shield her face.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... helpless. Terrified. I want to help Mom, but I'm frozen. My stomach hurts, like I might throw up. I can taste fear in my mouth, metallic and bitter.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Margaret. Keep going.",
    "Client: Dad grabs Mom's arm, yanking her up. She cries out in pain. I can see her lip is bleeding. I want to scream, to tell him to stop, but no sound comes out. I'm shaking so hard, I'm afraid they'll hear me.",
    "Therapist: What's happening in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. I'm having trouble breathing. It's like I'm back there, small and powerless.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe with me. In... and out.",
    "Client: (Breathes deeply) Thank you. I... I think I can continue.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: Mom tries to push Dad away, but he's so much stronger. He slaps her hard across the face. The sound echoes through the house. I flinch, bumping into a side table. A lamp wobbles, and I grab it just before it falls.",
    "Therapist: And then?",
    "Client: They both freeze. Dad's head snaps towards the living room. \"Who's there?\" he shouts. His voice is... it's like thunder. I'm trembling, praying he won't find me. Mom's eyes are wide with fear, but she calls out, \"It's probably just the cat, John. Please, let's stop this.\"",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm at an 85. My heart's pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Margaret. This is just a memory. Take another deep breath.",
    "Client: (Inhales deeply) Okay. Dad storms into the living room. I try to make myself smaller behind the chair. I can smell the alcohol on him as he gets closer. He's muttering, looking around. I'm holding my breath, afraid even the slightest sound will give me away.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it.",
    "Client: He's so close now. I can see his shoes from under the chair. Suddenly, he moves the chair. I'm exposed, clutching my teddy bear. His face... it's a mix of anger and surprise. \"Margaret?\" he says, his voice softer now, but still slurred. \"What are you doing up?\"",
    "Therapist: What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I can't speak. Tears are running down my face. Mom appears in the doorway, her face bruised. She sees me and rushes over, scooping me up in her arms. \"It's okay, baby,\" she whispers, but her voice is shaking. Dad just stands there, looking... lost.",
    "Therapist: How does this make you feel?",
    "Client: Confused. Scared. A part of me wants to comfort Dad, to make everything okay. But I'm also terrified of him. And angry. So angry that he hurt Mom, that he made me feel this way.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot of complex emotions. It's okay to feel them all.",
    "Client: Mom carries me to my room. I can hear Dad following, apologizing, saying it won't happen again. But it does. It always does. I bury my face in Mom's shoulder, wishing I could make it all go away.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well, Margaret. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually down to about 70. Talking about it... it's hard, but it feels like I'm letting something go.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's take a moment to breathe together.",
    "Client: (Breathes deeply) Thank you. I... I've never talked about this in so much detail before.",
    "Therapist: You've shown immense courage. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Drained, but... lighter somehow. Like I've been carrying this weight for so long, and now I've set some of it down.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after processing trauma. You did very well today.",
    "Client: I never realized how much I remembered. It's like once I started talking, it all came flooding back.",
    "Therapist: That's often the case. Your mind protected you by suppressing these memories.",
    "Client: I keep thinking about my mom. How she tried to protect me, even when she was hurting.",
    "Therapist: That seems to be a significant part of this memory for you.",
    "Client: It is. I... I wish I could have done more to help her.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you were a child. It wasn't your responsibility to fix the situation.",
    "Client: I know that logically, but emotionally... it's hard to accept.",
    "Therapist: That's completely normal. We'll work on that feeling of responsibility.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I feel exhausted, but also... I don't know, maybe a bit stronger?",
    "Therapist: That's a positive sign. How would you rate your distress now?",
    "Client: I'd say it's down to about a 50. Still there, but not overwhelming anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's scary, but... I think it's helping. I want to keep going.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. We'll continue at your pace.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable strength today, Margaret.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Thompson. I... I think I'm ready to end for today.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's do a quick grounding exercise before we finish.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Describe five things you can see in this room.",
    "Client: I see... your desk, the painting on the wall, the plant in the corner, my purse, and the clock.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now four things you can touch.",
    "Client: The armrest of this chair, my necklace, the fabric of my skirt, and my hair.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Three things you can hear?",
    "Client: The ticking of the clock, a car passing outside, and the hum of the air conditioner.",
    "Therapist: Two things you can smell?",
    "Client: The lavender air freshener and... is that coffee?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it is. Lastly, one thing you can taste?",
    "Client: The mint from the tea you offered earlier.",
    "Therapist: Wonderful job, Margaret. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Much more... present. Calmer.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad. Remember to use these techniques if you feel overwhelmed this week.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you for today, Dr. Thompson. It was hard, but... I think it was important.",
    "Therapist: You did incredibly well. We'll continue next week. Take care, Margaret.",
    "Client: Thank you. Goodbye."
