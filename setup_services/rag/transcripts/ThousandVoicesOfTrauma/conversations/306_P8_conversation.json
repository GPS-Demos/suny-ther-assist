    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a bit overwhelming. My heart's still racing, and I feel this tightness in my chest. The memory of those messages, the constant notifications... it's like I'm right back there, you know?",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are coming up for you now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how alone I felt. Even though I was in a shared house, it was like I was isolated in this digital bubble of hate. I remember refreshing my social media feeds, hoping for something positive, but it was just more cruel comments and threats. I... I started to believe what they were saying about me.",
    "Therapist: And how does that belief feel in your body right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's heavy. Like this weight pressing down on my shoulders. My stomach feels knotted, and I'm a bit nauseous. It's strange how vivid these physical sensations are, even though it happened years ago.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm angry. Not just at the cyberbullies, but at myself for not standing up to them sooner. I kept thinking if I just ignored it, it would go away. But it didn't. It just got worse. And now, I'm realizing how much that experience has affected my relationships. I find it hard to trust people, especially online. I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop, you know?",
    "Therapist: How does this anger feel different from what you experienced then?",
    "Client: Back then, the anger was... muted, I guess? Like it was buried under all the fear and shame. Now it feels more... righteous? Is that the right word? Like, I know I didn't deserve that treatment. It wasn't my fault. But there's still this voice in the back of my head questioning if I somehow brought it on myself.",
    "Therapist: What do you make of that voice now?",
    "Client: I... I think it's remnants of the neglect I experienced as a child. Always feeling like I had to earn love or acceptance. The cyberbullying just reinforced that belief. But rationally, I know it's not true. No one deserves to be treated that way. It's just... it's hard to shake off those deeply ingrained thoughts.",
    "Therapist: How does recognizing that feel?",
    "Client: It's... liberating, in a way. But also scary. If I let go of that belief, then I have to face the fact that sometimes bad things happen for no reason. That I can't control everything. And that's terrifying. But also... maybe a little freeing? I don't know. It's confusing.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to let go of that control?",
    "Client: I suppose it would mean... accepting vulnerability? Being open to connections without constantly fearing rejection or attack. It's hard to imagine, honestly. I've been on guard for so long. But I'm tired of feeling isolated. I want to trust again, to have genuine relationships. I just... I don't know how to bridge that gap.",
    "Therapist: What small step could you take towards that?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I could try joining an online community for one of my hobbies. Something low-stakes, where I can interact without revealing too much personal information at first. Just to dip my toes back in, you know? The thought makes me nervous, but also a little excited.",
    "Therapist: How does that excitement feel?",
    "Client: It's like a tiny spark in my chest. A warmth that's pushing against the fear. It reminds me of how I felt before all this happened, when I was eager to connect with people online and share ideas. I miss that feeling. I want to reclaim it.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing as we talk about this?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much progress I've made. A year ago, I couldn't even talk about this without having a panic attack. Now, I'm able to explore these memories and feelings without being completely overwhelmed. It's still hard, don't get me wrong, but... I feel stronger. More resilient. Like maybe I can face this and come out the other side.",
    "Therapist: How does that strength feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a warmth spreading through my chest. My breathing feels easier, and the knot in my stomach is loosening a bit. I'm sitting up straighter, too. It's like... like I'm reclaiming some of the space I've been afraid to occupy.",
    "Therapist: What does this strength mean for your future?",
    "Client: It means... it means I have a future. That I'm not defined by what happened to me. I can build something new, something better. It won't be easy, and I know there will be setbacks, but... I feel like I have the tools to handle it now. I'm not alone in this anymore.",
    "Therapist: How do you want to carry this feeling forward?",
    "Client: I want to remind myself of this moment when things get tough. To remember that I'm capable of facing my fears and growing from them. Maybe I could write about it in my journal, or create some kind of visual reminder. Something to anchor me when the old doubts creep in.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a wonderful idea. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired, but in a good way. Like I've done something important. There's still some anxiety lingering, but it's not overwhelming anymore. I feel... I feel hopeful. And that's not something I've felt in a long time.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing so openly. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to explore more about setting boundaries online. How to engage with people without compromising my mental health. And maybe we could talk more about that step of joining an online community. I want to prepare myself for that.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great plan. Is there anything else you'd like to add before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in years, I feel like I'm moving in the right direction. It means a lot to have this support.",
    "Therapist: You're very welcome. I'll see you next week."
