    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the natural disaster experience?",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. It was a devastating earthquake. I was in my dorm room studying when it hit. The whole building started shaking violently. I could hear screams from other students...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Everything was falling off the shelves. The lights went out, and I could hear glass shattering. I was paralyzed with fear, unable to move. I thought... I thought I was going to die.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I crawled under my desk, my heart pounding so hard I could barely breathe. The shaking seemed to last forever. I kept thinking about my family, wondering if they were okay. I felt so alone and helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this really well. Continue.",
    "Client: When the shaking finally stopped, I was too scared to move. I could hear people crying and shouting in the hallway. I wanted to check on my friends, but I was frozen in place. The aftershocks kept coming, each one bringing back that terror.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can keep going. My chest feels tight, and I'm starting to feel dizzy...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. We can pause if needed.",
    "Client: No, I... I want to continue. After what felt like hours, I finally gathered the courage to leave my room. The hallway was a mess, with debris everywhere. Some students were injured, and others were trying to help. I felt guilty for not being able to do anything earlier.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. Keep going.",
    "Client: We all gathered outside, and that's when I saw the full extent of the damage. Buildings had collapsed, and there were sirens everywhere. I couldn't reach my family on the phone, and I was terrified something had happened to them.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job describing this. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm feeling anxious, but I think I can continue. The next few days were a blur. We slept in makeshift shelters, constantly on edge from aftershocks. The uncertainty was overwhelming. I kept having nightmares about being trapped under rubble.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I finally got in touch with my family after two days. They were okay, but our home was damaged. I felt relieved but also guilty for feeling relief when so many others had lost everything. Even now, years later, I still get anxious during small tremors or loud noises.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. You're handling this memory well.",
    "Client: Sometimes I wonder if I could have done more to help others. I feel like I was too focused on my own fear. And now, whenever there's news about earthquakes anywhere in the world, I get this sinking feeling in my stomach.",
    "Therapist: It's important to remember you did the best you could.",
    "Client: I know, rationally, but it's hard to shake off these feelings. The experience changed me. I became more anxious, more aware of how fragile life can be. It's like a part of me is always on alert, waiting for the next disaster.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response to trauma. You're doing great processing this.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think... I think I need a moment. This is more difficult than I expected.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take a short break. You've done really well today."
