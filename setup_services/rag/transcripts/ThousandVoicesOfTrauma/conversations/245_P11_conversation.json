    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. Going through that memory of witnessing the trafficking situation... it's just so vivid, you know? I can still see their faces, the fear in their eyes. It's like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. I remember feeling so powerless, watching those people being herded like cattle. I wanted to do something, anything, but I was frozen. And now, even though it's just a memory, I still feel that paralysis. It's frustrating and... and scary.",
    "Therapist: How does that connect to your daily life now?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... I often feel that same sense of powerlessness in my everyday life. Like when I'm at work and I see injustice happening, or even in my personal relationships. I tend to freeze up instead of speaking out. It's like that moment has defined how I react to everything now.",
    "Therapist: I see. What else did you notice during the exposure?",
    "Client: The guilt. It hit me hard this time. I keep thinking, \"Why didn't I do more? Why didn't I call for help?\" I know logically that it might have been dangerous, but emotionally... I can't shake the feeling that I failed those people. And that guilt, it's... it's suffocating sometimes.",
    "Therapist: How does working through this memory feel different from before?",
    "Client: It's... it's strange. It's still painful, but there's something else too. I felt more... present, I guess? Like I could observe the memory without being completely sucked into it. And I noticed some details I hadn't before \u2013 the sound of a car passing by, the smell of street food. It's like... like I'm starting to see it as a memory rather than reliving it entirely.",
    "Therapist: That's an important observation. How might this shift help you?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe it means I'm gaining some distance from the trauma? Like, it's still there, but I'm not completely at its mercy anymore. And maybe... maybe that means I can start to look at it more objectively, understand it better without being overwhelmed by the emotions all the time.",
    "Therapist: Excellent insight. What strategies helped during the exposure?",
    "Client: The breathing exercises we practiced really helped. When I felt myself getting too anxious, focusing on my breath brought me back to the present. And reminding myself that I'm safe now, that it's just a memory \u2013 that was grounding. It didn't make the memory less painful, but it made it more... manageable, I guess.",
    "Therapist: Good. How do you feel about continuing with these exposures?",
    "Client: It's... it's tough. Part of me wants to run away from it all. But I can see that it's helping, even if it's uncomfortable. I feel like I'm finally confronting this thing that's had such a hold on me for so long. It's scary, but... but I think I'm ready to keep going. I want my life back, you know?",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. Any final thoughts today?",
    "Client: I'm just... I'm grateful, I suppose. For this space to process everything. And I'm proud of myself for getting through it today. It's a small step, but it feels significant. I'm starting to believe that maybe, just maybe, I can get through this and come out stronger on the other side.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. We'll continue next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I'm nervous about the next session, but I'm also looking forward to it in a way. Is that weird? To look forward to something that's so difficult?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It shows your commitment to healing.",
    "Client: I guess you're right. It's like... it's painful, but it's a productive kind of pain, if that makes sense? Like I'm finally lancing a wound that's been festering for years. It hurts, but I can feel that it's leading to something better. I just hope I can hold onto this feeling of progress when things get tough again.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal concern. We'll work on that together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I really appreciate your guidance through all of this. It means a lot to have someone who understands and can help me navigate these choppy waters. I know we still have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I might actually make it to the other side of this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work, Sarah. See you next week.",
    "Client: See you next week. And... thank you again. For everything."
