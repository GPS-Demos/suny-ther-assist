    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your baseline SUDS.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10. My hands are a little clammy.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and describe the memory.",
    "Client: I'm back in Afghanistan. The air is hot and dusty. I can smell diesel fuel and hear the rumble of trucks. My unit is preparing for a routine patrol. I'm checking my gear, making sure everything is secure. The weight of my body armor feels heavy on my shoulders.",
    "Therapist: Good. SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 5. My heart is beating a little faster now.",
    "Therapist: Continue. You're doing well.",
    "Client: We're moving out now. The streets are narrow and crowded. I'm hyper-aware, scanning for threats. Suddenly, there's a loud explosion. The ground shakes, and I'm thrown off balance. Dust and debris fill the air. I can't see clearly, but I hear screaming.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. My palms are sweating, and I feel tense all over.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: I'm trying to locate my team members. There's chaos everywhere. People are running, and I see blood on the ground. I'm shouting orders, but my voice sounds distant. I spot one of my teammates down. I rush to him, my heart pounding in my ears.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I can't breathe. My chest is so tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay. I... I reach my teammate. He's badly injured. I'm calling for a medic, but everything seems to be moving in slow motion. I'm applying pressure to his wound, and my hands are covered in blood. I keep telling him to hang on, but I'm not sure he can hear me.",
    "Therapist: SUDS now?",
    "Client: Still a 9. I feel nauseous and shaky.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: The medic finally arrives. We're working frantically to stabilize my teammate. I can hear more explosions in the distance. I'm torn between staying with him and securing the area. I feel so helpless and angry. Why did this happen? We were just on a routine patrol.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down to an 8. I still feel shaky, but the nausea is subsiding a bit.",

    "Therapist: SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's a 7. I'm feeling a mix of sadness and anger now.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're doing well.",
    "Client: As we're heading back to base, I can't stop replaying the events in my mind. I keep thinking about what I could have done differently. The adrenaline is wearing off, and I feel exhausted. But I know I can't let my guard down yet.",
    "Therapist: Last SUDS check. Where are you now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6. I feel drained, but also a bit relieved that it's over.",
    "Therapist: Well done. Let's start grounding. Open your eyes when ready.",
    "Client: (opens eyes slowly) That was... intense. But I got through it.",
    "Therapist: You did excellently. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... maybe a little stronger? Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a common reaction. Let's debrief..."
