    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is buzzing, you know? My heart is still racing a bit, and my hands feel clammy. I can't shake this feeling of unease, like I'm still there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: It's a jumble, honestly. I keep seeing flashes of that dog's teeth, hearing the growling. But then it shifts, and I'm back in my room, feeling... feeling helpless again. It's like the two experiences are blending together somehow.",
    "Therapist: I see. Can you tell me more about that connection?",
    "Client: Yeah, um... I guess in both situations, I felt completely powerless. With the dog attack, it was this sudden, visceral fear. But with the... the abuse, it was more of a slow, creeping dread. Both left me feeling like I had no control, no way to protect myself.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really challenging. How are you coping with those feelings now?",
    "Client: It's tough. Part of me wants to just shut down, you know? But I'm trying to stay present. I'm reminding myself that I'm safe now, that I'm here in this room with you. It helps to focus on my breathing, to feel the chair beneath me. But there's still this underlying anxiety, like I'm waiting for something bad to happen.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm angry. Not just at the dog or the person who hurt me, but at myself. I keep thinking I should have done something differently, that maybe I could have prevented it somehow. And then I feel guilty for feeling angry, because I know logically it wasn't my fault. It's like this cycle I can't break out of.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. How does acknowledging that anger feel?",
    "Client: It's... liberating, in a way? But also scary. I've spent so long trying to push these feelings down, and now that they're coming up, it's overwhelming. But there's also a sense of relief, like I'm finally allowing myself to feel what I've been holding back.",
    "Therapist: That's a big step. What do you think has changed to allow this?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's because I feel safer now. Being here, talking about it, it's like I'm not alone with these memories anymore. And that makes it easier to face them, even though it's still really hard. It's like I'm starting to see myself as separate from what happened, if that makes sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. How does that separation feel?",
    "Client: It's strange. There's a part of me that feels lighter, like I'm not carrying the full weight of it anymore. But there's also this sadness, almost like I'm grieving for the person I was before all this happened. And I'm scared of what it means to let go of that part of myself, even though I know it's probably necessary for healing.",
    "Therapist: That's a profound insight. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to sit with these feelings for a bit. To let myself really experience them without trying to push them away. But I also need to know that it's okay, that feeling this way doesn't mean I'm going backwards or that I'm weak. I guess I need reassurance that this is part of the process, you know?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. It's a normal part of healing. What else?",
    "Client: I think I need to be gentler with myself. I've been so focused on being \"strong\" and \"getting over it\" that I haven't allowed myself to just... feel. And maybe that's okay sometimes. Maybe it's okay to not have all the answers, to just be where I am right now.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How can you practice that self-compassion?",
    "Client: I'm not sure, to be honest. It's not something that comes naturally to me. Maybe... maybe I can start by acknowledging my feelings without judging them? Like, when I feel scared or angry, instead of telling myself I shouldn't feel that way, I can just say \"Okay, this is how I'm feeling right now, and that's alright.\"",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good start. Anything else coming up for you?",
    "Client: Yeah, actually. I'm realizing that I've been so focused on the negative impacts of what happened, I haven't really thought about how I've grown or changed in positive ways. Like, I think I'm more empathetic now, more aware of other people's struggles. And maybe, in a weird way, going through this has made me stronger, even if it doesn't always feel like it.",
    "Therapist: That's an important perspective. How does recognizing that growth feel?",
    "Client: It's... comforting, I guess? Like, it doesn't erase what happened or make it okay, but it gives it some meaning, you know? It makes me feel like maybe I can use this experience to help others someday, or at least to be a more understanding person. And that feels... hopeful, I think. Yeah, hopeful.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful. What would you like to focus on next?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to explore more of those positive changes. Maybe look at how I can build on them, use them to help me move forward. And I want to work on that self-compassion thing too. It feels important, like it could be a key to helping me process all of this without getting overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great plan. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. This was intense, but in a good way, I think. I feel... raw, but also kind of clearer? Like I've taken a step forward, even if it's a small one. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and we'll continue next time."
