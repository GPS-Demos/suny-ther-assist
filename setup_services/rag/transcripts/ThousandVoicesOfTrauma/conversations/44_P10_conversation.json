    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A little jittery. I didn't sleep well last night thinking about this.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Are you ready to begin the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I think so. Yeah, let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in my room. It's late, maybe around midnight. The glow from my laptop screen is the only light. I can hear my parents watching TV downstairs. I'm scrolling through Instagram, and then... oh God, there it is. A notification.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: Um, maybe a 4? It's not too bad yet, but my stomach's starting to knot up.",
    "Therapist: Okay. What happens next?",
    "Client: I click on the notification. It's a comment on my latest post. As I read it, my heart starts racing. It's from this girl I thought was my friend. She's calling me... calling me a slut. Saying I'm desperate for attention. There are laughing emojis. I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember to breathe. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. My hands are shaking. I feel hot, like my face is on fire. I want to throw up.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe even a 9.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I start scrolling through the comments. There are so many. People I thought were my friends, people I don't even know. They're all laughing at me, calling me names. Someone's shared an old picture of me from a party. I look drunk in it. They're saying... God, they're saying such awful things.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I can't stop reading. It's like I'm paralyzed. My vision's getting blurry. I realize I'm crying. I can taste the salt from my tears. I want to scream, but I can't make a sound. I'm afraid my parents will hear me.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I think, \"They're right. I'm worthless. Nobody really likes me. I'm just a joke to everyone.\" I feel so small, so alone. I want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: Remember, these are just memories. You're safe now. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's still... still a 9. My heart's pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I close my laptop. I can't look anymore. But I can still hear the notification sounds. Ding. Ding. Ding. Each one feels like a punch. I curl up on my bed, hugging my knees to my chest. I'm shaking. I can't stop crying.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: I feel so helpless. So exposed. It's like everyone can see right through me, and they all hate what they see. I start thinking... maybe it would be better if I just... if I just wasn't here anymore.",
    "Therapist: I hear how painful this is. Remember, you survived this. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8.5. My chest hurts.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm trying. It's just... it's so vivid. I can still hear those notification sounds in my head.",
    "Therapist: What happens as the night goes on?",
    "Client: I... I don't sleep. I keep checking my phone, even though I know I shouldn't. The comments keep coming. Someone's made a meme of me. It's spreading. I feel like I'm drowning. The sun starts to come up, and I realize I've been crying for hours. My eyes burn. My head is pounding.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel hollow. Empty. Like something's been ripped out of me. My SUDS is maybe a 7 now. I'm so tired.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What happens when it's time to get up?",
    "Client: I... I can't face it. I tell my mom I'm sick. She believes me because I look awful. I stay in bed all day, but I can't stop checking my phone. It's like a compulsion. Every new comment, every new share... it's like being stabbed over and over.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"This is never going to end. Everyone hates me. I can't go back to school. I can't face anyone.\" I feel so ashamed, so exposed. Like my whole life is over.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here now. You got through this. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 6, I think. My breathing is a little easier.",
    "Therapist: Good. Take another deep breath. What happens next?",
    "Client: The day drags on. I don't eat. I don't drink. I just lie there, cycling between numbness and panic. Every time I close my eyes, I see those comments. I hear those notification sounds. It's like they're burned into my brain.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with it.",
    "Client: As it gets dark again, I start to panic. I can't face another night like this. I can't face tomorrow. I... I start thinking about the pills in the bathroom cabinet. About how easy it would be to just... to just make it all stop.",
    "Therapist: I hear how much pain you were in. Remember, you're safe now. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's back up to an 8. My hands are shaking again.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. Ground yourself in the present.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm here. I'm safe. It's just a memory.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You're doing great. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I don't go through with it. I'm too scared. But I spend the night planning how I can never leave my room again. How I can drop out of school. How I can just... disappear.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, thinking about that night?",
    "Client: It's... it's still painful. But it feels a little distant now. Like I'm watching it happen to someone else. My SUDS is down to a 5, I think.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. Let's start to bring you back to the present.",
    "Client: Okay. Yeah, I'm... I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Feel your feet on the floor. When you're ready, open your eyes.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath, opens eyes) I'm... I'm here. It's over.",
    "Therapist: Well done, Maria. You showed incredible strength today. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. But also... I don't know. Maybe a little proud? I got through it. Both then and now.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You've made significant progress. Let's take a few minutes to process what you experienced.",
    "Client: Yeah, okay. I... I think I'm ready for that.",
    "Therapist: What stood out to you most about revisiting this memory?",
    "Client: I guess... how intense it all felt. In the moment, it seemed like my whole world was ending. But now, looking back, I can see that it was just a terrible moment in time. It didn't last forever, even though it felt like it would.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. How does it feel to have confronted this memory?",
    "Client: It's... it's weird. It still hurts, but it's like the edges are softer now. Like it doesn't have the same power over me. I feel... I feel a little stronger.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Remember, healing isn't linear. It's okay to have ups and downs.",
    "Client: Yeah, I get that now. I... I think I'm starting to believe that I can get through this. That I am strong enough.",
    "Therapist: You absolutely are. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we end our session?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm good for now. This was hard, but... I'm glad we did it. Thank you.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Maria. You should be proud of your work today. We'll continue to process this in our next session."
