    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Carlos?",
    "Client: I'm... I don't know. It's a lot to process. Revisiting that breakup with Maria, it just brought back so many emotions. I felt like I was right back there in that moment, you know? My heart was racing, and I could feel this tightness in my chest. It's like I was reliving all the pain and humiliation all over again.",
    "Therapist: What stood out to you most about the experience?",
    "Client: I think... it was the look on her face when she told me it was over. She seemed so cold, so detached. It reminded me of how the bullies at school used to look at me \u2013 like I was nothing. And then, just like that, our three-year relationship was over. I felt so small, so insignificant. It's like all those feelings of inadequacy from my past came flooding back.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was tough, really tough. I felt angry, sad, and embarrassed all at once. But... I don't know, there was something different this time. Maybe because I knew I was in a safe space here? I felt like I could let myself really feel those emotions without being overwhelmed by them. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Can you tell me more about that?",
    "Client: Well, in the past, whenever I'd think about the breakup, I'd just shut down. I'd try to push the memories away because they hurt too much. But today, even though it was painful, I felt like I could face it. I could see it for what it was \u2013 a painful event in my past, but not something that defines me now. It's weird, but I almost feel... lighter? Like I've taken a step towards letting it go.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant insight, Carlos. How do you think this relates to your recovery?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe it's showing me that I'm stronger than I thought? That I can face these painful memories and not fall apart. It's like, for so long, I've been avoiding anything that reminds me of the bullying or the breakup. But maybe by facing it head-on, I'm taking back some control. I'm not letting the fear rule me anymore.",
    "Therapist: How might this new perspective impact your daily life?",
    "Client: That's a good question. I suppose... maybe I'll be less afraid of putting myself out there? Like, socially or romantically. I've been so scared of getting hurt again that I've kind of isolated myself. But if I can handle revisiting these memories here, maybe I can handle the risk of meeting new people or even dating again. It's scary to think about, but also kind of exciting.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you could take in that direction?",
    "Client: Hmm... maybe I could start by accepting my roommate's invitation to a party next weekend. I've always turned him down before, but... yeah, I think I might give it a try. Just to be around people, you know? No pressure to make best friends or find a girlfriend or anything. Just... being present.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great idea. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... okay, actually. A bit drained, but also kind of hopeful? Like, for the first time in a long time, I can see a future where I'm not constantly haunted by my past. It's not going to be easy, I know that. But I think I'm ready to keep working at this. Thank you for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't judge me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work, Carlos. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... maybe we could talk more about strategies for dealing with social anxiety? If I'm going to start putting myself out there more, I want to feel prepared. And maybe we could do another imaginal exposure? As tough as it was, I think it's helping. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll work on that next time. How will you take care of yourself this week?",
    "Client: I'm going to try that meditation app you recommended. And maybe I'll go for a run tomorrow. Physical activity always helps clear my head. Oh, and I promised myself I'd call my mom this week. I've been avoiding it, but I think it'll be good to connect with her.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like excellent self-care plans. I'm proud of your progress, Carlos.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm... I'm actually starting to feel proud of myself too. It's a new feeling, but a good one. I'm looking forward to our next session.",
    "Therapist: Take care, Carlos. I'll see you next week."
