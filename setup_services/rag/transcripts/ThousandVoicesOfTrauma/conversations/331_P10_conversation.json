    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Patel. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit apprehensive, to be honest. I know we've talked about doing this imaginal exposure, but now that we're here, I'm not sure I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start slowly. Can you rate your current distress on a scale of 0 to 100?",
    "Client: Uh, I'd say about a 60. My heart's racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Remember, we can pause anytime. When you're ready, close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Okay... I'm at the grocery store. It's a Saturday afternoon, and I'm picking up some things for dinner. The aisles are crowded, and I can hear the beeping of scanners and the chatter of other shoppers. I'm in the produce section, examining some tomatoes...",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue in the present tense.",
    "Client: Right. I'm holding a tomato, and suddenly I hear raised voices. I look up and see two young men arguing near the deli counter. One of them is white, the other is Asian, like me. Their voices are getting louder, and people are starting to stare. I feel... I feel a knot forming in my stomach.",
    "Therapist: What's happening in your body right now?",
    "Client: My palms are sweaty, and I'm gripping the shopping cart tightly. I want to leave, but I'm frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: The white man shoves the Asian man, hard. He stumbles backward into a display of chips, and they scatter across the floor. I hear someone gasp. The Asian man looks... he looks scared and angry at the same time. I can see his hands shaking.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I should do something. Help him. But I'm terrified. What if the white man turns on me? I've seen this before, been through this before. I feel so... so powerless.",
    "Therapist: Rate your distress level now.",
    "Client: It's up to 75, maybe 80.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Shaky breath) The store manager comes over, a middle-aged white woman. She's telling them to calm down, but she's only looking at the Asian man when she says it. It's not fair. He didn't start this. I want to speak up, but my voice is stuck in my throat.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice around you?",
    "Client: Other customers are watching, some with phones out. No one's helping. I see an elderly Asian woman clutching her purse, looking scared. It reminds me of my mother... (voice breaks)",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay present. What happens next?",
    "Client: The white man is yelling slurs now. Horrible things. \"Go back to where you came from!\" \"You people are ruining this country!\" Each word feels like a punch to my gut. I'm shaking. I want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: Focus on your breath for a moment. In and out.",
    "Client: (Takes a few breaths) Okay... The Asian man is backing away, hands up. He looks so defeated. The manager is on her phone, probably calling security. I'm still rooted to the spot, and I hate myself for it. Why can't I move? Why can't I help?",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's 90. Maybe higher. I feel sick.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. This is a memory. You're observing it.",
    "Client: Right, right... (deep breath) Security arrives. Two big guys. They immediately grab the Asian man, even though he's not the aggressor. The white man is smirking now. I feel a surge of anger, but it's mixed with shame. Why didn't I do anything?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What do you notice in your body?",
    "Client: My fists are clenched. My jaw is tight. I feel hot, like my skin is on fire. And there's this heaviness in my chest, like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Good awareness. What happens as the scene continues?",
    "Client: They're escorting both men out, but the white guy is walking on his own while they're gripping the Asian man's arms. It's so unfair. I watch them go, and I feel... I feel like a coward. The other shoppers are starting to go back to their business, like nothing happened. But that elderly Asian woman is still there, and she looks at me. Her eyes... they're full of fear and disappointment. I can't bear it.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Ashamed. Angry. Helpless. I want to apologize to her, to the man who was attacked, to every Asian person in that store. But I just stand there, silent.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's 95. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe with me. In... and out.",
    "Client: (Breathing slowly) Okay... I'm putting my basket down. I can't stay here anymore. As I walk out, I pass the deli counter. The white employees are whispering, glancing at me. I keep my head down, but I can feel their eyes. My skin is crawling. I just want to get out.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it.",
    "Client: I push through the doors, and the sunlight hits me. But I don't feel its warmth. I feel cold, exposed. In the parking lot, I see the Asian man sitting on a curb, head in his hands. The police are there now, talking to the white man. I should go over, be a witness, tell them what really happened. But I'm a coward. I hurry to my car, fumbling with my keys.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: Disgust. At myself, at the situation, at the world. I feel like I'm going to throw up. My hands are shaking so badly I can barely get the key in the ignition.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I drive away. I can see the scene getting smaller in my rearview mirror, but the knot in my stomach is getting bigger. I'm gripping the steering wheel so hard my knuckles are white. I can't stop thinking about that man, about the old woman's eyes, about my own cowardice.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's 100. I feel like I'm going to explode.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: (Shaky breath) I... I pull over a few blocks away. I can't drive like this. I'm crying now, big, heaving sobs. I feel so ashamed, so angry. Why didn't I do something? Why does this keep happening? When will it stop?",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I sit there for... I don't know how long. My phone rings. It's my wife, wondering where I am. I can't tell her. I can't bear to see the disappointment in her eyes too. I tell her I'll be home soon, but my voice sounds strange, even to me.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I try to pull myself together. I wipe my face, take some deep breaths. But I feel hollow inside. Like something fundamental has shifted. I drive home, but I feel like I'm on autopilot. When I get there, I sit in the driveway for a long time, unable to go in. I know I should tell my wife, but I'm afraid. Afraid of her judgment, afraid of reliving it all again.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. Completely empty. And... and scared. Because I know this won't be the last time something like this happens. And I'm terrified that next time, I'll freeze up again.",
    "Therapist: Your current distress level?",
    "Client: It's down to about 85. I'm... I'm exhausted.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Feel your feet on the floor, your back against the chair.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Okay... I'm here. In your office. It's... it's over.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You're safe here. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired. Really tired. But also... I don't know. Maybe a little relieved? Like I've let something out that I've been holding in for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after an exposure exercise. You've shown great courage today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I didn't think I could do it. Relive all that. But I did.",
    "Therapist: Yes, you did. And that's a significant step. Let's take a few minutes to process what you experienced before we end our session.",
    "Client: Okay. I... I think I'm ready for that now."
