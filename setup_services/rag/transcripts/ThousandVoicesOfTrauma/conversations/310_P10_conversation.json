    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Ah, you know... I'm feeling a bit uneasy, to be honest. This whole process of revisiting the past, it's not easy. But I'm here, ready to give it a try.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: I'd say... maybe a 40? My stomach's a bit tight, but I'm not panicking or anything.",
    "Therapist: Okay, good. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Can you close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day?",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Alright... I'm there. It's a sunny afternoon. I'm at home, in our living room. The curtains are open, and I can see the neighbor's kids playing outside.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear the front door open. It's Maria, my wife... well, ex-wife now. She's home early from work. I remember thinking that was strange. She walks in, and I can tell something's off. Her face is... tense, almost angry.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... confused. A little worried. My heart starts beating faster. I ask her, \"Is everything okay?\" But I already know it's not.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's creeping up... maybe 55?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Inhales deeply) She doesn't answer my question. Instead, she says, \"We need to talk.\" And that's when I see it \u2013 she's not wearing her wedding ring. My stomach drops. I feel... God, I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. This is just a memory.",
    "Client: Right, right... (voice shaky) She sits down across from me, and I can see tears in her eyes. She starts talking about how unhappy she's been, how we've grown apart. But I'm barely hearing her. All I can think is, \"This can't be happening.\"",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I'm thinking about our kids, our grandkids. Thirty-five years of marriage, and it's all falling apart in front of me. I feel... helpless. Angry. Scared.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's up to 70 now. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Focus on your breathing.",
    "Client: (Takes several deep breaths) Okay... I'm okay. As Maria's talking, I start to remember all the signs I ignored. The late nights at work, the distant behavior. I feel so stupid for not seeing it coming.",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: She's still talking, but now she's mentioning someone else. A coworker. And suddenly, it all clicks. The betrayal hits me like a punch to the gut. I stand up, I can't sit still anymore. I'm pacing, running my hands through my hair.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. I feel hot, like I'm burning up. My fists are clenched so tight my nails are digging into my palms.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's 85. Maybe higher. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Carlos. Remember, you're here in a safe place.",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) I start yelling. I'm not proud of it, but I lose it. I'm asking her how she could do this, throwing accusations. She's crying now, trying to explain, but I don't want to hear it. I grab my keys and storm out.",
    "Therapist: Where do you go?",
    "Client: I get in my car and just... drive. No destination. My vision is blurry from tears. I'm gripping the steering wheel so hard my knuckles are white. I can hear my heart pounding in my ears.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Takes several shaky breaths) I end up at a park. It's where we used to take our kids when they were little. I sit on a bench and just... break down. I'm sobbing like a child, and I don't care who sees me.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Devastated. Lost. Like my whole world has been turned upside down. But also... angry. So angry at her, at myself, at everything.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's 90. I feel like I'm reliving it all over again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Carlos. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you name five things you see in this room right now?",
    "Client: (Opens eyes, looks around) Uh... your desk. The bookshelf. The clock on the wall. The plant in the corner. And... the painting behind you.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, can you continue with the memory?",
    "Client: (Closes eyes again) I'm still at the park. The sun is setting now. I've been sitting there for hours, just... numb. My phone keeps ringing \u2013 it's Maria \u2013 but I can't bring myself to answer.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm thinking about our life together. All the good times, the bad times. Our children, our home. I'm wondering how I'm going to tell our kids, our friends. I feel... ashamed. Like I've failed somehow.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're not responsible for her actions.",
    "Client: I know that now, but then... I felt like I must have done something wrong. Like I wasn't good enough. (Voice breaks) God, it hurts to remember this.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's still high... 85 maybe. My chest feels so tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great, Carlos.",
    "Client: (Inhales deeply) I finally decide to go home. It's dark now. When I pull up to the house, I can see Maria through the window. She's on the phone, probably talking to one of our kids. I sit in the car for a long time, not wanting to go in.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I gather my courage and go inside. Maria's off the phone now. Her eyes are red and puffy. We just... look at each other for a long moment. Neither of us knows what to say.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in that moment?",
    "Client: Broken. Exhausted. But also... a tiny bit relieved. Like the worst has happened, and now we have to deal with it. I sit down on the couch, and Maria sits next to me. We start talking \u2013 really talking \u2013 for the first time in years.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a significant moment.",
    "Client: It was. It was the beginning of the end of our marriage, but also... the start of something new. We talked all night. About where we went wrong, about what we wanted for the future. It was painful, but also... cleansing, in a way.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, as you remember this?",
    "Client: It's... it's not as intense as before. My SUDS is down to maybe 60? I still feel sad, but also... I don't know, maybe a little proud? We handled it as best we could, given the circumstances.",
    "Therapist: That's a great observation, Carlos. Let's take a moment to reflect on how far you've come.",
    "Client: (Opens eyes, looks at therapist) Yeah... it's still hard to think about, but it doesn't feel like it's crushing me anymore. I can see it more objectively now.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How would you rate your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 40, I think. My breathing is easier, and my hands have stopped shaking.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today, Carlos. How are you feeling about the session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, to be honest. But also... lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after these sessions. You've shown great courage today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It wasn't easy, but... I think it was worth it.",
    "Therapist: I agree. Let's take a few minutes to decompress before we end our session. Is there anything you'd like to discuss about what we've covered today?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need some time to process it all. But I feel like I understand the situation better now. It's not just a blur of pain anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. Remember, healing is a process, and you're making great strides.",
    "Client: Yeah... I can see that now. It's still hard, but... I feel like I can handle it better.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful, Carlos. We'll continue to work on this in our future sessions. For now, let's focus on some grounding exercises before you leave."
