    "Therapist: Welcome, James. Today we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of revisiting those memories... it's unsettling. I've spent years trying to push them away, you know? The thought of deliberately bringing them up makes my stomach churn.",
    "Therapist: Your apprehension is natural. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about losing control. What if I completely break down? Or what if I can't handle the memories and emotions that come up? I've worked hard to build a stable life, and I'm scared this might unravel everything. Plus, I'm not sure I can accurately remember all the details after so long.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. Let's address them one by one. First, about control...",
    "Client: Yes, that's a big one for me. I've always prided myself on being composed, especially at work. The idea of falling apart... it's terrifying. What if I can't pull myself back together?",
    "Therapist: You'll remain in control. I'll guide you throughout. Shall I explain the process?",
    "Client: Please do. I think understanding what's going to happen might help ease some of my anxiety. At least I'll know what to expect, right?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. We'll revisit the memory gradually. You'll describe it in present tense, focusing on sensory details.",
    "Client: Present tense? That sounds intense. Why is that important? And what do you mean by sensory details?",
    "Therapist: It helps engage with the memory fully. Sensory details include sights, sounds, smells, and physical sensations.",
    "Client: I see. That makes sense, but it also sounds challenging. Will you be there to help if it gets too overwhelming? I'm worried about getting lost in the memory.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'll be here throughout, providing support and guidance. We can pause anytime you need.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I appreciate your support. I guess another concern I have is... what if I remember things differently? Or what if I can't remember certain parts at all? Will that affect the therapy?",
    "Therapist: Your recollection is what matters. We'll work with what you remember. Gaps are normal.",
    "Client: Okay, that's good to know. It takes some pressure off. I've been so worried about getting everything \"right.\" One more thing - how long will this process take? Will we be doing this every session from now on?",
    "Therapist: We'll do this for several sessions, adjusting as needed. Each exposure typically lasts about 30-45 minutes.",
    "Client: That's longer than I expected. It sounds exhausting. But I suppose that's part of the process, right? Facing these memories head-on instead of avoiding them?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. It can be tiring, but it's crucial for healing. Your courage is admirable.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm still nervous, but I feel more prepared now. I appreciate your patience in explaining everything. I think I'm ready to give this a try. Where do we start?",
    "Therapist: We'll start with a relaxation exercise, then gradually approach the memory. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I am. Let's do this. I know it won't be easy, but I'm committed to this process. I want to move past these traumatic experiences and reclaim my life. I'm grateful for your guidance.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is inspiring. Let's begin with some deep breaths..."
