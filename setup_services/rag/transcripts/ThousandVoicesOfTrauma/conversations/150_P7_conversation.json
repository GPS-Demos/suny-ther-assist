    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the scene of the natural disaster?",
    "Client: Okay... I can see the dark clouds gathering. The wind is picking up, and there's this eerie silence. I'm at home, looking out the window, and I can feel my heart starting to race.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The rain starts, and it's coming down in sheets. I can hear it pounding on the roof. The trees are bending, and I'm worried they might snap. I'm trying to decide if I should leave or stay put.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm terrified. My hands are shaking, and I can't think straight. I want to run, but I don't know where to go. The storm is everywhere.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel scared. You're safe now.",
    "Client: The power goes out, and suddenly everything is dark. I can hear things crashing outside, and I'm convinced the house is going to collapse. I'm huddled in the corner, trying to make myself as small as possible.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep describing what's happening.",
    "Client: I can hear my neighbors screaming now. There's a loud crack, and I realize a tree has fallen on their house. I want to help, but I'm paralyzed with fear. I feel so guilty and helpless.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. Continue.",
    "Client: The storm seems to last forever. I'm cold and wet because rain is coming in through a broken window. I can't stop shaking, and I'm having trouble breathing. I keep thinking about all the people who might be hurt or... or worse.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. What happens next?",
    "Client: Eventually, the storm starts to die down. The silence afterward is almost worse than the noise. I'm afraid to move, to see what's left. When I finally look outside, it's like a war zone. Trees down everywhere, houses damaged, debris all over the streets.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, remembering this?",
    "Client: It's hard. My chest feels tight, and I can feel my heart racing again. But... I also feel a bit relieved that I survived it. Is that wrong? Should I feel guilty for being okay when others weren't?",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. There's no right or wrong.",
    "Client: I remember walking outside and seeing my neighbors. We were all in shock, just staring at the destruction. Someone was crying, and I wanted to comfort them, but I didn't know how. I felt so useless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The days after were a blur. No power, limited water, trying to clean up. I kept having nightmares about being trapped in the storm. I was jumpy at every loud noise. I felt like I couldn't trust anything anymore, not even the weather.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to feel that way. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Talking about it... it's bringing back a lot of those feelings. But it's also different. I'm here, safe, and I can see that I got through it. It's still scary, but maybe not as overwhelming as it was before.",
    "Therapist: That's a great observation. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I think what sticks with me most is the helplessness. Both during the storm and after. I wanted to do more, to help more, but I felt so limited. And now, hearing about other disasters or even human trafficking... it brings back that same feeling of helplessness.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to have those connections. How are you coping now?",
    "Client: I'm trying to be more prepared, I guess. I have emergency kits, I stay informed about weather patterns. But emotionally... I'm still working on it. Sometimes I feel okay, and other times it all comes rushing back.",
    "Therapist: That's part of the healing process. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to talk about, but I think it helps. I just wish I could shake this feeling that something bad is always around the corner. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Many people feel that way after trauma. We'll work on it.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I want to get better at handling these memories and feelings. It's exhausting being on edge all the time. I want to feel safe again, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. We'll keep working towards it.",
    "Client: Thank you. I feel drained after talking about this, but also a bit lighter. Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a common experience. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but okay. I think I need some time to process all of this. Is it alright if we wrap up for today?",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've done excellent work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm glad we did this, even though it was difficult. I'll see you next week?",
    "Therapist: Yes, same time next week. Take care of yourself."
