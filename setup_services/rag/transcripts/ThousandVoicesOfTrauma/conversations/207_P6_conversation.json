    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important. Let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day of the earthquake. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm in my kitchen. The ground starts to shake. It's gentle at first, but then it gets stronger. The cupboards are rattling, dishes are falling. I can hear car alarms going off outside. My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 5. It's uncomfortable, but I can handle it.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: The shaking gets worse. I'm trying to get to the doorway, but I can barely stand. I hear a loud crash - the bookshelf in the living room has fallen over. I'm terrified it's going to bring the whole house down.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 7. My palms are sweating, and my breathing is getting faster.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep breathing. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I manage to get to the doorway and hold on. The house is creaking and groaning. I can hear my neighbors screaming outside. I'm frozen, just praying for it to stop.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My heart is pounding. I feel like I'm right back there. It's... it's a 9 now.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep breathing. What happens as the shaking continues?",
    "Client: It feels like it's lasting forever. I can hear things breaking all around me. I'm thinking about my husband - he's at work, and I don't know if he's okay. I feel so helpless and alone.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: Still a 9. My chest feels tight, and I'm shaking.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're doing great. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: The shaking starts to slow down. I'm still holding onto the doorframe, afraid to move. I can hear car alarms and people yelling outside. The house is a mess - there's broken glass everywhere.",
    "Therapist: And now?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 7. I'm starting to catch my breath, but I still feel shaky.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're processing this well. What do you do after the shaking stops?",
    "Client: I cautiously step out of the doorway. My legs feel like jelly. I'm trying to avoid the broken glass as I make my way to the front door. I need to check on my neighbors and try to call my husband.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5. I'm still anxious, but the immediate fear is subsiding. I remember feeling a mix of relief and dread - relief that I survived, but dread about what I might find outside.",
    "Therapist: You're doing excellent work. Let's stay with that moment a bit longer.",
    "Client: Okay. As I open the front door, I see my neighborhood in chaos. Trees are down, there are cracks in the street. People are out on their lawns, some crying, some hugging each other. I feel overwhelmed by the destruction.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's holding steady at a 5. I'm sad and scared, but also feeling a strange sense of community with my neighbors.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. How do you feel now, thinking back on this memory?",
    "Client: It's down to a 3 now. I still feel a twinge of anxiety, but I also feel stronger. I survived that day. We all did.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well. Let's start to bring you back to the present."
