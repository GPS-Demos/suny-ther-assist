    "Therapist: Welcome back. Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of revisiting my experience with severe illness... it's daunting. I've spent so much time trying to push those memories away, and now you're asking me to bring them back. It feels counterintuitive.",
    "Therapist: Your nervousness is understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about how I'll react. What if I completely fall apart? Or what if I can't handle it and have to stop? I've worked hard to build a semblance of normalcy in my life, and I'm scared this might undo all of that. Plus, I'm not sure I can accurately remember everything that happened. It's all a bit of a blur now.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How do you think facing these memories might help?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe it could help me process what happened? I've been having nightmares and flashbacks, and they often catch me off guard. If I confront these memories head-on, perhaps I'll have more control over them? But I'm still scared of being overwhelmed by the emotions.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. Facing fears often reduces their power. What support do you need?",
    "Client: I think I'd feel better if we had a clear plan for what to do if I become too distressed. Maybe we could agree on a signal for when I need a break? And... this might sound silly, but could I bring a comfort object with me? I have this small stone I found during my recovery that I often hold when I'm anxious.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent ideas. We'll use hand signals and include your stone. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm still nervous, but I trust you, and I'm willing to give this a try. Can you walk me through what exactly we'll be doing? How long will this take? And what should I expect to feel during and after the session?",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit the memory for about 30-45 minutes. You'll describe it in detail. Emotions may intensify, but that's normal and will pass.",
    "Client: Okay, I understand. It's a bit like exposure therapy for my anxiety, right? Face the fear to reduce its impact. I'm trying to remind myself that this is a safe space and that you're here to guide me through this. Is it okay if I need to pause or if I struggle to find the right words?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll go at your pace. Pausing is fine. Your comfort is priority.",
    "Client: Thank you, that's reassuring. I appreciate your patience and support. I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Should I close my eyes? And how should I start? Do I just begin describing what happened, or will you ask me questions?",
    "Therapist: Eyes closed if comfortable. Start from the beginning. I'll guide with questions if needed.",
    "Client: Alright. I'm taking a deep breath. Here goes... It was a Tuesday morning when I first noticed the symptoms. I remember because I had an important meeting at work. I woke up feeling off, but I couldn't quite put my finger on what was wrong. As I was getting ready, I started to feel dizzy and nauseous. I thought maybe it was just nerves about the meeting, but deep down, I knew something wasn't right...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what happened next."
