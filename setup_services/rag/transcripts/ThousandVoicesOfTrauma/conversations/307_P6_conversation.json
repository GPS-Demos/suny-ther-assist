    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that moment of imprisonment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see the small, dark room. The walls are so close, I can touch them if I stretch out my arms. There's a tiny window near the ceiling, but barely any light comes through. The air feels heavy and stale. I'm sitting on a thin mattress on the floor, my back against the cold wall.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 6 out of 10. My heart's starting to race a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear footsteps approaching. My whole body tenses up. I know it's him coming to check on me. The door creaks open, and I can smell his cologne. It makes me feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My palms are sweaty, and I feel a knot in my throat. The SUDS is probably an 8 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with it.",
    "Client: He... he tells me I can come out if I promise to be good. But I know what that means. I shake my head, and he slams the door shut. I'm left alone again in the darkness. I feel so small, so helpless. Tears are running down my face, but I don't make a sound. I learned long ago that crying out loud only makes things worse.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I can barely breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: I curl up on the mattress, trying to make myself as small as possible. Time seems to stand still. I don't know how long I've been in here. Hours? Days? The hunger gnaws at my stomach, but it's nothing compared to the ache in my chest. Why doesn't anyone come looking for me? Why doesn't anyone care?",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm at a 10 now. My whole body is shaking. I can feel the fear and despair as if I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (taking deep breaths) I... I know. It's just so vivid. I can still smell the musty air, feel the cold floor. But... but I also know I'm here, in your office. The light from the window... it helps remind me I'm not there anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's right. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down. Maybe an 8? My heart's still racing, but I don't feel as overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's continue.",
    "Client: As I lie there, I start to imagine a way out. I picture myself finding a hidden door, or someone coming to rescue me. It's a small comfort, but it helps me get through the endless hours. I tell myself over and over that this won't last forever, that someday I'll be free.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm calmer. Maybe a 6? Remembering how I tried to comfort myself, it makes me feel stronger somehow.",
    "Therapist: You showed incredible resilience. We're almost done. How does the memory end?",
    "Client: Eventually, the door opens again. This time, it's my mother. She looks... disappointed. She tells me I can come out now, that I've learned my lesson. I follow her out, blinking in the bright light. I feel relief, but also anger and hurt. Why did she let this happen?",
    "Therapist: And your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to a 4 now. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little proud that I got through it?",
    "Therapist: You did extremely well. Let's take a moment to breathe."
