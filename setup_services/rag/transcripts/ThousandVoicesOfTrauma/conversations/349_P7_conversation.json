    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the home invasion for me?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure if I can do this. It's been so long, but it still feels so fresh.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take your time.",
    "Client: Okay... I was in my living room, watching TV. It was late, maybe 10 PM. I heard a noise at the back door. At first, I thought it was just the wind, but then I heard it again. It sounded like someone was trying to force the door open.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happened next?",
    "Client: I got up to check, my heart racing. As I approached the kitchen, I saw the door burst open. Two men rushed in, wearing masks. I froze. I couldn't move. They saw me and...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. You're safe now.",
    "Client: They rushed towards me. One of them grabbed me, his hands rough and strong. I could smell alcohol on his breath. He pushed me against the wall, hard. My head hit the wall, and I felt dizzy.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Continue.",
    "Client: The other man was ransacking the house. I could hear things breaking, drawers being pulled out. The man holding me kept demanding to know where I kept my valuables. I was so scared, I couldn't speak.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel scared. You're doing great.",
    "Client: He... he hit me. Across the face. I tasted blood in my mouth. I managed to tell them about the safe in my bedroom. They dragged me there, forced me to open it. I was shaking so much, I could barely turn the dial.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Keep going.",
    "Client: They took everything. My wife's jewelry, our savings... Then they tied me up and left me on the floor. I heard them leave, but I was too afraid to move for hours. I felt so helpless, so violated.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I keep thinking... what if I had fought back? What if I had a weapon? Maybe I could have stopped them. But I was just... frozen.",
    "Therapist: Your reaction was normal. You survived.",
    "Client: After that night, I couldn't sleep. Every noise made me jump. I felt weak, useless. I moved in with my daughter because I couldn't bear to be alone in that house anymore.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. You're working through this.",
    "Client: Sometimes, I still wake up in a cold sweat, thinking they're back. I hate feeling this way. I'm an old man, I should be enjoying my retirement, not jumping at shadows.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. This takes time.",
    "Client: I guess... I just want to feel safe again. To not be afraid in my own home. Is that too much to ask?",
    "Therapist: It's a reasonable desire. We'll work towards that.",
    "Client: Thank you... I think I need a break now. This... this was harder than I expected.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellently today. Let's take that break."
