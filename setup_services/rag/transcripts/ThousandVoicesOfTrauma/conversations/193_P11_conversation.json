    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. Going through that memory again, it's like I was right back there in that moment. The sounds, the smells, the fear... it all felt so real.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out most?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. Being trapped in that container, not knowing if we'd ever see daylight again. It's suffocating, you know? And the smell... God, the smell of sweat and fear. It's like it's still in my nose.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. How did your body react?",
    "Client: My heart was racing the whole time. My palms got all sweaty, and I felt this tightness in my chest. It's like my body forgot it wasn't really happening.",
    "Therapist: And emotionally?",
    "Client: Terrified. Angry. Sad. It's like a rollercoaster. One moment I'm furious at the traffickers, the next I'm scared out of my mind, and then I just feel this deep sadness for everyone who was there with me.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your day-to-day experiences?",
    "Client: I guess... I'm always on edge, aren't I? Like, even when I'm safe at home, part of me is still in that container, waiting for the worst to happen. And the nightmares... they're usually about being trapped like that.",
    "Therapist: I see. What's different now compared to when it happened?",
    "Client: Well, I'm here, talking about it. That's huge. Before, I couldn't even think about it without having a panic attack. And... I don't know, there's a part of me that feels stronger now. Like, I survived that, so maybe I can survive anything.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it feel to acknowledge that strength?",
    "Client: It's... strange. Good, but strange. I've spent so long feeling weak and broken. To think of myself as strong... it's going to take some getting used to.",
    "Therapist: What helped you get through the exposure today?",
    "Client: Remembering your breathing techniques helped a lot. And reminding myself that I'm safe now, that it's just a memory. Oh, and picturing my partner waiting for me at home. That always helps ground me.",
    "Therapist: Those are great strategies. How might you use them moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I could use the breathing whenever I feel panicky. And maybe I could keep a photo of my partner with me, as a reminder that I have support and safety now.",
    "Therapist: Excellent ideas. How are you feeling about continuing with the exposures?",
    "Client: Honestly? Scared. But also... determined, I guess. I want my life back. And if this is what it takes, then I'm willing to keep trying.",
    "Therapist: That's very courageous. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe we could work on my fear of enclosed spaces? It's still hard for me to use elevators or even stay in small rooms for too long.",
    "Therapist: We can certainly address that. Any final thoughts about today's session?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For being here, for guiding me through this. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like there might be light at the end of the tunnel.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredible work. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yeah, I'll be here. Thanks again."
