    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Patel?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. Reliving that moment when I found out about my son's imprisonment... it's still so raw, even after all this time. I can feel my heart racing, and there's this heaviness in my chest.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The overwhelming sense of helplessness. I keep replaying the phone call in my head, hearing my ex-wife's voice breaking as she told me. I felt like I had failed as a father, you know? I should have been there, should have done more to prevent this from happening.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. I noticed I was clenching my fists the whole time, and my breathing became shallow. I felt that same wave of shock and disbelief wash over me. But, strangely, I also felt a hint of... relief? Like, finally allowing myself to fully experience those emotions instead of pushing them away.",
    "Therapist: That's an important observation. How does this connect to your day-to-day experiences?",
    "Client: Well, I realize now that I've been carrying this tension with me constantly. It explains why I'm always on edge, expecting bad news. And the guilt... it's been coloring all my relationships, making me withdraw from people. I guess I've been punishing myself in a way.",
    "Therapist: I see. What did you learn about yourself during this exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm stronger than I thought. Facing this memory head-on was terrifying, but I did it. And I'm still here. It made me realize that maybe I can handle more than I give myself credit for. Perhaps it's time I stop blaming myself for something I couldn't control.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How might this affect your recovery goals?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's pushing me to be more proactive. Instead of dwelling on the past, maybe I can focus on rebuilding my relationship with my son. And perhaps it's time to start reconnecting with friends I've pushed away. This depression has isolated me for too long.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like positive steps. What's one small action you could take this week?",
    "Client: I could... I could write a letter to my son. Not about the past, but about my hopes for our future. And maybe reach out to an old colleague for coffee. Baby steps, right?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. How do you feel about continuing with these exposures?",
    "Client: It's scary, but... I'm starting to see the value. Each time, it gets a little easier to face these memories. I'm cautiously optimistic, I suppose.",
    "Therapist: That's great. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to work on managing the guilt. It's still there, lurking beneath the surface. And maybe explore ways to improve my sleep? The nightmares have been pretty intense lately.",
    "Therapist: We can definitely address those areas. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I'm starting to see a glimmer of hope. I forgot what that felt like.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work. I'll see you next week, Mr. Patel.",
    "Client: Thank you, Doctor. See you then."
