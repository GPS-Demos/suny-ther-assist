    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. Going through that memory of the cyber bullying incident after my deployment... it's bringing up a lot of emotions I've been trying to push down.",
    "Therapist: What stood out to you?",
    "Client: The feeling of helplessness, I guess. It's like... when I was in combat, I at least had some control, you know? But with the cyber bullying, it felt like I was being attacked from all sides, and I couldn't do anything to stop it. It reminded me of how vulnerable I felt during some of the more intense moments in the war.",
    "Therapist: How did that vulnerability feel today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. My heart was racing, and I felt this tightness in my chest. I kept thinking about how isolated I felt back then, both during my deployment and when I came back. The cyber bullying just amplified that feeling of being alone and misunderstood.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does this connect to your current experiences?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... I still struggle with trusting people. I'm always on edge, waiting for the next attack, whether it's online or in person. It's probably why I'm living alone now and why my relationships haven't worked out. I'm just... always waiting for the other shoe to drop, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds challenging. What else?",
    "Client: It's affecting my work too. I can only manage part-time because I get so anxious around people. And the depression... it's like this constant weight. Some days, it's all I can do to get out of bed.",
    "Therapist: How did today's session impact your view of recovery?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm starting to see how everything's connected. The war experiences, the cyber bullying, my current struggles... they're all part of the same story, aren't they? It's like... maybe if I can process one part, it might help with the others?",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... kind of empowering, actually. For the first time in a while, I feel like maybe there's hope. Like, maybe I'm not just broken or weak. There's a reason for how I'm feeling, and... and maybe I can do something about it.",
    "Therapist: What strategies do you think might help moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I need to work on rebuilding trust. Both in myself and in others. And maybe... maybe I need to start talking about my experiences more, instead of bottling everything up. It's scary, but... I think it might help.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive direction. Anything else?",
    "Client: Yeah, um... I think I need to be kinder to myself too. I've been so hard on myself for struggling, but... this isn't easy. What I went through wasn't easy. Maybe it's okay that I'm still working through it.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about continuing with these exposures?",
    "Client: It's... it's tough. Really tough. But I think it's helping. For the first time in a long time, I feel like I'm actually facing my fears instead of running from them. It's scary, but... I think I want to keep going. I want to get better.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. Shall we schedule our next session?",
    "Client: Yes, please. And... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. I know I have a long way to go, but... I think I'm finally on the right path."
