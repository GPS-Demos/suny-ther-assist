    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. The memory of that dog attack when I was a kid... it felt so real again. My heart's still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: Understandable. What stood out most?",
    "Client: The fear, definitely. I could almost feel the dog's teeth on my arm again. And the helplessness... I was so small, you know? I couldn't do anything to stop it.",
    "Therapist: How does that connect to your current experiences?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... I still feel that helplessness sometimes. Like when my anxiety spikes, it's like I'm that little kid again, unable to control what's happening.",
    "Therapist: I see. What else?",
    "Client: It's funny, I never realized how much that incident affected me. I mean, I knew I was afraid of dogs, but I didn't connect it to my general anxiety. It's like... that fear of sudden danger has been with me all this time.",
    "Therapist: How does making that connection feel?",
    "Client: It's... enlightening, I suppose. A bit scary too. But also, maybe hopeful? Like, if I can understand where it comes from, maybe I can start to deal with it better.",
    "Therapist: That's a great insight. How might this help moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I can start recognizing when I'm reacting based on that old fear. Like, when I'm anxious in a new situation, I can ask myself if I'm really in danger or if it's just that old trauma talking.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. What else did you notice during the exposure?",
    "Client: I realized I was holding my breath a lot. And my muscles were so tense. It's like my body was trying to make itself smaller, less noticeable.",
    "Therapist: How does that relate to your daily life?",
    "Client: Oh wow, I do that all the time. In meetings, or even just walking down the street. I'm always trying to make myself... less. Less visible, less of a target, I guess.",
    "Therapist: Good observation. How might you address that?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I could try some breathing exercises? And consciously relaxing my muscles when I notice I'm tensing up. It's not like I'm actually in danger most of the time, right?",
    "Therapist: That's a great strategy. Anything else?",
    "Client: I also noticed... during the memory, I kept thinking about how alone I felt. But then I realized, I'm not alone anymore. I have support now, people who care about me.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization impact you?",
    "Client: It's... comforting. And it makes me feel stronger. Like, even if something scary happens, I have people I can turn to now. I'm not that helpless kid anymore.",
    "Therapist: Excellent insight. How will you remind yourself of that?",
    "Client: Maybe I could... keep a photo of my partner with me? Or make a list of people I can call when I'm feeling anxious. Just to remind myself that I have backup now.",
    "Therapist: Great idea. How are you feeling about continuing with exposures?",
    "Client: It's tough, not gonna lie. But... I think it's helping. I feel like I'm understanding myself better. And if it can help me manage my anxiety better in the long run, I want to keep going.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. What would help you feel prepared?",
    "Client: Maybe we could go over some more grounding techniques? And... is it okay if we take it slow? I know we need to do this, but it's pretty intense.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll go at your pace. Anything else?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For helping me through this. I know it's your job, but... it means a lot to have someone guide me through these memories I've been avoiding for so long.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your hard work is commendable. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think I'm ready to end for today. I feel... drained, but also kind of accomplished? Like I've faced something big.",
    "Therapist: That's great. Remember to practice self-care. See you next week?",
    "Client: Definitely. Thanks again. See you next week."
