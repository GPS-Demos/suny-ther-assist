    "Therapist: Welcome, Priya. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I think so, Dr. Johnson. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay. I'll try my best. So, I'm back in my childhood home. It's late evening, and I can hear raised voices from the living room. My parents are arguing again. I'm in my bedroom, trying to focus on my homework, but the shouting keeps getting louder. I'm feeling scared and my heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Suddenly, I hear a loud crash. It sounds like something broke. My body tenses up, and I'm frozen in place. I want to go see what happened, but I'm too afraid to move. The shouting gets even louder, and I can hear my mother crying. I'm shaking now, and I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can. It's too much. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm trying. I hear heavy footsteps coming up the stairs. My father is yelling my mother's name. I'm terrified he might come into my room. I quickly turn off my light and hide under my blanket. I'm trembling, and I can feel tears running down my face.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Continue.",
    "Client: Through the thin walls, I can hear my father's angry voice in the next room. There's a thud, and my mother cries out in pain. I want to help her, but I'm paralyzed with fear. I feel so guilty for not doing anything, but I'm just a child. What could I do?",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. You weren't responsible.",
    "Client: I know that now, but back then... I felt so powerless. I can still hear my mother's sobs and my father's angry muttering. The house feels so tense, like it's holding its breath. I'm curled up in a tight ball under my blanket, wishing I could disappear.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: Eventually, things quiet down. But the silence is almost worse. I'm too scared to come out from under my blanket. I lie there for what feels like hours, my heart pounding, straining to hear any sound. When I finally fall asleep, it's fitful and full of nightmares.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... intense. Reliving it is hard, but I also feel a bit lighter. Like I'm not carrying it all alone anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. You did well today.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Johnson. It's still difficult, but I think it's getting a little easier each time.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. We'll end here for today.",
    "Client: Okay. I appreciate your support through this. It means a lot to have someone listen without judgment.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, Priya. I'll see you next week."
