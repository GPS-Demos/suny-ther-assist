    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Patel. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, Dr. Johnson. There's a heaviness in my chest. I've been dreading this all week, to be honest.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Though I'm not sure I'll ever truly be ready.",
    "Therapist: Let's start slowly. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: (Deep breath) I'm... I'm in the hospital waiting room. The fluorescent lights are so harsh, making everything look sickly pale. There's that antiseptic smell, you know? It's making my stomach churn.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's happening around you?",
    "Client: People are rushing about. Nurses, doctors... I can hear the squeak of their shoes on the linoleum. There's a TV in the corner, but I can't focus on what it's saying. My heart's pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 40? It's uncomfortable, but I can manage.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I see him. The doctor who operated on my husband. He's walking towards me, and his face... oh god, his face tells me everything before he even opens his mouth.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I can't breathe. My chest is so tight. I... I want to run, but my legs won't move. It's like I'm frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember to breathe. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe 65?",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What happens after you see the doctor?",
    "Client: He... he tells me my husband didn't make it. The words don't even sound real. I hear myself screaming, but it's like I'm outside my body. People are staring, but I don't care. I... I collapse onto the floor.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I can't believe it's real. We were just talking this morning. He promised he'd be fine. I... I feel so betrayed. By him, by the doctors, by life itself. It's not fair!",
    "Therapist: Allow yourself to feel that anger. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. Maybe 80? My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: (Deep breaths) Okay... okay. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I remember a nurse helping me up. She's speaking, but I can't understand her words. Everything's a blur. They take me to a small room... it's suffocating. I want to leave, but where would I go? He's gone. My Raj is gone.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My chest hurts. It's like someone's squeezing my heart. I feel nauseous, and my head is spinning. I... I think I might faint.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're here in the present. You're safe. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 85? I feel so overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're handling this bravely. What happens after they take you to the room?",
    "Client: They... they start asking me questions. About organ donation, about funeral arrangements. I can't process any of it. How can they be so calm? Don't they understand my world has just ended?",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly difficult. What are you feeling towards them?",
    "Client: I... I hate them. In that moment, I hate them all. They failed him. They failed me. I want to scream at them, but I can't find my voice.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to acknowledge those feelings. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still up there. Maybe 75? My hands are clenched so tight.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a moment to relax your hands. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I remember calling my daughter. My hands are shaking so much I can barely hold the phone. When I hear her voice, I break down completely. I can't even get the words out.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling as you try to tell her?",
    "Client: Guilt. Overwhelming guilt. I feel like I've failed as a mother. I couldn't protect her father. I can't even be strong enough to tell her what happened.",
    "Therapist: That's a heavy burden to carry. How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: Heavy. So, so heavy. Like I might sink through the floor. My throat is tight, and I can barely breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here in the present. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 70? I feel so drained.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Can you continue?",
    "Client: I... I think so. After I manage to tell my daughter, everything becomes a blur. People come and go. I sign papers without reading them. I just want to wake up from this nightmare.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your surroundings during this time?",
    "Client: It's... it's all muted. Like I'm underwater. Colors seem less vibrant. Voices sound far away. I keep expecting to see Raj walk through the door, telling me it was all a mistake.",
    "Therapist: How does that expectation make you feel?",
    "Client: Desperate. Hopeful, but in a painful way. Every time the door opens, my heart leaps... and then crashes when it's not him.",
    "Therapist: That must be exhausting. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe 60? I feel... numb.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're processing a lot. What happens as you prepare to leave the hospital?",
    "Client: I... I don't want to go. Leaving feels like I'm abandoning him. But I can't stay either. Everything in this place reminds me of what I've lost.",
    "Therapist: That's a difficult position to be in. How do you handle it?",
    "Client: I... I let my daughter guide me. She's trying to be strong, but I can see the pain in her eyes. We walk out together, and the sunlight... it feels wrong. How can the world still be so bright when my world has gone dark?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful image. What are you feeling as you step outside?",
    "Client: Lost. Completely and utterly lost. Like I've stepped into a world I don't recognize anymore. Everything looks the same, but nothing feels right.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 55 now. I feel drained, but... I made it through.",
    "Therapist: You did incredibly well. How are you feeling now, back in the present?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. But there's also a small sense of... I don't know, maybe accomplishment? I didn't think I could talk about it like this.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. Well done. Let's take a few deep breaths together.",
    "Client: (Deep breaths) Thank you, Dr. Johnson. I... I think I need a moment.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take all the time you need. You've shown remarkable strength today."
