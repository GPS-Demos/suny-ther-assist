    "Therapist: Welcome, Fatima. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is dreading it. My hands are a bit shaky.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I suppose we should. (Takes a deep breath)",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm at the bank. It's a Tuesday afternoon, and I'm there to deposit a check from a client. The lobby is quiet, just a few other customers. I'm in line, checking my phone...",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's shouting. Three men burst through the doors, waving guns. One fires a shot into the ceiling. I... I drop to the floor, my heart pounding. The noise is deafening.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: Um, about a 7... maybe 8.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Inhales shakily) They're yelling at everyone to get down. I can smell gunpowder. One of them grabs a teller, forces her to open the vault. I'm trembling, trying to make myself as small as possible. I can hear someone crying nearby.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking about my family. Will I ever see them again? I'm angry at myself for not going to the bank earlier. God, why today of all days?",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. Keep going.",
    "Client: Time seems to stretch forever. My legs are cramping from staying still. One of the robbers is pacing, muttering to himself. He seems agitated. I'm terrified he'll start shooting.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're doing great, Fatima.",
    "Client: (Breathes slowly) Okay... okay. I hear sirens in the distance. The robbers start panicking. They're arguing amongst themselves. One of them grabs me, pulls me to my feet. He's using me as a shield...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you feel?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm paralyzed with fear. His arm is around my neck, the gun pressed against my temple. It's cold, so cold. I can smell his sweat, hear his ragged breathing. I'm certain I'm going to die.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. Remember that. What happens next?",
    "Client: The police are outside. There's a negotiator on a megaphone. Everything's a blur of voices and movement. I'm trying to stay still, afraid any movement will set off the gunman.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still at 9. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take another deep breath. You're doing well.",
    "Client: (Inhales deeply) The negotiation goes on for hours. My legs are weak, I'm dizzy from fear and exhaustion. Finally, they agree to release me in exchange for a getaway vehicle. As they push me towards the door, I stumble...",
    "Therapist: What happens then?",
    "Client: I... I fall to the ground. There's a moment of chaos. Gunshots ring out. I cover my head, expecting to be hit. But when I look up, the police have stormed in. It's over. I'm alive, but I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: You made it through. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Relieved... but also hollow. Like I've aged years in just a few hours. I can't believe I survived.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 7, I think. My heart's still racing, but I feel... I don't know, drained?",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've done really well, Fatima.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's... it's still so vivid. The sounds, the smells. Sometimes I wake up at night, thinking I'm back there.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. How are you feeling about revisiting this memory?",
    "Client: It's tough, but... I think it helps. Each time, it feels a little less overwhelming. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's exactly what we hope for. Shall we take a break?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I could use some water.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take a moment to ground yourself.",
    "Therapist: Are you ready to continue?",
    "Client: I think so. Where should I start?",
    "Therapist: Let's go back to when the police first arrived. What do you remember?",
    "Client: The sirens... they were so loud. I remember feeling a mix of hope and terror. Hope that it would end soon, but terror that it might end badly.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What else?",
    "Client: I... I remember the negotiator's voice. He sounded calm, but I could hear the tension underneath. The gunman holding me was getting more agitated. His grip tightened...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's creeping up again. Maybe an 8.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Breathes deeply) The negotiator kept talking. Hours passed. My legs were numb, my throat dry. I kept thinking about my husband, my children. Would I ever see them again?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happened next?",
    "Client: The gunman started shouting demands. A car, free passage. I could feel his desperation. That's when they agreed to the exchange. Me for a getaway vehicle.",
    "Therapist: How did that make you feel?",
    "Client: Terrified. Relieved. Guilty. I was glad to be freed, but what about the others still inside?",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. Continue.",
    "Client: As they pushed me towards the door, my legs gave out. I fell. There was a moment of complete chaos. Gunshots, shouting. I thought for sure I'd be killed in the crossfire.",
    "Therapist: But you weren't. You survived.",
    "Client: Yes... yes, I did. When I looked up, it was over. The police had taken control. I was alive, but... changed.",
    "Therapist: How so?",
    "Client: I felt... fragile. Like the world had suddenly become a much more dangerous place. For weeks after, I jumped at every loud noise. I couldn't go near banks or crowded places.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction to trauma. How do you feel about it now?",
    "Client: It's... it's getting better. Talking about it helps. But sometimes, I still have nightmares. I see their faces, hear the gunshots.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6, I think. Talking about it... it's hard, but it feels like it's losing some of its power over me.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress, Fatima. How do you feel about ending our session here?",
    "Client: I think... I think that would be good. I'm exhausted, but in a different way than before. Like I've done something difficult but important.",
    "Therapist: You have. You've shown incredible strength today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without falling apart.",
    "Therapist: You're stronger than you realize. We'll continue working through this in our next session.",
    "Client: Okay. I... I'm actually looking forward to it, in a way. Is that strange?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a sign of progress. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves before we finish.",
    "Client: Alright. (Takes a deep breath) I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Remember to practice your relaxation techniques this week. I'll see you next time, Fatima.",
    "Client: Thank you. See you next week."
