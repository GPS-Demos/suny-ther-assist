    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. That memory of being in the hospital, it just... it brought everything back so vividly.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: It's like I'm back there, you know? The smell of antiseptic, the beeping of machines. I can almost feel the scratchy hospital gown on my skin. I remember feeling so... so alone. My kids were busy with their own lives, and after the divorce, well... there wasn't anyone else to be there.",
    "Therapist: You felt isolated during a vulnerable time.",
    "Client: Yeah, exactly. It's not just the physical pain I remember, it's the... the emptiness. I kept thinking, \"Is this how it ends? Alone in a hospital bed?\" I've spent my whole life working, providing for my family, and now... now I'm just this old man with no one to hold his hand when he's scared.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are you experiencing as you recall this?",
    "Client: Anger, I think. Yeah, definitely anger. At myself for pushing people away over the years. At my ex-wife for not being there. Even at my kids, though I know that's not fair. But mostly... mostly I feel this deep sadness. It's like a weight in my chest, you know? And fear. I'm terrified of ending up back there, of dying alone.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when you were actually in the hospital?",
    "Client: They're... they're not as intense now. Back then, it was like drowning. The fear and loneliness were suffocating. Now it's more... I don't know, manageable? But it still hurts. And there's this new feeling, like... like regret, I guess. For all the times I chose work over family, or a drink over a conversation.",
    "Therapist: You're connecting past choices to your current emotions.",
    "Client: Yeah, I suppose I am. It's funny, isn't it? You spend your whole life thinking you're building something, and then you end up in a hospital bed realizing maybe you built the wrong thing. I keep wondering what would've happened if I'd made different choices. If I'd been... I don't know, a better husband, a more present father. Maybe then I wouldn't have been alone when it really mattered.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are you having about yourself now?",
    "Client: I... I'm disappointed in myself, I guess. I always prided myself on being strong, independent. But now I see that strength as a weakness. It kept people at arm's length. And now... now I'm just an old man who's afraid of being alone. It's pathetic, really.",
    "Therapist: You're being quite hard on yourself.",
    "Client: Maybe. But it's the truth, isn't it? I made my bed, and now I have to lie in it. Alone. God, that word just keeps coming back. Alone. It's funny, you know. When I was younger, I used to crave solitude. Now it terrifies me.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you're sharing this?",
    "Client: Tense. My shoulders are all bunched up, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's like... like I'm bracing for something. And I feel so damn tired. Not just physically, but... but in my soul, you know? Like I've been carrying this weight for so long, and I'm only now realizing how heavy it is.",
    "Therapist: That sounds exhausting. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Part of me wants to crawl into a hole and disappear. Another part wants to call my kids, tell them I'm sorry for everything. But mostly, I think I just need... I need to not be alone with these thoughts. I need someone to tell me it's not too late to change things.",
    "Therapist: It's not too late. You're here, doing this work.",
    "Client: Yeah, I suppose I am. It's just... it's hard, you know? Facing all this. Sometimes I think it'd be easier to just... to just numb it all away. But I've tried that before, and it only made things worse. I guess... I guess I'm just tired of running from myself.",
    "Therapist: What's it like to share these feelings?",
    "Client: It's... it's scary. But also... I don't know, maybe a little relieving? Like I've been carrying this around for so long, and now I'm finally setting it down. It hurts, yeah, but it's also... it's like lancing a wound, you know? Painful, but necessary.",
    "Therapist: You're showing a lot of courage.",
    "Client: Thanks. I don't feel very courageous. Most days I feel like a coward for all the things I've run away from. But maybe... maybe this is a start. Maybe it's not too late to try and make things right. I just... I don't want to end up back in that hospital bed with all these regrets weighing me down.",
    "Therapist: What small step could you take towards change?",
    "Client: I... I could call my daughter, I suppose. Not to dump all this on her, but just to... to say hello. To try and bridge that gap a little. It's terrifying, the thought of reaching out. What if she rejects me? But... but I guess not trying is its own kind of rejection, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: That's a thoughtful insight. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, honestly. But also... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful? Like maybe there's still time to write a different ending to my story. It's a small thing, but it feels... it feels important.",
    "Therapist: It is important. You're taking steps forward.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess I am. It's just... it's a long road ahead, you know? But for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe... maybe I'm not walking it alone. That counts for something, right?",
    "Therapist: It absolutely does. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. This has been... intense. But good, I think. Thank you for... for listening. For not judging. It means more than you know.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and we'll continue next session."
