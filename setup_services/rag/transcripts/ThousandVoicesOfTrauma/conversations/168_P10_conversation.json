    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Patel. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit apprehensive, to be honest. I know we're going to be discussing the flood, and just thinking about it makes my heart race a little.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to work through this together. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Yes, let's get started.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see the rain. It's coming down in sheets, like I've never seen before. The sky is so dark, almost black. I'm standing at the window of my office, on the second floor, watching the water rise in the street below.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's happening around you?",
    "Client: My colleagues are all gathered around, murmuring nervously. Someone's trying to call their family, but the phones aren't working. The power flickers, and for a moment, we're all plunged into darkness. When it comes back on, I can see the panic on everyone's faces.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. My hands are shaking, and I can feel this knot in my stomach. I keep thinking about my wife and kids at home. Are they safe? Do they know what's happening?",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 70. Maybe 75.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Right... okay. The water's rising so fast now. Cars are floating down the street. I hear a crash and realize it's a tree that's fallen nearby. Someone in the office starts crying. I want to comfort them, but I'm frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I feel so helpless. I should be doing something, protecting my family, but I'm stuck here. I'm failing them. What kind of man am I if I can't keep them safe?",
    "Therapist: Remember, these are just thoughts. You're doing great. What happens next?",
    "Client: The building starts to shake. At first, I think it's thunder, but then I realize... it's a landslide. Part of the hill behind our building is coming down. Everyone's screaming now. I grab onto the desk to steady myself.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 85. My heart's pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember to breathe. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I try to take charge. I shout for everyone to move away from the windows. We need to get to higher ground. But as I'm saying this, I hear a loud crack. The window... the window I was just standing at shatters. Water starts pouring in.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The water's so cold. It's up to our ankles in seconds. People are pushing past me, trying to get to the stairs. I should move, but I'm... I'm paralyzed. All I can think is, \"This is how I die.\"",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You survived this. You're here now.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Yes... yes, I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: Okay... Someone grabs my arm. It's my assistant, Priya. She's yelling something, but I can barely hear her over the roar of the water. She pulls me towards the stairs. We're wading through waist-deep water now. It's so hard to move.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: I'm cold... so cold. My clothes are heavy, dragging me down. My legs are aching from fighting against the current. And the smell... it's awful. Like sewage and mud and... and fear.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's 90. Maybe higher. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here now, telling me this story. You're safe.",
    "Client: Right... safe. (Deep breath) We make it to the stairs, but they're so crowded. People are pushing and shoving. I lose my grip on Priya's hand. For a moment, I think I'm going to be swept away.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I manage to grab onto the railing. It's slippery, but I hold on for dear life. Slowly, so slowly, I pull myself up. Each step is a struggle. The water's still rising behind us. I can hear people crying, praying.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling emotionally?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified, but there's something else. A strange calm. Like part of me has accepted that this might be the end. And I feel... I feel guilty. Guilty that I'm here, fighting for my life, while my family might be going through the same thing.",
    "Therapist: Those are normal feelings in such an extreme situation. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: We finally reach the roof. The rain is still pouring down, but at least we're above the water. I look out over the city, and it's... it's unrecognizable. Everything's underwater. Houses, shops, cars... all gone. And the noise... the roar of the water, the wind, distant screams... it's deafening.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind at this point?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking, \"This can't be real. This can't be happening.\" But it is. And I feel so small, so insignificant in the face of this... this force of nature. I'm shivering, partly from the cold, partly from shock.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 85. The immediate danger is past, but the fear... the fear is still there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: We're all huddled together on the roof. Some people are crying, others are just staring blankly at the devastation. I find myself taking charge again, trying to organize people, see who needs immediate help. It gives me something to focus on besides my own fear.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. How long are you on the roof?",
    "Client: It feels like an eternity. Hours pass. The rain eventually stops, but the water doesn't recede. As night falls, it gets colder. We're all exhausted, hungry, scared. I keep trying to use my phone, but there's no signal.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking about as you wait?",
    "Client: My family. Over and over, I'm picturing them. Are they safe? Did they make it to higher ground? The not knowing is... it's torture. And I'm angry. Angry at myself for not being with them, angry at the storm, angry at... at everything.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: Morning comes. The water's started to recede, but everything's covered in mud. We can hear helicopters in the distance. Someone starts waving a bright piece of cloth. And finally, finally, we see a rescue boat approaching.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel seeing the rescue boat?",
    "Client: Relief... overwhelming relief. But also... also fear. What will I find when I get home? Will there even be a home to go back to?",
    "Therapist: That uncertainty must have been difficult. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 60. The immediate danger is past, but the worry... the worry is still there.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you tell me three things you can see in this room right now?",
    "Client: I see... I see the plant in the corner. The blue painting on the wall. And... and your notepad.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, two things you can hear?",
    "Client: The ticking of the clock. And... and the faint sound of traffic outside.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Lastly, one thing you can feel?",
    "Client: The... the softness of this chair.",
    "Therapist: Well done. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. A bit shaken, but okay. It's still hard to talk about, but... but I think it's getting easier.",
    "Therapist: You've made great progress today. Remember, you survived that experience. You're safe now. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we end?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm good for now. Thank you for guiding me through this. It's still painful, but I feel like I'm starting to process it better.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. You've shown incredible strength today. We'll continue to work through this in our future sessions. For now, take care of yourself and remember the grounding techniques we practiced.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. I'll see you next week."
