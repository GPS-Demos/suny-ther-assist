    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see the cramped room. It's dark, stuffy. There are other people here, but I can't make out their faces. The smell is... it's overwhelming. Sweat and fear.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that memory. What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 6. My heart's starting to race a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: There's shouting outside the door. I can hear heavy footsteps approaching. My mouth goes dry, and I feel like I can't breathe. The door bursts open, and there's this... this man. He's huge, intimidating. He starts barking orders in a language I don't understand.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe an 8? My palms are sweating, and I feel nauseous.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The man grabs someone next to me. They're crying, begging. I want to help, but I'm frozen. I can't move. I... I feel so ashamed. Why can't I do anything?",
    "Therapist: It's a natural response. What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm back there. My chest is so tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I can smell his cologne. It's overpowering. Mixed with cigarette smoke. I feel so small, so helpless. The person being taken away is screaming now. I want to cover my ears, but I can't move.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My SUDS is still at 9. I feel like I'm going to be sick.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: The man looks at me. His eyes are cold, calculating. He points at me, and I... I think I'm going to faint. My vision is blurring.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 10. I can't... I can't do this anymore.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Let's pause for a moment. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. My heart's pounding so hard. I feel like I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're doing great. Let's ground ourselves. Can you name five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: I... I see the chair, the window, your desk, a plant, and... and a clock.",
    "Therapist: Good. How's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down. Maybe a 7?",
    "Therapist: That's progress. Would you like to continue or take a break?",
    "Client: I... I think I need a moment. This is so intense.",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've done excellent work today. Let's take a few minutes to breathe and center ourselves."
