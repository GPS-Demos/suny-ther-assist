    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're in control here. Can you start by describing the medical trauma you experienced?",
    "Client: Okay, I'll try. It was about two years ago. I was in the hospital for what was supposed to be a routine surgery. I remember lying on the operating table, feeling nervous but trying to stay calm. The anesthesiologist was there, and he started to put me under. But something went wrong. I don't know exactly what happened, but I woke up during the procedure. I couldn't move or speak, but I could feel everything. The pain was excruciating.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I tried to scream, but no sound came out. I could hear the doctors talking, but they had no idea I was awake. The feeling of helplessness was overwhelming. I thought I was going to die right there on the table. The pain kept getting worse, and I couldn't do anything about it. I've never felt so scared and alone in my life.",
    "Therapist: That sounds terrifying. You're very brave for sharing this.",
    "Client: It felt like it went on forever. I kept praying for it to end, for someone to realize I was awake. But no one did. When I finally woke up after the surgery, I was shaking and crying. The nurses didn't understand why I was so upset. I tried to explain, but I was still groggy from the anesthesia. It took days before anyone really listened to me about what had happened.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: The worst part was the aftermath. I couldn't sleep for weeks without having nightmares about being trapped and in pain. I became paranoid about any medical procedure, even routine check-ups. My wife tried to be supportive, but she couldn't understand why I was so affected. It started to strain our relationship. I felt like I couldn't talk to anyone about it because they'd think I was overreacting or making it up.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to feel that way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I started having panic attacks, especially in enclosed spaces or when I felt like I couldn't move freely. It affected my work too. I couldn't concentrate, and I was always on edge. I felt like I was losing control of my life. The depression set in not long after that. I just felt so hopeless, like I'd never be the same person again. And now, with my marriage falling apart, it feels like that trauma has taken everything from me.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Keep going.",
    "Client: Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel normal again. I used to be so confident and carefree. Now I feel like I'm constantly looking over my shoulder, waiting for something terrible to happen. I've tried to explain it to my wife, but she just says I need to move on. She doesn't understand that I can't just forget it. It's like that experience is always there, just under the surface, ready to overwhelm me at any moment.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're processing it.",
    "Client: I feel guilty too, like maybe I'm not trying hard enough to get better. But it's so hard. Every time I think I'm making progress, something triggers me and I'm right back in that operating room, feeling helpless and terrified. I want to be the husband and professional I used to be, but I don't know how to get there from here. It's like there's this huge gap between who I was before and who I am now, and I don't know how to bridge it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work here. It takes courage.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to talk about, but I know I need to. I just wish I could make others understand how much this has affected me. My wife, my friends, even some of my colleagues \u2013 they all seem to think I should be over it by now. But how do you get over feeling like your life was completely out of your control? How do you move past the fear that it could happen again at any time? I feel like I'm constantly on guard, and it's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Keep expressing them.",
    "Client: I guess what scares me the most is the thought that I might never fully recover. That this experience will always be a part of me, always influencing my decisions and reactions. I want to believe that I can heal, that I can find a way to feel safe and confident again. But right now, it feels so far out of reach. And with my marriage falling apart, it's like I'm losing the one person who's been there through all of this, even if she didn't fully understand. I'm afraid of being alone with these feelings, of having to face this all by myself.",
    "Therapist: You're not alone. We're here to work through this together.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It helps to know that someone is listening and taking me seriously. I think that's part of why the trauma has been so hard to deal with \u2013 for so long, I felt like no one believed me or understood the depth of what I was experiencing. Even now, it's hard to put into words just how much it's affected every aspect of my life. But being here, talking about it like this, it feels like a small step forward. It's still painful and scary, but at least I don't feel like I'm carrying it all alone anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant realization. You're making progress.",
    "Client: You're right, it does feel like progress, even if it's small. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe there's hope. Maybe I can find a way to process this trauma and start to rebuild my life. It won't be easy, and I know there will be setbacks, but at least now I feel like I have some support and understanding. I just hope I can find a way to explain this to my wife, to help her understand why I've been struggling so much. Maybe if she could see it from this perspective, we could find a way to work through our issues together.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive outlook. We'll continue working on this."
