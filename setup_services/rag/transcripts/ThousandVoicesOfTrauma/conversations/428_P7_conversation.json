    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Can you describe the car accident scene?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm driving home from work. It's late, around 9 PM. The road is dark, just a few streetlights. I'm tired, thinking about getting home to my family. Suddenly, I see headlights coming straight at me in my lane. My heart starts racing. I try to swerve...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: The other car is coming so fast. I can't avoid it. There's a loud crash, metal crunching. My body jerks forward, then slams back. The airbag deploys, hitting my face. I can't breathe. Everything's spinning. I smell gasoline and burning rubber. I'm... I'm scared I might die.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Panic. Pure terror. My chest is tight, I can't catch my breath. My hands are shaking on the steering wheel. I'm trying to move, but I'm pinned. I hear someone screaming... I think it's me. There's blood on my hands. I can't tell if I'm seriously hurt. I keep thinking about my wife, my kids... will I see them again?",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm trying to calm down, but I can't. My military training kicks in, telling me to assess the situation, but I'm overwhelmed. The car's creaking, I smell smoke. I'm worried it might catch fire. I try to unbuckle my seatbelt, but my hands are shaking too much. I hear sirens in the distance. I'm relieved but also more scared - it means it's real, it's not just a nightmare.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. What happens next?",
    "Client: The firefighters arrive. They're talking to me, asking if I'm okay. I can barely respond. They start cutting the door off. The sound of metal grinding makes me flinch. It reminds me of... of the sounds during combat. I start having flashbacks to my time in the war. The chaos, the fear, it all comes flooding back.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: They pull me out of the car. I'm on a stretcher now. The paramedics are checking me. I keep asking about the other driver, but no one answers. I'm scared I might have killed someone. The guilt is overwhelming. They put me in the ambulance. The sirens are so loud. I close my eyes, trying to block it all out, but I can't escape the fear, the pain, the memories of war mixing with this new trauma.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel shaken. Reliving it is hard. My heart's racing, and I feel a bit nauseous. But... I also feel a strange sense of relief. Like I'm finally facing it instead of running from it. It's still scary, but maybe a little less overwhelming than before.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You've shown great courage.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's tough, but I think it's helping. I've been avoiding thinking about the accident for so long. Talking about it... it's like I'm starting to process it. I still feel the fear and guilt, but there's also a small sense of... I don't know, maybe control? Like I'm not just a victim of my memories anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: I think I can keep going. It's difficult, but I want to work through this. The accident brought back so many memories from my time in combat. I've been struggling with both, and they seem to feed into each other. I want to learn how to manage these memories and emotions better.",
    "Therapist: You're making excellent progress. Shall we continue?",
    "Client: Yes, let's continue. After the ambulance ride, I remember arriving at the hospital. The bright lights, the rush of doctors and nurses. They're cutting off my clothes, attaching monitors. I'm still in shock, I think. The pain is setting in now, but it's dull compared to the emotional turmoil. I keep seeing flashes of the accident mixed with war scenes. It's like my brain can't separate them anymore.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: The doctor tells me I have a concussion, some broken ribs, and a fractured wrist. But all I can think about is the other driver. I keep asking, but they don't have any information yet. The guilt is eating me alive. What if they didn't make it? How could I live with that? It reminds me of the civilians we couldn't save during the war. That same helpless feeling, that crushing responsibility.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: They give me something for the pain, and I start to feel drowsy. But I'm afraid to close my eyes. Every time I do, I see the headlights coming at me, or I hear explosions from my time in combat. I feel so alone in that hospital bed, even though there are people all around. I miss my wife, my kids. I want to call them, but I'm ashamed. I feel like I've let them down somehow.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this remarkably well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. Talking about it brings everything back so vividly. But there's also a part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I'm facing my fears head-on. It's exhausting, but I think it's necessary. I've been carrying this weight for so long, it's almost a relief to finally let it out.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Would you like to take a break?",
    "Client: No, I think I can keep going. It's hard, but I feel like I'm making progress. Is it okay if we continue? I want to talk about what happened when my family arrived at the hospital. That was when the reality of everything really hit me.",
    "Therapist: Of course. When you're ready, describe that moment.",
    "Client: Okay... So, it's a few hours after I've been admitted. I'm lying in the hospital bed, still in a lot of pain despite the medication. The room is dim, and I'm drifting in and out of consciousness. Then I hear my wife's voice in the hallway. She sounds worried, scared. When she walks in and sees me, her face... I'll never forget it. It's a mix of relief and horror.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... ashamed. Guilty. Like I've let her down somehow. But also, I'm so relieved to see her. She rushes to my side, takes my hand. I can see she's been crying. Our kids are there too, looking scared and confused. I want to comfort them, tell them everything's okay, but I can barely speak. The weight of what happened, how close I came to leaving them... it hits me all at once.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: My wife is asking the doctors questions, but I can barely focus on what they're saying. I'm overwhelmed by the love I feel from my family, but also this intense fear. What if I had died? What would happen to them? It brings back memories of losing friends in combat, of having to inform their families. The guilt, the 'what ifs' are suffocating.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to have these feelings. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I try to smile for my kids, to reassure them, but I can see the worry in their eyes. My oldest, she's always been perceptive. She asks if I'm going to be okay, and I promise her I will be. But inside, I'm not sure. I'm scared of how this will affect me, of the nightmares I know will come. I'm scared of becoming a burden to my family, of not being the husband and father they deserve.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great strength. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: It's... it's tough. Reliving these moments is painful, but there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe catharsis? Talking about it, facing these memories head-on... it's hard, but I think it's helping. I've been carrying this weight for so long, trying to be strong for my family. But maybe true strength is facing these fears, working through them.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. Would you like to continue?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I can. There's more I want to explore. The days after the accident were a blur of pain, medication, and nightmares. But there was also this overwhelming sense of gratitude for being alive, mixed with guilt over feeling relieved when I learned the other driver survived too. It's all so complicated, but I want to work through it. I need to, for myself and for my family.",
    "Therapist: You're making excellent progress. Let's continue when you're ready."

Our kids are there too, looking scared and confused. I want to comfort them, tell them everything's okay, but I can barely speak. The weight of what happened, how close I came to leaving them... it hits me all at once.",
