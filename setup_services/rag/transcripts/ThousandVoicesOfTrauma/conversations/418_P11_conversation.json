    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. The memory of that dog attack feels so vivid now. I can still hear the growling, feel the pain... (voice trembles) It's like I'm right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most?",
    "Client: The fear. It was paralyzing. I remember freezing, unable to move as the dog lunged at me. I felt so helpless, like a child again. It reminded me of... of when my ex-husband would... (pauses, takes a deep breath) When he'd get violent.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does that connection feel?",
    "Client: It's... unsettling. I never realized how similar those feelings were. The helplessness, the terror... It's like my body can't tell the difference between the dog attack and the abuse I endured for years.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. How does it relate to your symptoms?",
    "Client: Well, I guess it explains why I'm always on edge, always expecting the worst. Even now, living alone, I still feel unsafe. It's exhausting, really. I'm constantly scanning for threats, be it angry dogs or... or angry men.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. What else came up?",
    "Client: I noticed... shame. I felt ashamed that I couldn't protect myself, both from the dog and in my marriage. I've always prided myself on being strong, independent. But in those moments, I was anything but.",
    "Therapist: How do you view that shame now?",
    "Client: (sighs) I suppose... it's not really fair to blame myself. I did what I could to survive, both times. It's just... it's hard to shake that feeling of weakness, you know?",
    "Therapist: I understand. What helped you get through the exposure?",
    "Client: Oddly enough, reminding myself that I'm safe now. That it's just a memory. And... and thinking about how far I've come. I'm not that scared, helpless person anymore. I've built a life for myself, on my own terms.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How might you use this?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I need to be kinder to myself. To recognize my strength in surviving, in moving forward. And perhaps... perhaps I can use that reminder of safety when I start feeling anxious or scared in daily life.",
    "Therapist: Excellent insight. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: It's tough, I won't lie. But I see the value in it. Each time, it gets a little easier to face those memories. And I'm learning so much about myself in the process. I want to keep going, to see where this leads.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. What's one thing you'll take away?",
    "Client: That I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. And that facing these memories, as painful as it is, is helping me understand myself better. It's... it's empowering, in a way I didn't expect.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful takeaway. Anything else?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone listen without judgment, to help me make sense of it all. I feel less alone in this journey now.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. You're doing great work. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I feel drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've done something important today. I'm looking forward to our next session, even if it's challenging.",
    "Therapist: That's a healthy perspective. Take care, and we'll continue next time."
