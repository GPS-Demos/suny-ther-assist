    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Can you describe the airplane crash scene and give me your initial SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm on the plane, and it's shaking violently. The oxygen masks have dropped, and people are screaming. I... I can feel my heart racing. It's like I'm there again. My SUDS is probably around 60 right now.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Remember, you're safe here. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: The plane is nose-diving. I can see the ground coming closer through the window. My hands are gripping the armrests so tightly they're turning white. I'm... I'm terrified. I can't breathe properly. It feels like my chest is constricting.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Maybe 75? I feel so helpless, just like I did then. The memory is so vivid.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Keep going, you're safe here.",
    "Client: We're hitting the ground now. There's a deafening crash, and everything goes dark. I can smell smoke and feel intense heat. People are screaming and crying all around me. I... I'm frozen in my seat, unable to move. My body feels numb, but my mind is racing.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now? What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's really high. Maybe 85 or 90. I feel overwhelmed, like I'm right back in that moment. My palms are sweating, and I can feel my heart pounding in my chest.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you survived this. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I manage to unbuckle my seatbelt. The plane is filled with smoke, and I can barely see. I'm coughing and struggling to breathe. I hear people calling for help, but I can't see them. I'm crawling towards where I think the exit should be. My hands are touching debris and... and I think bodies. I feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 80? I feel a bit dizzy, reliving this. But... but I also feel a glimmer of hope because I know I made it out.",
    "Therapist: That's right, you did make it. Continue with what happened next.",
    "Client: I finally reach the emergency exit. It's jammed, but I manage to force it open. The fresh air hits me, and I gasp. I help a few other passengers out before jumping myself. We're in a field, and I can see the plane burning behind us. I'm shaking uncontrollably, but I'm alive. I... I can't believe I survived.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe 65? I feel relieved that I made it out, but also guilty about those who didn't. My body feels exhausted, like I've run a marathon.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You've done well. Let's take a moment to breathe.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Thank you. It's... it's hard to revisit this, but I feel like I'm starting to process it better. The memory doesn't feel as overwhelming as it did before.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How would you rate your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's come down more. I'd say it's around 50 now. I feel drained, but also a sense of accomplishment for facing this memory.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. Let's end the exercise here. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... lighter, I think. It was intense, but I feel like I've taken a step forward in dealing with this trauma. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. You've shown great courage today."
