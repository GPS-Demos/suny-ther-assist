    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Are you ready to revisit your combat experience?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm back in Afghanistan. It's a hot day, and I can feel the weight of my gear. We're on patrol in a small village. The air is thick with dust, and there's an eerie silence.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud explosion. I'm thrown to the ground, my ears ringing. I can't see clearly through the dust and smoke. I hear screaming...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I'm trying to get up, but my leg hurts. I see one of my team members lying motionless nearby. I want to help him, but I can't move.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: I feel so helpless. The screaming continues, and I can hear gunfire in the distance. I'm dragging myself towards my teammate, but it feels like I'm moving in slow motion.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) I reach him, and there's so much blood. His eyes are open, but he's not moving. I'm calling for help, but my voice seems so small in the chaos.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (taking a shaky breath) Other team members are arriving now. Someone's pulling me away, telling me we need to evacuate. But I can't leave him there. I'm yelling, trying to go back.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Everything's a blur after that. I remember being in a helicopter, the pain in my leg becoming unbearable. And the guilt... the overwhelming guilt of leaving him behind.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're processing it.",
    "Client: (voice breaking) I keep seeing his face. He had a family back home. How could I just leave him there?",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel drained, and my heart is racing. But... I also feel a little lighter, like I've let go of something I've been holding onto for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. You've done excellent work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard, but I think it's getting easier to talk about.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of your progress. Let's end here for today."
