    "Therapist: Hello, John. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hey, Dr. Sarah. I'm... okay, I guess. My back's been acting up again, and I've been thinking a lot about my ex. It's been a rough week.",
    "Therapist: I'm sorry to hear that. Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. Are you ready to discuss it?",
    "Client: Imaginal exposure? That sounds... intense. I'm not sure I'm ready for that. What exactly does it involve?",
    "Therapist: It's a technique to help process traumatic memories. We'll go through it step-by-step. How does that sound?",
    "Client: Honestly, it sounds scary. I've been trying so hard not to think about my time in combat. Won't this just make everything worse?",
    "Therapist: I understand your concern. It's actually designed to help reduce PTSD symptoms over time. What worries you most?",
    "Client: I guess... I'm afraid of losing control. What if I can't handle reliving those memories? And with my back pain, I'm worried it'll just add more stress.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. We'll go at your pace and can stop anytime. How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: A little better, I suppose. But I'm still nervous. Will you be there the whole time? I mean, I know you're young, but... I just need to know I'm not alone in this.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'll be here to support you throughout. What else can I do to help you feel more comfortable?",
    "Client: Maybe... could you explain more about what to expect? Like, what am I supposed to do exactly?",
    "Therapist: Of course. You'll describe a traumatic event in detail, in the present tense. I'll guide you through it.",
    "Client: Okay... that sounds challenging. Will it be like this every session? I'm worried about how this might affect my relationship or work.",
    "Therapist: We'll do this gradually, adjusting as needed. How do you think it might impact your daily life?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. I guess I'm worried about being too emotional or distracted after sessions. My girlfriend's already concerned about how distant I've been lately.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate you sharing that. We can discuss coping strategies for after sessions. Does that help?",
    "Client: Yeah, that does help a bit. I just... I want to get better, you know? For myself, for my girlfriend, for my life. I'm tired of feeling stuck.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is admirable. This process takes courage. How are you feeling about starting now?",
    "Client: I'm still nervous, but... I think I'm ready to try. Can we start with something small today? Just to get a feel for it?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll start with a brief, less intense memory. Are you comfortable with that?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I can handle that. Thank you for being so patient with me, Dr. Sarah. I really appreciate it.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, John. Your bravery is commendable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Okay. Let's do this. I'm as ready as I'll ever be."
