    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Lim?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's like I'm right back there, you know? The memory of that tiger attack during the flood... it's so vivid. I can still hear the roar, feel the rain on my skin. My heart's racing even now.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... a strange sense of guilt? I keep thinking about my neighbor who didn't make it. Why did I survive and not her? It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: I see. Can you tell me more about that guilt?",
    "Client: Well, um... I was faster, I guess. When the flood waters rose and we heard that tiger had escaped from the zoo, I just... I ran. I didn't even think to check on Mrs. Chen next door. She was older, slower. I... I should have helped her.",
    "Therapist: Hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I... I'm a coward. I should have been braver. Maybe if I'd helped Mrs. Chen, she'd still be alive. But then... then I might not be here. It's all so confusing. I feel like I can't breathe sometimes when I think about it.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What physical sensations are you noticing?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. My hands are clammy. And there's this knot in my stomach. It's like my body is preparing to run again, even though I'm safe here.",
    "Therapist: How does talking about this memory compare to when it first happened?",
    "Client: It's... it's different. Back then, everything was chaos. I couldn't think straight. Now, it's like I'm reliving it, but I'm also observing it? Does that make sense? I can feel the fear, but I'm also aware that I'm here, in this room, talking to you.",
    "Therapist: That's a great observation. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I... I feel angry. At the situation, at myself, even at the tiger. It wasn't the animal's fault, but... why did this have to happen? Why did I have to make that choice? And now, years later, I'm still dealing with this. It's not fair.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings impact your daily life?",
    "Client: They... they make everything harder. I'm always on edge, especially during rainy season. I avoid the zoo, obviously. But it's more than that. I struggle to form close relationships. What if something happens to them? What if I have to choose between saving myself or someone else again?",
    "Therapist: I hear you. How do you cope with these feelings?",
    "Client: I... I try to stay busy. Working part-time helps. But sometimes, I isolate myself. It feels safer that way. No one to lose, no one to let down. But then I feel lonely, and that brings back the memories too. It's like I can't win.",
    "Therapist: What would winning look like to you?",
    "Client: Winning? I... I guess it would be feeling at peace. Not jumping at every loud noise. Being able to enjoy the rain again. Maybe even... forgiving myself? But that feels impossible right now.",
    "Therapist: Why do you think forgiveness feels impossible?",
    "Client: Because... because Mrs. Chen died. She's gone, and nothing can change that. How can I forgive myself when she paid the ultimate price? It feels disrespectful to her memory. But carrying this guilt... it's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: How does carrying this guilt serve you?",
    "Client: I... I don't know if it serves me. Maybe... maybe it's a way of punishing myself? Or keeping Mrs. Chen's memory alive? But when I really think about it, I'm not sure she would want me to suffer like this. She was always so kind.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful reflection. What else comes to mind?",
    "Client: I... I wonder what my life would be like without this weight. Could I be happy? Do I deserve to be? Part of me wants to let go, but another part clings to the guilt. It's familiar, in a twisted way.",
    "Therapist: How does that internal conflict feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's exhausting. Like I'm constantly at war with myself. Some days, I can almost imagine moving forward. Other days, the memory hits me like a tidal wave, and I'm right back there in the flood.",
    "Therapist: What helps during those difficult moments?",
    "Client: Sometimes... sometimes I try to remember Mrs. Chen's kindness. How she always shared her cooking with me. I think... I think she would want me to be okay. And that helps, a little. But it's hard.",
    "Therapist: That's a beautiful way to honor her memory. How does that feel?",
    "Client: It feels... bittersweet. There's sadness, of course. But also a warmth. Like maybe, just maybe, I can carry her memory forward in a positive way. Not just through guilt and fear.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What do you make of that?",
    "Client: I... I think it might be a first step. Towards healing, maybe? It's scary to think about letting go of the guilt. But holding onto it isn't bringing Mrs. Chen back. Perhaps... perhaps I can honor her by living fully, the way she always encouraged me to.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... it's both frightening and liberating. Like standing at the edge of something new. I'm not sure I'm ready to take that step yet, but... but for the first time in a long while, I can see the possibility. That's... that's something, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: Indeed it is. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained, honestly. But there's also a glimmer of... hope? Is that the right word? It's small, but it's there. Like a tiny light in all this darkness. I didn't expect to feel that today.",
    "Therapist: That's significant. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to explore this idea of honoring Mrs. Chen's memory in a positive way. Maybe... maybe that could be a path forward. It's scary, but... I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a meaningful direction. We'll pick up there next time. How are you feeling about ending our session today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. Tired, but... maybe a little lighter? Thank you for listening. For helping me see things differently. I... I appreciate it more than I can say.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Mrs. Lim. Take care, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. See you then."
