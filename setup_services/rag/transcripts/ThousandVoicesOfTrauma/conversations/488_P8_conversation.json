    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel a tightness in my chest. The memories of that earthquake... they're so vivid now. I can almost feel the ground shaking beneath me again.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. How the world just... crumbled around me. And then, strangely, I'm also thinking about this cyberbullying situation. It's like... both experiences make me feel so vulnerable, you know? Like I have no control.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does that feeling of vulnerability affect you?",
    "Client: It's... it's suffocating sometimes. With the earthquake, it was a physical threat. But this online harassment, it's... it's like an invisible enemy. I find myself constantly checking my phone, my social media, always on edge. I'm afraid to open my messages. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: What emotions come up when you think about these experiences?",
    "Client: Anger, definitely. Frustration. But also... shame? I feel ashamed that I can't just brush off these online attacks. I'm a 64-year-old man, for crying out loud. I should be able to handle this better. But then I remember the earthquake, how it shook me to my core, and I think... maybe it's okay to feel shaken by this too?",
    "Therapist: How do you see these experiences connecting?",
    "Client: I... I never thought about it before, but they both make me feel... exposed. During the earthquake, my home, my safe space, was literally torn apart. And now, with this cyberbullying, it's like my digital space isn't safe either. It's as if I have nowhere to hide, nowhere to feel truly secure.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you aware of as you talk about this?",
    "Client: My shoulders are tense. Really tense. And I notice I'm clenching my jaw. It's like my body is bracing for another impact, you know? Whether it's the ground shaking or another cruel message popping up on my screen. I'm just... always ready for the next blow.",
    "Therapist: How does recognizing these reactions make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... oddly comforting, in a way. Like, now that I can see the connection between these experiences, it makes sense why I'm reacting so strongly to the cyberbullying. It's not just about the messages themselves, it's about feeling unsafe all over again. But at the same time, it's frustrating. I thought I had dealt with the trauma from the earthquake, but clearly, it's still affecting me.",
    "Therapist: What do you think this realization means for your recovery?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe it means I need to work on feeling safe again, both in the physical world and online. But how do you do that when the threat could come from anywhere? A natural disaster, a stranger on the internet... It feels overwhelming. But also... maybe there's hope? If I could get through the aftermath of the earthquake, maybe I can get through this too.",
    "Therapist: How does that possibility of hope feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a glimmer, you know? Like a tiny crack of light in a dark room. I've been feeling so defeated lately, especially with this cyberbullying situation. But thinking about how I survived the earthquake, how I rebuilt my life after that... it gives me a bit of strength. Maybe I can reclaim my sense of safety, bit by bit.",
    "Therapist: What might be a first step towards that?",
    "Client: I... I think maybe I need to start by acknowledging that it's okay to feel vulnerable. That it doesn't make me weak. The earthquake wasn't my fault, and neither is this cyberbullying. Maybe if I can accept that, I can start to build my resilience back up. And perhaps... perhaps I need to reach out more. Connect with people who understand, who can support me. I've been isolating myself, and that's probably not helping.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to consider those steps?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of emotions. There's a part of me that feels hopeful, even excited about the possibility of feeling better. But there's also fear. What if I try and it doesn't work? What if I open up to people and they don't understand? But then I think about how I felt right after the earthquake. I was terrified then too, but I took it one day at a time, and eventually, things got better. Maybe I can approach this the same way.",
    "Therapist: What strengths did you draw on then that might help now?",
    "Client: Hmm... I guess my resilience, for one. I didn't give up, even when things seemed hopeless. And my adaptability. I had to learn to navigate a whole new reality after the earthquake, and I did it. Maybe I can adapt to this digital world too, learn to protect myself better online. And... my courage. It took courage to start over after losing so much. Maybe I can find that courage again to face this new challenge.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about your ability to use those strengths now?",
    "Client: You know, talking about it like this... it actually makes me feel a bit more confident. I've been through hard times before and come out the other side. This situation with the cyberbullying, it's different, but maybe the skills I need are the same. It's not going to be easy, but... I think I'm ready to try. To start taking back control, even if it's just in small ways at first.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you might take this week?",
    "Client: I think... I think I might reach out to my son. We haven't talked much lately, partly because I've been embarrassed about this whole cyberbullying situation. But he works in IT, and he might have some practical advice about online security. And even if he doesn't, just talking to him might help me feel less alone in this. Yeah, I think I'll give him a call tomorrow.",
    "Therapist: How does setting that intention make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a relief, actually. Like I'm finally doing something proactive instead of just reacting. And thinking about connecting with my son... it reminds me that I'm not alone. That I have people in my corner. It's a small step, but it feels like a step in the right direction.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. We're out of time, but let's continue next session.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I actually feel a bit lighter now. Still anxious, but... maybe a little more hopeful too. I appreciate your help in making these connections. It's given me a lot to think about, and some direction for moving forward. I'm looking forward to our next session."
