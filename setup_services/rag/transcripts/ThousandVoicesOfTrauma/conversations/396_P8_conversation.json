    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's a bit overwhelming, to be honest. My heart is still racing a bit, and I feel a tightness in my chest. The memories of fleeing my home... they're so vivid now. I can almost smell the smoke and hear the chaos around me. It's like I'm back there again, you know?",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: Well, I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. We had to leave everything behind, just grab what we could carry. I... I remember the look on my wife's face. She was so scared, but she was trying to be strong for our children. I feel like I failed them somehow. Like I should have done more to protect them, to prepare for this. It's silly, I know. How could anyone prepare for something like that?",
    "Therapist: And how does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Guilty, I suppose. And angry. Angry at the people who forced us to flee, angry at myself for not being able to do more. But there's also this... this strange sense of relief. We made it out alive, you know? So many others didn't. I feel guilty for feeling relieved. Is that... is that normal?",
    "Therapist: It's a common reaction. Can you tell me more about that relief?",
    "Client: It's like... even though we lost everything, we still had each other. I remember holding my youngest grandson's hand as we crossed the border. He was so brave, didn't cry once. And I thought, \"This is what matters. This is what we're fighting for.\" But then I think about the people we left behind, the neighbors who couldn't leave, and that relief turns to ash in my mouth.",
    "Therapist: How do these memories affect you now?",
    "Client: They... they're always there, lurking in the background. Sometimes I'll hear a loud noise, and I'm right back there, heart pounding, ready to run. I find myself constantly checking the exits whenever I'm in a new place. It's exhausting. But talking about it like this... it's hard, but it also feels like... like I'm finally acknowledging what happened. Like I'm not just running anymore.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice in your body as you share this?",
    "Client: I... I notice my shoulders are tense. I've been clenching my fists without realizing it. But... but I also feel like I can breathe a little easier. It's like a weight is lifting, just a little. Is that strange?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. What else are you experiencing?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel a bit shaky, but also more grounded somehow. Like I'm finally allowing myself to really feel what happened. It's scary, but also... I don't know, maybe healing? I keep thinking about my wife. She never got the chance to process all of this. She was always so strong for everyone else. I wonder if she ever felt like this, if she ever allowed herself to really feel it all.",
    "Therapist: How does thinking about your wife impact you right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's bittersweet. I miss her terribly. She was my rock through all of this. But I also feel... I feel like I'm honoring her memory by facing this. She always encouraged me to be strong, to keep going. I think she'd be proud of me for doing this, for trying to heal. It's hard, but I think it's what she would have wanted for me.",
    "Therapist: What does this process mean for you moving forward?",
    "Client: I... I think it means I'm finally ready to face my past, to stop running from these memories. It's terrifying, but also... liberating? I've spent so long trying to forget, to push it all down. But maybe by remembering, by really feeling it all, I can start to move forward. I want to be there for my children, my grandchildren, without this constant shadow hanging over me. I want to honor the life we've built here, the sacrifices we made to get here. It won't be easy, but... I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: That's very insightful. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but in a good way. Like after a long cry, you know? There's a heaviness, but also a sense of... I don't know, maybe hope? It's like I've been carrying this weight for so long, and now I'm finally starting to put it down. It's scary, but also exciting. I feel more... present, I guess. Like I'm not just going through the motions anymore. I'm actually here, in this moment, facing everything head-on. It's overwhelming, but also... empowering, in a way.",
    "Therapist: What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I... I think I just need a moment to breathe. To sit with all of these feelings. It's a lot to process, you know? But I also... I also feel grateful. Grateful for this opportunity to finally face my past, grateful for the safety and support to do so. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this, but here I am. It's... it's a strange feeling, but not an entirely unpleasant one. I think... I think I'm going to be okay.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. We'll end here for today.",
    "Client: Thank you. This wasn't easy, but I'm glad we did it. I feel... I feel like I've taken a big step today. It's scary, but also... hopeful. I'm looking forward to our next session, to continuing this journey. Thank you for your guidance and support."
