    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm not really sure. It's a lot to process, you know? Going back to that time when I was so sick, it just brings up so many emotions. I felt so alone and scared during that period of my life. It's like I can still feel the weight of it all pressing down on me.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The overwhelming sense of helplessness, I think. I remember lying in that hospital bed, day after day, with no one really there for me. My husband was busy with work, and my parents... well, they've never been the type to offer much support. It just hit me how truly isolated I felt during that time. It's like I was invisible, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. How did revisiting affect you?",
    "Client: It was tough, really tough. I found myself tensing up, my heart racing just like it did back then. But there was also this strange sense of... I don't know, maybe clarity? Like I'm finally acknowledging how much that experience affected me. I've spent so long trying to push it away, pretend it didn't matter. But it did. It does.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does this connect to your current experiences?",
    "Client: I think... I think it explains a lot about why I struggle with trust now. Why I have such a hard time letting people in or asking for help. I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop, you know? Always expecting to be left alone when things get tough. It's like that experience taught me that I can only rely on myself.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful connection. What else?",
    "Client: Well, I've noticed that I tend to downplay my own needs a lot. Like, I'll push myself to the point of exhaustion rather than admit I need help or rest. I think that comes from feeling so neglected during my illness. It's like I internalized this belief that my needs don't matter, that I shouldn't bother anyone with them.",
    "Therapist: How might addressing this impact your recovery?",
    "Client: I... I guess it could help me be kinder to myself? Maybe if I can recognize that what happened wasn't okay, that I deserved better care and support, I can start treating myself with more compassion now. And maybe... maybe I could start allowing others to support me too. It's scary to think about, but I know it's probably important for my healing.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's daunting, to be honest. Part of me wants to run away from all of this. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a glimmer of hope? Like maybe by facing this head-on, I can finally start to move past it. I'm tired of letting this experience control so much of my life. So yeah, I think I'm ready to keep going, even if it's hard.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. What's one small step you can take this week?",
    "Client: Hmm... Maybe I could try opening up to my husband about some of this? Not everything at once, but just... start letting him in a little. Maybe tell him about how the therapy's going and why it's important to me. That feels scary, but also like it could be a good first step.",
    "Therapist: Excellent idea. Shall we plan our next session?"
