    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure exercise. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the airplane crash?",
    "Client: Okay... I was on a flight from Singapore to Bangkok. It was supposed to be a short trip, just over two hours. Everything seemed normal at first. We took off, and I remember looking out the window, seeing the city lights fade away. Then, about an hour into the flight, there was this sudden jolt. The plane shook violently. I gripped the armrests so tightly my knuckles turned white.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The oxygen masks dropped down. There was chaos all around me. People were screaming, crying. I could hear a child wailing somewhere behind me. The flight attendants were trying to calm everyone, but I could see the fear in their eyes. I fumbled with my oxygen mask, my hands shaking so much I could barely put it on. The plane was descending rapidly. I felt like my stomach was in my throat.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe now.",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. I can still feel that terror. The plane was tilting to one side. Items from the overhead compartments were falling out. A suitcase hit the man next to me. He was unconscious, blood trickling down his forehead. I wanted to help him, but I couldn't move. I was frozen in fear.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The captain's voice came over the intercom. He sounded calm, but there was an edge to his voice. He said we were making an emergency landing. I looked out the window and saw we were over water. My heart was pounding so hard I thought it might burst out of my chest. I couldn't breathe properly, even with the oxygen mask.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're here now, and you're safe.",
    "Client: As we got closer to the water, I closed my eyes. I didn't want to see what was coming. The impact was... it was like nothing I've ever experienced. There was a deafening crash, and then water started pouring in. The plane broke apart. I was still strapped to my seat, but water was rising quickly. I fumbled with my seatbelt, my fingers numb with cold and fear.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: Somehow, I managed to unbuckle myself. The water was up to my chest now. I could see other passengers struggling, some already floating lifelessly. I swam towards what looked like an opening, fighting against the current pulling me back. My lungs were burning, screaming for air. Just when I thought I couldn't hold my breath any longer, I broke the surface.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I gasped for air, coughing and spluttering. The sea was rough, waves crashing over me. Debris from the plane was everywhere. I grabbed onto a floating piece of the fuselage. In the distance, I could see other survivors, clinging to whatever they could find. The sun was setting, and I realized with horror that we might be out here all night.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I... I feel shaky. My heart is racing, just like it did then. I can almost taste the salt water in my mouth. It's overwhelming, but... I'm here. I survived. Sometimes I still can't believe it.",
    "Therapist: You did survive. You're safe now.",
    "Client: Yes, I am. It's just... the memories are so vivid. We were in the water for hours before rescue came. I kept thinking about my family, wondering if I'd ever see them again. The night was the worst part. It was so dark, and the waves seemed to get bigger. People around me were crying, praying. Some... some didn't make it through the night.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're processing them now.",
    "Client: When dawn finally came, I saw the rescue helicopters. I've never felt such relief in my life. But even as they were pulling us out of the water, I couldn't stop shaking. I was safe, but I couldn't feel safe. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. That's a common reaction.",
    "Client: Ever since then, I've been... different. Anxious all the time. I can't even think about getting on a plane without having a panic attack. Loud noises make me jump. I have nightmares almost every night. It's like... like I'm still there, in that moment, waiting for the plane to hit the water.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well facing these memories.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard, but... I want to get better. I want to be able to travel again without this fear consuming me. I want to sleep through the night without waking up in a cold sweat. I just... I want to feel normal again.",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. We'll work towards it together.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. Sometimes I feel guilty for surviving when others didn't. I keep wondering why I made it when so many others didn't. It doesn't seem fair. And then I feel guilty for feeling guilty because I know I should be grateful to be alive. It's all so confusing.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are normal. It's okay to have them.",
    "Client: I guess so. It's just... it's changed everything. I used to be so independent, you know? I traveled all over the world by myself. Now, I can barely leave my apartment without feeling anxious. I've lost so much of who I was. And I'm angry about that. Angry at the airline, at fate, at myself for being so affected by this. Is that wrong?",
    "Therapist: It's not wrong at all. Your feelings are valid.",
    "Client: Thank you for saying that. It helps to talk about it, even though it's painful. I've been avoiding thinking about it for so long, but I can see now that's not helping. I want to move past this, to reclaim my life. I know it won't be easy, but... I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. We'll work on it together.",
    "Client: I appreciate your support. It means a lot to have someone listen without judgment. I've felt so alone in this for so long. My family tries to understand, but unless you've been through something like this... it's hard to explain. The constant fear, the flashbacks, the way even small things can trigger memories of that day. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: You're not alone anymore. We're here to help you.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think... I think I'm ready to stop for today. This has been intense, but also... I don't know, maybe a little cathartic? I feel drained, but also like a weight has been lifted. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's a common reaction. You did very well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm looking forward to our next session, even though I know it won't be easy. But I feel like I've taken a first step towards healing, and that gives me hope. I haven't felt hopeful in a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful. We'll continue next time. Take care."
