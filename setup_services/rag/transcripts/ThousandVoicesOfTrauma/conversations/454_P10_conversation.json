    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to be talking about the car accident, and just thinking about it makes my stomach churn. But I'm here, and I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your courage. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 6 out of 10 right now. My hands are a little shaky.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Okay... yes. I can do this. (takes a deep breath) It was a Tuesday afternoon. I remember because I had just finished a client meeting and was heading home. The sky was overcast, and there was a light drizzle. I was driving down Oak Street, approaching the intersection with Maple...",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay in the present tense.",
    "Client: Right, sorry. I'm driving down Oak Street. The traffic is light, and I'm thinking about what to make for dinner. As I near the intersection, the light turns green. I'm about to go through when suddenly... (voice wavers) I see this blur of red from the corner of my eye.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I can feel it pounding in my chest. My palms are sweating on the steering wheel.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: This red car is barreling towards me from the right. It's not slowing down. I realize they're going to run the red light. I try to swerve, but it's too late. There's this deafening crash, and my car is spinning. The airbag explodes in my face. I can't breathe. I can't see. Everything is chaos.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) It's... it's an 8. Maybe a 9. God, it feels so real.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: The spinning stops, but my ears are ringing. I taste blood in my mouth. I'm trying to move, but my body feels heavy. There's shattered glass everywhere. I can smell gasoline and burning rubber. I'm terrified the car might explode.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm going to die. I can't get out. I'm trapped. Why isn't anyone helping me? (voice breaks) I don't want to die alone in this car.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Remember, you survived this.",
    "Client: (sniffles) Right. I did. I... I hear sirens in the distance. They're getting louder. Someone is shouting outside the car. A man's voice asking if I can hear him. I try to respond, but my voice is weak. My door is jammed. I can hear them trying to pry it open.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Scared, but... hopeful? The firefighters are here now. They're telling me to stay calm, that they're going to get me out. I can feel the car shaking as they work on the door. There's this loud screeching sound as they force it open.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep describing what's happening.",
    "Client: They're asking me questions. Can I move my fingers and toes? Does my neck hurt? Everything hurts, but I can move. They're so gentle as they put a neck brace on me and slide me onto a backboard. I'm looking up at the grey sky as they lift me out of the car. It's still drizzling. The raindrops feel cool on my face.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind at this point?",
    "Client: I... I'm relieved. Grateful. But also in shock, I think. I can see my car now. It's completely crumpled on the driver's side. I can't believe I'm alive. They're loading me into the ambulance. There's so much activity around me, but it all feels distant, like I'm watching it happen to someone else.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. How's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's come down a bit. Maybe a 7 now. My heart's still racing, but I feel more... present.",
    "Therapist: You're doing very well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: In the ambulance, they're hooking me up to machines. I can hear the steady beep of my heartbeat. The paramedic is asking me questions - my name, the date, if I have any allergies. I answer, but my voice sounds strange to me. We're moving now, sirens blaring. I'm trying to piece together what happened. Did I do something wrong? Was it my fault?",
    "Therapist: Remember, you had the green light.",
    "Client: Right... right. It wasn't my fault. (takes a shaky breath) We arrive at the hospital. Everything is a blur of bright lights and unfamiliar faces. They're cutting my clothes off, prodding me, asking more questions. I keep thinking about work, about the projects I have due. It seems so absurd now, but in that moment, it was all I could focus on.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling as you recall this?",
    "Client: Overwhelmed. Vulnerable. I remember feeling so exposed lying there in the ER. They're taking me for scans now. The CT machine is loud and claustrophobic. I close my eyes and try to steady my breathing. I'm thinking about my family, wondering if anyone has contacted them yet.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm back in the ER. A doctor is telling me I'm incredibly lucky. No major injuries, just a concussion, whiplash, and some cuts and bruises. They want to keep me overnight for observation. As the adrenaline wears off, the pain sets in. My whole body aches. A nurse gives me something for the pain, and I start to feel drowsy.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 5. I'm feeling... drained.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: My sister arrives. She looks so worried. I try to smile, to reassure her, but I start crying instead. It's like all the emotions I've been holding back just come flooding out. She holds my hand, and for the first time since the accident, I feel safe.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a powerful moment.",
    "Client: It was. (pauses) The next few days are a blur of hospital visits, insurance calls, and trying to process what happened. I keep replaying the accident in my mind, wondering if there was anything I could have done differently. The sound of screeching tires makes me jump. I'm afraid to get back in a car.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about cars now?",
    "Client: I'm... still nervous. But not as terrified as I was right after the accident. It's getting better, slowly.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. What do you notice in this room right now?",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) I can see the green plant in the corner. I can feel the softness of the chair I'm sitting in. I can hear the faint hum of the air conditioner.",
    "Therapist: Good. And how are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... lighter somehow. Like I've let go of something I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent, Sarah. You've done incredibly well today. What's your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: I'd say it's down to a 3 now. I feel more in control.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. How do you feel about the session overall?",
    "Client: It was intense, but... I think it helped. Talking through it like that, it makes it feel less overwhelming. Like I can face it.",
    "Therapist: I'm proud of the work you've done today. Let's take a few minutes to debrief and discuss some coping strategies for the coming week.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you. I... I think I'm ready for that.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great strength today, Sarah. Let's build on this progress..."
