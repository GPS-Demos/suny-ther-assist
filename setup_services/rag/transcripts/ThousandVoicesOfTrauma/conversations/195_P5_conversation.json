    "Therapist: Good morning. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Buenos d\u00edas, Doctor. I'm... a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this session all week. The idea of revisiting that hostage situation at the bank... it makes my heart race just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Your feelings are valid.",
    "Client: Gracias. It's just... I've spent so long trying to forget that day. The fear, the helplessness... it's all still so vivid. I worry that talking about it will make everything worse. What if I can't handle it?",
    "Therapist: That's a common concern. This process is designed to help, not harm.",
    "Client: I see. But how exactly does reliving such a traumatic experience help? It seems counterintuitive to me. I've always believed that some memories are better left buried.",
    "Therapist: By facing the memory, we can process it and reduce its power over you.",
    "Client: That makes sense, I suppose. But what if I get overwhelmed? Or have a panic attack right here in your office? I'm not as young as I used to be, you know. My heart might not be able to take it.",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. I'll be here to support you throughout.",
    "Client: Okay, that's reassuring. I appreciate your patience with me, Doctor. It's just... after losing my partner, I've felt so vulnerable. This trauma has only added to that feeling. I want to be strong, but sometimes it's hard.",
    "Therapist: Your strength is evident in your willingness to face this. We'll work together.",
    "Client: Thank you, that means a lot. I guess I'm ready to give this a try. What exactly will we be doing? How does this imaginal exposure work?",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit the memory gradually. You'll describe it in detail, in the present tense.",
    "Client: In the present tense? As if it's happening right now? That sounds... intense. Will I be able to stop if it becomes too much? And what should I expect to feel during this process?",
    "Therapist: Yes, you can pause anytime. You might feel anxiety, but it will decrease with repetition.",
    "Client: I see. It's a bit like exposure therapy for phobias, right? I remember my nieto went through something similar for his fear of heights. It was difficult at first, but it really helped him in the long run.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. This process follows a similar principle.",
    "Client: Alright, I think I understand better now. It's still scary, but I'm willing to try. You'll guide me through it, right? And maybe we can have a code word if I need to stop?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's use \"pausa\" as our code word. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: Pausa... yes, that works well. Okay, Doctor. I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Let's do this. For my peace of mind, for my family, for myself. I want to reclaim my life from this trauma.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Let's start slowly. Close your eyes when you're ready."
