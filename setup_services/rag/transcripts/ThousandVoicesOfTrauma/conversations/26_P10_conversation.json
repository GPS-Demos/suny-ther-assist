    "Therapist: Welcome back, Ahmed. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I think so... I'm feeling a bit anxious, to be honest. But I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Can you tell me your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 5 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Let's start. Close your eyes and describe the scene when your ex-partner told you she wanted a divorce.",
    "Client: (deep breath) Alright... I'm in our living room. It's evening, and the soft glow of the lamp casts long shadows across the room. I can smell the faint scent of jasmine from the candle she always liked to burn. I... I just got home from work, and Sarah is sitting on the couch, her face serious. My heart starts to race as I sense something's wrong.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay in the moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: She... she tells me we need to talk. Her voice is trembling slightly, and I feel a knot forming in my stomach. I sit down across from her, my hands suddenly clammy. She looks at me, her eyes glistening with tears, and says, \"Ahmed, I can't do this anymore. I want a divorce.\"",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, like I can't breathe properly. My hands are shaking, and I feel dizzy. It's like the room is spinning around me.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Stay with those sensations. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 7 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what happens.",
    "Client: I... I can't believe what I'm hearing. The words echo in my head, but they don't make sense. I stammer, \"What? Why? We can work this out.\" But Sarah shakes her head, tears now flowing freely. She starts listing all the reasons \u2013 how we've grown apart, how I'm always working, how she feels neglected. Each word feels like a knife twisting in my chest.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking this can't be happening. We were supposed to grow old together. I'm thinking about all the plans we made, the future we talked about. It's all crumbling around me. I feel so... so worthless.",
    "Therapist: Remember, these are memories. You're safe here. Take another deep breath.",
    "Client: (audible breath) Okay... Sarah is still talking, but I can barely hear her over the roaring in my ears. I want to argue, to fight for us, but I feel paralyzed. My mouth is dry, and when I try to speak, only a choked sob comes out.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Ahmed. Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I finally find my voice. I'm pleading with her, promising to change, to be better. But she just looks at me with pity in her eyes. She says, \"It's too late, Ahmed. I've made up my mind.\" And suddenly, I'm angry. So angry. I stand up, knocking over the coffee table. The sound of shattering glass fills the room.",
    "Therapist: Good. Describe your anger.",
    "Client: It's... it's like a fire burning through me. My fists are clenched, and I'm shouting. Asking how she could do this to me, to us. I'm saying hurtful things I don't mean, calling her selfish, accusing her of never really loving me. But even as I'm yelling, I can see her retreating, pulling away from me emotionally.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel out of control. Scared of my own anger. Desperate to make her stay. And underneath it all, there's this overwhelming sense of shame. Shame that I couldn't be what she needed, that I'm not enough.",
    "Therapist: Take a breath. You're safe here. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. This is really intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Sarah... she's backing away from me now. She looks frightened, and that just makes me feel worse. I want to comfort her, but I'm too caught up in my own pain. She says she's going to stay with her sister for a while, that we need some space. And then she's gathering her things, stuffing clothes into a bag. I'm following her around the house, still talking, still trying to change her mind. But it's like I'm not even there anymore.",
    "Therapist: What are you noticing in your body?",
    "Client: My throat feels raw from shouting. My heart is pounding so hard I can feel it in my ears. My hands are shaking uncontrollably.",
    "Therapist: Good awareness. Keep describing what's happening.",
    "Client: Sarah... she's at the door now. She turns to look at me one last time, and I can see the mixture of sadness and determination in her eyes. She says, \"I'm sorry, Ahmed. I really am.\" And then she's gone. The sound of the door closing behind her is so final. I... I collapse to the floor, sobbing. The house suddenly feels so empty, so silent. I can't breathe. I can't think. It's like my whole world has just ended.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 10. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Ahmed. This is just a memory. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (audible breath) Okay... I'm... I'm still on the floor. I don't know how long I've been there. Hours maybe. The room is dark now. I can hear the tick of the clock on the wall, each second feeling like an eternity. I'm replaying everything in my head, wondering what I could have done differently, how I could have saved us.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking about yourself in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking I'm a failure. That I've ruined the one good thing in my life. That I'll never be happy again. That I don't deserve to be loved.",
    "Therapist: Remember, these are just thoughts, not facts. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I finally drag myself to bed. But I can't sleep. I keep reaching out to Sarah's side of the bed, but it's cold and empty. I toss and turn all night, alternating between anger and despair. When the sun finally rises, I feel like I've aged years overnight.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... hollow. Empty. Like a part of me has been ripped away. The anger is gone, replaced by this deep, aching sadness.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to an 8 now. The intensity has faded a bit.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Take a few deep breaths.",
    "Client: (audible breaths) Okay... I'm... I'm starting to feel a bit calmer.",
    "Therapist: Good. Slowly open your eyes when you're ready. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. But also, maybe a little relieved? Like I've let something out that I've been holding onto for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. You did excellent work today, Ahmed. How would you rate your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 4 now. I feel more grounded.",
    "Therapist: Great job. Let's take a few moments to process what you experienced."
