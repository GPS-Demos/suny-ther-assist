    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Johnson?",
    "Client: Oh, it's... it's quite overwhelming, to be honest. I didn't expect it to feel so real, even after all these years. My hands are still shaking a bit. It's like I was right back there in that moment, you know? I could almost smell the cigarette smoke on his breath and feel the coldness of the kitchen tiles beneath my feet. It's strange how vivid these memories can be, even at my age.",
    "Therapist: What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The fear. The absolute terror I felt when I heard his footsteps coming down the hallway. I remember thinking, \"This is it. This time he might actually kill me.\" And the shame... the overwhelming shame of being in that situation at my age. I should have known better, should have been stronger. But I felt so helpless, like a child again.",
    "Therapist: How does sharing this make you feel now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of emotions, really. There's still fear there, but also... relief? Is that strange? It's like finally letting out a breath I've been holding for decades. But there's also this deep sadness. I've lost so much time, so many years living in fear. And anger too - at him, at myself, at the world for letting this happen.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. How do you think this relates to your current symptoms?",
    "Client: Well, I suppose... I've always been jumpy, especially around men. Even my own sons sometimes. And I have trouble sleeping - nightmares, you know? I guess reliving this memory helps me understand why. It's not just some irrational fear; it's based on real experiences. And the depression... I think a lot of it comes from feeling like I lost control of my life for so long.",
    "Therapist: What's one thing you've learned from this process?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm starting to realize that it wasn't my fault. For years, I blamed myself for not leaving sooner, for not being stronger. But going through this memory again, I can see how trapped I really was. It wasn't a choice I made; it was survival.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How might this change things for you?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I can start being a little kinder to myself? And perhaps I can explain to my family why I act the way I do sometimes. They've been so patient with me, but I know they don't always understand. This might help me open up to them more.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's hard, really hard. But I think it's worth it. For the first time in years, I feel like I'm actually moving forward instead of just existing. It's scary, but... I'm ready to keep going. I want to reclaim the years I have left, you know? I don't want to be defined by what happened to me anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a courageous attitude. What's your main takeaway today?",
    "Client: I survived. Not just the abuse, but this session too. I faced one of my worst memories and I'm still here, still fighting. That makes me feel... stronger, I suppose. Like maybe I'm not as fragile as I thought I was. And that gives me hope for the future, as strange as that might sound at my age.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. How can we support you until next time?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I could try writing down some of my thoughts when the memories come up? And perhaps I could talk to my daughter about what we're doing here. She's been worried about me, and it might help her understand. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Those sound like great ideas. Anything else?",
    "Client: No, I think that's enough for now. This session has been exhausting, but in a good way, if that makes sense. I feel drained, but also... lighter somehow. Thank you for your patience with me. I know it can't be easy listening to these stories.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue next week. Take care.",
    "Client: Thank you, doctor. I will. And... thank you for helping me find my voice again. It's been silent for far too long."
