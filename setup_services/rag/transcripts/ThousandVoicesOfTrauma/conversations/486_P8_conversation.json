    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I'm back there, you know? The memory feels so vivid. I can still hear the shouting, smell the sweat and fear in the air. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Mhm. What physical sensations are you noticing right now?",
    "Client: My palms are sweaty, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's hard to breathe normally. I feel... jittery, like I need to move or do something. But at the same time, I'm frozen. It's a strange contradiction.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. How I couldn't do anything to change the situation. I was just... there, at the mercy of those men. And then I think about my family, wondering if I'd ever see them again. It's... it's crushing, you know? The weight of that fear and uncertainty.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. How are you coping with those feelings now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a struggle. Part of me wants to push it all away, to forget it ever happened. But another part knows I need to face this. It's just... it's exhausting. Sometimes I feel angry - at the men who did this, at myself for being there, at the world for being so unpredictable and dangerous. And then I feel guilty for feeling angry. It's a mess of emotions.",
    "Therapist: What do you think that guilt is about?",
    "Client: I guess... I feel like I should be over this by now. It's been years, and I'm still affected by it. I worry that I'm letting my family down, that I'm not as strong as I should be. And then there's this voice in my head saying I should be grateful I survived when others didn't. It's... it's confusing.",
    "Therapist: How does revisiting this memory impact your daily life?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a shadow that follows me everywhere. I'm always on edge, always watching for danger. I struggle to trust people, even those close to me. It's affected my relationship with my partner - I find it hard to open up, to be vulnerable. And work... some days it's all I can do to function normally. The memory pops up at random times, and suddenly I'm back there, feeling that same terror.",
    "Therapist: What strategies have you found helpful in managing these moments?",
    "Client: I've been trying to use some of the breathing exercises we've practiced. They help... sometimes. And talking about it, like we're doing now, it's painful but... I think it's necessary. I've also been trying to reconnect with things I enjoyed before the incident - cooking, playing guitar. It helps ground me in the present.",
    "Therapist: How do you see your progress in therapy so far?",
    "Client: It's... it's a rollercoaster, to be honest. Some days I feel like I'm making real progress, like I can see a future where this doesn't dominate my life. Other days, it feels like I'm right back at the beginning. But overall, I think I'm... I'm moving forward. Slowly, but forward. I'm starting to understand my reactions better, to recognize when I'm being triggered. It's hard work, but... I think it's worth it.",
    "Therapist: What gives you hope in your recovery journey?",
    "Client: That's... that's a tough question. I guess... seeing small improvements gives me hope. Like, being able to talk about this without completely breaking down - that's progress. And my partner's support means a lot. They've been so patient and understanding. I want to get better for them, for us. And... I don't know, maybe the idea that by working through this, I might be able to help others someday. Turn this terrible experience into something... something meaningful, you know?",
    "Therapist: How do you feel now compared to when we started today's session?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also somewhat lighter. It's like... like I've been carrying this heavy backpack, and I've just taken it off for a moment. The weight of the memory is still there, but it feels more manageable somehow. I'm exhausted, but there's also a sense of... I don't know, accomplishment maybe? Like I've faced something difficult and come out the other side. It's a mix of emotions, really.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to explore more about how this is affecting my relationships. Especially with my partner. I want to find ways to connect better, to not let this experience isolate me from the people I care about. And maybe... maybe we could look at some more strategies for managing the flashbacks when they happen at work. I've had a few close calls where I almost lost it in front of colleagues, and that scares me.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. We'll address that next time.",
    "Client: Thank you. This... this isn't easy, but I'm grateful for the support. I just hope... I hope someday I can look back on this and see how far I've come. That this won't always have such a hold on me. Is that... is that possible?",
    "Therapist: Many find healing possible with time and effort. How about we end here today?",
    "Client: Yeah, that sounds good. I'm pretty wiped out. But... thanks. For listening, for guiding me through this. It means a lot. I'll try to practice some of those grounding techniques we talked about before our next session. Is there... is there anything else I should be doing between now and then?",
    "Therapist: Just take care of yourself. We'll pick up next time.",
    "Client: Okay, I will. Thanks again. See you next week."
