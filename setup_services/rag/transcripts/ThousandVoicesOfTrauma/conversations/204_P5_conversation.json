    "Therapist: Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: I'm not really sure what that means. Can you explain it to me? I'm feeling a bit nervous about trying something new.",
    "Therapist: Of course. It's a technique where you'll revisit your traumatic memories in a safe environment. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Revisit my memories? That sounds pretty intense. I've been trying so hard to avoid thinking about those experiences. Won't that make things worse? I'm already struggling with depression, and I'm worried this might push me over the edge.",
    "Therapist: I understand your concerns. This process actually helps reduce symptoms over time. How does that sound to you?",
    "Client: I guess that makes sense, but I'm still scared. What if I can't handle it? Being a student is already stressful enough, and living with roommates doesn't give me much privacy to deal with my emotions.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. We'll go at your pace and I'll support you throughout. What coping strategies have worked for you before?",
    "Client: Well, I've found that deep breathing helps sometimes. And talking to my best friend usually makes me feel better. But this seems different. How long will the exposure last? And what exactly will I have to do?",
    "Therapist: The exposure typically lasts about 30-45 minutes. You'll describe your traumatic experience in detail. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: That's a long time to talk about something so painful. I'm worried I might break down or have a panic attack. And honestly, I'm not sure how much I remember clearly. A lot of my childhood is kind of a blur.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel anxious. We'll take breaks if needed. Your bravery in facing this is commendable. Any other concerns?",
    "Client: Thank you, that helps a bit. I guess I'm also worried about how this might affect my studies. If it stirs up a lot of emotions, will I be able to focus on my coursework? And... I haven't really talked about my experiences with racial trauma before. It feels vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: We'll work on grounding techniques to help you transition after sessions. Your studies are important. How else can I support you?",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I think it would help if we could have a signal or a word I can use if things get too overwhelming during the exposure. And maybe we could discuss some specific strategies for managing my emotions in between sessions, especially when I'm around my roommates or in class?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's establish a safe word and discuss coping strategies now. What would you like your safe word to be?",
    "Client: How about \"pause\"? It's simple and easy to remember. And for coping strategies, I've heard mindfulness can be helpful, but I've never really tried it. Could you maybe teach me a quick mindfulness exercise I could use when I'm feeling overwhelmed?",
    "Therapist: \"Pause\" works well. Let's practice a brief mindfulness exercise now. Are you ready to try?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm ready. I appreciate you taking the time to address my concerns and teach me some skills. It makes me feel a bit more prepared for what's to come. Even though I'm still nervous, I'm starting to see how this could potentially help me in the long run.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad you're feeling more prepared. Let's begin the mindfulness exercise. Close your eyes and focus on your breath..."
