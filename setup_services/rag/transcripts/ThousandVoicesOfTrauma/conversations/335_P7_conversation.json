    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure exercise. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the scene of the animal attack?",
    "Client: Okay... I was walking in the park near our house. It was a sunny afternoon, and I had just finished my grocery shopping. I remember the weight of the bags in my hands. As I approached the playground area, I heard a commotion. There was a large dog, maybe a Rottweiler or a Pit Bull, it was growling and barking aggressively at a young boy on the swing set.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you saw.",
    "Client: The boy was frozen in fear, gripping the chains of the swing. The dog's owner was desperately trying to control it, but the leash had snapped. Everything seemed to slow down as I watched the dog lunge towards the child. I wanted to scream, to do something, but I felt paralyzed.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What were you feeling?",
    "Client: I felt... terrified. My heart was pounding so hard I could hear it in my ears. My hands were shaking, and I dropped my grocery bags. The oranges rolled across the path, but I couldn't move to pick them up. I felt so helpless, watching this unfold before my eyes.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The dog... it grabbed the boy's leg and started shaking it violently. The child's screams were piercing. I've never heard anything like it before. People were running towards them, but it felt like they were moving in slow motion. I remember thinking, \"This can't be happening. This can't be real.\"",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The boy's mother appeared out of nowhere, screaming and hitting the dog with her purse. The dog wouldn't let go. There was blood... so much blood on the boy's pants. I felt nauseous and lightheaded. I wanted to help, but my feet wouldn't move. I just stood there, watching this horrific scene unfold.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel overwhelmed. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: Finally, a man - I think he was a jogger - managed to pull the dog off the boy. The child was sobbing uncontrollably, cradled in his mother's arms. The dog's owner was in shock, repeating \"I'm sorry\" over and over again. The jogger was restraining the dog, which was still snarling and trying to lunge.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. How did you feel after the attack ended?",
    "Client: I felt... I felt guilty. So incredibly guilty. Why didn't I do something? Why couldn't I move? I've replayed that moment in my head countless times, thinking about what I could have done differently. The boy's cries, the mother's screams, they haunt me. I can still hear them when I close my eyes.",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. You're processing a traumatic event.",
    "Client: I know that logically, but emotionally... it's hard. After the ambulance came and took the boy away, I finally managed to move. I gathered my scattered groceries, my hands shaking so badly I could barely hold the bags. I practically ran home, locking the door behind me. I felt so ashamed, so useless.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Continue sharing what happened next.",
    "Client: I couldn't sleep that night. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the attack happening again. I kept hearing the screams, the growling. For weeks after, I avoided that park. I couldn't bear to walk past it. Even now, months later, when I hear a dog bark, I flinch. I feel my heart race. It's like I'm back there, in that moment, frozen and helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage by facing this memory.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's... it's not easy. I've always loved animals, especially dogs. But now, I find myself crossing the street if I see someone walking a large dog. I know it's irrational, but I can't help it. This experience has changed me in ways I never expected. I feel more anxious, more aware of potential dangers around me. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel changed. You're working through it.",
    "Client: I am trying. But sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel normal again. Will I ever be able to enjoy a simple walk in the park without constantly scanning for potential threats? Will I ever be able to pet a dog without my heart racing? It feels like this incident has stolen a part of me that I may never get back.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are understandable. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: I hope so. I really do. Because right now, it feels like this fear and guilt are controlling my life. I want to be the person I was before - carefree, animal-loving, able to enjoy outdoor activities without constant anxiety. But that person feels so far away now. It's like there's a divide in my life - before the attack and after. And I'm not sure how to bridge that gap.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. Let's continue working on this."
