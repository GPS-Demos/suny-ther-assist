    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the memory.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in high school, walking down the hallway. I can see the lockers, smell the cleaning products. My ex-girlfriend is there with her new boyfriend. They're laughing and whispering. I feel... I feel like everyone's staring at me.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 4 out of 10. It's uncomfortable, but not too bad yet.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: As I walk past them, I hear my ex say something like, \"Oh, there he is.\" Her new boyfriend smirks and says loudly, \"Hey, loser!\" I can feel my face getting hot, my palms are sweaty. I'm trying to walk faster, but it feels like my legs are moving through mud.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's getting worse. Maybe a 6 out of 10 now. My heart's racing, and I feel kind of sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: That sounds tough. Keep going, you're doing well.",
    "Client: Thanks. I... I make it to my classroom, but I can hear them laughing behind me. I sit down, but I can't focus. The teacher's voice sounds far away. All I can think about is how everyone must be talking about me, how I wasn't good enough for her. I feel so... so worthless.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating at this point?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. I'm reliving all those feelings of rejection and humiliation. My chest feels tight, and I'm having trouble breathing normally.",
    "Therapist: I hear how distressing this is. You're handling it bravely.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can keep going. It's too much.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here. What's happening now?",
    "Client: I... okay. I'm trying to calm down. In the memory, I'm still in class, but now I'm imagining what might happen after. Will they be waiting for me? Will everyone laugh at me in the cafeteria? I feel so alone and scared.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down a bit. Maybe a 7? I'm still anxious, but talking about it is helping somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing the memory. Keep going.",
    "Client: The bell rings, and I'm dreading leaving the classroom. But as I step out, I see my best friend waiting for me. He doesn't know what happened, but he can tell something's wrong. He asks if I'm okay, and... and I feel a little less alone.",
    "Therapist: How does that change your feelings?",

    "Therapist: What's your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: I'd say it's down to a 3 now. I feel... I feel okay.",
    "Therapist: Well done. Let's take a moment to breathe before we discuss."
