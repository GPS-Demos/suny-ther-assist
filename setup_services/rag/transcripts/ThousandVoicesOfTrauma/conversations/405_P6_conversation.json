    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's begin when you're comfortable.",
    "Client: Okay, I'm closing my eyes now. I'm remembering the day I found those awful comments about me online. My heart is starting to race a little.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue with the memory.",
    "Client: I was scrolling through my social media feed when I saw a post from a coworker. At first, I thought it was just a normal update, but then I noticed the comments. There were so many cruel things written about me. People I thought were my friends were saying I was incompetent, lazy, and that I didn't deserve my job. My chest feels tight thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. I can feel my palms getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Keep going.",
    "Client: As I read more comments, I felt like the room was spinning. Someone had shared an embarrassing photo of me from the office Christmas party, and people were making fun of how I looked. I remember feeling so exposed and humiliated. My breathing is getting faster now.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with it if you can.",
    "Client: I... I tried to defend myself in the comments, but that only made things worse. More people joined in, calling me oversensitive and dramatic. I felt so alone and attacked. I'm shaking a little now, remembering how helpless I felt.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: Still an 8. Maybe even a 9. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I ended up calling in sick the next day. I couldn't face anyone. I felt like everyone was laughing at me behind my back. I spent the whole day in bed, crying on and off. My stomach hurts thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down a bit. Maybe a 7? I'm starting to remember that I got through it.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Keep going.",
    "Client: I eventually reached out to HR about the cyberbullying. They were supportive and took action. Some of the worst offenders were disciplined. But the damage was done. I never felt comfortable at work again. That's why I eventually quit. I'm feeling a mix of anger and sadness now.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level?",

    "Client: I'd say it's down to a 4 again. I feel... I don't know, maybe a little empowered?",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. Let's end here and discuss."
