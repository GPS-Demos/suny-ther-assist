    "Therapist: Welcome, James. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. I've been dreading this session a bit. Talking about what happened that night is still hard for me.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We'll take it step by step.",
    "Client: Okay. I guess we should start. That night, I was working late at the office. It was around 9 PM when I got the call from the hospital. They told me Sarah had been in a car accident. I remember my hands shaking as I grabbed my keys...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: I drove to the hospital in a daze. The streets were a blur. When I got there, the emergency room was chaos. Nurses rushing, people crying. I approached the desk, and before I could even speak, I saw the doctor walking towards me with a grim expression. I knew... I just knew.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) He said, \"Mr. Johnson, I'm so sorry...\" I felt like the floor dropped out from under me. I couldn't breathe. Sarah, my Sarah... gone. Just like that. We were supposed to celebrate our anniversary next week. I... I can't...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (taking a deep breath) The worst part was having to identify her body. She looked so peaceful, like she was sleeping. But she was cold... so cold. I touched her hand, hoping she'd squeeze back like she always did. But there was nothing. I broke down right there, sobbing over her.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: After that, everything's a blur. I remember sitting in the waiting room, staring at the wall. People were talking to me, but I couldn't hear them. It felt like I was underwater. I kept thinking, 'This can't be real. This can't be happening.' But it was. My wife was gone, and I was alone.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... hollow. Talking about it brings back that night so vividly. The smell of the hospital, the fluorescent lights, the coldness of her hand. It's like I'm reliving it all over again.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're doing great.",
    "Client: (sighs) The drive home was the longest of my life. Our house felt so empty. I sat on our bed, holding her pillow, breathing in her scent. I couldn't sleep. I just kept replaying our last conversation over and over in my head. If only I'd told her to be careful on the road... if only I'd gone home earlier...",
    "Therapist: Remember, it wasn't your fault.",
    "Client: I know that logically, but emotionally... it's hard. The guilt, the 'what ifs'... they eat at me. The next few days were a whirlwind of funeral arrangements and condolences. I felt like I was on autopilot. People kept telling me how strong I was, but inside, I was falling apart.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way.",
    "Client: The funeral was... God, it was awful. Seeing her casket, all those flowers... It made it so final. I gave a eulogy, but I don't even remember what I said. All I could think was, 'This isn't fair. We were supposed to grow old together.'",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: After everyone left, the silence was deafening. Our home, once filled with laughter and love, felt like a mausoleum. I couldn't bear to move her things. Her coffee mug still sits where she left it that morning. Sometimes, I catch myself talking to her, expecting her to answer.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. Go on.",
    "Client: The nights are the worst. I reach for her in my sleep, only to wake up to an empty bed. The loneliness... it's crushing. I've thrown myself into work, trying to keep busy, but at the end of the day, I come home to an empty house and it all comes rushing back.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Drained. But... maybe a little lighter? Talking about it... it hurts, but it also feels like I'm letting some of the pressure out. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. That's part of the healing process.",
    "Client: I miss her so much. Every day, I find new things to miss about her. Her smile, her laugh, the way she'd hum while cooking. It's the little things that catch me off guard and bring me to my knees.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to grieve. You're making progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. I know this is part of the process, but it's so hard. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel whole again. But I'm trying. I know Sarah would want me to keep going, to find happiness again. It's just... it's a long road ahead.",
    "Therapist: You're on the right path. We'll end here for today.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you for listening. It means a lot to have someone to talk to about this. Same time next week?",
    "Therapist: Yes, I'll see you then. Take care, James."
