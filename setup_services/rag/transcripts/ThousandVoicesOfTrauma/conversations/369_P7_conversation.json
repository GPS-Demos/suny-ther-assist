    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe what happened when you witnessed the violence?",
    "Client: Okay... I was in my hometown, a small village near the border. It was early morning, and I was walking to the market. Suddenly, I heard shouting and screaming. I saw a group of armed men entering the village. They were yelling and firing their weapons into the air. People were running, trying to hide. I froze, not knowing what to do.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I hid behind a large tree. My heart was pounding so hard I thought they might hear it. I saw them entering houses, dragging people out. There was a family \u2013 a mother, father, and two young children. The armed men were shouting at them, demanding something. The father was trying to protect his family, but one of the men hit him with the butt of his gun. The children were crying, and the mother was begging them to stop.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... terrified. Helpless. I wanted to do something, but I was paralyzed with fear. The sound of the children crying is so clear in my memory. I can still hear it now. My hands are shaking just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I watched as they forced the family into a truck. Other villagers were being rounded up too. I knew some of them \u2013 my neighbors, friends. The armed men were destroying everything in their path. Houses were being ransacked, belongings thrown into the street. I remember the smell of smoke \u2013 they had set fire to some buildings.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I stayed hidden for what felt like hours. When the armed men finally left, taking many villagers with them, I emerged from my hiding place. The village was in ruins. There were injured people everywhere, crying for help. I tried to assist where I could, but I felt so overwhelmed. That's when I knew I had to leave. I couldn't stay there anymore. The fear of them coming back was too much.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... a mix of emotions. Sad, angry, guilty for not doing more. But also relieved that I survived. It's hard to reconcile all these feelings. Sometimes I wonder if I should have tried to help more, but then I remember how terrified I was.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have conflicting emotions. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still so vivid in my mind. The journey after that was difficult too. I had to leave everything behind, not knowing if I'd ever see my home again. The refugee camp was overcrowded and conditions were poor. But at least I felt safer there than in my village. Still, the memories of that day haunted me. They still do, sometimes.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but also a bit lighter. Talking about it is hard, but I think it helps. Sometimes I worry these memories will never fade, that I'll always carry this weight with me.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I hope so. I want to move forward, to build a new life here. But it's challenging when these memories surface. I'm trying to focus on the present, on the opportunities I have now. But sometimes, especially at night, the sounds and images from that day come flooding back.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well in managing those memories. Let's wrap up for today.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you for listening and guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm slowly making progress. I appreciate your support and patience.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. We'll continue next session."
