    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mrs. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like my whole body is trembling on the inside. The memory of that night, the home invasion... it's so vivid now. I can still hear the sound of glass breaking downstairs. My heart is racing just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. I was frozen in my bed, listening to those footsteps coming up the stairs. I... I should have done something, called for help, but I couldn't move. I feel so ashamed that I just lay there, paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: How does that shame feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like a heavy weight on my chest. My throat feels tight, and there's this knot in my stomach. I feel small, you know? Like I'm shrinking into myself. It's hard to even look at you right now.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm angry. Not just at the intruders, but at myself. I've lived alone for so long after my divorce, and I've always prided myself on being independent. But that night... it shattered that image I had of myself. Now I'm living with my daughter and her family, and I hate feeling like a burden. I miss my home, my routines, but I'm too scared to live alone again.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger manifest for you?",
    "Client: It's like a fire in my chest. My hands are clenching just talking about it. I want to scream, to punch something. But then I remember how I couldn't even make a sound that night, and the anger turns inward. I feel so... so disappointed in myself.",
    "Therapist: What do you make of that disappointment?",
    "Client: I guess... I guess it's tied to how I've always seen myself. I've weathered so much in my life - a difficult marriage, raising kids alone, battling depression. I thought I was tough, you know? But now, at 76, I feel like I've lost that strength. It's like the home invasion stole more than just my belongings; it took away my sense of self.",
    "Therapist: How does that loss of identity affect you day-to-day?",
    "Client: It's... it's pervasive. I find myself second-guessing everything. I used to enjoy my part-time job at the library, but now I'm always looking over my shoulder, startling at every loud noise. At home, I feel like I'm walking on eggshells, not wanting to be a bother to my daughter's family. I've stopped doing things I love, like my evening walks or tending to my garden. It's like I'm not living anymore, just... existing.",
    "Therapist: What comes up when you think about reclaiming those parts of yourself?",
    "Client: There's a spark of hope, but it's quickly overshadowed by fear. I want to be that strong, independent woman again. I miss her. But then I remember the terror of that night, and I... I don't know if I can ever feel safe again. It's frustrating because logically, I know the chances of another home invasion are slim, but emotionally, I can't shake the fear.",
    "Therapist: How does that conflict between logic and emotion feel?",
    "Client: It's exhausting. My mind is constantly at war with itself. One part of me wants to move forward, to reclaim my life. But another part is stuck in that moment of terror, reliving it over and over. It's like I'm split in two, and I don't know how to bring those parts back together.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to you to reconcile those parts?",
    "Client: It would... it would mean everything. To feel whole again, to trust myself and my judgement. To be able to enjoy simple pleasures without constant fear. To feel like I'm living rather than just surviving. But it feels so out of reach right now. I'm not sure I even remember what it feels like to be at peace.",
    "Therapist: What small step might move you in that direction?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe I could try sitting on my daughter's porch in the evenings. Just for a few minutes at first. It's not the same as my old evening walks, but it might help me feel a bit more connected to the world outside. And perhaps I could start a small herb garden in the kitchen window. Something to nurture, to remind me that growth is still possible.",
    "Therapist: How does considering those steps make you feel?",
    "Client: There's a glimmer of excitement, but it's mixed with anxiety. The idea of being outside, even on the porch, makes my heart race a bit. But there's also a part of me that longs for it, that remembers how much I used to enjoy the fresh air and the sounds of the neighborhood. And the thought of having plants to care for again... it brings a warmth to my chest. It's small, but it feels like... like a tiny spark of my old self.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to explore more ways to reconnect with parts of myself that I've lost. Maybe we could talk about strategies for managing my anxiety when I try new things. And... and I'd like to work on forgiving myself for that night. I know logically that it wasn't my fault, but I need help believing it emotionally.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but also a bit lighter. Talking about that night is never easy, but I feel like I understand my reactions a bit better now. There's still a lot of work to do, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can find my way back to myself. Thank you for listening and guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue next week."
