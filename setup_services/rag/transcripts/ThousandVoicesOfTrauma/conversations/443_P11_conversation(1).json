    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Khalil?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving that moment when I witnessed the domestic violence incident in our neighborhood... it's brought up a lot of emotions I've been trying to suppress for years.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most about the experience?",
    "Client: The sounds. The screaming, the shattering glass... it was like I was right back there, frozen on the sidewalk. I could feel my heart racing, just like it did that day. It's strange how vivid it all becomes when you force yourself to really remember.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. Frightening, even. But also, in a way, liberating? I've spent so long trying not to think about it, and now that I've faced it head-on, it's like... I don't know, like I'm taking back some control.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How does this connect to your everyday experiences?",
    "Client: Well, I've noticed that loud noises or arguments have always set me on edge since that day. Even at work, if voices are raised in a meeting, I feel this surge of panic. I think... I think I've been carrying this fear with me all along, without really understanding why.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. How do you see this relating to your recovery goals?",
    "Client: I suppose... if I can learn to process these memories without being overwhelmed, maybe I can start to feel safer in my day-to-day life. Maybe I won't always be waiting for the other shoe to drop, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent observation. What strategies have you found helpful so far?",
    "Client: The breathing exercises we've practiced have been surprisingly effective. When I felt myself getting too anxious during the exposure, I was able to use them to ground myself. It's like... a lifeline back to the present.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad you're finding those helpful. How do you feel about continuing with the exposures?",
    "Client: It's daunting, I won't lie. But I also feel... hopeful? For the first time in a long while, I feel like I'm actually addressing the problem instead of just trying to ignore it. It's difficult, but I think it's worth it.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to work on my reactions to sudden noises. That seems to be a big trigger for me, especially since the accident I was in a few years ago. It's like my brain can't distinguish between a car backfiring and... well, something more sinister.",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. How have these sessions been affecting your depression?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. Some days, facing these memories makes me feel worse. But overall, I think I'm starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel. My wife has noticed that I seem more present, less withdrawn. That alone feels like progress.",
    "Therapist: That is progress. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss today?",
    "Client: I... I'm curious about how to talk to my family about this. They've been so patient with me, but I know my struggles have affected them too. I want them to understand what I'm going through, but I'm not sure how to explain it.",
    "Therapist: That's a thoughtful consideration. Shall we brainstorm some ideas next time?",
    "Client: Yes, I'd appreciate that. It's important to me that they understand this isn't just about the past, but about building a better future for all of us. I want to be the husband and father they deserve.",
    "Therapist: That's a beautiful goal. We'll work on that together. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... good. Like I've done something important today. Thank you for guiding me through this. It means more than I can express.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your hard work is paying off. We'll continue next week?",
    "Client: Absolutely. I'll be here. Thank you again, doctor."
