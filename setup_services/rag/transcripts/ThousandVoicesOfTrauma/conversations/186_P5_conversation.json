    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. Today we'll start imaginal exposure. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of reliving that accident... it's overwhelming. I've spent so much time trying to push those memories away, and now you're asking me to bring them back. It's scary.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Imaginal exposure can be challenging, but it's crucial for healing.",
    "Client: I understand that, but... how exactly is this supposed to help? Won't it just make everything worse? I've been having nightmares about the accident, and now you want me to voluntarily think about it? It doesn't make sense to me.",
    "Therapist: It helps by processing the memory safely. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about losing control. What if I have a panic attack during the session? Or what if I can't stop thinking about it afterward? I have a big presentation at work next week, and I can't afford to be distracted or emotional.",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. I'll be here to support you throughout.",
    "Client: Okay, that's somewhat reassuring. But what exactly will we be doing? Do I just start talking about the accident? And how long will this take? I'm not sure I can handle reliving it for too long.",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the experience in detail. We'll start with 20 minutes today.",
    "Client: Twenty minutes? That seems like an eternity. I'm not sure I can talk about it for that long. What if I run out of things to say? Or what if I get too upset and can't continue?",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel anxious. We can pause if needed. Your bravery is commendable.",
    "Client: Thank you for saying that. I don't feel very brave right now. I feel like I'm about to jump off a cliff without knowing what's at the bottom. But I trust you, and I want to get better. I'm tired of living in fear and avoiding things that remind me of the accident. If this can help... I guess I'm willing to try.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is a big step. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Can you just... can you walk me through what I need to do one more time? And maybe remind me of some of those grounding techniques we practiced? I have a feeling I'm going to need them.",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes, describe the event in detail. Use present tense. I'll guide you.",
    "Client: Okay. I'll try my best. It's strange, but now that we're about to start, I feel a mix of fear and... almost relief? Like maybe finally facing this head-on might help. I just hope I can get through it without falling apart.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. Ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I am. Let's do this before I change my mind. I'm putting my trust in you and this process. Here goes nothing..."
