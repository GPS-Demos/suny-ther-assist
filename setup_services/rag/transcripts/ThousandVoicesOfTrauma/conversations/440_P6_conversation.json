    "Therapist: Welcome back. Are you ready to continue our imaginal exposure exercise focusing on your workplace trauma?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. My stomach's in knots just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Can you give me your current SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 4 out of 10. I'm anxious, but not overwhelmed yet.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Let's begin. Close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) I'm in the break room at work. It's lunchtime, and I can smell someone's leftover curry. I'm sitting alone, as usual, trying to eat quickly so I can get back to my desk. Then I hear them coming - the group of coworkers who always pick on me. My heart starts racing...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: They walk in, laughing loudly. One of them, Mark, spots me and nudges the others. They all go quiet for a second, then start whispering and giggling. I know they're talking about me. I can feel my face getting hot, and my hands are starting to shake.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 6. I can feel the anxiety building in my chest.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: Mark walks over to me, grinning. He says, \"Hey there, freak. Eating alone again?\" The others laugh. I try to ignore them, but my vision's getting blurry. I'm fighting back tears. I want to disappear, to just melt into the floor...",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) I... I can't. It's too much. My SUDS is at an 8 now. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great. What do you notice in your body?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. My hands are clammy. I feel dizzy, like the room is spinning.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. These sensations will pass. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: (Inhales deeply) Okay... In the memory, I'm trying to gather my things to leave, but I'm so flustered I knock my lunch onto the floor. Everyone erupts in laughter. Mark says, \"Looks like the freak can't even eat properly.\" I... I feel so humiliated.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still at an 8. Maybe even a 9. I feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Remember, you're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: I run out of the break room, tears streaming down my face. I can hear their laughter echoing behind me. I lock myself in a bathroom stall and just... break down. I feel so alone, so worthless. Why can't I stand up for myself? Why am I such an easy target?",
    "Therapist: Those are painful thoughts. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My SUDS is coming down a bit... maybe a 7? I still feel shaky, but the nausea is subsiding.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing the memory well.",
    "Client: In the bathroom, I'm trying to calm down, but all I can think about is how I have to go back out there and face everyone. I'm dreading it. I feel so trapped, like there's no escape from this daily torment.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I feel a mix of anger and despair. My fists are clenched, and I want to scream. But I also feel this deep sadness, like a heavy weight on my chest. My SUDS is back up to an 8.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. These fluctuations are normal.",
    "Client: (Sighs) I know I should report them, but I'm scared it'll make things worse. I feel so powerless, like I'm stuck in this nightmare with no way out.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My SUDS is down to a 6. I'm feeling drained, but the intense panic is fading.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. Let's start wrapping up.",
    "Client: (Opens eyes) Wow, that was... intense. I'm exhausted, but I also feel like I've released something. My SUDS is down to a 4 now.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How do you feel about today's session?",
    "Client: It was tough, but... I think it helped. I feel a bit lighter, somehow.",
