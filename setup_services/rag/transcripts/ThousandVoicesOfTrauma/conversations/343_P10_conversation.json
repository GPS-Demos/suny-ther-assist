    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, Dr. Thompson. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is dreading it. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start slowly. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in our living room. It's late afternoon, and the sun is streaming through the windows. I can hear the kids playing in the backyard. Carlos is sitting across from me, and his face... it's so serious. I know something's wrong.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: He starts talking, but I can barely focus on his words. My heart is racing. I catch phrases like \"it's not working\" and \"we need to separate.\" I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 70.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I start to argue. I'm pleading with him, telling him we can work it out. But he's so calm, so detached. It's like he's already made up his mind. I feel my world crumbling around me.",
    "Therapist: What's happening in your body right now?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking. I feel nauseous, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's hard to breathe.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here in the office with me. You're safe. Take another deep breath.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Okay... okay. I'm trying to stay calm, but I can feel the panic rising. I start yelling at Carlos, asking him how he can do this to our family. The kids... oh God, the kids are still outside. I hope they can't hear us.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 85.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Let's pause for a moment. Focus on my voice. You're here, you're safe.",
    "Client: *breathing heavily* Okay... I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: Carlos stands up. He's... he's walking towards the door. I jump up and grab his arm, begging him not to leave. He turns, and for a moment, I see pain in his eyes. But then it's gone, replaced by determination. He gently removes my hand and says, \"I'm sorry, Maria. It's over.\"",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel like I'm dying. Like someone's ripped my heart out. I can't breathe, I can't think. I collapse onto the floor, sobbing. I hear the front door close, and I know he's gone.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Maria. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's 95. I can't... I can't do this.",
    "Therapist: You can. You're stronger than you think. Take a deep breath. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: *takes a shaky breath* I'm trying. I... I hear the back door open. The kids are coming in. I can't let them see me like this. I force myself to stand up, wiping my face. But when I see their confused looks, I break down again.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel so ashamed. So helpless. I should be stronger for my kids, but I can't stop crying.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're human. What happens next?",
    "Client: My daughter, Elena, she's only eight. She comes up to me and asks, \"Mama, why are you crying? Where's Papa?\" And I... I don't know what to say. How do you tell your children their father's left?",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly difficult. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I pull them both close. I'm hugging them so tight, probably too tight. I manage to choke out, \"Papa... Papa had to go away for a while.\" And then my son, he's 10, he asks if it's because of something they did. And that... that breaks me all over again.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's still at 90. I can feel it all so vividly.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Maria. Remember, you're here with me. You're safe.",
    "Client: *nods* I... I spend the next few hours just holding my kids. We're all crying. I'm trying to reassure them, but I don't even know what to say. I feel so lost, so betrayed. How could Carlos do this to us?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... maybe if I'd been a better wife. Maybe if I'd worked less, or lost weight, or... I don't know. I feel like I've failed my family. And I'm so angry at Carlos. How could he just walk away like that?",
    "Therapist: Those are natural thoughts, but remember, you're not responsible for Carlos's actions.",
    "Client: I know that... logically. But it doesn't stop the thoughts. As night falls, I realize I have to make dinner. The kids need to eat. But I can barely function. I end up ordering pizza, and we eat in silence. The empty chair at the table... it's like a gaping wound.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Emotionally drained. But there's this underlying panic. What am I going to do? How will I support the kids on my own? What if Carlos wants custody? My mind is racing with all these terrifying possibilities.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Focus on the present moment. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 75. I'm still upset, but I'm starting to feel a bit numb.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: After dinner, I put the kids to bed. They both want to sleep in my room, and I let them. As I lie there in the dark, listening to their breathing, I feel so alone. Even with them right next to me, I've never felt more isolated.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind at this point?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm scared. Scared of the future, scared of being alone. But there's also this tiny spark of... I don't know, defiance maybe? A part of me thinks, \"I'll show him. I'll be okay without him.\" But it's overwhelmed by the fear and sadness.",
    "Therapist: That spark is important. Hold onto it. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. My eyes hurt from crying, my head is pounding. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a tiny bit stronger? Like I've survived the worst day of my life, and I'm still here.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 60. I'm still upset, but I'm starting to feel a bit more in control.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well, Maria. How are you feeling about the exercise?",
    "Client: It was... it was hard. Really hard. But I think... I think it helped. Talking through it, I can see that I survived that day. It didn't break me, even though it felt like it would.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. You're stronger than you realize.",
    "Client: Yeah... I guess I am. It still hurts, but maybe... maybe I can get through this.",
    "Therapist: You absolutely can. We'll work on it together. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm tired, but... okay. Thank you, Dr. Thompson.",
    "Therapist: You did great work today, Maria. Let's end here and discuss how you're feeling."
