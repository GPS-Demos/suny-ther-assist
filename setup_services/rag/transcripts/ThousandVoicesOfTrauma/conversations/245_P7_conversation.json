    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe what you witnessed?",
    "Client: Okay... I was walking home late one night after work. It was dark, and I heard some commotion in an alley. I... I saw a group of men forcing a young woman into a van. She was crying and trying to resist, but they were too strong. I felt frozen, unable to move or help.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you saw and felt.",
    "Client: I... I wanted to scream or call for help, but I was terrified they'd see me. My heart was racing, and I could barely breathe. The woman's eyes met mine for a moment, and I saw such fear and desperation. I felt so guilty and ashamed for not doing anything.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: The van door slammed shut, and they drove away quickly. I just stood there, shaking. I couldn't believe what I'd just witnessed. I kept thinking about that woman, wondering what would happen to her. I felt sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that memory. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: I... I couldn't sleep for days after that. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw her face. I started having nightmares about being taken myself. I became paranoid, always looking over my shoulder when I walked anywhere. I... I still feel so much guilt.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. Keep going.",
    "Client: I reported it to the police, but I don't know if they ever found her. I keep imagining what she must have gone through, what she might still be going through. It's hard not to think about the worst possibilities. I feel like I failed her by not doing more.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage sharing this. Continue.",
    "Client: Sometimes, I find myself scanning crowds, hoping to see her face. I know it's unlikely, but I can't help it. The incident has made me hyper-aware of the darker side of the world. I struggle to trust people now, especially men I don't know well. It's affected my relationships and my ability to feel safe in my own neighborhood.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How do you feel right now?",
    "Client: I feel... overwhelmed. My chest feels tight, and my hands are shaking a bit. Talking about it brings back the fear and helplessness I felt that night. But... I also feel a bit relieved to be sharing this. It's been a burden I've carried alone for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's completely normal. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I've started volunteering at a women's shelter, trying to do something positive. But sometimes, when I'm there, I get flashbacks to that night. I wonder if any of the women I'm helping have gone through similar experiences. It's both motivating and distressing.",
    "Therapist: You're showing remarkable strength. Keep going.",
    "Client: The guilt is the hardest part to shake. I know, logically, that I couldn't have fought off those men myself. But emotionally, I still feel like I should have done more. Called for help, tried to distract them, anything. That moment of eye contact with the woman haunts me. I feel like I let her down.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. You're processing it well.",
    "Client: I've become much more cautious now. I don't go out alone at night anymore. I'm always hyper-vigilant, which is exhausting. I've taken self-defense classes, but I'm not sure if they make me feel safer or just remind me of my vulnerability that night. It's changed how I see the world.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job describing your experience.",
    "Client: Sometimes, I wonder about the men who took her. How could they do something so cruel? Do they have sisters, mothers, daughters? It makes me angry and scared to think there are people capable of such things walking among us. I find myself distrusting strangers more now, always wondering about their true intentions.",
    "Therapist: These are valid feelings. You're handling this bravely.",
    "Client: The experience has made me more aware of human trafficking issues. I've read stories of survivors, and while they give me hope, they also remind me of what I witnessed. I often wonder if I'll ever fully feel safe again or if this constant state of alertness is my new normal. It's exhausting, but I don't know how to let my guard down.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great insight. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but also somewhat relieved. Talking about it is hard, but it also feels like I'm slowly lifting some of the weight off my shoulders. My heart rate has calmed down a bit, though I still feel a knot in my stomach. It's strange, but I feel both vulnerable and stronger at the same time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. You're doing very well.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think... I think I need a moment to breathe. This is the most I've ever talked about that night, and it's bringing up a lot of emotions. But I also feel like I'm starting to process it in a way I haven't before. It's overwhelming, but maybe... maybe it's a step towards healing?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves."
