    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a part of me that wants to get this over with, but another part that's terrified of going back there. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yeah, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in a small, dimly lit room. The air is thick and stuffy. I can hear muffled voices outside. My heart is racing. I'm lying on a cold, metal table. There's... there's medical equipment all around me.",
    "Therapist: Good. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The smell... it's antiseptic, but there's something else. Something... metallic. Blood, maybe? I'm trying not to panic. My wrists and ankles are restrained. I can feel the cold metal against my skin.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's happening now?",
    "Client: The door opens. Two men enter. They're wearing masks and gloves. One of them is holding a clipboard. He's talking, but I can't understand what he's saying. The other one... he's preparing something. A syringe, I think. Oh God...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it, John. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe 9. I can feel my heart pounding in my chest.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... The man with the syringe approaches me. I'm trying to struggle, but the restraints are too tight. I can feel tears running down my face. I'm begging them to stop, but they ignore me. The needle... it pierces my skin. It burns. I feel dizzy...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. Stay in the moment.",
    "Client: Everything's... everything's starting to blur. I can hear them talking, but it sounds far away. I'm fighting to stay conscious. I'm so scared. I don't know what they've given me or why. I... I think I'm going to pass out.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. What's happening now?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure how much time has passed. I'm coming to, but everything's hazy. My mouth is dry. I can taste blood. Did I bite my tongue? There are more people in the room now. They're discussing something. I catch words like \"shipment\" and \"buyer.\" Oh God, I realize what's happening. They're going to sell me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling, John. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 10. I can't... I can't breathe. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Focus on my voice. You're safe here in the office. Breathe slowly.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... okay. I'm... I'm still there, but I'm a bit calmer now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: They're... they're preparing to move me. I can feel hands on my body, undoing the restraints. But I'm too weak to fight back. My limbs feel like lead. They're lifting me onto a stretcher. I'm trying to speak, to cry out, but no sound comes out. We're moving through corridors. It's brighter now. I squint against the light.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: Helpless. Utterly helpless. And... and angry. So angry that this is happening to me. That I can't do anything to stop it.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. Keep going.",
    "Client: We're outside now. The air is cool on my skin. I can hear traffic in the distance. They're loading me into a vehicle. A van, I think. The doors slam shut, and we start moving. I'm lying there, unable to move, unable to call for help. I'm... I'm wondering if I'll ever see my family again. If anyone will even know what happened to me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, John. How's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8 now. My heart is still racing, but I feel... I feel a little more in control.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Take a deep breath and continue.",
    "Client: The van stops. I hear voices outside. They're speaking a language I don't understand. The doors open, and I'm being moved again. We're in some kind of warehouse. It's cold and damp. There are other people here. I can hear crying, muffled screams. They place me on the floor. Someone injects me with something else. The world starts to fade again...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it, John. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I drift in and out of consciousness. Time becomes meaningless. Sometimes I'm aware of people around me, touching me, examining me like I'm not even human. Other times, it's just darkness. I'm... I'm so thirsty. So hungry. My body aches all over.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel broken. Like they've stripped away everything that makes me who I am. But there's also... there's also a tiny spark of hope. A part of me that refuses to give up.",
    "Therapist: Hold onto that spark. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure how much time has passed. Days, maybe? But something's different. There's commotion. Shouting. Gunshots. I force my eyes open. People are running. I see... I see police officers. They're raiding the warehouse. Someone kneels beside me, asks if I'm okay. I try to speak, but I can't. I'm crying. Relief washes over me. I'm... I'm being rescued.",
    "Therapist: You made it through, John. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Exhausted. But also... also a sense of relief. Like I've faced this memory and survived it all over again.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 5, I think. My heart's still beating fast, but I feel more... more in control.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's take a few deep breaths together.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Thank you. I... I never thought I could talk about this in such detail.",
    "Therapist: You've shown tremendous courage. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. Really tired. But there's also this weird sense of... I don't know, accomplishment? Like I've reclaimed something.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after exposure therapy. You've faced a very difficult memory.",
    "Client: Yeah... it's strange. It's still painful, but it feels... less overwhelming now. Like I can look at it without being completely consumed by it.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step forward. Would you like to share any final thoughts?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm starting to understand what you meant about the importance of confronting these memories. It's hard, really hard, but... but I feel like I'm finally starting to process what happened to me. It's not just this dark, formless thing lurking in the back of my mind anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight, John. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm nervous about it, to be honest. But I also feel more... more determined, I guess. Like I can see a path forward now, even if it's going to be difficult.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. We'll take it one step at a time. How about we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think that's a good idea. I'm pretty drained. But... but thank you. For guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You did all the hard work, John. I'm just here to support you. Take care of yourself for the rest of the day, okay?",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll pick this up in our next session. Take care, John."
