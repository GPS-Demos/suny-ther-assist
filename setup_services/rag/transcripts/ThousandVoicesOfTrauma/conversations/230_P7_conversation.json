    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Can you take me through that day when you witnessed the severe illness?",
    "Client: Okay... I remember it was a Tuesday morning. I was at work, and I got a call from my mother. She said my father had collapsed at home and wasn't responding. I rushed to the hospital, my heart pounding the entire way.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: When I arrived at the emergency room, I saw my father on a gurney. He looked so pale and lifeless. The doctors were working frantically around him. I felt frozen, unable to move or speak.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What were you feeling?",
    "Client: I felt... terrified. My hands were shaking, and I could barely breathe. I kept thinking, \"This can't be happening. Not to my father.\" The beeping of the machines was so loud, it was overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: A nurse approached me and asked if I was family. I nodded, unable to speak. She told me my father had suffered a massive heart attack. I remember feeling like the floor was falling away beneath me. I wanted to scream, but no sound came out.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I'm sorry. This is hard to talk about.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. Remember, you're in control.",
    "Client: Okay... I watched as they wheeled my father into the ICU. The waiting room was cold and sterile. I sat there for hours, feeling completely helpless. Every time a doctor walked by, my heart would race, thinking they were coming to tell me he didn't make it.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. How did your body feel during that time?",
    "Client: My stomach was in knots. I felt nauseous and light-headed. I couldn't eat or drink anything. My whole body was tense, like I was bracing for impact.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. Keep going.",
    "Client: After what felt like an eternity, a doctor finally came to speak with us. He said my father had survived but was in critical condition. I felt a mix of relief and intense fear. I couldn't shake the image of my father looking so vulnerable and weak on that hospital bed.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job describing this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. I can feel my heart racing just talking about it. But I also feel a little lighter, like I'm finally letting some of this out.",
    "Therapist: That's a good sign. You're processing it well.",
    "Client: The next few days were a blur of hospital visits, hushed conversations with doctors, and trying to stay strong for my mother. I felt like I was walking on a tightrope, trying not to fall apart.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great strength. Continue.",
    "Client: My father eventually recovered, but those days in the hospital changed something in me. I became hyper-aware of everyone's health, always fearing the worst. It's like I'm constantly waiting for another phone call, another emergency.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. How do you cope with those feelings now?",
    "Client: I try to remind myself that my father is okay now, but it's hard. Sometimes I find myself checking on my family members more than I should, just to make sure they're alright. I know it's not healthy, but I can't seem to shake this fear.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have those feelings. We'll work on managing them.",
    "Client: Thank you. It helps to talk about this, even though it's difficult. I've kept these feelings bottled up for so long, afraid that if I spoke about them, it would somehow make it all happen again.",
    "Therapist: You're making great progress. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel drained, but also a bit relieved. It's like I've been carrying this heavy weight, and now I'm starting to put it down. I know I have a long way to go, but this feels like a start.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent observation. You've done well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It's still painful, but I feel like I can breathe a little easier now.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. We'll end here for today."
