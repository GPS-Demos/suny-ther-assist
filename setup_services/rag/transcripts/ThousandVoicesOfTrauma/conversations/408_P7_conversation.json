    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the scene?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm at home, in the living room. It's late evening, and I can hear the TV in the background. My boyfriend, he's... he's been drinking again. I can smell the alcohol on his breath as he comes closer. My heart is starting to race...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: He's yelling at me, saying I'm useless, that I can't do anything right. I'm trying to stay calm, but I'm shaking. I want to run, but I'm frozen in place. His face is so close to mine, and I'm afraid he's going to hit me like last time.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I can't... it's too much. I feel so small, so helpless. My chest is tight, and I can barely breathe. I'm looking around for something, anything to protect myself with, but there's nothing. I hate feeling this way, so weak and pathetic.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're brave for facing this.",
    "Client: He grabs my arm, and it hurts. I can feel his fingers digging into my skin. I'm trying to pull away, but he's so much stronger. I'm crying now, begging him to let go. I keep thinking about my mom, how she always told me to be strong, but I don't feel strong at all right now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I manage to break free and run to the bedroom, locking the door behind me. I can hear him pounding on the door, screaming that he'll break it down. I'm huddled in the corner, my whole body shaking. I'm reaching for my phone, trying to call for help, but my hands are trembling so much I can barely hold it.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Remember, you're safe now.",
    "Client: I finally manage to call my sister. I'm whispering, begging her to come help me. The banging on the door is getting louder, and I'm terrified it's going to break. I feel so alone, so scared. I keep thinking about how I ended up here, how I let this happen to me. I miss my mom so much in this moment. She would know what to do.",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. You're strong for sharing this.",
    "Client: I hear sirens in the distance, and the banging stops. There's a moment of silence, and then I hear him cursing and stumbling away. I'm still frozen, afraid to move or make a sound. I don't know if I should feel relieved or more scared about what will happen when the police leave. I feel so trapped, not just in this room, but in this whole situation.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. My heart is still racing, and I feel a bit nauseous. But also... I don't know, maybe a little proud? I've never been able to talk about this in so much detail before. It's hard, but I think it's helping. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Your courage is commendable.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's strange, but reliving it like this, I can see how strong I actually was in that moment. I protected myself, I called for help. I didn't just give up. I still feel the fear and the helplessness, but there's also this new perspective. I just wish... I wish I could have done more to prevent it from happening in the first place.",
    "Therapist: You did the best you could. Let's take a deep breath together.",
    "Client: Okay... *inhales deeply* That helps a bit. I feel like I'm coming back to the present now. It's still vivid in my mind, but I know I'm here, in this room with you, and I'm safe. It's over. I survived it. I'm just... I'm tired now. Really, really tired.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've done excellent work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It still hurts, and it's scary, but I feel like maybe... maybe I can face it. Maybe I can work through this and come out stronger on the other side. Is that possible?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're already showing great strength.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I think I need a moment to just sit with all of this. It's a lot to process. But I'm glad I did it. I'm glad I'm here, working on this. For the first time in a long time, I feel like there might be hope for me to move past this and have a better life.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Well done today."
