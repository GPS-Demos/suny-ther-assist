    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Patel?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. Reliving that airplane crash was intense. My heart is still racing a bit, and I feel a bit dizzy. It's like I was right back there, you know? The screams, the shaking, the smell of smoke... it all came flooding back.",
    "Therapist: That sounds overwhelming. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The moment of impact. I keep replaying it in my mind. The sudden jolt, the sickening crunch of metal... and then the silence right after. It was so eerie, like time stood still for a second before chaos erupted. I remember thinking, \"This is it. I'm going to die.\" That feeling of utter helplessness... it's haunting.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... difficult. Scary. But also... I don't know, maybe a little empowering? I mean, I survived it once, and I survived reliving it just now. I'm still here, still breathing. It's like... maybe I'm stronger than I thought?",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. How does this relate to your daily life?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... maybe I've been underestimating myself? I've been so afraid of everything since the crash. Afraid to fly, obviously, but also just... afraid to live, you know? But if I could survive that, and survive reliving it... maybe I can handle more than I've been giving myself credit for.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How might you apply this?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe I could start small? Like, perhaps I could finally accept my sister's invitation to visit her. It's only a two-hour drive away, but I've been too scared to travel. But now, I'm thinking... maybe I could do it?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great step. How do you feel about that idea?",
    "Client: Nervous, definitely. But also... a little excited? It's been so long since I've felt excited about anything. I miss my sister, and I miss feeling like I could just... go places, you know? Maybe this is a chance to start reclaiming some of that freedom.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. What else did you notice during the exposure?",
    "Client: I realized that... well, my anxiety isn't just about the crash itself. It's about feeling out of control. During the imaginal, I noticed how much I focused on the helplessness, the lack of control. And that's how I've felt ever since - like at any moment, something terrible could happen and I'd be powerless to stop it.",
    "Therapist: How does recognizing that impact you?",
    "Client: It's... oddly comforting, in a way? Because maybe if the problem is feeling out of control, rather than the specific fear of flying or traveling, that's something I can work on. I can't guarantee another accident won't happen, but I can work on how I handle uncertainty. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How might you start working on that?",
    "Client: Um, maybe... mindfulness? I've heard it can help with staying present and managing anxiety. And perhaps... talking to my doctor about my anxiety medication? I've been resistant to changing it, but maybe it's time to reconsider.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like thoughtful approaches. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, definitely. But also... hopeful? Like maybe there's a light at the end of this very long, dark tunnel. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can get there.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful progress. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to dive deeper into this control issue. Maybe explore some concrete strategies for managing those feelings of helplessness? And... I think I'm ready to start seriously planning that visit to my sister. It's scary, but... I think I'm ready to take that step.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. We'll work on that together. How do you feel about today's session?",
    "Client: It was tough, really tough. But... I'm glad we did it. I feel like I understand myself a bit better now. And... thank you. For guiding me through this. I know I'm not the easiest patient, with all my fears and resistance. But I appreciate your patience and support.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work, Mrs. Patel. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, definitely. Thank you again. I'll... I'll try to practice some mindfulness before our next session. Baby steps, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Take care, Mrs. Patel."
