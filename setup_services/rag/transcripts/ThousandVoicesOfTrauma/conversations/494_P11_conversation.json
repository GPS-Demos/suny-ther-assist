    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. Going through that memory of being diagnosed with cancer... it's like I'm right back there in that moment, you know? I can still feel the weight of it all, the fear, the uncertainty. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The silence. After the doctor told me, there was this... deafening silence. It felt like the world had stopped. I remember thinking, \"This can't be happening to me.\" My heart was racing, and I felt so... alone. Even though the doctor was right there, I felt completely isolated.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to share that now?",
    "Client: It's... strange. Part of me feels vulnerable, like I'm exposing a raw wound. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe relief? Like I'm finally letting it out instead of keeping it bottled up inside.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts came up during the exposure?",
    "Client: I kept thinking about how unfair it all was. I was angry at my body for betraying me, scared about what would happen to my career, my relationships. And then there was this voice in my head saying, \"You're not strong enough to handle this.\" It's the same voice that tells me I can't handle things now, even though the cancer's gone.",
    "Therapist: How do those thoughts connect to your current experiences?",
    "Client: I... I guess I still struggle with feeling vulnerable. Anytime something challenging comes up at work or in my personal life, that same fear creeps in. It's like I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop, you know? Like I can't trust that things will be okay.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What did you learn about yourself today?",
    "Client: I... I realized that I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. Going through that memory was tough, but I did it. And I survived the actual experience too. Maybe... maybe I am capable of handling more than I think.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How might you use this moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I need to start challenging that negative voice more. When it tells me I can't handle something, I can remind myself of what I've already overcome. It's not easy, but... I want to try.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How are you feeling about continuing with the exposures?",
    "Client: It's scary, honestly. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a bit hopeful? Like maybe this can actually help me move past some of this stuff. I want to keep going, even if it's hard.",
    "Therapist: That's great. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... maybe we could explore the day I started treatment? That's another memory that still haunts me a bit. Is that... is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll work on that next session. How will you take care of yourself today?",
    "Client: I think I'll go for a walk in the park near my place. Being in nature always helps me feel a bit more grounded. And maybe I'll call my sister... I've been avoiding talking about this stuff with her, but I think I'm ready to open up a bit.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a good plan. Any final thoughts?",
