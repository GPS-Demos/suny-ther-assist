    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, John?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. That memory... it's so vivid, you know? I can still hear the sound of the gunshot, smell the fear in the air. It's like I was right back there in that convenience store.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. Being tied up, not knowing if I'd make it out alive. I keep replaying the moment when the robber pointed his gun at the cashier's head. I thought... I thought he was going to kill her right in front of me.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. Scary, but also... I don't know, maybe a little empowering? Like, I survived it once, and I survived telling it again. But man, my anxiety was through the roof. My palms are still sweaty.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does this connect to your day-to-day experiences?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... I'm always on edge, you know? Always looking over my shoulder, expecting the worst. It's exhausting. And crowds? Forget about it. I can't handle feeling trapped like that again.",
    "Therapist: Understandable. What insights did you gain from today's session?",
    "Client: I... I realized that maybe I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. I mean, I lived through that nightmare, and here I am, talking about it. That's something, right? But it's also made me see how much this fear controls my life. I want to feel normal again, doc. I want to go to a store without having a panic attack.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization, John. How might you use this moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I need to start challenging myself more? Like, maybe I could try going to a small shop for a few minutes, see how I handle it. Baby steps, you know? And maybe... maybe I need to be kinder to myself when I do feel scared. It's not weakness, it's... it's just my brain trying to protect me.",
    "Therapist: Excellent insights. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's tough, I won't lie. But I think it's helping. I mean, a month ago, I couldn't even talk about what happened without completely shutting down. Now, it's still hard, but... I can do it. I want to keep going. I want my life back.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. What's one thing you'll take away from today?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's that I'm not alone in this. Talking it through with you, it helps me see that what I'm feeling is normal for what I've been through. And that maybe, just maybe, I can get through this. It won't be easy, but... I'm willing to try.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful takeaway, John. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: I... I don't think so. I'm pretty drained, to be honest. But in a good way, if that makes sense? Like I've done something important, even if it was really hard. I just hope I can keep this momentum going, you know?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How will you take care of yourself for the rest of the day?",
    "Client: I think I'll go for a walk in the park. Being in nature always helps calm me down. And maybe I'll call my sister. She's been really supportive through all of this. Just hearing her voice helps, you know?",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a good plan. Any final thoughts before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I guess. For listening, for guiding me through this. It means a lot. I know I've got a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe there's hope. That's... that's huge for me.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, John. I'll see you next week?",
    "Client: Yeah, definitely. See you then, doc."
