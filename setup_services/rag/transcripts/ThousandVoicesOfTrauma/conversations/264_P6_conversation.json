    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Can you describe the animal attack you witnessed?",
    "Client: Okay... I was at the beach with my friends. It was a beautiful day, the sun was shining, and we were all laughing and having a good time. Suddenly, I heard screaming coming from the water. I looked up and saw a large shark fin circling a swimmer. My heart started racing immediately.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10. I'm feeling a bit anxious just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Understood. Please continue.",
    "Client: The shark attacked the swimmer, and there was blood everywhere. People were panicking, running out of the water. I felt frozen in place, unable to move or look away. The lifeguards were trying to reach the person, but it all happened so fast. I remember feeling helpless and terrified.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. My palms are starting to sweat, and I can feel my heart beating faster.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The water turned red, and I could hear the victim's screams. It was horrifying. I wanted to help, but I couldn't move. I just stood there, watching this person fight for their life. The shark kept coming back, again and again. I've never felt so powerless in my life.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. I feel like I'm back there. My chest feels tight, and I'm having trouble breathing.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What happened next?",
    "Client: The lifeguards finally reached the victim and brought them to shore. There was so much blood... I remember the sound of sirens as the ambulance arrived. Everyone was in shock. I couldn't stop shaking. I kept thinking, \"What if that had been me or one of my friends?\"",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's still an 8. I can't shake this feeling of dread. My stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: After the ambulance left, we all just stood there in silence. The beach was empty now. I remember the eerie calm that settled over everything. The waves kept rolling in like nothing had happened, but everything had changed. I couldn't stop replaying the attack in my mind.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's coming down a bit... maybe a 7 now. I still feel shaky, but the tightness in my chest is easing.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're processing this well. Continue.",
    "Client: In the days that followed, I couldn't sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the shark and the blood. I was afraid to go near the water. I felt guilty for not doing anything to help, even though logically I know there was nothing I could have done.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS now?",

    "Therapist: That's a normal response. Keep going.",
    "Client: I started having nightmares about sharks. Even now, years later, I get anxious when I see the ocean. I used to love swimming, but now I can't bring myself to go in past my knees. I feel like that day took something from me that I can't get back.",
    "Therapist: And your current SUDS?",
    "Client: It's a 4 now. I feel drained, but also a bit relieved to be talking about it.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted, but I think this helped. It's like... I've been carrying this weight for so long, and now I've set some of it down. I didn't realize how much it was affecting me until I talked through it all.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's end here for today."
