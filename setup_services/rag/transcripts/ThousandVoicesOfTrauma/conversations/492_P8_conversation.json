    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mrs. Farsi?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart is still racing, and I feel a tightness in my chest. The memory of that day, when my ex-husband told me he was leaving... it's so vivid now. I can almost smell the coffee I was brewing when he broke the news.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep hearing his words, \"I don't love you anymore.\" They're echoing in my head. And I'm thinking... was I not good enough? After 40 years of marriage, how could he just... leave? I feel so foolish, like I wasted my whole life on someone who didn't truly care about me.",
    "Therapist: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of pain and self-doubt.",
    "Client: Yes, exactly. And there's this... this anger bubbling up inside me. I dedicated my life to our family, to him. I left my home country, my family, everything I knew, to build a life with him here. And now, at 77, I'm alone. It's not fair. I... I don't know how to start over at this age.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a fire in my stomach. My hands are shaking, and I want to scream. But at the same time, I feel so helpless. Like a child again, lost and confused. It reminds me of when I was little, and my parents would argue. I'd feel so scared and powerless then, too.",
    "Therapist: You're drawing a connection between past and present experiences.",
    "Client: Yes, I suppose I am. I never realized that before. Both times, my world was turned upside down, and I felt abandoned. But this time... this time it's worse. Because I thought I had finally found stability, you know? I thought I was safe.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing about your reactions?",
    "Client: I... I'm surprised by how vivid the memory is. I can see every detail of our kitchen, the way the sunlight was streaming through the window. I remember thinking how beautiful the day was, and how it contrasted with the ugliness of what was happening. And there's this... this deep sadness. Like a heavy weight on my chest. I feel... I feel like I'm grieving not just for my marriage, but for the life I thought I had.",
    "Therapist: That's a profound observation. How does it feel to share these thoughts?",
    "Client: It's... it's both terrifying and relieving. I've kept so much of this bottled up inside. My children, they try to understand, but they're caught in the middle. And my friends... well, at my age, many of them are dealing with losing spouses to illness. They don't quite understand what it's like to be... to be discarded like this.",
    "Therapist: You're showing a lot of courage in facing these memories.",
    "Client: Thank you. It doesn't feel like courage, though. It feels like... like I'm being torn apart. But I suppose that's part of healing, isn't it? I just... I just want to feel whole again. To feel like I have value outside of being someone's wife. But it's so hard when this has been my identity for so long.",
    "Therapist: What do you think that process might look like for you?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to retreat, to hide away from the world. But another part... another part wants to prove him wrong. To show that I can thrive without him. Maybe... maybe I could volunteer, or take some classes at the community center. I've always loved art, but I gave it up when we had children. Perhaps it's time to pick up a paintbrush again.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive direction. How does thinking about that make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a glimmer of hope, I suppose. A tiny light in all this darkness. But it's also scary. What if I'm not good at anything anymore? What if I'm too old to learn new things? And yet... and yet there's a part of me that's excited. Like maybe, just maybe, this could be a new chapter instead of the end of my story.",
    "Therapist: You're showing resilience in considering new possibilities.",
    "Client: I never thought of myself as resilient before. I've always been the one who needed protection, who relied on others. But maybe... maybe I'm stronger than I thought. It's just... it's hard to hold onto that feeling when the pain and fear come rushing back.",
    "Therapist: Can you describe how those feelings of pain and fear manifest?",
    "Client: It's like... like waves crashing over me. One moment I feel like I can breathe, like maybe I'll be okay. And the next, I'm drowning in sorrow and panic. My chest tightens, my throat closes up, and I feel this overwhelming urge to curl up in a ball and disappear. Sometimes, I wake up in the middle of the night, reaching for him, and the realization that he's gone hits me all over again.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with those moments?",
    "Client: I... I try to breathe deeply, like you've taught me. Sometimes I call my daughter, even if it's late. She always answers. And I've started keeping a journal by my bed. Writing down my thoughts helps sometimes, even if they're messy and confused. But other times... other times I just cry until I'm exhausted and fall back asleep.",
    "Therapist: You're developing some helpful strategies. What else have you noticed?",
    "Client: I've noticed that... that the pain isn't constant. There are moments, brief ones, where I feel almost... almost okay. Like when I'm watering my plants or cooking a meal I enjoy. It's not happiness, not yet, but it's... it's a break from the sadness. And I'm starting to treasure those moments, to look forward to them.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant observation. How does recognizing those moments impact you?",
    "Client: It gives me... hope, I suppose. Hope that maybe, someday, those moments will grow longer and more frequent. That maybe I won't always feel this broken. But it also makes me sad, in a way. Because I realize how much of my life I've spent defining myself through my marriage, through him. And now I have to learn who I am without all that.",
    "Therapist: You're on a journey of self-discovery. How does that feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's terrifying and exhilarating at the same time. Like standing on the edge of a cliff, not knowing if I'll fall or fly. Part of me wishes I could go back to the life I knew, even if it wasn't perfect. But another part... another part is curious about who I might become. Maybe... maybe there's still time for me to be the person I dreamed of being when I was young, before I got married and life took over.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... I'm feeling a mix of emotions. There's still so much pain and anger, but there's also this tiny spark of excitement. Like maybe, just maybe, this isn't the end. Maybe it's a new beginning. But it's all so overwhelming. How do I even begin to rebuild my life at my age?",
    "Therapist: One step at a time. What might a first step look like?",
    "Client: I... I suppose it could be something small. Maybe I could sign up for that art class at the community center. Or... or maybe I could reach out to some old friends I've lost touch with over the years. It's scary to think about putting myself out there, but... but I think I need to. I can't keep hiding in my house, drowning in memories.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive approach. How do you feel about ending our session here?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm ready. This was hard, reliving those memories, but... but I feel like I've gained some clarity. Thank you for listening, for helping me see that maybe there's still hope for me. I know the path ahead won't be easy, but... but I think I'm ready to take those first steps.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great courage today. I look forward to our next session."
