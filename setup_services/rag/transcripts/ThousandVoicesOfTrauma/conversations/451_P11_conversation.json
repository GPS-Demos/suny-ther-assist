    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Priya?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Going through that memory of being bullied in high school... it brought up a lot of emotions I thought I'd buried.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The feeling of helplessness, I think. I remembered how those girls cornered me in the bathroom, taunting me about my accent and my clothes. I felt so small, so... powerless. It's like I was right back there, you know?",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How did your body react during the memory?",
    "Client: My heart was racing, and I felt this tightness in my chest. My palms got all sweaty too. It's funny, I haven't thought about that day in years, but my body remembered every detail.",
    "Therapist: That's common. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: A bit shaky, but... also relieved? It's like... I've been carrying this weight for so long, and now I've finally set it down. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Can you tell me more about that relief?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... for years, I've tried to forget about the bullying. I thought if I ignored it, it would go away. But going through it again, facing it head-on... it's scary, but it's also empowering. I survived it once, and I can face it again.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How might this relate to your current struggles?",
    "Client: I... I never thought about it before, but I think it's connected to my depression. Always feeling like I'm not good enough, always worried about what others think of me. It's like I'm still that scared girl in the bathroom, even though I'm an adult now.",
    "Therapist: I see. What do you think about that connection?",
    "Client: It's... eye-opening. And a little sad, honestly. I've let those bullies control my life for so long, even when they're not around anymore. But it also gives me hope. If I can recognize it, maybe I can change it, right?",
    "Therapist: That's a great insight. How might you apply this moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I need to be kinder to myself. To remember that I'm not that helpless girl anymore. And maybe... maybe I need to start standing up for myself more, both to others and to that critical voice in my head.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like valuable goals. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's scary, but... I want to keep going. I want to be free from this. And for the first time in a long time, I feel like that might actually be possible.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to explore more about how this bullying has affected my relationships. Especially with my boyfriend. I've always had trouble trusting people, and now I'm wondering if it's connected to all of this.",
    "Therapist: That's a great topic. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For helping me through this. I know we were focusing on the bullying today, but I can't help thinking about the human trafficking topic we touched on last time. It's all connected, isn't it? The feeling of being powerless, of being at someone else's mercy...",
    "Therapist: You're making important connections. How does that realization feel?",
    "Client: It's... heavy. But also clarifying, in a way. Like pieces of a puzzle falling into place. I'm starting to see how all these experiences have shaped me, for better or worse.",
    "Therapist: That's insightful. We'll explore this more next time. How will you take care of yourself this week?",
    "Client: I think I'll try some of those grounding exercises we talked about. And maybe... maybe I'll try journaling about some of these realizations. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great plan. Remember, be gentle with yourself. We'll continue next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I'm actually looking forward to it. Which is not something I thought I'd ever say about therapy.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful to hear. Take care, Priya. I'll see you next week."
