    "Therapist: Welcome, John. Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Are you ready to revisit the car accident?",
    "Client: I think so, Dr. Thompson. I'm a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm driving home from work, it's around 6 PM. The traffic is heavy, but moving steadily. I'm thinking about dinner plans with my wife. Suddenly, I hear screeching tires and see a car swerving in my rearview mirror. My heart starts racing...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The car behind me loses control and slams into the vehicle next to it. There's a loud crash, and I see metal flying everywhere. I quickly pull over to the side of the road, my hands shaking on the steering wheel. I can't believe what I'm seeing...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I see smoke rising from the crashed cars. People are screaming, and I hear car horns blaring. The smell of burning rubber fills the air. I feel frozen, unable to move or help. My chest feels tight, and I'm struggling to breathe...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I force myself to get out of the car, but my legs feel weak. As I approach the scene, I see a woman trapped in one of the cars. She's crying out for help, and there's blood on her face. I want to do something, but I feel so helpless...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: I hear sirens in the distance, getting closer. Other people are gathering around, some trying to help, others just staring in shock. I finally snap out of my daze and call 911, even though I'm sure others have already done so. My voice is shaking as I describe the scene to the operator...",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: The paramedics arrive and start working on freeing the trapped woman. I watch them, feeling a mix of relief and guilt. Why couldn't I do more? Why was I so paralyzed? As they load her into the ambulance, I catch a glimpse of her face. She looks so pale and scared. I can't shake the feeling that I should have done something sooner...",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. You're doing well.",
    "Client: After the ambulance leaves, a police officer approaches me for a statement. I try to describe what happened, but my words feel jumbled. I keep replaying the crash in my mind, wondering if I could have somehow prevented it. The officer thanks me and moves on, but I feel like I've failed somehow...",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're not responsible for the accident.",
    "Client: I know that logically, but it's hard to shake this feeling. As I finally get back in my car to leave, my hands are still trembling. The drive home is a blur. I keep checking my rearview mirror, flinching at every sudden movement on the road. When I get home, I break down and tell my wife what happened. She holds me, but I feel so disconnected, like I'm still back there at the accident scene...",
    "Therapist: You've done an excellent job describing the experience.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Thompson. It's still so vivid in my mind. Even now, talking about it, I can feel my heart racing and my palms getting sweaty. I've been having nightmares about it, seeing that woman's face, hearing the crash over and over again. Sometimes, when I'm driving, I get these sudden flashes of panic, thinking it's going to happen again...",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: I hope so. It's affecting my work too. I've been having trouble concentrating, always feeling on edge. My wife is worried about me. I know I need to move past this, but it feels like I'm stuck in that moment, you know? Like a part of me is still standing on that roadside, watching helplessly...",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. We'll address them step by step.",
    "Client: I appreciate that, Dr. Thompson. It helps to talk about it, even though it's difficult. I've been avoiding driving as much as possible, taking longer routes to avoid that stretch of road. I know it's not rational, but I can't help it. I keep wondering about that woman, if she's okay, if there was more I could have done...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have these thoughts. We'll work on processing them.",
    "Client: Thank you. I want to get better, to stop feeling so anxious and guilty all the time. It's exhausting, always being on guard, always replaying that scene in my head. I miss feeling normal, you know? Just being able to drive without my heart racing, or sleep without nightmares. I hope that by talking about it like this, I can start to move forward...",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. Let's continue next session.",
    "Client: Okay, Dr. Thompson. I'm feeling drained, but also a bit relieved. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know it's not easy, but I'm committed to working through it. I just want to feel like myself again, to be present for my family without this cloud hanging over me. I'm grateful for your help and patience.",
    "Therapist: You've done well today, John. We'll pick up here next time."
