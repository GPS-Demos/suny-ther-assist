    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm honestly quite nervous, Dr. Chen. I've been dreading this all week. The idea of reliving those experiences... it's making my stomach churn. I'm not sure I can handle it.",
    "Therapist: Your anxiety is understandable. This process is challenging but vital for healing.",
    "Client: I appreciate that, but... I've worked so hard to push those memories away. Won't bringing them back just make everything worse? I mean, I'm finally at a point where I can function day-to-day without constantly thinking about the bullying. What if this undoes all of that progress?",
    "Therapist: Facing memories can be difficult, but it often leads to long-term relief. Shall we discuss the process?",
    "Client: I guess so. But can you explain why we need to do this? I'm really struggling to see how reopening old wounds could possibly help.",
    "Therapist: Imaginal exposure helps process traumatic memories, reducing their emotional impact over time. It's like exercising a muscle.",
    "Client: That makes some sense, I suppose. But I'm worried about how I'll react. What if I completely fall apart? Or what if I can't remember enough details? I've spent so long trying to forget.",
    "Therapist: Your reactions are normal. We'll go at your pace, and I'll support you throughout. Remember, you're in control.",
    "Client: Okay... I think I understand. But what exactly will we be doing? Can you walk me through it step by step? I need to know what to expect.",
    "Therapist: We'll start slowly. You'll describe a memory, focusing on sensory details. I'll guide you with questions.",
    "Client: Alright. And what about afterwards? I'm worried about leaving here and feeling completely overwhelmed. How will I cope with that?",
    "Therapist: We'll end each session with relaxation techniques. I'll also teach you coping strategies for between sessions.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I guess I'm just scared of feeling vulnerable. As a professional, I'm used to being in control. And as a minority, I've always felt like I needed to be strong. This feels like the opposite of that.",
    "Therapist: Your strength is evident in facing this challenge. Vulnerability can lead to growth and healing.",
    "Client: Thank you for saying that. It means a lot. I suppose I'm ready to try, even though I'm terrified. Can you tell me again how this will help with my PTSD symptoms?",
    "Therapist: Exposure helps desensitize traumatic memories, reducing anxiety and avoidance behaviors over time. Your courage is commendable.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I'm still nervous, but I trust you, Dr. Chen. I know you wouldn't suggest this if you didn't think it would help. I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Where do we start?",
    "Therapist: Let's begin with a recent, less distressing memory. Remember, you're in control. Ready?",
    "Client: Okay, I think I can do that. A less distressing memory... alright. Yes, I'm ready. Let's do this before I change my mind."
