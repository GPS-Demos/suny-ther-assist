    "Therapist: Welcome back. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm feeling a bit jittery, to be honest. My hands are a little shaky.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to work through this together. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 6 right now. Just thinking about revisiting that day makes my heart race a bit.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Take a deep breath. When you're ready, close your eyes and begin describing the hostage situation.",
    "Client: Okay... *deep breath* I'm there. It's a hot day in Kabul. The sun is beating down, and I can feel sweat trickling down my back. We're on a routine patrol, my unit and I. Everything seems normal, but there's this... tension in the air. You know that feeling when something's off, but you can't put your finger on it?",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: We turn a corner, and suddenly... chaos erupts. Gunfire everywhere. I can smell the acrid scent of gunpowder. My training kicks in, and I'm diving for cover behind a low wall. But it's not enough. They're everywhere.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe an 8? My heart is pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... I'm continuing. I see my squadmate, Alex, get hit. He goes down hard. I'm yelling for a medic, but it's so loud. The next thing I know, rough hands are grabbing me. I'm fighting, kicking, but there are too many of them. They're dragging me away from my unit. I can hear my CO shouting, but his voice is getting fainter...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: Terror. Pure, ice-cold terror. I can't breathe. They're blindfolding me, tying my hands. The fabric is rough against my face. I can smell their sweat, hear their harsh voices speaking in Pashto. I don't understand everything, but I catch enough to know I'm in deep trouble.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here, safe in my office. What's happening now?",
    "Client: They're shoving me into a vehicle. It's hot, stuffy. I can feel others pressed against me \u2013 I think some of my unit got captured too. We're driving for what feels like hours. Every bump, every turn, I think this is it. This is where they'll kill us.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. Maybe higher. I feel like I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe with me. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: *breathing slowly* Okay... We finally stop. They're pulling us out of the vehicle. I can hear muffled voices, doors slamming. They march us somewhere \u2013 down stairs, I think. It's cooler here. Damp. They push me into a small space and rip off the blindfold. It's a cell. Bare concrete, a small window high up. Alex is here too, but he's not moving. There's so much blood...",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. This is just a memory. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My hands won't stop trembling. But I want to keep going. I need to get through this.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Days blur together. They come for me regularly. Interrogations. I can still feel the sting of their slaps, the ache in my ribs from their kicks. They keep asking about troop movements, supply lines. I tell them nothing. Just name, rank, and serial number. Over and over.",
    "Therapist: How are you coping in this situation?",
    "Client: I... I retreat into my mind. I think about home, about my partner. I recite poems in my head, anything to stay sane. But it's hard. The fear is constant. Every time I hear footsteps, my stomach clenches. Will this be the time they decide I'm not worth keeping alive?",
    "Therapist: You're demonstrating remarkable resilience. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's hovering around 8. My palms are sweaty, and I feel a bit nauseous.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to breathe. You're doing well.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... One day \u2013 I don't know how long it's been \u2013 there's a commotion outside. Gunfire, shouts. My heart's in my throat. This could be rescue, or it could be the end. The door bursts open, and I see... I see American uniforms. I'm crying, I can't help it. They're helping me up, but my legs are so weak. As they carry me out, I see bodies on the ground. Some are my captors, but others... others are my fellow soldiers who didn't make it.",
    "Therapist: You're almost through. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm overwhelmed. Relieved, but also devastated. The sunlight hurts my eyes as we exit the building. I'm on a stretcher now, being loaded into a helicopter. The roar of the blades is deafening, but it's the most beautiful sound I've ever heard. As we lift off, I finally let myself believe it's over. But part of me... part of me is still in that cell.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Take some deep breaths.",
    "Client: *breathing deeply* I... I made it through. I can't believe I actually talked about all of that.",
    "Therapist: You showed immense courage. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. Emotionally and physically. But also... maybe a little lighter? Like I've set down a heavy burden, even if just for a moment.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after these sessions. What's your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's come down to about a 5 now. I'm still shaky, but I feel more... present.",
    "Therapist: You've made significant progress today. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves before we end the session.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I needed this more than I realized.",
