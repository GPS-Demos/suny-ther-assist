    "Therapist: Welcome back. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm... nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this all week. The idea of revisiting those experiences with the cult... it's terrifying. I've worked so hard to push those memories away.",
    "Therapist: Your apprehension is understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: It's just... I'm worried about losing control. What if I can't handle it? What if I have a breakdown right here in your office? And then there's the fear that reliving it might somehow pull me back into that mindset. I've come so far since leaving the cult, and I don't want to risk undoing all that progress.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How can I support you today?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. Maybe... can you explain why we need to do this? I mean, I understand it intellectually, but emotionally, I'm struggling to see how this could be helpful.",
    "Therapist: Certainly. Imaginal exposure helps process trauma memories. It can reduce their power over you. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: I guess... what exactly will happen? Will I need to close my eyes? Will you be guiding me through it, or am I supposed to just... talk? And how long will this last? Sorry, I know that's a lot of questions.",
    "Therapist: No need to apologize. You'll describe the memory while I listen. We'll start with 20 minutes. Eyes open or closed - your choice.",
    "Client: Okay, that doesn't sound as overwhelming as I imagined. Twenty minutes... I can do that. I think I'd prefer to keep my eyes open, if that's alright. It might help me feel more grounded in the present.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Your comfort is important. What else can I clarify?",
    "Client: I'm wondering about what happens after the 20 minutes. Will we discuss it? And... is it normal to feel physically affected by this? I'm already noticing my heart rate increasing just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Yes, we'll process it afterwards. Physical reactions are normal. We'll manage them together. You're very brave for doing this.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot. I've been feeling so alone in this, you know? It's not exactly something I can discuss with friends or family. They try to understand, but unless you've been through something like this... it's hard to explain.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. This process can be intense. How else can I support you?",
    "Client: I think... maybe just knowing that you're here and that I can stop if it becomes too much? And perhaps a reminder that I'm safe now, that this is just a memory we're working through?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're in control. We can pause anytime. You're safe here. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes. I'm nervous, but... I'm ready. Let's do this. I want to take back control of my life, and if this is a step towards that, then I'm willing to try.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Let's start. Remember, you're safe. Begin when you're ready."
