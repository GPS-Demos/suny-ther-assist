    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. I can still see the dog's teeth, you know? It's weird because I know I'm safe here, but my heart is pounding like I'm back there again.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What physical sensations are you noticing?",
    "Client: My hands are sweaty, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's hard to breathe normally. I keep wanting to look over my shoulder, like I'm expecting something to jump out at me. It's ridiculous, I know, but I can't help it.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. Like, I couldn't do anything to stop it. And then I start wondering... what if it happens again? What if next time it's worse? I know it's not logical, but I can't shake this feeling that I'm not safe anywhere.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does this connect to your past experiences?",
    "Client: I guess... it reminds me of how I felt growing up. My dad would always criticize everything I did, and I never knew when he'd explode. This constant fear, always being on edge... it's similar. I couldn't control my dad's outbursts, just like I couldn't control that dog.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful connection. What else comes up for you?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much this has affected my life. I avoid parks now, I get nervous around dogs... it's like I'm always preparing for the worst. And it's not just about animals. I think it's made me more hesitant in general, like I'm always waiting for something bad to happen.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that realization?",
    "Client: It's... frustrating. And sad. I don't want to live like this, always afraid. But at the same time, there's a part of me that thinks being cautious keeps me safe. It's confusing.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What do you think about your ability to cope?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Sometimes I feel like I'm handling it okay, but then something small happens and I'm right back to feeling overwhelmed. Like today, doing this exercise... I thought I was ready, but it hit me harder than I expected.",
    "Therapist: Mm. How does that make you feel about your progress?",
    "Client: It's discouraging, to be honest. I want to be over this already. But then I think about where I was a few months ago, and I know I've made some progress. It's just... it feels so slow sometimes.",
    "Therapist: I hear that. What's giving you hope in this process?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... the fact that I can talk about it now without completely falling apart is something. And I've started going on walks again, even if it's just around the block. It's not much, but it's a start, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What else have you noticed changing?",
    "Client: I've been more open with my girlfriend about what I'm going through. She's been really supportive, and that helps. And I'm starting to recognize when I'm having a reaction to something, instead of just feeling overwhelmed and not knowing why.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. How does sharing with your girlfriend feel?",
    "Client: It's... scary, but also kind of freeing? Like, I don't have to pretend everything's okay all the time. And she doesn't judge me or think I'm weak, which is what I was afraid of.",
    "Therapist: I see. What does that tell you about yourself?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe I'm stronger than I thought? Or at least, I'm trying to be. It's hard to admit I need help, but I'm doing it. And maybe that's a kind of strength too.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How does it feel to acknowledge that?",
    "Client: It's... weird. Good, I think, but also a little uncomfortable. I'm not used to thinking of myself as strong. But yeah, it feels good to recognize that I'm making an effort, even when it's hard.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What do you want to take away from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... maybe that it's okay to struggle sometimes. That doesn't mean I'm not making progress. And that facing these memories, even though it's scary, is helping me understand myself better. It's not easy, but I'm doing it.",
    "Therapist: That's a great takeaway. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... tired, but also kind of relieved? Like I've let go of something heavy. I'm still a bit shaky, but I feel more grounded than I did at the start of the session.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. What will you do to take care of yourself today?",
    "Client: I think I'll take a long shower when I get home, maybe do some deep breathing exercises. And I might call my girlfriend, just to hear her voice. That usually helps me feel calmer.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a good plan. We're out of time, but is there anything else you'd like to add?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I guess. For listening and helping me work through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm starting to understand myself better.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
