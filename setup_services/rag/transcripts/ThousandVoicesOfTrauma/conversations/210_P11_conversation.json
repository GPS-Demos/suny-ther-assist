    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: (sighs deeply) It's... it's intense. I feel drained, but also kind of... I don't know, maybe relieved? Going through that memory of being trapped during the cyclone, it's like I'm reliving it all over again. The wind, the creaking of the house, the water rising... it's so vivid.",
    "Therapist: What stood out most?",
    "Client: The helplessness. I remember feeling so... powerless. Like nature was just gonna swallow us whole, you know? And then thinking about my partner, wondering if they were safe... it was overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: How does that compare to now?",
    "Client: It's different. I mean, I'm here, I'm safe. But sometimes I still feel that helplessness in my day-to-day life. Like when I'm studying, and I hit a wall, I get this flash of panic. It's not as intense, but it's there.",
    "Therapist: Mm. How might this connect to your recovery?",
    "Client: (pauses) I guess... maybe it's about control? Or lack of it? The disaster took away all control, and now I'm trying to regain it. But it's hard. Sometimes I turn to substances just to feel like I have some power over something, anything.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation.",
    "Client: Yeah... it's tough though. Facing these memories, it brings up a lot. Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it, you know? Like, am I just torturing myself for nothing?",
    "Therapist: What makes you question that?",
    "Client: It's just... it's so hard. Reliving it, talking about it. Sometimes I feel like I'm getting worse before I get better. And then there's the whole thing with my studies and trying to stay clean... it's a lot.",
    "Therapist: It is challenging. What keeps you going?",
    "Client: (long pause) Hope, I guess. Hope that one day I'll be able to think about the cyclone without feeling like I'm right back there. Hope that I can finish my degree without falling apart. And... hope that I can be the partner I want to be, without relying on substances to cope.",
    "Therapist: That's powerful motivation.",
    "Client: Yeah, it is. But it's also scary. What if I can't do it? What if I'm just kidding myself?",
    "Therapist: How might we address those fears?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe by taking it one day at a time? Focusing on small victories? Like today, I got through the imaginal exposure. That's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What else?",
    "Client: Well, I've been clean for a week now. That's huge for me. And I managed to submit my assignment on time, even with all this going on. I guess when I look at it that way, I am making progress.",
    "Therapist: How does recognizing that progress feel?",
    "Client: It feels... good. Surprising, almost. I've been so focused on the struggle that I didn't really see how far I've come. Maybe I'm stronger than I give myself credit for.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization.",
    "Client: Yeah, it is. (chuckles softly) You know, when we started these sessions, I thought it was gonna be all about the trauma. But it's like... it's about everything. My whole life. It's all connected.",
    "Therapist: How so?",
    "Client: Well, the trauma affected how I see the world, how I cope with stress. It's tied into my substance use, my relationships, my studies. Working through it isn't just about the memory itself, it's about... rebuilding myself, I guess.",
    "Therapist: That's a profound insight.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's... it's actually kind of exciting, in a weird way. Like, yeah, it's hard work, but I'm not just healing from the trauma. I'm becoming a better version of myself. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. How will you carry this forward?",
    "Client: I think... I need to be kinder to myself. Recognize the small victories. And maybe... maybe use that feeling of control I'm gaining here to help me in other areas. Like with my studies, or staying clean. It's all part of the same journey, right?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a solid plan.",
    "Client: Yeah. It's not gonna be easy, but... I think I'm ready for it. Or at least, more ready than I was before. Thank you for helping me see that.",
    "Therapist: You did the work. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... hopeful. Like maybe I can face whatever comes next. It's a good feeling."
