    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling today as we begin our session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit nervous about diving into this again, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here.",
    "Client: Right, okay. So, where do you want me to start?",
    "Therapist: Let's begin with the incident you mentioned last time. Take your time.",
    "Client: Alright. It was a Tuesday evening, I remember because I had just gotten home from my book club. I walked into the house, and I could feel the tension immediately. John, my ex-husband, was in the living room. He'd been drinking again. I could smell it from the doorway. I tried to just go upstairs, avoid any confrontation, you know? But he called out to me, his voice slurred and angry.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: He... he started yelling about dinner not being ready. I tried to explain that I had told him I'd be late because of book club, but he wouldn't listen. He got up and started walking towards me. I remember feeling my heart racing, my palms getting sweaty. I knew what was coming.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: It's hard... I can still see his face, contorted with anger. He grabbed my arm, squeezing so hard. I can almost feel it now. He shoved me against the wall, screaming in my face about how useless I was. I... I can smell the alcohol on his breath. It's making me feel sick...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: I... I closed my eyes, trying to block it out. But then I heard a crash. When I opened my eyes, I saw my daughter, Emma, standing there. She had dropped a glass of water. She looked so scared, so small. John turned towards her, and I just... I panicked. I couldn't let him hurt her.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: I pushed him away from me, screaming at Emma to run to her room. John stumbled, caught off guard. I ran to Emma, scooped her up, and locked us in her bedroom. I could hear John pounding on the door, yelling, threatening us. Emma was crying, shaking in my arms. I... I felt so helpless, so angry at myself for letting it get to this point.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: We stayed in that room for hours. Eventually, John passed out in the hallway. I remember sitting there, holding Emma, listening to make sure it was safe. When morning came, I packed our bags and we left. That was the last time I saw him. But sometimes... sometimes I still feel like I'm in that room, waiting, terrified.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Drained. But... also a little relieved, I think. Like a weight has been lifted somewhat.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've done excellent work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to talk about, but I think it's getting a little easier each time.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm taking deep breaths... focusing on the present. I'm here, in your office. I'm safe now.",
    "Therapist: Well done. How would you like to proceed?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to talk about how this has affected my relationships since then. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Whenever you're ready.",
    "Client: Alright. Well, after leaving John, I found it really hard to trust anyone. Especially men. I've been divorced for five years now, and I've only been on a handful of dates. Each time, I find myself looking for signs, you know? Signs that they might be like John. I analyze every word, every gesture. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. You're protecting yourself.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess so. But it's lonely too. I miss having someone to share my life with. But then I think about Emma, about how I need to keep her safe, and I just... I retreat back into my shell.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Safety is important.",
    "Client: It's not just romantic relationships either. I find it hard to make friends. I'm always worried about letting people get too close, about them finding out about my past. I feel like I'm constantly on guard.",
    "Therapist: That must be tiring. You're very resilient.",
    "Client: It is tiring. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel normal again. If I'll ever be able to just relax and enjoy life without this constant fear hanging over me.",
    "Therapist: Healing takes time. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I hope so. I want to be a good example for Emma. I don't want her to grow up thinking that fear and mistrust are normal. But it's so hard to let go of these feelings.",
    "Therapist: You're aware, and that's a big step.",
    "Client: I guess you're right. It's just... sometimes it feels like one step forward, two steps back, you know? Like last week, I was at the grocery store, and a man raised his voice at the cashier. It wasn't even directed at me, but I felt that panic rising, that urge to run.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. How did you handle it?",
    "Client: I took some deep breaths, like we've practiced. I reminded myself that I was safe, that not everyone is like John. I managed to finish my shopping, but I felt drained afterwards.",
    "Therapist: You used your coping skills effectively. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's small, I know, but it felt like a victory. I just wish these reactions would stop altogether.",
    "Therapist: Healing isn't linear. You're doing great work.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's hard to see progress sometimes, but I guess I am moving forward, even if it's slow.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Every step counts. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. This session was intense, but I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great courage today. Take care, Sarah."
