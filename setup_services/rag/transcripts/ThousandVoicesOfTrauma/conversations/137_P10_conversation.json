    "Therapist: Welcome, Amira. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is terrified. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0-100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably around 60? My heart's already racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we're here together. Are you ready to begin the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I guess so. Just... give me a moment to breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. When you're ready, close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... I'm... I'm in that room again. It's dark, and I can smell the damp concrete. The air feels heavy, like it's pressing down on me. I'm sitting on the cold floor, my back against the wall. My wrists hurt from the rope...",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you hear?",
    "Client: I hear... I hear footsteps. They're getting closer. Oh god, I know it's him. My heart is pounding so hard...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Amira. Remember, you're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: The door creaks open. There's a sliver of light, and I can see his silhouette. He's... he's so much bigger than me. I feel so small, so helpless. I want to disappear into the wall.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. I can barely breathe. My hands are shaking, and I'm pressing them against the floor, trying to ground myself.",
    "Therapist: Good awareness. Keep describing what's happening.",
    "Client: He's walking towards me. I can smell alcohol on his breath. He's saying something, but I can't... I can't focus on the words. It's like my ears are ringing. He reaches down and grabs my arm, pulling me up...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it, Amira. You're doing great. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's probably 80. Maybe higher. I feel like I'm there again.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Take a deep breath. What happens next?",
    "Client: He's... he's touching me. His hands are rough, and I feel so dirty. I want to scream, but no sound comes out. It's like my voice is trapped in my throat. I'm frozen...",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave, Amira. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I close my eyes. I'm trying to pretend I'm somewhere else, anywhere else. But I can still feel everything. His weight on me, the cold floor beneath me. I'm... I'm crying, but he doesn't care. He just keeps... *sobs*",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're safe now. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: *deep, shaky breath* I... I can do this. Um, after he's... done, he just leaves. The door slams shut, and I'm alone again in the dark. I curl up in the corner, hugging my knees to my chest. I feel so... broken. So ashamed.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well, Amira. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. My heart's still racing, and I feel nauseous. But also... maybe a little relieved? Like, I got through it again, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: Maybe... 75? It's come down a little, but I still feel really shaken up.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's take a few deep breaths together. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: *breathes deeply* Okay... that helps a bit.",
    "Therapist: Good. Can you tell me more about what happened after he left?",
    "Client: I... I just stayed there for a long time. I was afraid he'd come back. Every little noise made me jump. I kept replaying what happened in my head, wondering if I could have done something differently. If I could have fought harder or... I don't know.",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault, Amira. You did what you needed to survive.",
    "Client: I know that... logically. But it's hard to believe sometimes. I felt so powerless, so... insignificant. Like I didn't matter at all.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are valid, but remember they're tied to the past. How are you feeling right now, in this moment?",
    "Client: Right now? I'm... I'm okay, I think. My hands are still shaking a bit, but I can feel the chair beneath me. I can hear the traffic outside. It helps remind me that I'm here, not there.",
    "Therapist: Excellent grounding, Amira. Let's continue. What happened next?",
    "Client: Eventually, I heard more footsteps. But these were different... lighter, faster. I heard whispers, and then suddenly the door burst open. There were police officers, and paramedics. Someone wrapped a blanket around me, and they helped me out of that room.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to be rescued?",
    "Client: It was... overwhelming. I was relieved, but also terrified. I didn't know what was going to happen next. I remember one of the paramedics talking to me softly, checking me over. But I couldn't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction to trauma. How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... maybe 65? Talking about the rescue feels a bit easier.",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. Can you tell me about leaving that place?",
    "Client: They helped me into an ambulance. The lights were so bright after being in that dark room for so long. I remember squinting, feeling almost blinded. The paramedic kept asking me questions, but I could barely speak. My throat felt raw from... from screaming, I guess.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Amira. Keep going.",
    "Client: At the hospital, everything was a blur. Doctors, nurses, police officers asking questions. I felt so exposed, so vulnerable. They did tests, took photos of my injuries. I wanted to disappear, to wash everything away. But I couldn't. I just had to sit there and let them... document everything.",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly difficult. How are you feeling now, recalling this?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. But also, I feel... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like, I survived that. I'm here now, talking about it. That has to mean something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Your strength is evident, Amira. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: I think it's down to about 55. It's still there, but not as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Can you tell me about what happened after the hospital?",
    "Client: They... they took me to a safe house. I remember walking in and just... collapsing on the bed. I slept for what felt like days. When I woke up, there was a counselor there. She talked to me about what happened, about my options. But all I could think about was how I'd never feel safe again.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after trauma. How do you feel about safety now?",
    "Client: It's... it's better. Not perfect, but better. I still have moments where I panic, where I feel like I'm back in that room. But they're less frequent now. And I have tools to help me cope.",
    "Therapist: You've made incredible progress, Amira. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm proud of myself, actually. It was hard, really hard. But I did it. And I feel... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've let go of a bit of the weight I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful, Amira. What's your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: I think... maybe 45? I still feel shaken up, but it's manageable now.",
    "Therapist: That's significant improvement. You should be very proud of yourself. Let's end with some grounding exercises.",
    "Client: Okay. *deep breath* I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Great. Let's start by naming five things you can see in this room..."
