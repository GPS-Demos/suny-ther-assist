    "Therapist: Mr. Lee, today we'll begin imaginal exposure. Are you ready to discuss this?",
    "Client: I think so, Dr. Chen. But I'm not entirely sure what to expect. Can you tell me more about it?",
    "Therapist: Of course. It involves revisiting your trauma memory in a safe environment. How does that sound?",
    "Client: Honestly, it sounds a bit daunting. I've spent years trying to avoid thinking about that terrible flood. The idea of purposely remembering it makes me nervous. Will it be very distressing?",
    "Therapist: It can be challenging, but we'll go at your pace. How are you feeling about it now?",
    "Client: I'm apprehensive, but I trust you, Dr. Chen. I've been struggling with nightmares and flashbacks for so long, and nothing else has helped. If this can make a difference, I'm willing to try. Can you tell me more about what exactly we'll be doing?",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit the memory gradually. You'll describe it aloud while I guide you. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It sounds intense. I'm worried I might become overwhelmed or panic. What happens if it becomes too much for me to handle? I'm not as young as I used to be, and my heart isn't what it once was.",
    "Therapist: We can pause anytime. Your safety is my priority. Shall we discuss coping strategies?",
    "Client: Yes, that would be helpful. I've developed some breathing techniques over the years that sometimes help when I'm feeling anxious. Would those be useful during this process?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Those techniques can be very beneficial. What else might help you feel safe?",
    "Client: Well, I find comfort in holding onto my late wife's scarf. Would it be alright if I brought that with me to our sessions? It helps ground me when I'm feeling distressed.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Bringing the scarf is a great idea. Anything else you'd like to know?",
    "Client: I appreciate your understanding, Dr. Chen. I'm curious about how long this process typically takes. Will we be doing this every session from now on? And how will I know if it's working?",
    "Therapist: It varies, but we'll track your progress regularly. Any other concerns?",
    "Client: I suppose I'm worried about how this might affect me between sessions. Will revisiting these memories make my symptoms worse before they get better? I live with a roommate, and I don't want to disturb him if I start having more frequent nightmares or anxiety attacks.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to have some increased symptoms initially. We'll develop strategies to manage this. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's reassuring to hear. I appreciate your patience with all my questions, Dr. Chen. I think I'm feeling a bit more prepared now. Is there anything else I should know or do to get ready for our next session when we start this process?",
    "Therapist: Just take care of yourself. Rest well, use your coping skills. Ready to schedule our next session?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I am. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly, Dr. Chen. I'm still nervous, but I feel more confident knowing what to expect and that you'll be there to guide me through it. Let's schedule that next session and take this step forward."
