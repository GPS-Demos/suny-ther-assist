    "Therapist: Welcome, Amara. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is scared. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Let's start with your SUDS level.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 6 out of 10. My hands are a bit shaky.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. When you're ready, close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Alright... I'm... I'm in our old apartment. It's late evening, and the air feels heavy. I can hear the TV in the background, some action movie John always liked. The lights are dim, and there's this... this tension in the air. I'm in the kitchen, trying to clean up after dinner, but my hands keep shaking. I drop a plate, and it shatters on the floor. I freeze, my heart racing...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you see, hear, feel?",
    "Client: I... I see the broken pieces scattered on the floor. They look so sharp. I hear John's footsteps, heavy and angry, coming towards the kitchen. My chest feels tight, and I can't breathe properly. I want to run, but my legs won't move.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: John bursts into the kitchen. His face is red, and I can smell the alcohol on his breath. He's yelling, \"Can't you do anything right?\" I try to apologize, but the words get stuck in my throat. He grabs my arm, squeezing so hard it hurts. I can feel his fingers digging into my skin...",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about an 8. My heart is pounding.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Focus on your breathing. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *takes a shaky breath* Okay... John is still gripping my arm. He's so close I can see the veins in his neck bulging. I'm trying to pull away, but he's too strong. He shoves me, and I stumble backwards, my foot catching on a chair. I fall, and I feel a sharp pain in my hip as I hit the floor. The broken plate pieces are everywhere, and I cut my hand as I try to push myself up.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: I... I can taste blood in my mouth. I must have bit my lip when I fell. John is looming over me, his fists clenched. I'm crying now, begging him to stop. But his eyes... they're so cold. He kicks the chair out of the way, and it crashes against the wall. I flinch at the sound, curling into myself, trying to protect my body. I can hear my own heartbeat, so loud in my ears...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm scared. My body feels tense, like I'm back there. But... but I know I'm here. It's hard.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a deep breath. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *inhales shakily* John grabs a fistful of my hair, yanking my head back. The pain is sharp, and I cry out. He's yelling in my face, calling me useless, worthless. I can feel his spit on my cheek. I want to fight back, but I'm frozen. My mind is screaming at me to do something, anything, but my body won't respond.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I hear a knock at the door. It's loud, insistent. John freezes, his grip on my hair loosening. We both turn towards the sound. It's Mrs. Thompson from next door. She's calling out, asking if everything's okay. John lets go of me, stepping back. His face changes, like he's putting on a mask. He tells me to clean myself up, then goes to answer the door. I'm still on the floor, shaking, surrounded by broken ceramic and drops of my own blood...",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 9 now. I feel like I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here in the present. Look around the room. Can you name three things you see?",
    "Client: I... I see the blue chair, the plant by the window, and your desk.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, continue with the memory when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... I can hear John at the door, his voice all charm and apologies. He's telling Mrs. Thompson we were just moving furniture, that everything's fine. I'm struggling to stand up, my legs feel weak. My hip throbs where I fell, and my scalp stings. I can hear my own ragged breathing, and I'm trying to be quiet so Mrs. Thompson doesn't hear me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Angry. Sad. It's all mixed up.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're processing a lot. Do you want to continue?",
    "Client: Yeah... I think so. I hear the door close, and my stomach drops. John's footsteps are coming back to the kitchen. I'm trying to clean faster, but my hands are slippery with blood and sweat. He appears in the doorway, and I freeze again. But he looks... different. Calmer. He sighs and says, \"Look at this mess. I'll get the broom.\"",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well. Let's take a moment. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I... I feel exhausted. Drained. But also... I don't know. Like a weight has lifted a bit?",
    "Therapist: That's common after processing trauma. Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 6 now. Still there, but not as intense.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's do some grounding exercises before we end.",
    "Client: Okay... yeah, that sounds good. I... I can't believe I got through all that. It was hard, but... I did it.",
    "Therapist: You did. You showed immense courage. We'll process this more next session. For now, let's focus on bringing you back to the present..."
