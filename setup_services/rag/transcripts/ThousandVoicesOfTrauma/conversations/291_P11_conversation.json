    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving that moment when I saw my friend collapse from her illness... it's bringing up a lot of emotions I've been trying to push down.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. Seeing her there, on the floor, struggling to breathe... I felt so powerless. I keep replaying it in my mind, wondering if I could have done something differently, you know?",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. My heart was racing, and I felt this tightness in my chest. It's like I was right back there in that moment. I could even smell the sterile hospital air. It's strange how vivid it all becomes when I let myself really remember.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage. How does this connect to your daily life?",
    "Client: I guess... I've been avoiding anything that reminds me of hospitals or illness. Even TV shows with medical scenes make me anxious now. And I've been so worried about my own health lately. It's like I'm constantly on edge, waiting for something bad to happen.",
    "Therapist: That sounds challenging. What insights have you gained?",
    "Client: I'm realizing that maybe my anxiety isn't just about school or normal stress. It's tied to this fear of losing control, of not being able to help when it really matters. I've been pushing people away too, afraid of getting close in case something happens to them.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How might this affect your goals?",
    "Client: I think... I need to work on accepting that I can't control everything. And maybe it's okay to let people in, even if it's scary. I want to be able to live my life without this constant fear hanging over me.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent insight. What's one small step you could take?",
    "Client: Um, maybe... reaching out to some friends I've been avoiding? Or... forcing myself to watch a medical drama without turning it off? It sounds silly, but it feels like a big deal to me.",
    "Therapist: Not silly at all. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's hard, really hard. But... I think it's helping? I feel like I'm understanding myself better, even if it's painful. I want to keep going, to see where this leads. I'm tired of feeling stuck.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is commendable. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I guess. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's not easy to talk about, but I feel... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I'm not carrying this all alone anymore. It's still scary, but I feel like maybe there's hope. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're making great progress. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. It's a lot to process, but I'm glad we did this. I'll try to practice some of those grounding techniques we talked about before, especially when the memories feel overwhelming. And maybe I'll try reaching out to a friend this week, just for a quick coffee or something. Baby steps, right?",
    "Therapist: Excellent plan. Take care, and we'll continue next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. See you next week."
