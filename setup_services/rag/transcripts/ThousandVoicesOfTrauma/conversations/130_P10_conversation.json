    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a part of me that wants to get this over with, but another part that's terrified of reliving it all. My hands are a bit shaky.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess so. Where do you want me to start?",
    "Therapist: Start from the beginning of the event. Use present tense, as if it's happening now.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm walking down this dimly lit hallway. The walls are covered in these strange symbols, and there's incense burning somewhere. My heart's racing. I can hear chanting coming from the room at the end of the hall.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Uh, probably a 6 or 7. The chanting is getting louder as I get closer to the door.",
    "Therapist: Keep going. You're doing well.",
    "Client: I push open the heavy wooden door, and... oh god. There's about 20 people in robes, standing in a circle. In the center, there's an altar, and on it... there's a person. They're not moving. I can't tell if they're breathing.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. My mouth is dry, and I can feel my pulse in my ears. The leader, he turns to look at me. His eyes are so cold. He beckons me to join the circle.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe 9. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay. I... I step into the circle. The chanting gets louder, and I can smell copper. Blood. There's blood on the altar. The person isn't moving at all. I want to run, but my feet won't move.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The leader starts speaking in a language I don't understand. He's holding a knife. It's glinting in the candlelight. I... I can't look away. He raises it above the person on the altar.",
    "Therapist: What's happening in your body right now?",
    "Client: My... my chest is tight. I feel nauseous. My hands are clenched so tight they hurt.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *exhales shakily* The knife comes down. There's a sickening sound, and more blood. So much blood. I think I'm going to be sick. The other members are still chanting, but now they're swaying. The leader turns to me, his hands covered in blood. He's smiling. Oh god, he's smiling.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 10. I can't... I can't do this. I need to stop.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing incredibly well. Remember, you're here in the office with me. Can you tell me five things you see in the room?",
    "Client: I... okay. I see the clock on the wall. Your desk. The plant in the corner. The painting of the ocean. And... and my own hands, shaking.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, can you continue? What happens next?",
    "Client: *deep breath* The leader approaches me. He's still smiling. He holds out the bloody knife to me. I can smell the blood, metallic and overwhelming. He wants me to take it. I... I shake my head. I can't. I won't.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Scared, but... but also angry. How dare they involve me in this? I start backing away, towards the door.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going.",
    "Client: The other members start to close in around me. Their faces are hidden by their hoods, but I can feel their eyes on me. The leader's smile fades. He looks... disappointed. Angry. He says something in that strange language again, and the others start to reach for me.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8 or 9. I'm panicking. I turn and run for the door, but someone grabs my robe. I'm struggling, trying to break free.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I manage to slip out of the robe. I burst through the door and run down the hallway. I can hear them behind me, their footsteps echoing. The symbols on the walls seem to be moving, swirling. I feel dizzy, but I keep running.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's happening in your body?",
    "Client: My legs are burning. My lungs feel like they're on fire. I can taste blood in my mouth - I think I bit my tongue. But I keep running. I have to get out.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I see a door ahead. It's heavy, metal. I slam into it with my shoulder. It hurts, but it opens. I stumble out into the night air. It's cold, so cold after the stuffy heat inside. I keep running, across a field. I can see lights in the distance - a road, maybe?",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Terrified, but... relieved. I think I'm going to make it. I don't hear them behind me anymore. I reach the road and flag down a car. The driver looks scared - I must look a mess. But he stops.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down. Maybe a 6 or 7. I'm in the car now. The driver is asking me questions, but I can't speak. I just point down the road, away from that place.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: We're driving now. I keep looking back, but I don't see anyone following. The adrenaline is wearing off, and I start shaking. The driver asks if I need a hospital. I shake my head. I just want to go home.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Drained. But... alive. I made it out. I survived.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You did survive. You're here now, safe.",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, I am. *deep breath* It's over.",
    "Therapist: You did incredibly well. How are you feeling right now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. Shaky, but okay. It's strange, but I feel... lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after processing trauma. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 4, I think. I'm still anxious, but it's manageable.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves. Can you tell me three things you can hear right now?",
    "Client: Sure. I can hear the ticking of the clock, the hum of the air conditioner, and... my own breathing, which is calmer now.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Now, let's discuss what you experienced during this session.",
    "Client: It was intense. There were moments when I thought I couldn't continue, but... I did. It felt real, like I was there again, but this time I knew I was safe here with you.",
    "Therapist: You showed great courage. How do you feel about the experience now?",
    "Client: It's still painful, but... it doesn't have the same power over me. I feel like I faced it, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. How do you think this might impact your daily life?",
    "Client: I think... I might be able to sleep better. The nightmares might not be as frequent. And maybe I won't be as jumpy when I see people in robes or smell incense.",
    "Therapist: Those are all positive outcomes. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: No, I think... I think I'm good for now. It's a lot to process, but I feel... stronger. Like I can handle this.",
    "Therapist: You've made excellent progress today. Remember to use the coping strategies we've discussed if you feel overwhelmed. Shall we end the session here?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that's good. Thank you... for guiding me through this. It wasn't easy, but I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care of yourself, and I'll see you next week."
