    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. Today we'll start imaginal exposure. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Thompson. I'm... honestly, I'm pretty nervous. I've been dreading this all week. The idea of reliving that night of the home invasion... it's making my stomach churn. I barely slept last night thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried that talking about it will make everything worse. What if I can't handle it? What if I have a panic attack right here in your office? And... I'm embarrassed to admit this, but I'm scared I might even wet myself if I get too overwhelmed. It's just... it's a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. Your fears are valid. How can I support you?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. Maybe... could you explain why we need to do this? I mean, I've been trying so hard to forget that night. Why do we have to bring it all back up again?",
    "Therapist: It helps process the trauma. By facing it, we reduce its power over you.",
    "Client: I see. But how does that work exactly? It seems counterintuitive to deliberately think about something I've been avoiding.",
    "Therapist: Avoidance maintains fear. Exposure helps you realize you can cope with memories safely.",
    "Client: Okay, that makes sense. But what if I get too overwhelmed during the exercise? What if I can't continue?",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. You can pause anytime. I'm here to support you throughout.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I appreciate your patience with me, Dr. Thompson. I know I must seem like a mess right now. It's just... ever since that night, I've felt so on edge. Every little noise makes me jump. I've been sleeping with the lights on, and I've triple-checked the locks more times than I can count. It's exhausting living like this.",
    "Therapist: Your reactions are normal after trauma. This process will help reduce those symptoms.",
    "Client: I really hope so. I want my life back. I want to feel safe in my own home again. It's just hard to imagine getting there from where I am now.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Your courage in facing this is admirable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Okay... I think I'm ready. Or as ready as I'll ever be. Can you just... can you walk me through what we're going to do? Step by step? I think that might help calm my nerves a bit.",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll start slowly. You'll describe the event, focusing on sensory details.",
    "Client: Sensory details? Like what I saw and heard that night?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. Also smells, physical sensations. I'll guide you with questions if needed.",
    "Client: Alright. And how long will this last? The whole session?",
    "Therapist: About 30-45 minutes. We'll process your feelings afterward. Remember, you're in control.",
    "Client: Okay. I can do this. I'm still nervous, but I trust you, Dr. Thompson. And I want to get better. I'm tired of letting that night control my life. So... I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Should we start now?",
    "Therapist: Your determination is inspiring. Let's begin when you're comfortable. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay. I'm ready. Where should I start?",
    "Therapist: Start with the moment you first realized something was wrong that night."
