    "Therapist: Alright, Raj, we're going to start the imaginal exposure now. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I understand why we're doing this.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and describe the hostage situation.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm at my store. It's a quiet afternoon. Suddenly, two men burst in with guns. My heart starts racing. They're shouting, demanding money. I can smell their sweat and cigarette breath. My hands are shaking as I try to open the register.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Um... I'd say about a 6 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue.",
    "Client: One of them grabs a customer - an elderly woman. He's pressing the gun to her head. I can hear her whimpering. I'm fumbling with the cash, trying to move faster. My mouth is dry, and I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: And now?",
    "Client: It's getting worse. Maybe an 8? My palms are sweating just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: They're getting angrier. Shouting more. The woman is crying now. I finally get the register open, but it's not enough money. They're furious. One of them hits me with the butt of his gun. I taste blood in my mouth. I'm terrified they're going to kill us all.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm back there. My heart is pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) Okay... okay. They're tying us up now. The rope is cutting into my wrists. I can hear sirens in the distance. The robbers are panicking. One of them kicks me in the ribs. I'm gasping for air, thinking about my family, wondering if I'll see them again.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still a 9. I feel so helpless, so scared.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Raj. Remember, you survived this.",
    "Client: Right... The police arrive. There's shouting, chaos. A gunshot. I think I'm going to die. But then... it's over. The police have them. We're being untied. I'm shaking uncontrollably. I can't stop crying.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7 now. I feel... drained.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. How do you feel physically?",
    "Client: My heart is still racing. I feel tense all over. But... I'm also relieved it's over.",
    "Therapist: You did well. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: Okay... (deep breath) I'm starting to feel more present now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Final SUDS?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 5 now. It's... it's getting better.",
    "Therapist: Excellent work, Raj. Let's discuss what you experienced."
