    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to the day of the car accident. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see the road. It's a clear day, sunny. I'm driving to work, just like any other morning. The radio is on, playing some pop song. I'm feeling good, thinking about a project I'm excited about.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that memory. What happens next?",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud screeching noise. I look to my left and see a car coming straight at me. It's happening so fast. I... I can't...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) The impact is violent. I feel my body jerk forward, then slam back into the seat. The airbag deploys, hitting my face. There's a ringing in my ears, and I taste blood in my mouth. I'm... I'm so scared.",
    "Therapist: That sounds terrifying. Keep going, you're handling this well.",
    "Client: Everything is spinning. I'm trying to focus, to understand what just happened. I smell gasoline and burning rubber. My hands are shaking as I try to unbuckle my seatbelt. I'm panicking, thinking the car might explode.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I manage to get out of the car. My legs feel weak, and I stumble. That's when I see the other car. It's... it's much worse than mine. There's someone inside, not moving. I want to help, but I'm frozen. I can't... I can't move.",
    "Therapist: Stay with the memory. You're doing well.",
    "Client: People are gathering around. Someone's calling for an ambulance. I hear sirens in the distance. I'm still standing there, unable to process what's happening. A woman approaches me, asks if I'm okay. I can't speak. I just stare at the other car, feeling... feeling...",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in that moment?",
    "Client: Guilt. Overwhelming guilt. Even though I know it wasn't my fault, I feel responsible. I keep thinking, \"If only I'd left a few minutes later, or earlier.\" The paramedics arrive, and they're rushing to the other car. I'm praying, hoping the other driver is okay.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those feelings. Continue, you're doing great.",
    "Client: They're working on the other driver for what feels like hours. Finally, they get him out and into the ambulance. Someone tells me he's alive but in critical condition. I'm relieved, but the guilt is still there. A police officer comes to take my statement, but I can barely focus. My hands won't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. Reliving it brings back all those emotions - the fear, the guilt, the shock. But... it's different now. I can separate myself from it a bit more. It's still painful, but I feel like I can breathe through it.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard, but I think it's getting easier each time we do this. I used to avoid thinking about the accident at all costs, but now... now I feel like I can face it. It's not controlling me as much anymore.",

    "Client: I will. Thank you for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone here while I face these memories.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue next session. Take care."
