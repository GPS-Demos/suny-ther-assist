    "Client: Um, probably around a 6 or 7 right now.",

    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear raised voices. There's a man at the reception desk, he's yelling about wait times. His face is red, and he's... he's pounding his fist on the counter. The receptionist looks scared.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling as you witness this?",
    "Client: My heart's racing. I want to do something, but I'm frozen in my seat. I... I can't look away.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Maybe an 8?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. What do you see happening?",
    "Client: The man's getting more aggressive. He's... oh god, he's grabbed a clipboard and thrown it across the room. People are screaming, ducking. I can hear a child crying.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Security's running in now. But the man, he's... he's pulled something from his pocket. It's shiny. A knife? My chest feels so tight...",

    "Therapist: What are you doing in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm standing up. My legs feel wobbly. I want to help, but I don't know how. I'm edging towards the exit, but I can't take my eyes off the scene.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. Maybe a 9 now.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Feel your feet on the floor here in my office. You're safe.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... okay. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: The man's getting more erratic. He's... he's lunged at the security guard. There's a scuffle. I hear the knife clatter to the floor. More security's rushing in. They're... they're pinning him down. He's crying now, not fighting anymore.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling as you watch this unfold?",

    "Client: The police have arrived. They're talking to the man, who's now in handcuffs. He looks... broken. Defeated. The adrenaline's wearing off, and I'm feeling lightheaded.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking about how quickly it all happened. How one moment everything was normal, and the next... chaos. I'm wondering about the man's wife. Is she okay? Did she even know what was happening?",
    "Therapist: These are natural thoughts. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7?",
    "Therapist: That's good. What's happening as things start to calm down?",
    "Client: The staff are checking on people, asking if anyone needs medical attention. I'm... I'm sitting down again. My legs feel like jelly. A nurse comes over to me, asks if I'm alright. I nod, but... I don't feel alright.",
    "Therapist: What do you mean by that?",
    "Client: I feel... shaken. Like the world isn't as safe as I thought it was. I keep replaying the man's face in my mind, the desperation in his eyes.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction to what you've witnessed. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I decide to leave. I can't stay there anymore. As I'm walking out, I see them cleaning up the mess. The clipboard's still on the floor, papers scattered everywhere. It feels... surreal.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel as you're leaving?",
    "Client: Numb. Like I'm moving in slow motion. The sunlight outside seems too bright, too normal after what just happened. I sit in my car for a long time before I can bring myself to drive home.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. How are you feeling right now, as you remember all this?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. My heart's still beating fast, but not like before. I feel... drained. But also, maybe a little relieved to have talked about it?",
    "Therapist: That's good. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 5, I think.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well today. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end the session.",
