    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Carlos?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is buzzing, you know? My hands are shaking a bit, and I feel kind of nauseous. That memory... it's so vivid. I can still smell the musty air in that room where they kept us.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. Like, I was just a kid, you know? I should've been worrying about school and crushes, not... not trying to survive that nightmare. It's not fair. I feel angry, but also... I don't know, ashamed? Like maybe I could've done something differently.",
    "Therapist: I see. Can you tell me more about that shame?",
    "Client: It's... it's like this heavy weight in my chest. I know logically that it wasn't my fault, but there's this voice in my head saying I should've been stronger, should've found a way to escape sooner. And then I feel guilty for even thinking that because I know others had it worse than me.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you talk about this?",
    "Client: Tense. Really tense. My shoulders are all bunched up, and I'm clenching my jaw. I just want to curl up into a ball and disappear, you know? But at the same time, there's this restless energy, like I need to run or punch something.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to just forget about all of this, go back to pretending it never happened. But another part... I don't know, maybe I need to feel safe? To know that it's over and I'm okay now?",
    "Therapist: That makes sense. How can we help you feel safe right now?",
    "Client: Um, maybe... maybe just reminding me where I am? That I'm here in your office, not back there. And... is it okay if I open the window? I need some fresh air.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Please, go ahead.",
    "Client: *sound of window opening* Thanks. That helps. The breeze... it's grounding, you know? Reminds me I'm here, in the present. It's just... it's hard to shake off those memories once they start playing in my head.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice as you focus on the present?",
    "Client: I can hear traffic outside. People going about their day. It's... it's kind of comforting, actually. Reminds me that life goes on, you know? And I can smell someone's cooking from another apartment. It's so... normal. Makes me feel like maybe I can have normal too, someday.",
    "Therapist: How does that possibility feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's hopeful, I guess? But also scary. Like, what if I can't ever be normal? What if I'm too broken? But then I think about how far I've come already. I'm in college now, I have a girlfriend... things I never thought I'd have back then.",
    "Therapist: Mm. What's coming up for you as you reflect on that progress?",
    "Client: Pride, I think. Yeah, definitely pride. And gratitude. I mean, it hasn't been easy, and there are still days when I struggle. But I'm here, you know? I survived. And not just survived, but I'm actually living. Building a life for myself. It's... it's powerful to realize that.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization impact your view of yourself?",
    "Client: It's... it's changing, I think. Like, I've spent so long seeing myself as a victim, as damaged goods. But maybe... maybe I'm stronger than I thought. Resilient. I mean, I'm facing these memories head-on now, right? That takes guts.",
    "Therapist: Indeed it does. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm breathing easier now. The nausea is fading. And I feel... I don't know, more present? Like I'm fully here in my body, not lost in the memories. It's still uncomfortable, but it's manageable. And there's this tiny spark of... hope, maybe? Like maybe I can get through this, come out the other side even stronger.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful shift. How do you want to honor that feeling?",
    "Client: I... I think I want to write about it. Get it all out on paper, you know? Not just the bad stuff, but this moment too. The realization that I'm not defined by what happened to me. That I'm more than my trauma. Is that... is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How else can we support you?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe we could end with some grounding exercises? Something to help me transition back into the world, you know? And... and thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Carlos. Let's do those grounding exercises now."
