    "Therapist: Welcome, Amir. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. There's a lot on my mind. With everything going on in the news lately about police brutality, it's bringing up some difficult memories.",
    "Therapist: I understand. We're here to work through those feelings. Are you ready to begin the imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I guess so. I mean, yes. I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take a deep breath. Describe the scene as vividly as you can, using present tense.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm walking down the street. It's late afternoon, and the sun is setting. The air feels heavy, like it might rain soon. I can hear traffic in the distance, but this particular street is quiet. I'm... I'm feeling uneasy. My heart is starting to race a little.",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: There are old brick buildings on both sides of the street. Some have graffiti on them. I see a group of teenagers hanging out on a stoop, laughing and talking loudly. As I get closer, I notice a police car slowly driving by. My palms are getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, what's your distress level right now?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 40? It's climbing though.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath and continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: The police car stops. Two officers get out and start walking towards the group of teenagers. I can see their hands resting on their holsters. My throat feels tight. I... I want to do something, say something, but I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... \"Not again. Please, not again.\" My heart is pounding now. I can hear one of the officers shouting at the kids to put their hands up. They look so scared. I'm... I'm shaking. I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Amir. Remember, you're safe here. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 70. Maybe higher. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Focus on your breathing. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... okay. I'm still there. One of the teenagers, a young boy, he looks so much like my little brother. He's trembling. The officer grabs his arm roughly, and I... I can't stay silent anymore. I shout, \"Hey! Leave them alone!\" My voice cracks. I'm terrified, but I can't just watch this happen.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to speak up?",
    "Client: It's... it's terrifying and empowering at the same time. My legs feel weak, but I'm moving closer. The officers turn to look at me. One of them tells me to back off, but I don't. I keep my hands visible and say, \"They're just kids. They haven't done anything wrong.\" My voice is steadier now, but inside I'm a mess.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible courage. What happens next?",
    "Client: The situation is tense. I can feel the anger radiating from the officers. But the kids... they look at me with such gratitude. It reminds me of all the times I wished someone had stood up for me. The main officer, he's clearly annoyed, but he lets go of the boy's arm. He says something into his radio, then tells the kids to go home. I'm... I'm in disbelief. Did I actually make a difference?",
    "Therapist: How does that realization feel?",
    "Client: It's... overwhelming. I'm still shaking, but there's this warmth in my chest. Pride, maybe? The kids are leaving, looking back at me with small smiles. The officers get back in their car, but not before giving me a hard look. I'm scared they might come after me next, but they drive away.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 50. I'm still on edge, but I feel... I don't know. Stronger, somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Amir. Can you describe what you're feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My heart is still racing, but it's slowing down. My hands are clammy, and my legs feel a bit wobbly. But there's this energy running through me. Like I've tapped into something I didn't know I had.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What do you do next in the scene?",
    "Client: I... I sit down on the curb. I need a moment to process what just happened. My phone buzzes in my pocket \u2013 it's a text from my mom asking if I'm coming for dinner. It's such a normal thing, but it grounds me. I realize I'm okay. I made it through. I look up at the sky, and I notice the clouds have cleared. There's a beautiful sunset.",
    "Therapist: How does seeing that sunset make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a weight has been lifted. I feel drained but... peaceful? Like I've faced something I've been running from for a long time. I stand up, dust off my pants, and start walking home. Each step feels more confident than the last.",
    "Therapist: That's powerful, Amir. What's your distress level as you walk home?",
    "Client: It's down to about 30 now. I'm still processing everything, but I feel... I feel okay.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Take a few deep breaths and slowly open your eyes when you're ready.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... I'm back. Wow, that was... intense.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted, but... there's this sense of accomplishment. Like I've reclaimed something.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant breakthrough, Amir. You showed tremendous courage, both in the memory and in facing it today. How do you think this experience might impact your daily life?",
    "Client: I... I think it might help me feel less helpless. Maybe I can start standing up for myself more, you know? And for others too. It's scary, but... it feels right.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. We'll work on integrating this experience in our future sessions. For now, what can you do to take care of yourself for the rest of the day?",
    "Client: I think I'll call my mom, actually. Maybe take a long walk in the park. Just... be present, you know?",
    "Therapist: Those sound like excellent ideas. Remember to be gentle with yourself. You've done some challenging work today. Do you have any questions before we wrap up?",
    "Client: No, I... I think I'm good. Thank you. This was hard, but... I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Amir. I'm proud of the work you've done today. We'll pick up here next week. Take care.",
