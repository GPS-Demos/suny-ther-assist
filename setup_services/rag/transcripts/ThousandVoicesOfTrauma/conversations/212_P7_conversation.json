    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure exercise. Can you describe the moment you realized you were imprisoned?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard to think about. I remember the cold metal of the cell door closing. The sound was so final. I felt my heart racing, and my palms were sweaty. I couldn't believe this was happening to me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I looked around the tiny cell, and it hit me that this was my new reality. The walls seemed to close in on me. I could hear other inmates shouting and crying. I felt so alone and scared. I kept thinking about my family, wondering if they knew where I was.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I sat on the hard bunk, and I couldn't stop shaking. The smell was awful \u2013 a mix of disinfectant and body odor. I felt nauseous. I kept replaying the events that led to this moment, wondering how I could have prevented it. The guilt and shame were overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: I remember curling up in a ball, trying to make myself as small as possible. I was terrified of what might happen to me. Would the other inmates hurt me? Would the guards abuse me? I felt so vulnerable and exposed. I missed my husband and children so much it physically hurt.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. Continue.",
    "Client: The nights were the worst. The lights never fully went out, and there was always noise. I couldn't sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the faces of my children, wondering if I'd ever see them again. The uncertainty of how long I'd be there was torture.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job. Keep going.",
    "Client: I felt like I was losing my mind. The days blurred together. I lost track of time. The routines of prison life felt dehumanizing. Meal times, shower times, everything was controlled. I felt like I had no autonomy left. The neglect I experienced as a child came flooding back \u2013 that same feeling of being unwanted and forgotten.",
    "Therapist: You're handling these difficult memories well. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: I started to have panic attacks. My chest would tighten, and I couldn't breathe. I thought I was dying. The guards didn't seem to care. I felt so helpless and alone. I kept thinking about my life before this, my job, my family, and it all seemed like a distant dream.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. You're doing great.",
    "Client: The worst part was the visits. Seeing my family through the glass, not being able to touch them... it was heartbreaking. My children looked so confused and scared. My husband tried to be strong, but I could see the pain in his eyes. I felt like I had failed them all.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel this way. You're very strong.",
    "Client: As time went on, I started to lose hope. I wondered if I'd ever get out, if I'd ever have a normal life again. The anxiety was constant. I felt like I was drowning in despair. Every day was a struggle to keep going, to not give up entirely.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible resilience. Keep sharing.",
    "Client: I started to withdraw from everything. I stopped eating regularly, stopped talking to other inmates. I felt like a shell of my former self. The person I was before seemed so far away. I didn't know who I was anymore. The neglect I felt as a child, that feeling of being unworthy and unloved, it all came rushing back.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an amazing job. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming to talk about this. My heart is racing, and I feel a bit shaky. But also... I feel a sense of relief. Like I'm finally letting out something I've been holding in for so long. It's painful, but there's also a strange sense of freedom in talking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You've done incredibly well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It's still hard, and the memories are still painful, but I feel like I'm starting to process it all. Is this... is this what healing feels like?",
    "Therapist: It can be. You've taken a big step today.",
    "Client: I think I need a moment to catch my breath. This was more intense than I expected. But I'm glad I did it. I feel like I'm finally facing these memories instead of running from them. It's scary, but also... empowering in a way.",
    "Therapist: Take all the time you need. You've done excellent work today."
