    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Ahmed?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Going through that memory of my heart attack again... it's like I was right back there in that moment. I could feel the tightness in my chest, the panic rising. It's strange how vivid it all still is, even though it happened three years ago.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The fear. The absolute terror of thinking I was going to die right there in my office. I remember looking at the family photo on my desk and... (voice breaks) thinking I'd never see my wife and kids again. It's silly, but I even remember wishing I'd told my wife I loved her that morning before leaving for work.",
    "Therapist: That's not silly at all. How did it feel to revisit that today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. But different from when I usually think about it. Usually, I try to push the memory away as quickly as possible. This time, staying with it... I noticed things I hadn't before. Like how quickly my assistant reacted, calling the ambulance. I guess I never really acknowledged how much she helped that day.",
    "Therapist: I see. What else did you notice?",
    "Client: Well, I... I realized how much anger I still carry about the whole thing. Not just about having a heart attack, but how it changed everything. My business suffered, my relationships... It's like my life split into 'before' and 'after' that day.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger manifest in your daily life now?",
    "Client: I suppose I'm more irritable, especially with my wife. I get frustrated easily when I can't do things I used to. And I've been pushing people away, afraid to let anyone get too close. It's... it's like I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop, you know?",
    "Therapist: That makes sense. How might addressing this anger help your recovery?",
    "Client: I... I never thought about it that way. Maybe if I could let go of some of this anger, I wouldn't be so on edge all the time. Maybe I could start enjoying life again, instead of just... existing. But I don't know how to do that.",
    "Therapist: It's a process. What's one small step you could take?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe I could try talking to my wife about how I'm feeling? I've been keeping her at arm's length, but she's been so patient. Maybe opening up would help.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great idea. How do you feel about today's session?",
    "Client: It was tough, but... I feel like I understand myself a bit better now. There's still a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe there's hope. Is that... is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Your insights today show real progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I appreciate your guidance through this. It's not easy, but I'm starting to see why it's important. I just hope I can keep this momentum going.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What would help you stay engaged?",
    "Client: Maybe... setting small goals between sessions? Like talking to my wife, or trying some relaxation techniques when I feel anxious about my health. I think having concrete things to work on might help me feel more in control.",
    "Therapist: Excellent idea. Shall we set those goals now?",
    "Client: Yes, I'd like that. And... I know I've been resistant to the idea before, but I think I'm ready to consider joining that cardiac rehab support group you mentioned. Being around others who've been through similar experiences... it might help me feel less alone in this.",
    "Therapist: That's a big step. I'm proud of you for considering it.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's scary, but I'm starting to realize that I can't keep living in fear of another heart attack. I need to start living again, you know? This process is helping me see that.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it feel?",
    "Client: It feels... liberating, I guess. And a little terrifying. But mostly, it feels like I'm finally moving forward instead of being stuck. I know there's still a lot of work to do, but for the first time in a long time, I feel like I might actually be okay.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful progress, Ahmed. Shall we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. Thank you again. I... I'm actually looking forward to our next session. That's new for me.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. Take care, Ahmed."
