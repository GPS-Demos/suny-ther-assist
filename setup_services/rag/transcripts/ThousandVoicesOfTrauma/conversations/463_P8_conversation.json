    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. The memory of the earthquake, it's so vivid now. I can still feel the ground shaking beneath my feet, you know? My heart is pounding, and I feel a bit dizzy.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I think. No, not just fear. It's... terror. I'm back there, in that moment when everything started to crumble. I can hear the screams, the sound of buildings collapsing. It's overwhelming. My palms are sweaty, and I feel this tightness in my chest.",
    "Therapist: And what thoughts are accompanying these feelings?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"I'm not safe. It could happen again at any moment.\" And then I feel guilty because I survived when so many others didn't. I wonder why I was spared. It doesn't make sense. And then I think about my childhood, how unstable everything felt then too. It's like... like the earthquake brought all that back.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts connect to your past experiences?",
    "Client: I... well, growing up, nothing ever felt secure. My parents were always fighting, and I never knew when the next explosion would happen. The earthquake, it's like it confirmed all my worst fears from childhood. That the world isn't safe, that everything can fall apart in an instant. I feel like I'm always waiting for the next disaster.",
    "Therapist: I see. What do you notice in your body right now?",
    "Client: My shoulders are so tense, they're almost up to my ears. I'm clenching my jaw, and my stomach feels like it's in knots. It's hard to take a deep breath. I just want to curl up into a ball and hide.",
    "Therapist: Mm. And if you could express what you need in this moment, what would it be?",
    "Client: I... I need to feel safe. I need to know that it's okay to let my guard down, that the world won't come crashing down if I do. But it's so hard. Every time I start to relax, I remember the earthquake, or I remember some fight from my childhood, and I tense up again. I want to be able to enjoy life without constantly looking over my shoulder.",
    "Therapist: How does sharing this make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a bit of a relief. I've never really put it all together like this before. The connection between my childhood and the earthquake, I mean. It's scary to talk about, but also... I don't know, maybe hopeful? Like maybe if I can understand it better, I can start to move past it. But then there's this voice in my head saying I'm being silly, that I should just get over it already.",
    "Therapist: What would you say to that voice if you could?",
    "Client: I'd... I'd tell it to shut up, honestly. I know I'm not being silly. What I experienced was real and traumatic. Both in my childhood and during the earthquake. I have a right to feel this way, and I have a right to heal. It's just... it's hard to believe that sometimes.",
    "Therapist: How does asserting that right feel?",
    "Client: It feels... empowering, actually. Like I'm taking back some control. My hands aren't shaking as much now, and I feel like I can breathe a little easier. It's like... like I'm standing up for myself, not just against the memory of the earthquake, but against all the times I felt powerless as a kid.",
    "Therapist: What do you want to remember from this realization?",
    "Client: I want to remember that my feelings are valid. That it's okay to be affected by what happened, but also that I have the strength to work through it. I'm not that helpless kid anymore, and I'm not trapped in that moment of the earthquake. I'm here, I'm safe, and I'm working on healing. It's a process, and that's okay.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How do you feel now compared to the beginning of our session?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, I think. Still a bit shaky, but more grounded. Like I've let go of something heavy I've been carrying around. There's still fear there, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming. I feel like I understand myself a bit better now. It's exhausting, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've done some important work.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What's one thing you'd like to focus on before our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to practice some of those grounding techniques we talked about. When I start feeling overwhelmed by memories or anxiety, I want to try to bring myself back to the present. Maybe focus on my breathing or my surroundings. And I want to try to be kinder to myself when those feelings come up, instead of getting frustrated or scared.",
    "Therapist: Excellent plan. We'll discuss how it went next time. Take care.",
    "Client: Thank you. This was tough, but... I think it was really helpful. I appreciate your guidance through all of this. See you next week."
