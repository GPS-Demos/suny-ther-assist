    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we've talked about this, but actually diving into those memories... it's daunting. Part of me wants to just get it over with, you know? But another part is screaming to run away.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Yeah, I think so. Let's do this before I change my mind.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in the Humvee. It's hot, so hot. The air feels thick, like you could cut it with a knife. I can smell the dust, the sweat, the diesel fuel. We're on patrol, rolling through a small village. Everything seems quiet, but there's this tension... like the calm before a storm.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's happening now?",
    "Client: We're approaching a checkpoint. I can see the barricades ahead, sandbags piled high. My hands are sweating inside my gloves, and I'm gripping my rifle tightly. I keep scanning the rooftops, the windows... anywhere a threat could be hiding.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 40? It's uncomfortable, but I'm managing.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a flash to our right. A deafening explosion rocks the Humvee. My ears are ringing, and I can taste blood in my mouth. I must've bitten my tongue. Everything's moving in slow motion. I see Johnson, our driver, slumped over the wheel. There's... there's blood everywhere.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: (Voice shaking) I'm... I'm terrified. My heart's pounding so hard I think it might burst out of my chest. I can't breathe. I want to help Johnson, but I'm frozen. I can hear screaming, but it sounds far away. Oh God, I think it might be me screaming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Sarah. Remember, you're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Inhales shakily) Okay... okay. I'm trying to focus. We're under attack. I can hear gunfire now, sharp cracks cutting through the ringing in my ears. I force myself to move, to check on Johnson. His pulse is weak, but he's alive. I'm yelling for the medic, but everything's chaos.",
    "Therapist: What's happening around you?",
    "Client: Smoke is everywhere. I can barely see. I'm coughing, choking on it. I manage to get out of the Humvee, dragging Johnson with me. The heat from the explosion is intense. I can feel it on my face, smell burning rubber and metal. There are people running, shouting. I see Martinez returning fire, but I can't tell where the enemy is.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: (Voice strained) It's... it's up to about 70. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Remember, you're here in the office with me. You're safe.",
    "Client: (Nods) Right, right. I'm... I'm trying to stay focused. I've got Johnson behind what's left of the Humvee. I'm putting pressure on his wound, but there's so much blood. I can hear bullets pinging off the metal around us. I'm so scared, but I'm angry too. I want to fight back, to do something, but I can't leave Johnson.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: Reinforcements arrive. I hear more vehicles, more shouting. The firefight intensifies. I'm still with Johnson, talking to him, trying to keep him conscious. His eyes keep rolling back, and I'm terrified he's going to die right here in my arms. I've never felt so helpless in my life.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. Describe them to me.",
    "Client: It's... it's like a weight on my chest. I can't breathe properly. My hands are shaking, but I'm trying to keep steady pressure on Johnson's wound. I feel sick to my stomach. The guilt is overwhelming \u2013 why him and not me? Why couldn't I do more? I'm a soldier, I'm supposed to be prepared for this, but I feel like a scared little kid.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Sarah. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) It's... it's pretty high. Maybe 85? I can feel my heart racing.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor, your back against the chair.",
    "Client: (Takes a few deep breaths) Okay... okay. I'm here. I'm safe. It's just a memory.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: The medic finally reaches us. He takes over caring for Johnson, and I feel a mix of relief and guilt for being glad it's not my responsibility anymore. I grab my rifle and join Martinez. We're returning fire, but it's hard to see where the shots are coming from. The adrenaline is pumping through me. I'm scared, but I'm also angry. So angry at the people who did this, at the situation, at myself for feeling so unprepared.",
    "Therapist: What are you seeing and hearing?",
    "Client: Dust and smoke everywhere. The air is thick with it. I can taste it. The gunfire is constant, a deafening mix of our weapons and theirs. I can hear shouting \u2013 orders being given, calls for help. Someone's crying out in pain. I think it's Cooper, but I can't see him. The smell of gunpowder and blood is overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: And how are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified, but also weirdly calm. It's like part of me has detached, is watching from above. I'm going through the motions \u2013 aim, fire, reload. My training has kicked in, but inside, I'm screaming. I keep thinking, \"This can't be real. This can't be happening.\"",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 80? My hands are shaking just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. This is just a memory. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Inhales deeply) Right. I'm here. I'm safe. (Pauses) The firefight seems to last forever, but it's probably only minutes. Suddenly, it's quiet. The silence is almost as deafening as the gunfire was. We're all tense, waiting for the next attack. But it doesn't come. We start checking on the wounded, securing the area. I make my way back to Johnson. He's been stabilized, but he looks so pale, so still. I can't stop thinking that this is my fault somehow, that I should have seen the attack coming.",
    "Therapist: What happens after that?",
    "Client: We evacuate the wounded. I help load Johnson into the medevac helicopter. As it takes off, I feel this... emptiness. Like I've been hollowed out. The adrenaline is wearing off, and I'm starting to shake. I can see the damage around us \u2013 the burning Humvee, the bullet holes, the blood on the ground. It hits me then \u2013 we could have all died. I almost throw up.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, Sarah?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. It's like I've lived through it all over again. My heart's still racing, and I feel a bit nauseous.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you name five things you can see in this room?",
    "Client: (Opens eyes, looks around) Um... the blue painting on the wall, your desk lamp, the tissue box, the plant in the corner, and my water bottle.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, how would you rate your distress level?",
    "Client: It's coming down. Maybe a 60 now? I feel... drained, but also a bit lighter? Like I've let something go.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've done some hard work today. How are you feeling about the session?",
    "Client: It was tough. Really tough. But... I think it was good? I haven't let myself think about that day in so much detail before. It's always been this big, scary thing in my mind, but talking through it... it's still scary, but it feels more manageable somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Sarah. Remember, healing takes time. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I just... I want to thank you. For guiding me through this. For helping me face it. I know we have more work to do, but for the first time in a long while, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can get past this.",
    "Therapist: You're very welcome, Sarah. You've shown incredible strength today. Let's end our session here and discuss how you're feeling overall."
