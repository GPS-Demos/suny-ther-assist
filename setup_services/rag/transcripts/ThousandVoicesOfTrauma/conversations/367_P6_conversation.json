    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your current SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10. My heart's beating a little faster than usual.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and recall the memory we discussed. Describe what you see.",
    "Client: I'm back in my childhood home. It's dark, and I'm alone in my room. I can hear my parents arguing downstairs. The shouting is getting louder, and I'm curling up in my bed, trying to block it out.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, and I'm starting to feel scared, just like I did back then. The loneliness is overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. I can feel my hands shaking a little.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Stay with the memory. What happens next?",
    "Client: The arguing stops suddenly, and I hear a door slam. Then there's just... silence. It's almost worse than the shouting. I'm too afraid to go downstairs and see what happened. I feel so helpless and abandoned.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's about a 7. My throat feels constricted, and I'm fighting back tears.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to cry if you need to. Keep going with the memory.",
    "Client: I... I eventually fall asleep, but when I wake up in the morning, my dad is gone. My mom is sitting at the kitchen table, looking blank. She doesn't even acknowledge me when I come in. It's like I'm invisible.",
    "Therapist: That must have been so difficult. What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's an 8 now. I feel a deep ache in my chest, and my breathing is shallow. It's like I'm right back there, feeling so small and unimportant.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it.",
    "Client: As the day goes on, mom just... she just sits there. She doesn't make me breakfast or ask about school. I have to fend for myself. I remember feeling so confused and hurt. Why wasn't she taking care of me? Didn't she love me?",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My SUDS is still at an 8. I feel a mix of sadness and anger. My stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What happens next in the memory?",
    "Client: Days go by, and it's like I don't exist. Mom barely speaks, and when she does, it's short and cold. I start to believe that I must have done something wrong, that it's my fault dad left and mom is acting this way.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually gone down a bit. Maybe a 7. I still feel sad, but there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe understanding? I can see now that my mom was probably depressed.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. How does that realization affect you?",
    "Client: It's bittersweet. I wish she could have been there for me, but I understand she was struggling too. My chest feels less tight, but there's still a heaviness.",
    "Therapist: What's your current SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6 now. I feel drained, but also a bit relieved to have talked through this.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. How do you feel about ending the exercise?",
    "Client: I think I'm ready to stop. It was hard, but I feel like I've processed some of those old feelings.",
    "Therapist: Well done. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we wrap up."
