    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Can you describe the combat experience you mentioned?",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. It was during my second tour in Afghanistan. We were on patrol in a small village. The air was thick with dust, and the heat was unbearable. I remember feeling on edge, like something wasn't right.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there was an explosion. The sound was deafening, and I felt the ground shake beneath my feet. I was thrown back, and for a moment, everything went black. When I came to, I could hear screaming and gunfire all around me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see chaos. Smoke everywhere. My ears are ringing, and I can taste blood in my mouth. I'm trying to get up, but my body feels heavy. I see one of my squad members lying motionless nearby.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I crawl towards him, my heart pounding. I can feel the gravel digging into my palms and knees. As I get closer, I realize... he's not moving. There's so much blood. I... I can't...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I feel so helpless. I want to save him, but I know it's too late. I can hear more explosions in the distance, and gunfire is getting closer. I'm torn between staying with my fallen comrade and finding cover.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I make the decision to move. It feels like I'm abandoning him, but I know I have to survive. I drag myself behind a nearby wall, my hands shaking as I try to ready my weapon. The guilt is overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're doing great.",
    "Client: The guilt... it's crushing. I can hear more of my team calling out, some in pain, others giving orders. I want to help them, but I'm frozen. I can smell the smoke, the gunpowder, and... and the blood. It's making me nauseous.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I finally manage to peek around the corner. I see more of my team taking cover, returning fire. There are civilians running, screaming. A child is crying nearby. I want to help, but I'm paralyzed with fear. I feel so ashamed.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I close my eyes, trying to steady my breathing. When I open them again, I see one of my teammates gesturing frantically at me. He's yelling something, but I can't hear him over the chaos. Suddenly, I see a flash of movement to my right.",
    "Therapist: Stay with the memory. What do you do?",
    "Client: I react instinctively, raising my weapon and firing. Time seems to slow down. I see the person fall. It's... it's not an enemy combatant. It's a civilian. An old man. Oh God... what have I done?",
    "Therapist: This is difficult, but you're handling it well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I can't breathe. The reality of what I've just done hits me like a physical blow. I want to run to him, to help him, but I can't move. I'm vaguely aware of my team advancing, securing the area, but all I can focus on is the old man's body.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... devastated. Guilty. Angry at myself, at the situation, at the war. I keep replaying that moment in my head, wondering if I could have done something differently. The image of that old man haunts me. I can't shake it.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The rest of that day is a blur. I remember being pulled back to base, debriefed. But I felt numb, disconnected. That night, I couldn't sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw his face. I still see it sometimes, even now.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength today. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. Talking about it brings back all those emotions - the fear, the guilt, the helplessness. But there's also a small sense of... I don't know, maybe relief? Like I've been carrying this alone for so long, and now I've finally shared it.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. You've done well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to talk about, but I think... I think it might be helping. I've never really told anyone all the details before. It's always been too painful. But being able to say it out loud, to really confront those memories... it's difficult, but maybe it's a step towards healing?",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. We'll end here for today."
