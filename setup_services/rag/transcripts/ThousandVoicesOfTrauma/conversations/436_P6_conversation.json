    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that moment.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm sitting at my computer, scrolling through social media. Suddenly, I see a post about my son. It's... it's mocking him. Making fun of the way he died. I feel my heart racing, my palms are sweating. I can't believe someone would do this.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: It's about a 6. I'm feeling angry and hurt.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: I'm reading the comments. People are laughing, sharing it. I feel so powerless. My son isn't here to defend himself. I want to scream at them, but I know it won't help. My chest feels tight, like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to an 8. I'm feeling overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm trying to report the post, but my hands are shaking. I can't seem to click the right buttons. I feel so useless. Why can't I protect him, even now? I'm his father, I should be able to do something.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's still at an 8. My mouth is dry, and I feel like I might be sick.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: I finally manage to report the post, but I know it might not do any good. I'm imagining my son's face if he could see this. He was always so sensitive. This would have crushed him. I feel like I've failed him all over again.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually dropped to a 7. I'm still upset, but talking about it... it helps somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this. Keep going.",
    "Client: I shut down the computer. I can't bear to look anymore. But the images, the comments, they're stuck in my head. I want to call my wife, but I don't want to upset her too. I feel so alone with this pain.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's back up to an 8. I'm feeling really isolated right now.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're doing great. Continue.",
    "Client: I'm pacing around the room now. I can't sit still. I'm angry at the world, at the people who did this, at myself for not being able to stop it. I keep thinking about all the times I should have been there for my son when he was alive. Maybe if I had been a better father, this wouldn't have happened.",
