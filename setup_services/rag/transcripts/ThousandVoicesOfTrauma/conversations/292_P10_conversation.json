    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is dreading it. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. How distressed are you right now, 0 to 100?",
    "Client: Um... probably around a 40? I'm anxious, but not panicking or anything.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I think so. Yeah, let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm walking home from the bus stop. It's late afternoon, maybe around 5 PM. The sun is starting to set, and the streets are getting busy with people heading home from work.",
    "Therapist: Good. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I can hear cars honking, people talking as they walk past. There's a slight chill in the air, and I'm pulling my jacket closer around me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm approaching the corner of 5th and Main. That's when I hear... oh God, I hear shouting. Angry voices. My heart starts racing.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe 60? I feel my palms getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What do you see happening?",
    "Client: I see two men arguing. They're standing close to each other, faces red with anger. One of them shoves the other, hard. I freeze, not sure what to do.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The man who got shoved, he... he pulls something out of his pocket. It glints in the streetlight. A knife. Oh God, I can't... I can't watch this.",
    "Therapist: Sarah, you're safe here. This is just a memory. Take another deep breath. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 80 now. My heart is pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Can you tell me what happens next?",
    "Client: The man with the knife, he lunges forward. There's a scuffle, and then... then there's blood. So much blood. People are screaming, running. I can't move. I'm just standing there, watching it all happen.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you feeling in that moment?",
    "Client: I'm terrified. I feel helpless, like I should do something but I can't. My legs won't move. I'm shaking all over.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. What happens after that?",
    "Client: Someone calls the police. I hear sirens in the distance. The man who was stabbed, he's on the ground. There's a pool of blood spreading around him. The other man is just standing there, looking shocked.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel sick to my stomach. My SUDS is probably 90 now. Can we... can we stop for a moment?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take a few deep breaths. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: (Takes several deep breaths) Okay... okay, I think I can continue.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Sarah. When you're ready, tell me what happens next.",
    "Client: The police arrive. Everything becomes chaotic. They're pushing people back, setting up a perimeter. An ambulance shows up. I'm still just standing there, frozen.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"This can't be real. This isn't happening.\" But it is. I feel so... so powerless. Like the world isn't safe anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction to witnessing violence. How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's still high, maybe 85. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. You're doing great. What happens after the police arrive?",
    "Client: They start questioning people. Someone points at me, tells them I saw everything. An officer approaches me. I can barely speak. My voice is shaking as I try to explain what I saw.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel as you're talking to the officer?",
    "Client: Overwhelmed. Scared. I keep replaying the moment of the stabbing in my head. I feel like I'm going to throw up.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What happens after you talk to the officer?",
    "Client: They let me go home. I walk the rest of the way in a daze. Everything feels surreal, like I'm watching myself from outside my body. When I get home, I just... I just break down. I can't stop crying.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Sarah. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My SUDS is still around 80. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved to have talked about it?",
    "Therapist: That's good. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you name five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: Um... I see the clock on the wall, your bookshelf, the plant in the corner, the window, and the painting above your desk.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Now, can you tell me how this memory has affected your daily life since it happened?",
    "Client: I've been having nightmares. I avoid that street now, even though it means a longer walk home. I jump at loud noises, and I'm always scanning my surroundings for potential threats. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. These are common reactions to trauma. How do you feel about having shared this memory today?",
    "Client: It was hard, really hard. But... I don't know, maybe a bit cathartic? Like I've been carrying this weight around, and now I've set it down for a moment.",
    "Therapist: That's a great insight, Sarah. How would you rate your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's come down some. Maybe around 60?",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. Remember, it's normal for the distress to linger. What we're doing is helping your brain process this memory in a safe environment. How do you feel about trying this again in our next session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm nervous about it, but I think I can do it. It wasn't easy, but I feel like I've accomplished something today.",
    "Therapist: You absolutely have. You've shown a lot of courage. For next time, I'd like you to practice some of the breathing exercises we've discussed. How does that sound?",
    "Client: I can do that. I think it'll help me feel more prepared.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's end our session here. You've done incredibly well today, Sarah. How are you feeling as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm tired, but... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful? Like maybe I can get through this.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude to have. Remember, healing takes time, but you're making progress. I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. See you then."
