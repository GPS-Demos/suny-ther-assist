    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. That memory of being in the hospital during the hostage situation... it's so vivid. I can still hear the shouting, the alarms... (takes a deep breath) It's like I was right back there.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. What stood out most?",
    "Client: The fear. It was overwhelming. I remember thinking, \"This is it. I'm going to die here.\" The uncertainty of not knowing what would happen next... it was paralyzing. And the guilt... (voice breaks) I keep thinking about the other patients who couldn't move, who were even more vulnerable than I was.",
    "Therapist: How does reflecting on this memory feel different now?",
    "Client: It's... strange. It's still painful, but there's a part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like, I survived that. I'm here now, talking about it. That's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much this experience has affected my daily life. The hypervigilance, always scanning for threats... it makes sense now. And the nightmares... they're not just random. They're my brain trying to process this trauma.",
    "Therapist: How does this awareness impact you?",
    "Client: It's... oddly comforting, in a way. Like, there's a reason for how I've been feeling. It's not just me being \"weak\" or \"overreacting.\" This was a real, terrifying experience, and my reactions are... normal, I guess?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How might this change things?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I can be a bit kinder to myself? And possibly... I don't know, maybe start reclaiming some of the things I've been avoiding? Like, I haven't been to a hospital since then, even for check-ups. But now I'm wondering if I could try, with support.",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's scary, but... I want to keep going. I want my life back. And for the first time in a while, I feel like that might actually be possible. It's not going to be easy, but... I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. What's one thing you'll take from today?",
    "Client: I think... the realization that I'm not alone in this. That what I'm experiencing makes sense given what I went through. And that there's hope. It's a small spark, but it's there.",
    "Therapist: That's beautiful. How will you care for yourself today?",
    "Client: I think I'll call my partner, share a bit about this session if I can. And maybe take a walk in the park... I've been avoiding open spaces, but I miss nature. Baby steps, right?",
    "Therapist: Sounds perfect. You've done great work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's tough, but... I'm grateful for this space to process everything. See you next week?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Take care."
