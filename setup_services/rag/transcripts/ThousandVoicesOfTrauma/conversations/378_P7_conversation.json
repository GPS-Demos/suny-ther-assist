    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the hostage situation?",
    "Client: Okay... I was at the bank, just a regular day. I remember walking in and noticing how quiet it was. There were only a few other customers. I was at the counter when suddenly there was a loud bang. I turned around and saw three men with masks, holding guns. My heart started racing immediately.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: One of them shouted for everyone to get down on the ground. I was frozen for a moment, but then I dropped to the floor. I could hear people crying and whimpering around me. The robbers were yelling at the tellers to open the safe. I remember the cold tile against my cheek as I lay there, trying to make myself as small as possible.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I... I was so scared. I kept thinking about my family, wondering if I'd ever see them again. One of the robbers came over to where we were lying and started demanding our valuables. When he got to me, I could smell his breath - it was like stale cigarettes. My hands were shaking so badly as I tried to take off my watch and give him my wallet.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The waiting felt endless. I could hear sirens in the distance, and the robbers started to panic. They were arguing among themselves about what to do next. One of them grabbed a young woman near me and pulled her up, using her as a shield. She was sobbing, and I felt so helpless. I wanted to do something, but I was paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there was a commotion at the front of the bank. The police had arrived. Everything happened so fast after that. There was shouting, gunshots... I curled up into a ball, covering my head with my arms. I could hear glass shattering and people screaming. I was sure I was going to die.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: When it was finally over, and the police were helping us up, I couldn't stop shaking. My legs felt like jelly. I remember looking around at the chaos - overturned furniture, broken glass everywhere. The young woman who had been taken as a shield was being comforted by an officer. I felt this overwhelming sense of relief mixed with disbelief. I couldn't believe I had survived.",
    "Therapist: You did survive. You're here now.",
    "Client: In the days after, I couldn't sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw those masked men. I kept reliving those terrifying moments over and over. I was jumpy at every loud noise. I couldn't bring myself to go back to that bank - or any bank, really. It's been years, but sometimes I still have nightmares about it.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I know I'm safe now, but sometimes it doesn't feel that way. I find myself constantly scanning my surroundings, always on edge. I hate feeling this way. I want to be able to go about my day without this constant fear hanging over me.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. You're making progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to talk about this, but I know it's necessary. I want to move past this, to not let that day control my life anymore. But it's so difficult. Sometimes I feel like I'll never be the same person I was before it happened.",
    "Therapist: Change is possible. You're doing the work.",
    "Client: I hope so. I really do. I want to be able to walk into a bank without my heart racing. I want to stop flinching at loud noises. I want to feel safe again. It's just... it's a long journey, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: It is, but you're not alone. Let's continue."
