    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Johnson. I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares about the hurricane lately, and I'm not sure I'm ready to talk about it in detail.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's discuss the plan for today's session.",
    "Client: Okay... What exactly are we going to do? You mentioned something about imaginal exposure last time, but I'm not really sure what that means.",
    "Therapist: It's a technique to help process your traumatic memories. Can you share your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about reliving the whole experience. What if I panic? Or what if it makes everything worse? I've been trying so hard to avoid thinking about it, and now you want me to do the opposite?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. This process can be challenging, but it's effective. How do you feel about trying?",
    "Client: I... I guess I'm willing to give it a shot. But I'm still scared. Can you tell me more about what to expect? Will you be there the whole time?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'll guide you through the entire process. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Um, how long will it take? And what exactly am I supposed to do? Do I just start talking about what happened during the hurricane?",
    "Therapist: We'll spend about 30-45 minutes on the exercise. You'll describe the event in detail, in present tense.",
    "Client: Present tense? That sounds intense. I'm not sure I can do that without breaking down. What if I can't handle it?",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel emotional. We can take breaks if needed. Your safety is my priority.",
    "Client: Okay, that's reassuring. I appreciate that. I guess I'm just worried about opening this can of worms. Once I start talking about it, will I be able to stop thinking about it?",
    "Therapist: It's a common concern. Remember, facing the memory helps reduce its power over time.",
    "Client: That makes sense, I suppose. It's just hard to believe right now. So, after we do this, will I feel better immediately?",
    "Therapist: Improvement is gradual. You might feel emotional initially, but it typically eases with repeated sessions.",
    "Client: I see. That's good to know. I'm still nervous, but I think I understand the process better now. Is there anything I should do to prepare myself before we start?",
    "Therapist: Just try to relax. We'll go at your pace. Your courage in facing this is commendable.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Johnson. That means a lot. I'm glad you'll be here with me through this. I think... I think I'm ready to try. Can we start now, or do we need to do anything else first?",
    "Therapist: We can start now. Remember, you're in control. Let's begin when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm as ready as I'll ever be, I guess. Should I close my eyes? Where should I start in the story?",
    "Therapist: Eyes open or closed, whatever feels comfortable. Start from the beginning of the event.",
    "Client: Alright. Here goes... (takes a deep breath) I'm in my apartment. It's early morning, and the hurricane warnings have been blaring all night..."
