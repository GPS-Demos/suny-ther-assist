    "Therapist: Good morning, Mr. Johnson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Morning, Dr. Adams. I'm... well, I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. I know we've been building up to this, but the idea of reliving that day in prison... it's daunting.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: It's just... being locked up was bad enough the first time. The thought of going back there, even in my mind, makes my heart race. I lost so much time, missed my sister's final moments. What if I can't handle reliving it?",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: I know, logically. But emotionally, it's a different story. I've spent years trying to forget, and now we're deliberately bringing it all back. It feels counterintuitive.",
    "Therapist: I hear you. How about we discuss the purpose of this exercise?",
    "Client: Please do. I need to understand why we're doing this if I'm going to go through with it.",
    "Therapist: It's to process the trauma and reduce its power over you.",
    "Client: Reduce its power? That sounds... well, it sounds good, but how exactly does reliving it accomplish that?",
    "Therapist: By facing it in a safe environment, we can change how your brain processes the memory.",
    "Client: I see. So, it's like... rewiring my brain's response to the memory? That makes sense, I suppose. But what if I get overwhelmed during the process?",
    "Therapist: I'll be here to guide and support you throughout. We can pause anytime.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I appreciate your patience with me, Dr. Adams. I know I'm not the easiest patient. This whole process... it's bringing up a lot of emotions I've kept buried for years.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Shall we set some expectations for today's session?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think having a clear idea of what's coming might help calm my nerves a bit.",
    "Therapist: You may experience strong emotions. This is normal and part of the healing process.",
    "Client: Strong emotions... I'm used to those. But I'm worried about losing control. What if I can't pull myself back out of the memory?",
    "Therapist: I'll be here to ground you. We have techniques to help you stay present.",
    "Client: Okay, that's good to know. I trust you, Dr. Adams. You've been incredibly helpful so far. I just... I want to get better, to move past this. But it's scary facing it head-on like this.",
    "Therapist: Your willingness to engage is a significant step towards healing. Any other questions?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Just one last thing - if this doesn't work, if I can't do it, what then?",
    "Therapist: There's no failure here. Every attempt is progress. We'll adjust as needed.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Adams. That takes some of the pressure off. I appreciate your understanding and support. I guess... I guess we should get started then?",
    "Therapist: When you're ready. Remember, you're in control. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do this. I'm nervous, but I'm also... hopeful. For the first time in a long while, I feel like there might be a way forward. Thank you for guiding me through this."
