    "Therapist: Welcome, Rajesh. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's begin. Close your eyes and recall the accident.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in my car, driving home from work. It's late evening, and the roads are quiet. I can see the streetlights reflecting off the wet pavement. I'm tired after a long day, but looking forward to getting home. Suddenly, I see headlights coming towards me, swerving... they're on the wrong side of the road...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: Um, about a 4 out of 10. I'm feeling tense, but it's manageable.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue.",
    "Client: The car is getting closer, and I realize it's not going to correct its course. I try to swerve, but it's too late. There's a deafening crash, and I feel a sharp pain in my chest. The airbag deploys, and I can't breathe. I'm gasping for air, and there's a metallic taste in my mouth. I think it's blood. I'm trying to move, but I'm trapped. I can hear people shouting outside, but it sounds distant and muffled.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 7. My heart is racing, and I feel like I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm drifting in and out of consciousness. I hear sirens in the distance. Someone's talking to me through the window, telling me to stay awake. But I'm so tired, and everything hurts. I'm scared I might die. The paramedics arrive and start cutting me out of the car. The sound of metal being torn apart is horrifying. They're asking me questions, but I can barely speak. I'm placed on a stretcher and loaded into the ambulance. The lights are so bright, and I'm shivering uncontrollably.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. I feel like I'm back there. My chest feels tight, and I'm sweating.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're here with me, safe.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) In the hospital, everything's a blur of bright lights and urgent voices. I'm in so much pain. They're cutting off my clothes, attaching monitors, inserting IVs. I hear them say something about internal bleeding and broken ribs. I'm terrified. I keep thinking about my family, wondering if I'll ever see them again. The doctors are talking about emergency surgery. I'm wheeled into the operating room, and the anesthesiologist tells me to count backward from 10. I only make it to 8 before everything goes black.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still an 8. My hands are shaking, and I feel nauseous.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (breathes deeply) When I wake up, I'm in the ICU. There are tubes and wires everywhere. I can't move, and it hurts to breathe. The doctor tells me I almost didn't make it. I had severe internal injuries and lost a lot of blood. They had to remove my spleen. I'm told I'll need months of recovery and physical therapy. I feel so helpless and scared about the future. Will I ever be the same? Will I be able to work again? The pain is constant, and I'm haunted by flashbacks of the accident.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down to a 6. I feel drained, but talking about it is helping.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to talk about, but I feel a bit lighter now.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's end here. How do you feel?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but relieved. It's getting easier each time.",
    "Therapist: Excellent work today, Rajesh. We'll continue next session."
