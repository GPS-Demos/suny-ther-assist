    "Therapist: Good morning, Mr. Gonzalez. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Buenos d\u00edas, Dr. Thompson. I'm... okay, I guess. The pain in my back is acting up a bit today, and I didn't sleep well last night. I kept having these... flashes, you know? Of the things we've been talking about.",
    "Therapist: I'm sorry to hear that. Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Imaginal exposure? I'm not sure I understand what that means. It sounds... intimidating. Can you explain it to me?",
    "Therapist: Of course. It's a technique where you'll revisit your traumatic memories in a safe environment.",
    "Client: Revisit them? I... I don't know if I can do that. Just thinking about it makes my heart race. What if I lose control?",
    "Therapist: Your reaction is normal. We'll go at your pace, and I'll be here to support you throughout.",
    "Client: I appreciate that, but... it's been so long since I left the cult. I've tried so hard to forget everything that happened there, especially... especially the abuse. What if bringing it all up again makes things worse?",
    "Therapist: I understand your concern. This process can actually help reduce your PTSD symptoms over time.",
    "Client: Really? How does that work? It seems counterintuitive to me.",
    "Therapist: By facing these memories, we can process them and reduce their power over you.",
    "Client: I see. It's just... I've never talked about this with anyone before. Not even my late wife knew the full extent of what happened. I'm scared of what might come out.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. We'll take it step by step. How are you feeling about trying?",
    "Client: I'm terrified, to be honest. But I trust you, Dr. Thompson. And I'm tired of these memories controlling my life. If this can help... I want to try. What should I expect?",
    "Therapist: You might experience strong emotions. That's normal and part of the healing process.",
    "Client: Strong emotions? Like what? Anger? Sadness? I'm worried about breaking down completely.",
    "Therapist: All of those are possible. Remember, you're safe here, and we can pause anytime.",
    "Client: Okay. I appreciate that. It's comforting to know we can stop if it gets too intense. How long will this process take?",
    "Therapist: It varies for each person. We'll go at your pace and adjust as needed.",
    "Client: Alright. I'm nervous, but I think I'm ready to give it a try. Where do we start?",
    "Therapist: We'll begin with a specific memory. Choose one you feel ready to explore.",
    "Client: I... there's one that's been haunting me lately. It was my first day in the compound. I think that might be a good place to start. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: That's perfect. We'll start there. Remember to breathe and stay present.",
    "Client: Okay. I'll do my best. Thank you for guiding me through this, Dr. Thompson. It means a lot to have your support.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your resilience is inspiring. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do this. I'm as ready as I'll ever be."
