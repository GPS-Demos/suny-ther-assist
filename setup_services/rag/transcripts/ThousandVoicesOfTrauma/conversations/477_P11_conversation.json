    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's always hard to go back there, you know? To that moment when the car came out of nowhere. My heart's still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you this time?",
    "Client: The sounds. God, the sounds were so vivid. The screeching tires, the crunch of metal... It's like I was right back there on that street corner. I could even smell the burning rubber. It's funny, I don't usually remember the smells, but this time it was so strong.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to experience those sensations again?",
    "Client: Terrifying, at first. I felt that same panic rising in my chest. But... but then something changed. I realized I was here, safe in this room with you. It was like I could observe the memory without being completely consumed by it. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. That's a significant step, Sarah.",
    "Client: Really? I mean, I still felt scared, but it wasn't as overwhelming as before. I kept reminding myself that I survived, that I'm here now. It's just... it's hard to reconcile that person in the memory with who I am now, you know?",
    "Therapist: How do you see the difference between those two versions of yourself?",
    "Client: Well, the Sarah in the memory feels so... vulnerable. Helpless. But now, even though I'm still dealing with this, I feel... stronger, I guess? Like I'm facing it head-on instead of running away. It's exhausting, but also... empowering, in a way.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How does this relate to your daily life?",
    "Client: I've noticed I'm less jumpy when I'm out walking now. I used to flinch at every car horn or sudden noise. It's still there, but... muted? Like, I can remind myself that not every sound means danger. It's a work in progress, but I feel like I'm slowly reclaiming my life.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress, Sarah. What's helping you most?",
    "Client: These sessions, definitely. And... well, I've started journaling after our exposures. Writing down what I remember, how I felt. It helps me process things, see patterns. Sometimes I surprise myself with what comes out on the page.",
    "Therapist: That's a great strategy. How else has this impacted your life?",
    "Client: I... I called my daughter yesterday. We haven't spoken much since... well, you know. I've been pushing everyone away. But after our last session, I felt... ready? To try reconnecting. It was awkward, but good. She seemed happy I called.",
    "Therapist: That's a big step. How do you feel about it?",
    "Client: Nervous, but hopeful. I've missed her. Missed everyone, really. I think I'm starting to see that isolating myself isn't the answer. It's scary to be vulnerable again, but... I want my life back. My relationships.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's your next step?",
    "Client: I'm thinking of joining that support group you mentioned. The idea of talking to others who've been through similar experiences... it's intimidating, but I think it could be helpful. And maybe... maybe I'll invite my daughter for coffee next week. Baby steps, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're making great progress, Sarah.",
    "Client: Thanks. It doesn't always feel like it, but... I guess I am. There are still bad days, nightmares... but I'm starting to have more good moments too. I'm learning to appreciate those more.",
    "Therapist: That's an important shift. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For guiding me through this. I know we have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like there's light at the end of the tunnel. It's dim, but it's there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work, Sarah. See you next week?",
    "Client: Definitely. I'll be here."
