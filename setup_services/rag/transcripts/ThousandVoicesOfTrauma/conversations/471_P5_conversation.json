    "Therapist: Welcome back, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been thinking a lot about our last session and the idea of this imaginal exposure thing. It's been making me anxious.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's talk through it.",
    "Client: Yeah, I'd appreciate that. I mean, I know we've discussed it before, but the idea of deliberately reliving those experiences... it's scary. I've spent so long trying to forget, you know? And now you're asking me to remember in detail. It feels counterintuitive.",
    "Therapist: I hear your concerns. Shall we review the purpose?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think I need a reminder of why we're doing this. It's just... the thought of going back there, even in my mind, it makes my heart race.",
    "Therapist: The goal is to process the trauma, reducing its power over you.",
    "Client: I understand that in theory, but... how does reliving it help? Won't it just make everything worse? I'm worried I'll fall apart or have a panic attack or something.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel anxious. We'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: Okay... that's somewhat reassuring. Can you tell me more about what exactly will happen during the exposure? Like, what am I supposed to do?",
    "Therapist: You'll describe the traumatic event in detail, in present tense.",
    "Client: In the present tense? As if it's happening right now? That sounds... intense. Will you be guiding me through it, or am I just supposed to talk?",
    "Therapist: I'll be here, supporting you throughout. We can pause anytime.",
    "Client: That's good to know. I'm still nervous, but knowing I can stop if it gets too much helps. How long will this last? And... will we be doing this multiple times?",
    "Therapist: About 30-45 minutes. We'll repeat in future sessions to reduce distress.",
    "Client: Okay. I think I can handle that. It's just... this is about the physical abuse, right? But lately, I've been thinking a lot about the racial aspects of what happened. How it wasn't just violence, but... targeted because of who I am. Can we address that too?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll incorporate all aspects of your experience.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot. I've never really talked about that part before. It's like... a double layer of trauma, you know? The physical pain and then the... the realization that it happened because of my race. It's been hard to process.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I'm still scared, but I think I'm ready to try. Or as ready as I'll ever be, anyway. Is there anything I should do to prepare myself before we start?",
    "Therapist: Just breathe deeply. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay. Deep breaths. I can do that. And... thank you. For being patient with me, and for guiding me through this. I know it's not easy for you either, listening to these stories. I just want you to know I'm grateful.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. Let's do this before I lose my nerve. I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Just... please remind me that I'm safe if I start to panic, okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're safe here. Let's start slowly..."
