    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and take a deep breath. When you're ready, describe the car accident.",
    "Client: Okay... I was driving home from work. It was raining heavily. The windshield wipers were barely keeping up. I remember gripping the steering wheel tightly, leaning forward to see better. The road was slick, and I could feel my tires struggling for traction.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: Suddenly, I saw headlights coming towards me. They were in my lane. I panicked. My heart started racing. I tried to swerve, but the car wouldn't respond. It was like everything was moving in slow motion. I could hear the screeching of tires, and then...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The impact was deafening. Metal crunching, glass shattering. My body jerked violently. The airbag deployed, hitting me in the face. I tasted blood. The car was spinning, and I couldn't control it. When it finally stopped, everything was silent except for the rain and my own gasping breaths.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I... I feel scared. My heart is pounding, just like it did then. My hands are shaking. It's hard to breathe.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: I remember being trapped in the car. The door was jammed, and my leg was pinned under the dashboard. I could smell gasoline and burning rubber. I was terrified the car might explode. I tried to call for help, but my phone had been thrown somewhere during the crash. I felt so helpless, so alone.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: I don't know how long I was there. It felt like hours. I kept drifting in and out of consciousness. The pain in my leg was excruciating. Every time I moved, it sent shockwaves through my body. I remember thinking about my family, wondering if I'd ever see them again.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... overwhelmed. My chest feels tight. I can almost smell the gasoline again. It's like I'm back there.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're safe here. Take another deep breath.",
    "Client: Eventually, I heard sirens. The relief was indescribable. I saw flashing lights, and then firefighters were there, talking to me, trying to keep me calm. They had to use the jaws of life to get me out. The sound of metal being torn apart was terrifying. When they finally pulled me out, the cold rain hit my face. I remember looking up at the sky, feeling the raindrops, and just being grateful to be alive.",
    "Therapist: You've done an excellent job. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel drained, but also... lighter somehow. Like I've released something that's been bottled up inside me for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. You've shown great courage.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to talk about, but I think it's getting easier. I used to avoid thinking about the accident at all costs, but now... I feel like I can face it. It's still scary, but it doesn't control me like it used to.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. You should be proud.",
    "Client: I am. I mean, I still have a long way to go, but I feel like I'm finally moving forward. The nightmares aren't as frequent, and I've even started driving short distances again. It's not easy, but I'm doing it.",
    "Therapist: You're showing remarkable resilience. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: I'm nervous about it, but I'm also determined. I want my life back. I want to be able to drive without panicking, to not flinch every time I hear screeching tires. I know it won't be easy, but I'm ready to keep working on it.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. We'll take it step by step.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your support through all of this. It means a lot to have someone guiding me through these difficult memories and emotions. I know I have a supportive family, but there are some things I just can't share with them. They worry enough as it is.",
    "Therapist: It's my pleasure to support you. Let's wrap up for today.",
    "Client: Okay. I feel exhausted, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've accomplished something important. Thank you again for your help and patience.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Take care of yourself."
