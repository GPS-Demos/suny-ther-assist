    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Lee?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. It's like I'm back there, you know? The memory of that airplane crash... it's so vivid. I can still hear the screams, the metal tearing... (takes a deep breath) My heart is racing, and my palms are sweaty. It's like I'm reliving it all over again.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: Fear... overwhelming fear. I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. We were just falling from the sky, and there was nothing I could do. I... I remember gripping the armrests so tightly, my knuckles turned white. And the smell... the acrid smell of smoke and fear. It's making me nauseous just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you recall this?",
    "Client: Tense. Very tense. My shoulders are so tight, and there's this knot in my stomach. I feel like I can't breathe properly, like the air is too thin. It's... it's suffocating. And my legs... they feel weak, like they might give out if I try to stand.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"This is it. I'm going to die.\" Over and over. And then... guilt. Why did I survive when others didn't? I see their faces, you know? The people who didn't make it. They haunt me. I wonder about their families, their lives... (voice breaks) It's not fair. Why them and not me?",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts connect to your everyday life now?",
    "Client: I... I guess I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop. Every time I hear a loud noise or feel any kind of turbulence, even in a car, I panic. I can't fly anymore. I've missed family weddings, funerals... I feel so isolated. And the guilt... it affects everything. I feel like I don't deserve to be happy or enjoy life when others lost theirs.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm angry. Angry at the airline, at the pilots, at the weather... even at myself for choosing that flight. But mostly, I'm angry at how much this has changed me. I used to be carefree, you know? Now I'm always on edge, always expecting the worst. It's exhausting. And I feel... I feel old. Like this experience aged me beyond my years.",
    "Therapist: How does sharing this make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. Really hard. But also... I don't know, maybe a little relieving? Like I'm not carrying this burden alone anymore. I've never really talked about it in this much detail before. I always worried it would be too much for others to hear. But now... now I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can start to process this.",
    "Therapist: What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I... I think I need a moment. Just to breathe. To remind myself that I'm here, I'm safe. (takes several deep breaths) And maybe... maybe I need to start forgiving myself. For surviving, for struggling, for all of it. It's just... it's so hard to let go of the guilt and fear.",
    "Therapist: How might you start that process?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe by acknowledging that it wasn't my fault? That surviving doesn't make me a bad person? It's difficult to even say that out loud. But perhaps... perhaps I could start by doing something to honor those who didn't make it. A donation, or volunteering... something to give their loss meaning. And for myself... maybe it's time I talked to my family about this. Really talked. They've been so patient, but I've kept them at arm's length. I think... I think I'm ready to let them in.",
    "Therapist: What gives you hope moving forward?",
    "Client: Hope... (long pause) I suppose the fact that I'm here, talking about this. That's something, isn't it? A year ago, I couldn't even think about the crash without having a panic attack. Now... it's still painful, but I'm facing it. And... and I want to get better. I want to be able to travel again, to see my grandchildren overseas. I want to feel joy without guilt. That desire... that's my hope. It's small, but it's there.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel now, compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also lighter somehow. Like I've set down a heavy backpack I've been carrying for years. I'm exhausted, but there's a sense of... I don't know, maybe accomplishment? I faced this memory head-on today. It was terrifying, but I did it. And I'm still here. That... that means something, doesn't it?",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to work on strategies for managing my anxiety in everyday situations. The panic attacks, the constant worry... I want to learn how to control that better. And maybe... maybe we could talk more about how to reconnect with my family. I've pushed them away for so long, I'm not sure how to let them back in.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing, Mr. Lee. We'll end here for today.",
    "Client: Thank you, doctor. This was... difficult, but I think it was important. I... I appreciate your guidance through this. See you next week."
