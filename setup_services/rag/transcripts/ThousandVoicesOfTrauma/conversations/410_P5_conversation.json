    "Therapist: Hello Maria. Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Thompson. To be honest, I'm a bit nervous. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of revisiting those memories... it's scary. Can you tell me more about what we'll be doing exactly?",
    "Therapist: Of course. It's natural to feel apprehensive. Imaginal exposure involves recounting your trauma in detail. It helps process the memory.",
    "Client: I understand, but... won't that make things worse? I've spent so long trying to forget. The thought of deliberately bringing it all back up makes my stomach churn.",
    "Therapist: Your concern is valid. However, avoidance often prolongs suffering. This exercise aims to reduce symptoms over time.",
    "Client: I see. It's just... the idea of reliving that violence I witnessed as a child. It's overwhelming. What if I can't handle it? What if I break down completely?",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. I'll be here to support you throughout. Remember, you're safe now.",
    "Client: Okay... I appreciate that. Can you tell me more about what I might experience during this process? I want to be prepared.",
    "Therapist: You may feel intense emotions or physical sensations. This is normal. We'll work through them together.",
    "Client: That's a bit scary, but I guess it's part of the process. How long will each session last? And how many times will we need to do this?",
    "Therapist: Sessions typically last about 45 minutes. We'll likely have several, adjusting as needed based on your progress.",
    "Client: I see. It's a lot to take in. I'm trying to be brave, but part of me still wants to run away from all this. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Your feelings are valid. It takes courage to face trauma. You're showing strength by being here.",
    "Client: Thank you, that means a lot. I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be. What do you need me to do to start?",
    "Therapist: We'll begin with relaxation exercises. Then, you'll recount the memory in present tense, including sensory details.",
    "Client: Okay, I can try that. It's strange to think about deliberately bringing up these memories I've tried so hard to suppress. But if it will help in the long run, I'm willing to give it a shot. Is there anything else I should know before we begin?",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're in control. We can pause anytime. This process is about reclaiming your power.",
    "Client: That's comforting to know. I appreciate your guidance and support, Dr. Thompson. I'm nervous, but I'm also hopeful that this might finally help me move past these experiences. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable, Maria. We'll take it step by step. Are you ready to start our relaxation exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm taking deep breaths and trying to stay calm. Please guide me through it."
