    "Therapist: Welcome back. Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm... not sure. To be honest, I'm a bit anxious. The idea of revisiting those combat experiences... it's daunting. I've spent years trying to forget, you know?",
    "Therapist: Your anxiety is understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I worry that talking about it will make everything worse. What if I can't handle it? I've managed to keep it together all these years by not thinking about it. And... I'm not sure I want to remember all the details.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How about we discuss the purpose of this exercise?",
    "Client: Alright, I suppose that would help. I mean, I trust you, but I'm still apprehensive. It's not easy to face these things, especially at my age. I've been carrying this for so long.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Imaginal exposure helps process traumatic memories. It may be challenging but can reduce PTSD symptoms over time.",
    "Client: That sounds promising, but also scary. How exactly does it work? And what should I expect during the session?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the traumatic event in detail. I'll guide you through it. It might be emotionally intense, but I'll be here to support you.",
    "Client: Okay... that does sound intense. I'm worried about losing control or getting overwhelmed. My combat experiences were... well, they were pretty horrific. I've never really talked about them in detail before.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are normal. We'll go at your pace, and you can pause anytime. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's somewhat reassuring. I appreciate your patience with me. I guess I'm just worried about opening Pandora's box, you know? But if you think this will help... I'm willing to try.",
    "Therapist: Your willingness shows great courage. Remember, this is a step towards healing. Any other questions?",
    "Client: Yes, actually. After we do this, how will I feel? I mean, will I be okay to drive home? Will I be able to sleep that night? I live alone, and I'm a bit worried about how I'll cope afterwards.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel emotional after. We'll debrief and ensure you're grounded before leaving. Do you have support at home?",
    "Client: Not really. My spouse and I... we're separated. That's why I'm living alone now. It's been tough, dealing with all of this on my own. I guess that's part of why I'm here.",
    "Therapist: I see. Let's discuss some coping strategies for after our session. What usually helps you relax?",
    "Client: Well, I used to enjoy gardening. And sometimes I listen to classical music. But lately, I've been relying more on... well, substances. I know it's not healthy, but it numbs things for a while.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your honesty. Let's explore healthier alternatives. How about we create a post-session plan?",
    "Client: That sounds good. I'm willing to try anything that might help. I just want to feel... normal again, you know? To not be haunted by these memories all the time.",
    "Therapist: Your desire for change is powerful. Shall we begin the exposure exercise now?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm ready. Or as ready as I'll ever be. Just... please be patient with me if I struggle. This isn't easy for me.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Your bravery is commendable. Let's start slowly. Take a deep breath..."
