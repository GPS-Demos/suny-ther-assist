    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. The memory of that night in the ER, it just... it felt so real again. My heart's still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sounds, I think. The beeping of the machines, the rushed voices of the doctors. It's like I was right back there, you know? And the feeling of helplessness... God, I felt so small and scared.",
    "Therapist: Hmm. How did reliving that compare to your day-to-day experiences?",
    "Client: It was more intense, definitely. Usually, I can push those memories away, but here... it was like I couldn't escape it. But, um, I noticed something weird. Towards the end, it... it started to feel less overwhelming? Like, I was still there, but I could breathe a little easier.",
    "Therapist: Interesting observation. What do you make of that?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe it's because I knew I was safe here? Or because I've talked about it before? I don't know, it's confusing. Part of me feels stronger for having gone through it again, but another part just wants to curl up and cry.",
    "Therapist: Both reactions are valid. How might this relate to your overall recovery?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe it shows I'm making progress? Like, if I can face this memory and not completely fall apart, maybe I can handle other things too. But it's scary to think about doing this again. What if next time is worse?",
    "Therapist: That's a common concern. How have you handled challenges so far?",
    "Client: Well, I've been using those breathing exercises you taught me. They help sometimes. And I've been trying to talk to my friend more when I'm struggling instead of isolating myself. It's hard, but... I'm trying.",
    "Therapist: That's great. How else has this process affected you?",
    "Client: It's weird, but I feel like I understand myself better? Like, now I can see why certain things trigger me. And I'm starting to realize that what happened wasn't my fault. That's... that's big for me.",
    "Therapist: Indeed. What's next for you in this journey?",
    "Client: I... I think I want to keep going. It's tough, but I want my life back. Maybe next time we could... could we talk about how this affects my relationships? I've been avoiding dating because of all this.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll address that next session. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... okay. Better than I expected, actually. Thank you for being here with me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your courage is admirable. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yeah, see you then. Thanks again."
