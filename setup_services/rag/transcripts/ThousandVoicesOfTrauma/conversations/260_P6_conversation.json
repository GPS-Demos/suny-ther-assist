    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your baseline SUDS.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that memory.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Alright. I'm... I'm back in my childhood home. I can see the old wallpaper in the hallway, faded and peeling. The house feels so big and empty. I can hear my parents arguing in the kitchen. Their voices are getting louder, and I'm starting to feel scared.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. My heart is beating faster, and my palms are getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: Keep going. You're doing well.",
    "Client: The shouting is getting worse. I can hear things being thrown around. I'm hiding in my closet, trying to make myself as small as possible. The darkness feels suffocating, but I'm too afraid to come out. I can feel tears running down my face, and I'm struggling to breathe.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. I feel like I'm right back there, helpless and terrified.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: (Voice shaking) I can hear footsteps coming up the stairs. Heavy, angry footsteps. I'm praying they won't find me, but part of me wants to run out and make them stop fighting. My whole body is shaking, and I feel so cold.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's still an 8. Maybe even a 9. I feel like I'm going to be sick.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it.",
    "Client: (Sobbing) The door slams open, and I can see my father's silhouette. He's... he's shouting my name, telling me to come out. I'm frozen, I can't move. I can smell the alcohol on his breath even from here. I'm so scared he's going to hurt me.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: (Breathing heavily) It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7. I'm starting to remember that I'm here in the office, not back there.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're safe here. Continue.",
    "Client: I... I eventually came out of the closet. My mom was there too, crying. They both looked so broken. I remember feeling like I had to be the strong one, even though I was just a child. It's... it's fading now. The memory doesn't feel as vivid anymore.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5 now. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved?",
    "Therapist: That's common. How do you feel physically?",
    "Client: My heart rate is slowing down. I feel exhausted, like I've run a marathon. But the tightness in my chest is easing up.",
    "Therapist: Well done. Let's start grounding. Open your eyes when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Opens eyes slowly) That was... intense. But I got through it.",
    "Therapist: Yes, you did. Excellent work today."
