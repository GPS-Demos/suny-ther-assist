    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's strange, even though it happened years ago, going through it again in my mind feels so vivid. I can still hear the shouting, the panic in people's voices. It's like I'm right back there in that bank, watching everything unfold all over again.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The helplessness. I remember feeling so utterly powerless. There was this moment when one of the robbers grabbed a young woman, and I thought... I thought he was going to hurt her. I wanted to do something, anything, but I was frozen. I couldn't move, couldn't speak. It's frustrating to relive that paralysis.",
    "Therapist: How does that feeling of helplessness affect you now?",
    "Client: It... it still haunts me. Sometimes I find myself overcompensating, you know? I'm always on high alert in public places, always looking for exits, always watching people's hands. It's exhausting, but I can't seem to shake this need to be prepared, to not be caught off guard again.",
    "Therapist: I see. How did it feel to confront those memories today?",
    "Client: It was tough, really tough. But... there's also a part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like, I survived it once, and I survived reliving it just now. It's painful, but I'm still here, still fighting. That counts for something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm noticing that my hands are shaking a bit less now. When we started, I could barely hold a glass of water. Now, I feel like I'm coming back to the present. It's like... the memory is still there, but it's not consuming me entirely. Is that progress?",
    "Therapist: It certainly can be. How does this connect to your goals?",
    "Client: Well, I guess it ties into my goal of not letting this experience control my life anymore. Being able to recall it without completely falling apart... that feels like a step in the right direction. I want to be able to go to public places without constantly scanning for threats, to enjoy time with my grandkids without this dark cloud hanging over me.",
    "Therapist: Those are important goals. What's helping you work towards them?",
    "Client: Hmm... I think talking about it helps, as difficult as it is. And... and reminding myself that I'm safe now. That what happened was terrible, but it's over. I'm trying to use those grounding techniques we've practiced. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't, but I'm trying.",
    "Therapist: That's great, Sarah. How can we build on this for next time?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe we could work more on those moments where I felt most helpless? I think if I can tackle those head-on, it might help me feel more in control now. And perhaps we could spend some time on how to manage when I start feeling overwhelmed in public places? I'd really like to be able to go shopping or to a restaurant without feeling like I'm about to jump out of my skin.",
    "Therapist: Excellent ideas. Is there anything else you'd like to share?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm not alone in this anymore. And that... that means more than I can say.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Sarah. We'll continue this journey together."
