    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's strange, you know? I'm 66 years old, and here I am, still affected by something that happened decades ago. The memory of that workplace bullying... it just feels so fresh. I can still hear my coworker's mocking tone, see the smirks on the faces of the others. It's like I'm right back there in that office, feeling small and powerless all over again.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most to you this time?",
    "Client: (sighs) The overwhelming sense of isolation. I remember looking around the room, hoping someone would speak up, but everyone just averted their eyes. It was like I was invisible, or worse, like I deserved it. I've built a successful business since then, but in that moment, I felt... God, I felt worthless.",
    "Therapist: How does that compare to how you feel now?",
    "Client: Well, logically, I know I'm not worthless. I've accomplished so much since then. But emotionally? There's still this... this little voice inside that whispers, \"Maybe they were right about you.\" It's frustrating, you know? To still be carrying this around after all these years.",
    "Therapist: That frustration is understandable. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm noticing that my hands are clenched tight. I didn't even realize I was doing that. And my breathing... it's like there's this weight on my chest. Is this... is this part of the PTSD you mentioned?",
    "Therapist: Yes, those can be physical manifestations of PTSD. How does recognizing that make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... oddly comforting, in a way. Like, there's a reason for what I'm experiencing. It's not just me being weak or oversensitive. But it's also scary. I've been carrying this for so long, what if I can't let it go?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How do you think this experience relates to your recovery goals?",
    "Client: I suppose... well, I want to be able to think about my career without this dark cloud hanging over it. I want to be able to mentor younger women in business without feeling like a fraud. And most of all, I want to stop letting these bullies from my past have any power over my present. This exposure... it's hard, but maybe it's a step towards that?",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful connection. What strategies helped you get through today's session?",
    "Client: I... I tried to remind myself that I'm safe now. That I'm not that vulnerable young woman anymore. And I kept focusing on my breathing, like you taught me. It helped a little, but it was still so overwhelming at times. I just... I wish I could go back and stand up for myself, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. How might you stand up for yourself now?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe by not letting this define me anymore? By recognizing that their actions say more about them than about me? It's easier said than done, though. But I'm here, aren't I? That's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Your commitment to this process is commendable. How are you feeling about continuing?",
    "Client: Scared, to be honest. But also... determined? Each session is difficult, but I feel like I'm uncovering pieces of myself that I've kept buried for too long. It's painful, but there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe hope? Like maybe I can finally put this to rest and move forward. I just... I hope I'm strong enough to see it through.",
    "Therapist: Your strength is evident in your willingness to confront this. What support do you need moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need reassurance that this is normal. That it's okay to still be affected by this after all these years. And maybe some more tools to help me when the memories feel overwhelming? Oh, and... (voice breaking) thank you. For listening. For not judging. It means more than you know.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your progress is remarkable. Shall we schedule our next session?",
    "Client: Yes, please. Same time next week? I... I think I'm ready to keep going. It's hard, but I think it's worth it. I want to be free of this, you know? To just be me, without all this baggage. Is that possible?",
    "Therapist: It's absolutely possible. Your dedication is key. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, I'll be here. Thank you again, Doctor. I'm... I'm glad I found you. This isn't easy, but I feel like I'm finally on the right path. I just hope I can keep this courage up for the next session."
