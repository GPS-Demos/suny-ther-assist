    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Um, to be honest, I'm a bit on edge. I know we're going to be talking about my aunt's illness, and... well, it's not easy.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yeah, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in the hospital corridor. It's so bright, and there's this antiseptic smell everywhere. I can hear the beeping of machines and distant voices. My hands are shaking as I approach her room.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I pause outside the door. My heart's racing. I'm terrified of what I'll see. But I take a deep breath and push the door open. And there she is... Aunt Lisa. She looks so small in that hospital bed.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... God, I feel like my chest is being crushed. She's so pale, and there are tubes everywhere. This can't be my vibrant, laughing Aunt Lisa. It's wrong, all wrong.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 70? It's pretty intense.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm walking towards her bed. My legs feel like lead. I can hear the rhythmic hiss of the ventilator. It's keeping her alive, but it's also a constant reminder that she can't breathe on her own. I reach out to touch her hand, and it's so cold. I... I start to cry.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: I'm holding her hand, and I'm talking to her. I don't even know if she can hear me, but I'm telling her how much I love her, how much I need her to get better. My voice is shaking, and I can taste the salt from my tears.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind at this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about all the times we spent together. How she taught me to bake cookies, how she'd always listen to my problems without judgment. And now... now she might never wake up. It's not fair. She doesn't deserve this.",
    "Therapist: Allow yourself to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I feel so helpless. The machines are beeping, and I know they're keeping her alive, but they're also a constant reminder that she's slipping away. I want to scream, to beg her to wake up, but I know it won't change anything.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's probably around 85. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Remember to breathe. What happens next?",
    "Client: A nurse comes in to check her vitals. She gives me a sympathetic look, and I hate it. I don't want sympathy; I want my aunt to be okay. The nurse adjusts something on one of the machines, and for a moment, I have this irrational hope that she's fixing everything. But nothing changes. Aunt Lisa is still lying there, unresponsive.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My stomach is in knots. I feel nauseous, and my hands are clammy. I can hear my own heartbeat pounding in my ears. It's like... like the whole world is closing in on me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I sit down in the chair next to her bed. Time seems to stretch on forever. I'm holding her hand, willing her to squeeze back, but there's nothing. Just the steady beep of the heart monitor. I start talking to her again, reminiscing about our favorite memories. Remember when we went to the beach last summer? Remember how you always burn the cookies but we eat them anyway?",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to share those memories?",
    "Client: It's... it's bittersweet. Part of me feels warm remembering those times, but it also makes the current situation even more painful. I'm scared that these might be the last memories we ever make together.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Emotionally drained. But also angry. Why her? Why now? She had so much life left to live.",
    "Therapist: Allow yourself to feel that anger. It's okay.",
    "Client: I... I want to punch something. I want to scream at the doctors to do more, even though I know they're doing everything they can. I feel so powerless.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 90 now. This is really intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm still sitting there, holding her hand. The day is turning to evening, and the room is getting darker. A doctor comes in to talk to me. He's explaining her condition, but his words sound muffled, like I'm underwater. All I can focus on is the rise and fall of her chest, wondering if each breath will be her last.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel like I'm drowning. Like the weight of the situation is crushing me. I want to run away, but I can't leave her. I won't leave her.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The night drags on. Nurses come and go. I doze off a few times, but every time I wake up, I'm hit with the reality of the situation all over again. It's like a punch to the gut each time. By morning, my eyes are swollen from crying, and I feel hollow inside.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. Emotionally and physically. But there's also this weird sense of... I don't know, maybe acceptance? Not that I've given up hope, but... I realize that no matter what happens, I'll have to find a way to keep going.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually down to about 65. I still feel awful, but talking through it... it helps, somehow.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well, Sarah. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end the exercise.",
    "Client: Okay... *deep breath* Thank you. This was tough, but... I think it was good to face it.",
    "Therapist: You showed great courage today. How are you feeling now that we've finished?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, but also a bit relieved. It's like I've been carrying this weight around, and now I've set it down for a moment. It's still there, but it feels a little lighter.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience after these sessions. What you're feeling is normal and part of the healing process.",
    "Client: Yeah... I can see that. It's strange, but I feel like I understand my emotions a bit better now. Like, I can separate them out and look at them more clearly.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress, Sarah. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I just... I want to thank you. For guiding me through this. It wasn't easy, but I feel like I've taken a step forward. Maybe next time we can talk about the day she... the day she passed. I'm not ready yet, but I think I will be soon.",
    "Therapist: You'll know when you're ready, and we'll take it at your pace. You've done great work today. Let's end with some grounding exercises to help you transition back to the present.",
    "Client: Okay, that sounds good. I'm ready."
