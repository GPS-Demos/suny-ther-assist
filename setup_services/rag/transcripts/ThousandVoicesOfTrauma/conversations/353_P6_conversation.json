    "Therapist: Okay, Carlos, we're going to start the imaginal exposure now. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I understand why we're doing this.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's begin. Close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) I'm... I'm in our old apartment. It's dark, and I can hear shouting from the next room. My parents are fighting again. I'm hiding in my closet, trying to make myself as small as possible.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, about a 4, I'd say.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The shouting is getting louder. I can hear things breaking. My heart is racing, and I'm starting to sweat. I want to cover my ears, but I'm also straining to hear what's happening. I'm so scared they'll find me.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's going up. Maybe a 6?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud crash. I hear my mom scream. I'm shaking uncontrollably now. I want to help her, but I'm frozen in fear. My chest feels tight, and I can barely breathe.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm really distressed. My SUDS is probably an 8. It feels so real, like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Carlos. Stay with it.",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) I hear footsteps coming closer. The closet door flies open, and there's my father, looming over me. His eyes are wild, and I can smell alcohol on his breath. I'm terrified he's going to hurt me too.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm about to panic.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Breathing heavily) He... he grabs my arm and yanks me out of the closet. I can see my mom on the floor in the living room. There's blood... I can't... I can't do this.",
    "Therapist: You can, Carlos. You're doing it right now. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: (Sobbing) He's yelling at me, telling me I'm weak for hiding. I can't look away from my mom. She's not moving. I think... I think she might be dead.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 10. I feel like I'm right there again.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: (Taking shaky breaths) I... I break free from his grip and run to my mom. She's breathing, but barely. I'm crying, begging her to wake up. My father just stands there, looking shocked. I hear sirens in the distance...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: The intensity is... it's starting to fade a bit. Maybe an 8?",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing it. Keep going.",
    "Client: The police arrive. Everything's a blur of lights and voices. They take my father away. I'm holding my mom's hand as the paramedics work on her. I feel... I feel so helpless and angry.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6, I think. I'm starting to feel more present in the room with you.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Carlos. Let's start wrapping up.",
    "Client: (Sighs) Okay. As I watch the ambulance drive away with my mom, I'm left standing there, feeling lost and alone. But there's also a small sense of relief that it's over.",

    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. My SUDS is down to a 4. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger?",

    "Therapist: We'll process this more next time. How about we do some grounding exercises?",
