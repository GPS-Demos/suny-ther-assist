    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Martha?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like my whole body is vibrating, but not in a good way. You know, it's strange because I thought I had put all of this behind me, but reliving that moment when Tom... when he first raised his hand to me... it's bringing back so many emotions I thought I'd buried.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What emotions are coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... shame? I feel this overwhelming sense of shame, like somehow it was my fault. I know logically it wasn't, but... God, why didn't I just leave the first time it happened? I feel so stupid, so weak.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave, Martha. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I can feel it pounding in my chest, just like it did back then. And my hands... they're clammy. I keep wanting to clench them into fists, like I'm ready to defend myself. It's ridiculous, isn't it? He's not even here, but my body is reacting like he could walk through that door any second.",
    "Therapist: That's a natural response. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep hearing his voice in my head. \"This is your fault, Martha. If you'd just listened to me...\" God, I believed him for so long. I thought if I could just be better, be perfect, he wouldn't get angry. But it was never enough, was it? No matter what I did, he always found a reason. I... I'm realizing now how much that affected me, even years later. I'm always trying to be perfect, always worried about making someone angry.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization make you feel?",
    "Client: Sad. Really, deeply sad. I've spent so much of my life trying to please others, always walking on eggshells. It's exhausting. But there's also... I don't know if this makes sense, but there's a little spark of anger too. Not at myself this time, but at Tom. He took so much from me, and I'm only now starting to understand how much.",
    "Therapist: That anger is important, Martha. Can you tell me more about it?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a fire in my belly. For so long, I was too scared to be angry. I thought anger was dangerous, that it would make me like him. But this doesn't feel dangerous. It feels... righteous, I guess? Like I have a right to be angry about what happened to me. I didn't deserve that treatment. No one does.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How does it feel to acknowledge that?",
    "Client: It's liberating, in a way. But also terrifying. If I accept that I didn't deserve it, that means... that means it really wasn't my fault. And that's a big thing to wrap my head around. I've spent so long blaming myself, it's almost comfortable. But maybe... maybe it's time to let that go.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight, Martha. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm noticing that my breathing has slowed down a bit. The shaking isn't as bad. It's like... by talking about it, by facing it head-on, it's losing some of its power over me. Don't get me wrong, it's still painful and scary, but it feels... I don't know, more manageable somehow?",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's hard. Really hard. But I think... I think I need to. For the first time in a long time, I feel like maybe I can actually move past this. Not forget it, but... not let it control me anymore. I want to keep going. I want to understand myself better, to stop being afraid all the time. I want to learn how to trust again, how to be in a relationship without constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop. Is that... is that possible?",
    "Therapist: It absolutely is. What gives you hope?",
    "Client: The fact that I'm here, I suppose. That I finally found the courage to talk about this. And... and the fact that I can feel things changing, even if it's just a little bit. I'm starting to see myself differently. Not as a victim, but as a survivor. Someone who's been through hell but is still standing. That's... that's pretty powerful, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: It certainly is. How would you like to end our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to take a moment to just breathe. To acknowledge how far I've come, even in just this one session. And maybe... maybe to make a promise to myself. A promise that I'll keep working on this, that I'll keep facing these memories until they don't have power over me anymore. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: That's more than okay, Martha. Let's do that together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I'm ready."
