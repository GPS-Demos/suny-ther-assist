    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like I'm right back there, you know? I can still hear the sound of the glass breaking downstairs. My heart's racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The fear. It was... overwhelming. I remember hiding in my closet, praying they wouldn't find me. I felt so helpless, like a child again. It's funny, I've lived through so much in my 76 years, but this... this brought me right back to feeling like that neglected little girl.",
    "Therapist: How does that connection feel?",
    "Client: It's... eye-opening, actually. I never realized how much that home invasion triggered those old feelings of abandonment. It's like... like I was reliving two traumas at once.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. How are you coping with these feelings now?",
    "Client: Well, I'm here, aren't I? (chuckles nervously) I guess that's something. But honestly, it's hard. Some days I feel strong, like I'm making progress. Other days... it's like I'm right back in that closet, terrified and alone.",
    "Therapist: You're showing real courage. What helps on the better days?",
    "Client: Oh, um... well, my daughter. She's been so supportive. And... (pauses) I've been trying those breathing exercises you taught me. They help sometimes, when the panic starts to rise.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. How else has this experience affected you?",
    "Client: It's... it's changed everything. I used to love my home, you know? Now, every creak, every shadow... it sets me on edge. And my depression... it's gotten worse. Some days I can barely get out of bed.",
    "Therapist: How does that relate to your recovery goals?",
    "Client: I... I want my life back. I want to feel safe in my own home again. And... I want to be present for my family without this constant cloud of fear and sadness.",
    "Therapist: Those are important goals. What's one small step you can take?",
    "Client: I... I guess I could try to spend more time in the living room. Maybe during the day, when it feels safer. Baby steps, right?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. How does that idea feel?",
    "Client: Scary, but... maybe a little exciting too? Like I'm taking back control, even if it's just a little bit.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. What else came up during the exposure?",
    "Client: I... I remembered something I'd forgotten. The sound of my neighbor's dog barking. It... it actually made me feel less alone, somehow. Like a reminder that the world was still out there, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful memory. How can you use that?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I could get to know my neighbors better? Create a support network close to home?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great idea. How do you feel about our session today?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... hopeful, I think. It's hard, reliving it all. But I feel like I understand myself a little better now. And that... that feels like progress.",
    "Therapist: It absolutely is. What will you focus on this week?",

    "Therapist: Perfect. Remember, you're not alone in this journey.",
    "Client: Thank you, doctor. I... I really appreciate your help. It means more than you know."
