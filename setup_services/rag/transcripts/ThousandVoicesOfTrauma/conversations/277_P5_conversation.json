    "Therapist: Hello Maria, how are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Ramirez. I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares about the earthquake lately, and I'm not sure I'm ready to face it all again.",
    "Therapist: I understand. It's normal to feel anxious. Shall we discuss the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: Yeah, I suppose so. But can you explain it again? I'm not sure I fully get why we need to do this.",
    "Therapist: Of course. It's a way to process your trauma memories. By revisiting them in a safe space, we can reduce their power over you.",
    "Client: That makes sense, but it sounds scary. What if I can't handle it? What if I completely fall apart?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace, and I'll be here to support you throughout. How does that sound?",
    "Client: A little better, I guess. But what exactly will happen during the session?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount your experience of the earthquake in detail. I'll guide you through it, and we'll process your emotions together.",
    "Client: Okay... I think I can do that. Will it help with my nightmares and the anxiety I feel at work?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it can help reduce those symptoms over time. Your bravery in facing this is commendable.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm still scared, but I want to get better. How long will the exposure part last?",
    "Therapist: We'll aim for about 30-45 minutes. Remember, you're in control. We can pause or stop if needed.",
    "Client: That's a relief to hear. I'm worried about getting too emotional or not being able to describe things well.",
    "Therapist: Those reactions are normal. There's no right or wrong way to do this. Just be honest about your experience.",
    "Client: Alright. I think I'm ready to try. Can we start with something small, though? Maybe just describing the morning before the earthquake?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll start there and progress gradually. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: A mix of scared and hopeful, I think. But I trust you, Dr. Ramirez. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: I'm proud of your courage, Maria. Shall we begin?"
