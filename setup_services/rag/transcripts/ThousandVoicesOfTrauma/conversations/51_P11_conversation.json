    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel drained. Reliving that moment in the refugee camp, when I thought I might not make it through the night... it's intense. The sounds of people crying, the smell of illness... it all came flooding back.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out most?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. I remember feeling so... powerless. Like my life wasn't in my hands anymore. And the pain... my chronic pain started around that time, you know? It's like my body's never forgotten that trauma.",
    "Therapist: How does that connect to now?",
    "Client: Well, I... I guess I still struggle with feeling in control sometimes. Especially when my pain flares up. It's like I'm right back there, vulnerable and scared.",
    "Therapist: I see. What else?",
    "Client: I noticed something new this time. Despite everything, there was this... resilience. I survived that. I'm here now, with my family, in a safe place. It's... it's actually kind of empowering to realize that.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight.",
    "Client: Yeah, it is. I mean, don't get me wrong, it's still hard. But maybe... maybe I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. It's just... it's difficult to shake off that fear sometimes, you know?",
    "Therapist: How might you use this strength?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe I could try to remember it when I'm having a tough day with my pain? Like, if I got through that, I can get through this too? It sounds simple when I say it out loud, but it feels... significant.",
    "Therapist: It is significant. How else?",
    "Client: Well, I've been avoiding talking about my experiences, even with my family. But maybe... maybe sharing a bit wouldn't be so bad. They might understand me better. And it might help me feel less... isolated?",
    "Therapist: That's a brave step. Anything else?",
    "Client: I... I realized during the exposure that I've been holding onto a lot of guilt. For surviving when others didn't. For bringing my family into such a difficult situation. But... maybe it's time to start letting some of that go?",
    "Therapist: How would that change things?",
    "Client: It would be... freeing, I think. Like a weight off my shoulders. Maybe I could focus more on the present, on my family, my work. Instead of always looking back, always feeling... haunted.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization.",
    "Client: It is, isn't it? I mean, it's scary too. The idea of letting go... it's like I'm afraid I'll forget or dishonor those who didn't make it. But holding onto all this pain... it's not helping anyone, is it?",
    "Therapist: What do you think about that?",
    "Client: I think... I think you're right. It's not helping. Maybe honoring them means living well, you know? Using this second chance I've been given. It's just... it's hard to change the way I've been thinking for so long.",
    "Therapist: Change takes time. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... lighter, somehow. Like I've put down a heavy load I've been carrying. There's still a lot to work through, but I feel... I don't know, hopeful? Like maybe I can actually get better, move past this.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Next steps?",
    "Client: I think... I want to try talking to my wife about some of this. Not everything at once, but... opening up a bit. And maybe we could work on some strategies for when my pain triggers these memories? I want to feel more in control.",
    "Therapist: Excellent plan. Anything else?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. This isn't easy, but I feel like I'm finally moving forward. It's scary, but... good scary, if that makes sense? Like I'm finally facing things instead of running away.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, definitely. I... I'm actually looking forward to it. Thank you again."
