    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. Knowing we're going to delve into the home invasion... it's bringing up a lot of emotions I've tried to push down.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay, yes. I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that night. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in my living room. It's late, maybe around 11 PM. I'm curled up on the sofa, watching a movie. The house feels... cozy, warm. I can hear the faint hum of the refrigerator from the kitchen.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: There's a sudden noise. It's... it's coming from the back door. At first, I think it might be the wind, but then I hear it again. It's more forceful this time. My heart starts racing. I mute the TV, straining to listen.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Terrified. My palms are sweating, and I can feel my heart pounding in my chest. I... I want to run, but I'm frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 7. Maybe 8.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Inhales shakily) The noise gets louder. I hear wood splintering, and then... then the door crashes open. I can hear heavy footsteps. Oh God, there's someone in my house. I... I can't breathe. I can't move.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Sarah. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I hear them moving through the kitchen. Drawers opening, things being knocked over. I'm trying to be as quiet as possible, but my breathing feels so loud. I'm shaking uncontrollably.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking this can't be real. This doesn't happen to people like me. I'm wondering if I should try to run, or hide, or... or fight. But I'm paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. How high is your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: (Takes several deep breaths) Okay... okay. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: The footsteps are getting closer. I can hear them in the hallway now. I... I decide to try and make a run for the front door. As I stand up, my leg bumps the coffee table. The remote falls to the floor with a loud clatter.",
    "Therapist: How does your body react?",
    "Client: I freeze. My whole body goes cold. I can hear the intruder stop moving. There's this horrible moment of silence, and then... then I hear them running towards the living room.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: A man bursts into the room. He's... he's wearing a black hoodie and a ski mask. All I can see are his eyes. They're... they're wild, frantic. He's holding a crowbar. I... I can't breathe. I can't think.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 10. I feel like I'm going to pass out.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Feel the chair beneath you. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Breathing heavily) I... I'm trying. It just feels so real.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. It's part of the process. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: The man... he yells at me to get down on the floor. His voice is so angry, so threatening. I... I comply immediately. I'm sobbing, begging him not to hurt me. He starts demanding to know where I keep my valuables.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: I'm shaking. My throat feels tight, like I can't get enough air. My heart is pounding so hard I think it might burst out of my chest.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) I... I tell him about the safe in my bedroom. He grabs me by the arm, yanks me to my feet. His grip is so tight, it hurts. He... he pushes me ahead of him, forcing me to lead the way.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking as this happens?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified he's going to kill me. I'm thinking about my children, wondering if I'll ever see them again. I'm angry at myself for not having better security, for being so helpless.",
    "Therapist: Those are all normal thoughts in that situation. What happens next?",
    "Client: We get to the bedroom. He... he shoves me towards the closet where the safe is. I'm fumbling with the combination, my hands are shaking so badly. He keeps yelling at me to hurry up. I can feel the crowbar pressed against my back.",
    "Therapist: How high is your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still at a 10. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you survived this. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (Inhales deeply) Right. I... I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I finally get the safe open. He pushes me aside, starts grabbing everything. Jewelry, cash, important documents. I... I can't stop crying. I'm begging him to leave, telling him he has everything valuable.",
    "Therapist: What does he do?",
    "Client: He... he turns to me, and for a moment, I think he's going to hit me with the crowbar. But then we both hear it - sirens in the distance. Someone must have called the police.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: There's this... this surge of hope. But also more fear. I don't know how he'll react.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he panics. Starts stuffing things into his pockets. Then he grabs me, drags me back downstairs. I'm stumbling, barely able to keep up. He pushes me onto the couch, tells me if I move or call for help, he'll come back and kill me.",
    "Therapist: That must have been terrifying. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking again. My chest feels tight. It's like I can still feel his hands on me.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Takes several deep breaths) Okay... okay. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens after he threatens you?",
    "Client: He... he runs out the back door. I hear him crashing through the bushes in the backyard. The sirens are getting louder. I'm... I'm frozen on the couch. I can't move, can't think. I'm just sitting there, shaking and sobbing.",
    "Therapist: How long do you stay like that?",
    "Client: It... it feels like forever. But it's probably only a few minutes before the police arrive. They're knocking on the door, calling out. I... I can barely find my voice to answer them.",
    "Therapist: What happens when they come in?",
    "Client: They... they sweep the house, make sure the intruder is gone. One officer stays with me, tries to calm me down. But I can't stop shaking. I feel... I feel so violated, so vulnerable. Like my home isn't safe anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after such an experience. How are you feeling now, as you recall this?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. Emotionally exhausted. But also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved? Like talking about it has released some of the pressure.",
    "Therapist: That's good. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about a 6, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. How do you feel about going through this memory?",
    "Client: It was... it was hard. Really hard. But I think... I think it helps to talk about it. To face it head-on instead of trying to push it away.",
    "Therapist: That's a great insight, Sarah. You've done excellent work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It... it doesn't feel like the memory has as much power over me now. I mean, it's still scary, but... but I feel like I can handle it better.",
    "Therapist: That's often the result of this process. Is there anything else you want to share about the experience?",
    "Client: I... I think the hardest part is feeling like my sense of safety was stolen. Not just my belongings, but my peace of mind. I've struggled with feeling secure ever since.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We'll work on rebuilding that sense of safety.",
    "Client: I'd like that. I want to feel comfortable in my own home again.",
    "Therapist: We'll get there. You've taken a big step today. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... but also a bit stronger. Like I've faced something I've been running from for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's exactly what you've done. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I am. It's been hard, but I'm glad I did this.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today, Sarah. Let's end here and talk about self-care for the rest of the day."
