    "Therapist: Welcome back. Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm honestly pretty nervous. I've been dreading this part of therapy. The idea of reliving that animal attack... it's terrifying. I've spent so long trying to forget it.",
    "Therapist: Your anxiety is understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about losing control. What if I have a panic attack? Or what if I can't handle the memories? I've been using substances to numb these feelings for so long, and now I'm supposed to face them head-on? It feels overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How can I support you through this process?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. Maybe... could you explain why we're doing this? How is reliving the trauma supposed to help me?",
    "Therapist: Certainly. Imaginal exposure helps process traumatic memories. It can reduce PTSD symptoms over time. Shall I elaborate?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I need to understand why I'm putting myself through this.",
    "Therapist: By revisiting the memory in a safe environment, we can work through the emotions attached to it. This can help reduce its power over you.",
    "Client: That makes sense, I guess. But what if it makes things worse? I've been struggling with substance use to cope, and I'm worried this might trigger a relapse.",
    "Therapist: Your concern is valid. We'll monitor your reactions closely. How can we address your relapse concerns?",
    "Client: Maybe we could have a plan in place? Like, if I feel the urge to use after the session, I could call my sponsor or something?",
    "Therapist: Excellent suggestion. Let's create that plan now. What else might help you feel safe?",
    "Client: Could we have a safe word? Something I can say if it gets too intense and I need to stop?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What word would you like to use?",
    "Client: How about \"pause\"? It feels less final than \"stop,\" but it still gives me control.",
    "Therapist: \"Pause\" it is. Remember, you're in control throughout this process. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm still scared, but I trust you. And I want to get better. I want to be able to talk about my experiences in the war without feeling like I'm right back there. I want to be able to go to the zoo without having a panic attack. I want to feel like myself again.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Shall we start with a breathing exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, please. That would help calm my nerves a bit. And... thank you. For being patient with me and for helping me through this. I know it can't be easy dealing with someone who's both a trauma survivor and struggling with addiction.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your resilience is inspiring. Let's begin the breathing exercise now."
