    "Therapist: Welcome, Priya. Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Johnson. I'm... I'm not sure. A bit nervous, I guess. I've been thinking about this all week, and I'm not entirely sure what to expect. Can you tell me more about what we'll be doing?",
    "Therapist: Of course. It's a way to process your trauma. We'll revisit the event safely. Questions?",
    "Client: Um, yeah... I mean, isn't that going to be really difficult? I've spent so much time trying not to think about what happened. The idea of purposely bringing it up is... well, it's scary. And with everything going on with school and the cyberbullying situation, I'm worried this might be too much to handle right now.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's... that's reassuring. I appreciate that. But I'm still not sure I understand why we need to do this. Couldn't talking about it make things worse? I've been having a hard enough time concentrating on my studies as it is.",
    "Therapist: Revisiting helps reduce fear. It's challenging but effective. Ready to try?",
    "Client: I... I guess so. I trust you, Dr. Johnson. But can you tell me more about what exactly will happen? Will I have to close my eyes? Will you be asking me questions? I'm just trying to prepare myself mentally.",
    "Therapist: You'll recall the event, eyes open or closed. I'll guide you. We can pause anytime.",
    "Client: Okay, that doesn't sound too bad. I think I can manage that. But what if I start to panic? Or if I can't continue? I'm worried I might let you down if I can't go through with it.",
    "Therapist: Your safety comes first. We'll stop if needed. No pressure. You're brave for trying.",
    "Client: Thank you, that means a lot. I've been feeling so isolated lately, especially with all the online harassment. It's nice to know someone's in my corner. So, what should I expect to feel during this process?",
    "Therapist: Various emotions may surface. It's normal. We'll work through them together.",
    "Client: I see. That makes sense, I suppose. I'm still nervous, but I feel a bit more prepared now. Is there anything I should do to get ready for our next session when we actually start the exposure?",
    "Therapist: Just come as you are. Your willingness is enough. Any other concerns?",
    "Client: Not really, I think you've covered most of it. I'm still anxious, but I'm also hopeful that this might help. It's been so hard dealing with the memories of the abuse, and then having to face this new form of bullying online. I just want to feel... normal again, you know?",
    "Therapist: Your resilience is admirable. This process will help. Shall we end here today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. Thank you for explaining everything, Dr. Johnson. I feel more prepared now, even if I'm still a bit scared. I'll see you next week, and... well, I'll try my best with this exposure therapy.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Priya. Take care, and see you next week."
