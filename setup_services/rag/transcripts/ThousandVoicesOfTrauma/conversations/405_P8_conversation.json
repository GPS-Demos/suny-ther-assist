    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken up, to be honest. It's like I'm right back there, you know? My heart's racing, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's hard to shake off the memory of those cruel messages popping up on my screen, one after another.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how alone I felt. How powerless. Like, these people I'd never even met in person had so much control over my emotions. I remember sitting there, staring at my computer, and feeling like the walls were closing in on me. It's silly, isn't it? They were just words on a screen, but they hurt so much.",
    "Therapist: It's not silly at all. How did your body react to those feelings?",
    "Client: My hands were shaking. I remember that clearly. And I felt nauseous, like I might throw up at any moment. There was this constant knot in my stomach that wouldn't go away. Even now, talking about it, I can feel my palms getting sweaty and my mouth going dry.",
    "Therapist: I see. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I feel angry. Not just at them, but at myself. Why did I let it affect me so much? I was 50 years old, for crying out loud! I should have been stronger, should have just brushed it off. But I couldn't. It was like every nasty comment chipped away at my self-worth until I felt like nothing.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's hot. Like a fire in my chest. My jaw is clenched, and I want to... I don't know, scream or punch something. But at the same time, I feel so tired. Like I've been carrying this weight for so long, and I just want to put it down.",
    "Therapist: What do you think that tiredness represents?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe it's the exhaustion from trying to pretend I was okay for so long. Putting on a brave face for my family, for my coworkers. But inside, I was crumbling. Every day was a struggle just to get out of bed, to face another day of potential harassment. It wore me down, little by little, until I couldn't recognize myself anymore.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to share this now?",
    "Client: It's... oddly freeing. Scary, but freeing. Like I'm finally acknowledging how much it hurt me, how much it changed me. I've spent so long trying to forget, to push it down, but maybe... maybe that's not the answer. Maybe I need to face it head-on to truly move past it.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much I've isolated myself since then. I lost my job because I couldn't handle being around people anymore. I pushed away friends, family. It's like the cyberbullying didn't just stay online - it seeped into every aspect of my life. And now... now I'm alone, unemployed, and still scared to put myself out there.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... it's painful. But also, maybe... hopeful? Like, now that I can see how much it's affected me, maybe I can start to change it. I don't want to be alone and afraid forever. I want my life back. I want to feel strong again, to trust people again. It's just... it feels so overwhelming. Where do I even start?",
    "Therapist: What do you think could be a first step?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe reaching out to my sister? We used to be close, before all this happened. She tried to help, but I pushed her away. I wonder if she'd still want to talk to me. Or maybe... maybe looking for a support group? People who've been through similar experiences might understand.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like positive ideas. How do you feel about them?",
    "Client: Nervous. Really nervous. But also... a little excited? Like, for the first time in a long time, I feel like there might be a way forward. It's scary, but it's also... I don't know, empowering? To think that I might be able to take control of my life again, instead of letting the fear control me.",
    "Therapist: That's a big shift. What's different now?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's because I'm finally facing it. For so long, I've been running from these memories, these feelings. But now, talking about it, really feeling it... it's like I'm taking my power back. They hurt me, yes, but I'm still here. I survived. And maybe... maybe I can do more than just survive. Maybe I can learn to thrive again.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How does it feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a warmth spreading through my chest. My breathing feels easier, like a weight has been lifted. My hands aren't shaking anymore. I feel... I feel grounded, present. Like I'm really here, in this moment, instead of lost in the past or afraid of the future.",
    "Therapist: What does this mean for your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I think... I think it means I'm ready to really commit to it. To stop hiding and start healing. It's going to be hard, I know that. There will probably be setbacks and days when I want to give up. But for the first time in a long time, I feel like it's possible. Like I'm worth the effort. And that... that feels amazing.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but in a good way. Like I've released something that's been bottled up for too long. I'm a little shaky, but also... lighter? More hopeful. It's like I can see a path forward now, even if it's still a bit blurry. I know there's a lot more work to do, but I feel ready to face it. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. What's one thing you'd like to remember?",
    "Client: I think... I want to remember this feeling of hope. That even after everything I've been through, I can still feel strong, still feel like there's a future worth fighting for. It's not about forgetting what happened, but about not letting it define me anymore. I'm more than what those bullies tried to make me believe I was.",
    "Therapist: That's beautiful. How would you like to close our session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to take a moment to just breathe. To sit with this new feeling of hope and possibility. And maybe... maybe make a small plan for one thing I can do this week to start reconnecting with the world. Even if it's just sending a text to my sister. Small steps, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's take that moment now."
