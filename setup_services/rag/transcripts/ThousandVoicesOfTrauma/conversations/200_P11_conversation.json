    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Johnson?",
    "Client: (sighs deeply) It's... it's a lot to process, Dr. Williams. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a bit lighter? It's strange. Going through that memory of being locked up in that tiny room, it brought back so many feelings I thought I'd buried.",
    "Therapist: What stood out most?",
    "Client: The darkness. (pause) It was so dark in there, and I remember feeling like I couldn't breathe. I kept thinking, \"This is it. This is where I'll die.\" (voice trembles) But I didn't. I survived.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to acknowledge that survival?",
    "Client: (long pause) Empowering, I suppose. But also... sad. I'm 80 years old, and I'm just now dealing with this. All those years... (trails off)",
    "Therapist: It's never too late. What else?",
    "Client: The anger. I felt so angry during the exposure. At him, at the situation, at myself for not fighting back harder. But I know now... I did what I could to survive.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your symptoms?",
    "Client: (thoughtfully) I think... maybe this is why I struggle with small spaces. And why I always need to know where the exits are. It's not just quirks of old age, is it? It's... it's from this.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. How else has this affected you?",
    "Client: My depression... (pause) I've always felt this heaviness, this... worthlessness. Like I didn't deserve to take up space. But going through this memory, I realize how strong I was. How strong I am.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What next?",
    "Client: (with determination) I want to keep going. It's hard, but... I want to understand myself better. To heal. I've spent too long in the dark, Dr. Williams. I'm ready to step into the light.",
    "Therapist: That's courageous. How can we support that?",
    "Client: (thinking) Maybe... maybe we could work on my fear of small spaces? And... (hesitates) perhaps explore why I've always struggled to form close relationships. I think it might be connected to this.",
    "Therapist: Excellent insights. Anything else?",
    "Client: (softly) I... I think I need to forgive myself. For not speaking up sooner, for letting this affect me for so long. It wasn't my fault, was it?",
    "Therapist: No, it wasn't. How does that feel?",
    "Client: (tearfully) Liberating. Scary, but liberating. I've carried this burden for so long... the idea of putting it down is... overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: It's a process. What's one small step?",
    "Client: (considers) Maybe... maybe I could start journaling? Write down my feelings after our sessions, or when I have nightmares. Would that help?",
    "Therapist: Excellent idea. Anything else?",
    "Client: (nods) I think... I think I'd like to talk to my roommate about this. Not everything, but... something. I've kept this secret for so long, and it's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: That's brave. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... hopeful. For the first time in a long time, I feel... I feel like there might be a way forward. Like maybe I can reclaim some of what was taken from me.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. Next steps?",
    "Client: (with a small smile) Keep going. Keep facing these memories. It's hard, but... I'm stronger than I thought. And I'm not alone anymore, am I?",
    "Therapist: No, you're not. Well done today.",
    "Client: (nodding) Thank you, Dr. Williams. I... I'm grateful for this. For the chance to finally heal. It's never too late, right?",
    "Therapist: Never too late. See you next week?",
    "Client: (with determination) I'll be here. Ready to face whatever comes next. Thank you."
