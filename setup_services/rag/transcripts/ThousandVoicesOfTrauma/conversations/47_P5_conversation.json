    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Thompson. I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares lately, and I'm not sure if I'm ready for this.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel nervous. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about reliving those moments from my time in the military. What if I can't handle it? What if I completely fall apart? I've been trying so hard to keep it together, especially at work and with my roommates. I don't want to lose control.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How do you think this might help?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. I know you said it could help reduce my symptoms, but it feels counterintuitive to deliberately think about those experiences. I've been trying to avoid them for so long. But I also know that avoidance isn't really working for me anymore. My anxiety is getting worse, and I feel like I'm always on edge.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great insight. How do you feel about trying?",
    "Client: I'm scared, but I think I'm willing to give it a shot. Can you explain again what exactly we'll be doing? And... will you be there with me the whole time?",
    "Therapist: Of course. I'll guide you through recounting the memory. We'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: Okay... that's reassuring. What should I expect to feel during this? I'm worried about getting overwhelmed or having a panic attack.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel distressed. We'll monitor your anxiety and take breaks if needed.",
    "Client: Alright. I appreciate that. I guess I'm also worried about what happens after. Will I be okay to go home? I have work tomorrow, and I don't want to be a mess.",
    "Therapist: We'll end with grounding exercises. You can stay until you feel stable.",
    "Client: That helps. I'm still nervous, but I think I understand the process better now. Dr. Thompson, do you really think this will help me? I want to believe it will, but part of me is skeptical.",
    "Therapist: Many find it helpful. Your courage is admirable. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. Yes, let's do this. I'm tired of letting these memories control my life. I want to be able to sleep through the night and not jump at every loud noise. If this can help me get there, then I'm willing to try. Just... please be patient with me if I struggle.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Your resilience is inspiring. Let's start slowly."
