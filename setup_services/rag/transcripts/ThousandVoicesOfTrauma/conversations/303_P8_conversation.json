    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is buzzing, you know? My hands are a bit shaky, and my heart is still racing. That memory... it's so vivid. I can still hear the shouting, the crash of things breaking. It's like I'm right back there, hiding in my closet, peeking through the slats.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... why didn't I do something? I was so small, so helpless. I remember feeling frozen, like I couldn't move even if I wanted to. And now, I feel this overwhelming sense of... I don't know, guilt? Shame? Like I should have been braver, should have tried to stop it somehow.",
    "Therapist: How does that feeling of guilt sit with you?",
    "Client: It's heavy. Like a weight on my chest. I know, logically, that I was just a child. But emotionally? It's hard to shake off this feeling that I failed somehow. That if I had been stronger or smarter, maybe things would have been different. Maybe my mom wouldn't have... wouldn't have gotten hurt so badly that time.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing about your body right now?",
    "Client: My throat feels tight, like I'm trying not to cry. And my stomach is in knots. It's strange, but I can almost smell the fear from that night. That metallic taste in my mouth... I used to get that a lot as a kid, whenever I heard raised voices. I guess... I guess I still do sometimes.",
    "Therapist: How does talking about this memory now compare to when it happened?",
    "Client: It's... it's different. Back then, I felt so alone, so scared. Now, it's still scary, but I feel... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like, I'm an adult now, and I'm facing this. It's hard, really hard, but I'm doing it. And you're here, listening. That makes a difference. I'm not alone in that closet anymore.",
    "Therapist: What does that strength feel like?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a tiny flame. Small, but it's there. Sometimes I worry it'll go out, but then I remember I've made it this far. I've survived. I'm in college now, I'm building a life. That little girl in the closet, she grew up. She made it. I made it. And that flame, it gets a little bigger every time I face these memories.",
    "Therapist: How do you see this experience shaping your present?",
    "Client: I... I think it's why I'm so anxious sometimes. Why loud noises make me jump. Why I have trouble trusting people, especially men. But it's also why I'm studying psychology. I want to help kids who've been through similar things. I want to be the person I needed back then. It's like... the pain is still there, but maybe I can use it to do some good, you know?",
    "Therapist: What would you say to that little girl in the closet if you could?",
    "Client: (long pause, voice wavering) I'd tell her... I'd tell her it's not her fault. That she's brave, even when she's scared. That she'll make it through this, and one day, she'll be strong enough to face these memories. I'd tell her she's not alone, even when it feels like she is. And... (starts crying) I'd tell her I'm proud of her. That I'm proud of us.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to say those words?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. There's sadness, but also... relief? Like I'm finally acknowledging that little girl's pain, her fear. And I'm also recognizing how far I've come. It's bittersweet, I guess. Part of me wishes I could go back and protect her, but another part knows that these experiences, as horrible as they were, shaped who I am today.",
    "Therapist: What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I think... I think I just need a moment. To breathe. To let these feelings settle. It's a lot, you know? But it's also... I don't know, cathartic? Like I'm finally letting out something I've held in for so long. Can we just... can we just sit here for a bit? In silence?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take all the time you need.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I'm ready to continue now. This is hard, but I feel like I'm finally starting to process it all. To really face it head-on instead of running away. And that's... that's something, right?",
    "Therapist: What does this progress mean to you?",
    "Client: It means... it means I'm not letting the trauma control me anymore. I'm taking back my power, bit by bit. It's scary, and sometimes I feel like I'm going backwards, but moments like this... they show me I'm moving forward. I'm healing. Slowly, but I'm healing.",
    "Therapist: How do you want to use this strength moving forward?",
    "Client: I want to keep facing these memories, as hard as it is. I want to build on this strength, use it in my daily life. Maybe... maybe even share my story someday, to help others who've been through similar things. I want to turn this pain into something positive, you know? It's a long road, but I think I'm ready to walk it.",
    "Therapist: What support do you need on this journey?",
    "Client: I think... I need patience. From myself, from others. This isn't going to be a quick fix. I need people who'll listen without judgment, who'll be there on the bad days and the good. And I need to keep coming here, keep doing this work. It's tough, but it's worth it. I'm worth it.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained, honestly. But also, kind of... lighter? Like I've set down a heavy backpack I've been carrying for years. I know I'll have to pick it up again, but for now, in this moment, I feel... I feel okay. And that's... that's something I haven't felt in a long time after thinking about that night.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for your courage today. Is there anything else you'd like to share?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. I know we have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can do this. I can heal. And that... that means everything.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredible work today. We'll continue next session."
