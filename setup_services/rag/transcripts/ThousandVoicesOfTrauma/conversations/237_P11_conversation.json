    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: (sighs deeply) It's... it's a lot to process. I'm feeling pretty drained, to be honest. Going through that memory of the police brutality incident, it brought up so many emotions I've been trying to push down. The fear, the anger, the helplessness... it all came rushing back.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out most?",
    "Client: The sounds. The shouting, the sirens... I could hear it all so clearly. And the feeling of being powerless, you know? Like I was just a... a thing to them, not a person. It's hard to shake that feeling, even now.",
    "Therapist: How does that connect to your daily life?",
    "Client: (pauses) I guess... I'm always on edge now. Especially around authority figures. Even at work, when my boss calls me in, I feel this panic rising. It's like I'm back there, waiting for something bad to happen.",
    "Therapist: I see. How did today's session feel different?",
    "Client: Well, it's the first time I've really allowed myself to fully remember it. Usually, I try to block it out. But today... it was intense, but I felt... I don't know, maybe a little more in control? Like I could observe it without being completely overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. What helped you feel that way?",
    "Client: I think... knowing you were here, guiding me through it. And remembering the breathing techniques we practiced. There were moments when I felt my heart racing, but I was able to slow it down a bit.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How might this help moving forward?",
    "Client: (thoughtfully) Maybe... maybe I can start facing these memories instead of running from them. It's exhausting, always trying to avoid thinking about it. If I can learn to process it... perhaps I won't feel so controlled by the fear all the time.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What else?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much this has affected my relationships too. My wife... she's been so patient, but I know it's hard for her when I withdraw or get irritable. And my kids... (voice breaks slightly) I want to be more present for them.",
    "Therapist: It sounds like this is motivating you. How so?",
    "Client: Yeah, it is. I want to reclaim my life, you know? I'm tired of feeling like a victim. I want to be the husband and father my family deserves. And professionally... I used to love my work. I want to feel that passion again, without this constant cloud of anxiety.",
    "Therapist: Those are great goals. What's one small step you can take?",
    "Client: Hmm... Maybe I could try talking to my wife about today's session. I usually keep it all bottled up, but... maybe sharing a bit might help her understand what I'm going through.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent idea. Anything else you want to discuss?",
    "Client: I... I think that's enough for today. This session was tough, but... I feel a glimmer of hope. Like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this and come out stronger on the other side. Is that... is that normal to feel?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. It's a positive sign. How will you care for yourself today?",
    "Client: I think I'll take a long walk in the park. Clear my head a bit. Maybe call my brother too. He's always been a good listener.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a good plan. We'll continue next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. Really. I know I have a long way to go, but... I'm grateful for your guidance through this. See you next week."
