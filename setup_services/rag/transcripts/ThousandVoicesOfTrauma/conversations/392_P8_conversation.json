    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel this tightness in my chest. The memory of seeing my partner in the hospital bed, hooked up to all those machines... it's so vivid. I can almost smell the antiseptic and hear the beeping of the monitors.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how unfair it all was. They were so young, so full of life. One minute we were planning our future, and the next... It's like the world just stopped. I feel guilty, you know? Like maybe I could have done something differently. Maybe if I'd noticed the symptoms earlier...",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's heavy. Like a weight pressing down on my shoulders. My stomach feels knotted, and there's this lump in my throat that won't go away. I want to cry, but at the same time, I feel numb. It's confusing, really.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm noticing how much anger I'm holding onto. I'm angry at the doctors for not doing more, angry at the universe for taking my partner away, and... and I'm angry at myself for struggling to move on. It's been two years, but some days it feels like it just happened yesterday.",
    "Therapist: How does expressing that anger feel?",
    "Client: It's... surprisingly liberating. I've been trying to be so strong, you know? Put on a brave face for everyone. But acknowledging this anger, it's like... it's like I can finally breathe a little easier. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it does. What else is coming up for you?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much I've been avoiding. Not just places that remind me of them, but also certain emotions. I've been so focused on just getting through each day that I haven't really allowed myself to feel the full extent of my grief. It's overwhelming, but... but I think I need to face it.",
    "Therapist: How do you think facing these emotions might affect you?",
    "Client: I'm scared, to be honest. Part of me worries that if I really let myself feel everything, I'll fall apart completely. But another part of me... I don't know, maybe it's hope? Like maybe if I can face this head-on, I might finally start to heal. It's terrifying, but also... maybe necessary?",
    "Therapist: What do you need to feel safe exploring these emotions?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Support, definitely. Maybe some techniques to ground myself when it gets too intense? And... and patience. With myself, I mean. I've been so hard on myself for not 'getting over it' faster. I think I need to learn to be kinder to myself through this process.",
    "Therapist: That's insightful. How can we work on that self-compassion?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe by acknowledging that grief isn't linear? That it's okay to have good days and bad days? And maybe... maybe by remembering that my partner would want me to be gentle with myself. They were always so supportive and understanding. I think they'd want me to extend that same kindness to myself now.",
    "Therapist: That's a beautiful way to honor their memory. What else?",
    "Client: I think I need to start talking about them more. Not just the illness and the loss, but the happy memories too. I've been avoiding that because it hurts, but... but they were such an important part of my life. I don't want to erase that just because it's painful.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to consider that?",
    "Client: It's... bittersweet, I guess. There's a sadness there, of course, but also a warmth. Remembering the good times, it's like... it's like they're still here with me in a way. And that's both comforting and heartbreaking at the same time.",
    "Therapist: What do you think is the next step in your healing journey?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to start facing some of the places and things I've been avoiding. Maybe visit some of our favorite spots, or look through old photos. It's going to be hard, but I think it might help me process everything better. And... and maybe I need to consider joining a support group. Hearing from others who've been through similar experiences might help me feel less alone in all of this.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but also a bit lighter? Like I've set down a heavy backpack I didn't even realize I was carrying. There's still so much to work through, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can do this. It's not going to be easy, but... but I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant realization. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to work on developing some coping strategies for when the grief feels overwhelming. And maybe we could talk more about how to start incorporating happy memories of my partner into my life without getting completely derailed by sadness. Is that something we could explore?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll work on that together. How are you feeling about ending our session today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling okay. A bit raw, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've cleaned out a wound that needed attention. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know we have a long way to go, but I'm grateful for your support.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
