    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a part of me that wants to get this over with, but another part that's dreading it. My stomach's in knots just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to help you process this at your own pace. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. As ready as I'll ever be, I guess.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I'm in my office. It's a Tuesday afternoon, around 3 PM. The sun is streaming through the blinds, casting stripes across my desk. I can smell the coffee from the break room... God, it's so vivid.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: My phone buzzes. It's a text from Sarah. She... she wants to meet for dinner. Says we need to talk. I feel this... this sinking feeling in my gut. I know something's wrong.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Uh... probably a 6. My hands are getting clammy just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... I leave work early. The drive to the restaurant feels like it takes forever. My mind is racing, thinking of all the possibilities. I keep telling myself it's nothing, but deep down... I know.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What do you see when you arrive?",
    "Client: I see Sarah sitting at a table in the corner. She looks... tired. Sad. My heart is pounding as I walk over. She doesn't stand up to greet me like she usually does. I sit down, and... and...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it, John. You're safe here.",
    "Client: She says... she says she wants a divorce. That she's been unhappy for years. That she's met someone else. I feel like I've been punched in the gut. The world starts spinning, and I can't breathe. I... I can't...",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Focus on your breath. In and out. You're here, in my office, safe.",
    "Client: *breathing heavily* It's... it's hard. I can feel the panic rising, just like it did that day.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe higher.",
    "Therapist: Okay, let's ground ourselves. Can you name five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: Uh... your desk, the bookshelf, the clock, the plant in the corner, and... and the painting on the wall.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, continue with what happened next, if you can.",
    "Client: I... I remember asking her why. Begging her to reconsider. She just sat there, looking at me with pity. God, I hated that look. I felt so... so small. So worthless.",
    "Therapist: Those are tough emotions. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Angry. Hurt. Like I want to scream or punch something. But also... also like I want to curl up and disappear.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let those feelings come. What happened after the restaurant?",
    "Client: I... I drove home. I don't even remember the drive. It's all a blur. I walked into our house... our empty house. And I just... I lost it. I started throwing things, smashing picture frames. I couldn't stop crying.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What were you thinking?",
    "Client: That my life was over. That I'd failed. That I wasn't good enough. That I'd wasted 30 years of my life. I kept replaying every moment, trying to figure out where it all went wrong.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe a 7.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, John. Remember, you're describing a past event. You've survived this.",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, I know. It just... it still hurts so much.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What happened in the days following?",
    "Client: I couldn't eat. Couldn't sleep. I called in sick to work. I just... existed. I kept hoping it was all a bad dream, that I'd wake up and Sarah would be there. But she wasn't. She came by to get some of her things, and I... I begged her again. Promised I'd change, do anything. But she just looked at me with those sad eyes and said it was too late.",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly painful. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. Sad. But... but also a little relieved, I guess. Like talking about it is... I don't know, releasing some of the pressure.",
    "Therapist: That's good, John. You're processing this. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 5 now.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's continue. What happened in the weeks after?",
    "Client: I... I started drinking. A lot. I'd come home from work and just... drink until I passed out. I stopped answering calls from friends and family. I let myself go. I think... I think I was punishing myself, in a way.",
    "Therapist: How so?",
    "Client: I felt like I deserved the pain. Like if I suffered enough, maybe Sarah would come back. Or maybe I'd wake up and it would all be different. I know it doesn't make sense, but...",
    "Therapist: It's a common reaction. How long did this go on?",
    "Client: About a month, I think. Then my brother showed up at my door. He... he was shocked at the state I was in. He stayed with me for a week, forced me to eat, to shower. He's the one who suggested I see a therapist.",
    "Therapist: And how do you feel about that decision now?",
    "Client: Grateful, I guess. It's still hard, but... but I'm starting to see that there might be a life after this. It's just... it's hard to imagine right now.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You're making progress, John. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired. Really tired. But... but also a little lighter, maybe? Like I've set down a heavy load, even if it's just for a moment.",
    "Therapist: That's a good sign. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to a 3 now.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. You've done great work today, John. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end the session.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... yeah, I feel a bit more centered now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Remember, healing takes time. We'll continue to work through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think this is helping. It's hard, but... but I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. We'll pick up here next session. Take care of yourself this week, John.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you."
