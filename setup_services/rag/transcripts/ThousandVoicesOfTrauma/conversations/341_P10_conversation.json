    "Therapist: Alright, Rahul. Today we're going to work on the imaginal exposure related to your medical trauma. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. My heart's already racing a bit, to be honest.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 4 or 5 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath and begin describing the event in present tense.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm at the hospital. It's late at night, and I've just gotten a call that my grandfather's condition has worsened. I'm rushing through the corridors, the fluorescent lights are so harsh and everything smells like disinfectant. My hands are shaking as I press the elevator button.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue focusing on the details.",
    "Client: The elevator feels like it's taking forever. I can hear my own heartbeat in my ears. When I finally reach his floor, I... I see nurses rushing into his room. Oh god, I feel sick...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it, Rahul. What do you see next?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm frozen in the doorway. There's a flurry of activity around his bed. The machines are beeping so loudly. I can see my grandfather's face \u2013 he looks so pale and small. A doctor turns to me and says something, but I can't hear him over the noise.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Terrified. My chest feels tight, and I can't seem to catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... I'm stepping into the room now. The doctor is explaining that my grandfather's heart has stopped, and they're trying to resuscitate him. I watch as they perform chest compressions. It looks so violent, and I'm scared they're hurting him.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"This can't be happening. He was fine yesterday.\" I feel so helpless, just standing there watching.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: They... they keep working on him for what feels like hours, but it's probably just minutes. I can see the monitor, and the line is flat. My legs feel weak, and I have to lean against the wall to stay upright.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to an 8, I think.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Rahul. Remember, you're here in a safe place.",
    "Client: *nods* The doctor steps back and looks at the clock. He turns to me and says, \"I'm sorry, we've done everything we can.\" The room goes quiet, except for the continuous beep of the flatline. I... I can't believe it. I start shaking my head, saying \"No, no, no\" over and over.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Focus on the present moment.",
    "Client: *inhales shakily* I'm... I'm walking towards the bed. My grandfather looks so peaceful, like he's just sleeping. I reach out to touch his hand, and it's still warm. That's when it really hits me \u2013 he's gone. I start crying, and I can't stop. The nurses are saying something to me, but it's all just noise.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: Heavy. Like I'm carrying this enormous weight. My eyes are burning from the tears, and my throat feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What happens after that?",
    "Client: I... I have to call my parents. My hands are shaking so much I can barely use my phone. When my mom answers, I can barely get the words out. I hear her start to cry, and it makes me cry even harder. I feel so alone in this sterile, cold room.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Rahul. Keep going.",
    "Client: The next few hours are a blur. People come and go \u2013 other family members, hospital staff. I just sit in the chair next to his bed, holding his hand. I can't bear the thought of leaving him alone. Every time I look at his face, I keep expecting him to open his eyes.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind during this time?",
    "Client: I keep replaying our last conversation. Wishing I'd said more, told him how much he meant to me. I feel guilty for not being there sooner, for not somehow preventing this.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you couldn't have known or changed what happened.",
    "Client: *sighs* I know, but it's hard not to think that way. As the night goes on, the reality starts to sink in. I have to start thinking about practical things \u2013 funeral arrangements, notifying relatives. It feels so wrong to be thinking about these things when he's still... there.",
    "Therapist: How are you coping with these thoughts?",
    "Client: Not well. I feel overwhelmed, like I'm drowning in all the things that need to be done. And at the same time, I just want to curl up and pretend none of this is happening.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. What happens as morning approaches?",
    "Client: The sun starts to come up, and I can see it through the window. It feels so strange that the world is just... continuing. Like it doesn't know that everything has changed. A nurse comes in and tells me gently that they need to... to take him to the morgue. That word \u2013 morgue \u2013 it makes my stomach churn.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe a 7?",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well, Rahul. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I have to say goodbye. I lean over and kiss his forehead. It's cold now, and that finality... it breaks something inside me. I start sobbing uncontrollably. The nurse puts her hand on my shoulder, but I barely feel it. As they wheel him out, I feel like a part of me is going with him.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply.",
    "Client: *takes several deep breaths* I'm left alone in the room. The bed is empty now, and somehow that's even worse. I gather up his things \u2013 his watch, his glasses, the book he was reading. Each item feels so precious now. As I leave the room, I take one last look back, and I'm hit with this overwhelming sense of loss.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, in this moment?",
    "Client: Empty. Like there's this huge hole inside me that I don't know how to fill. I'm exhausted, both physically and emotionally. And I'm dreading having to face the world outside this hospital, a world without him in it.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well, Rahul. Let's start to bring you back to the present.",
    "Client: *nods* Okay... I'm... I'm here in your office. I can feel the chair beneath me, hear the clock ticking.",
    "Therapist: Good. Take a few deep breaths. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Drained, but... also a bit lighter? Like I've let out something that's been stuck inside me for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's common after an exposure session. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's come down to about a 4, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You've made excellent progress today, Rahul.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was hard, but... I think it helped. I haven't let myself really remember that night in detail before.",
    "Therapist: Confronting these memories is an important part of healing. How are you feeling about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's scary, but I want to keep going. I want to be able to think about my grandfather without feeling overwhelmed by that night.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. We'll continue to work on this in our future sessions.",
    "Client: Okay. I... I appreciate your help with this. It means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Rahul. Let's end here for today. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again.",
    "Therapist: Take care, Rahul. I'll see you next week."
