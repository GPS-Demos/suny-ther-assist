    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also kind of foggy at the same time. My heart is still pounding a bit. I can feel this tightness in my chest, you know? It's like I'm right back there in that moment, seeing my mom collapse. I can hear the thud of her body hitting the floor, and I'm frozen, just like I was then.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... what if I had acted faster? Maybe if I had called the ambulance sooner, things would've been different. I feel so guilty, like I failed her. And then I get angry at myself for not doing more. But then another part of me knows that's not rational. It's just... it's all mixed up in my head.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts make you feel physically?",
    "Client: My stomach is in knots. I feel nauseous, like I might throw up. My hands are clammy and shaky. It's hard to sit still. I keep wanting to get up and pace around the room, but I'm also feeling really heavy, like I'm glued to this chair. It's a weird contradiction.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's this overwhelming sense of dread, like something terrible is about to happen again. I know logically that I'm safe here, but my body doesn't seem to get that message. It's like I'm constantly on high alert, waiting for the next disaster to strike.",
    "Therapist: How does this fear compare to what you felt during the actual event?",
    "Client: It's... it's not as intense as it was then, but it's similar. Back then, it was like the whole world had stopped. Now, it's more like... like I'm watching the world continue around me, but I'm stuck in this bubble of fear. I can see everything happening, but I can't fully engage with it. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it does. Can you tell me more about that feeling of being stuck?",
    "Client: It's like... imagine being underwater. You can see the surface, you can see people moving around above you, but everything is muffled and distorted. You're trying to swim up, to break through, but something keeps pulling you back down. That's how I feel a lot of the time. I want to move on, to feel normal again, but this memory, this fear, it just keeps dragging me back.",
    "Therapist: What do you think that \"something\" pulling you back might be?",
    "Client: I think... I think it might be guilt. Or maybe a sense of responsibility? Like, if I move on, if I let go of this fear and pain, I'm somehow betraying my mom or forgetting what happened. It's irrational, I know, but it's there. And it's exhausting, constantly fighting against it.",
    "Therapist: How does sharing these feelings now impact you?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a bit of a relief. Saying it out loud, hearing myself describe it, it makes it feel more manageable somehow. Like, now that I've put it into words, I can start to make sense of it. It's still scary and overwhelming, but it feels less like this big, shapeless monster in my head.",
    "Therapist: What do you think this means for your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I guess... I guess it means I'm making progress? Even though it doesn't always feel like it. Being able to talk about it without completely falling apart, that's something, right? And recognizing these thoughts and feelings, maybe that's the first step to challenging them. It's just... it's hard. Sometimes it feels like two steps forward, one step back.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: Honestly? I'm terrified. But I'm also... hopeful? Is that weird? Like, I'm scared of facing these memories and feelings, but I'm also starting to see that maybe, just maybe, there's a way through this. It's not going to be easy, and I know I'll probably have more moments where I feel like I can't handle it. But being able to talk about it like this, it makes me think that maybe I'm stronger than I thought.",
    "Therapist: What support do you need moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need patience. From you, from myself. And maybe some tools to help me cope when these feelings get overwhelming outside of our sessions. Sometimes I feel so alone with all of this, even though I know I have people who care about me. It's like I don't know how to let them in, you know? So maybe... maybe some help with that too?",
    "Therapist: That's very insightful. How else can I support you?",
    "Client: Just... keep doing what you're doing, I guess? This space, where I can talk about all of this without judgment, it's really helpful. And maybe... maybe we could work on some specific strategies for when I start feeling overwhelmed? Like, concrete things I can do to ground myself when the memories start to take over. I think that would make me feel a bit more in control.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Is there anything else you'd like to share?",
    "Client: I... I don't think so. I feel drained, but in a good way? Like I've let out some of the pressure that's been building up. Thank you for listening, for helping me make sense of all this. It's still scary, but it feels a little less lonely now.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. How would you like to end our session?",
    "Client: Could we maybe do a quick grounding exercise? Something to help me transition back to the outside world? I'm feeling a bit raw and exposed after all of this, and I think I need a moment to collect myself before I leave.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's try a simple breathing exercise..."
