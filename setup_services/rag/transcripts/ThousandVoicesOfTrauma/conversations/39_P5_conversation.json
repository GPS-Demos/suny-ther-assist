    "Therapist: Good morning, Mr. Okafor. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Good morning, Doctor. I'm... well, I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. I know we've been working towards this, but the idea of revisiting those memories... it's daunting.",
    "Therapist: Understandable. Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. Are you ready to discuss it?",
    "Client: I suppose so. But I'm not entirely sure what to expect. Can you explain a bit more about what we'll be doing?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Imaginal exposure involves revisiting your refugee experiences in a safe environment. It helps process traumatic memories.",
    "Client: That sounds... intense. I've spent years trying to forget those experiences. Why do we need to bring them up again?",
    "Therapist: Confronting memories can reduce their power over you. It may be uncomfortable, but it's a path to healing.",
    "Client: I see. But what if I can't handle it? What if it's too much?",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. You're in control. We can stop anytime you need to.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I appreciate your patience with me, Doctor. It's just... these memories, they're not just about me. They involve my family, my community. It feels like I'm carrying their pain too.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. This process honors your experiences and those of your community.",
    "Client: I understand. It's just... sometimes I feel guilty for being here, safe, when so many others didn't make it. Will this help with that too?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it can. Processing these experiences often helps with survivor's guilt.",
    "Client: Alright. I think I'm ready to try. But... can you tell me exactly what I need to do?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount your experiences in detail. I'll guide you through it.",
    "Client: In detail? That's... that's going to be difficult. Some parts are vivid, but others are hazy. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Completely normal. We'll work with what you remember. Your brain protects you by blurring some memories.",
    "Client: I see. And what about the physical reactions? Sometimes when I think about those times, my heart races and I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Those reactions are common. We'll manage them together with breathing exercises.",
    "Client: Okay. I trust you, Doctor. I know this won't be easy, but I'm willing to try. For my own sake, and for the memory of those who didn't make it.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do this. Where should I start? The day we left our village, or earlier?",
    "Therapist: Start where you feel comfortable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Alright. I'll start with the night before we left. It was raining..."
