    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Lee?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's not easy revisiting that night. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel tense all over. It's like I'm right back there, you know? I can still hear the sound of glass breaking downstairs, and the heavy footsteps... (takes a deep breath) It's intense.",
    "Therapist: That sounds challenging. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The fear, definitely. It was overwhelming. I remember hiding in my closet, trying not to breathe too loudly. I kept thinking, \"What if they find me? What will they do?\" It's strange, but I could smell the musty scent of old clothes in the closet so clearly. And the waiting... it felt like hours, even though it was probably just minutes.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... difficult, but different from before. I noticed I could separate myself a bit more from the memory this time. Like, I knew I was here in your office, safe, even while remembering. That's new for me. Usually, I feel completely lost in the memory, but today, there was a small part of me that stayed present.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant observation. How might this relate to your recovery?",
    "Client: Well, I guess it shows I'm making some progress, right? Being able to maintain even a small sense of the present while remembering... that feels important. Maybe it means I'm starting to gain more control over these memories, instead of them controlling me all the time.",
    "Therapist: Excellent insight. What else did you notice?",
    "Client: I realized how much this experience has affected my daily life. Like, the way I always check the locks multiple times before bed, or how I startle at any unexpected noise. It's all connected to that night. But going through it again in here, it's like... I'm facing it head-on instead of running from it.",
    "Therapist: How does that feel?",
    "Client: It's scary, but also... empowering, I think. Like I'm taking back some control. I've avoided thinking about that night for so long, but now I'm choosing to confront it. It's exhausting, but I also feel a sense of... I don't know, maybe pride? That I can do this, even though it's hard.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I want to keep pushing forward. Maybe... maybe I can start working on feeling safer in my own home again. I've been thinking about taking a self-defense class, or maybe installing a better security system. Just something to help me feel more in control. And I want to keep doing these exposures, as tough as they are. I think they're helping.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a strong plan. How can we support that?",
    "Client: Could we maybe... focus on some coping strategies for when I'm feeling particularly anxious at home? And perhaps work on how I can remind myself that I'm safe now, even when memories come up? I think that would really help me between our sessions.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll incorporate that next time. Anything else?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm finally moving forward instead of being stuck in that moment. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel hopeful.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, definitely. I'll be here. Thanks again, doctor."
