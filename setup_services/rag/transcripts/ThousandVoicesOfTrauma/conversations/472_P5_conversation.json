    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. Today we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of reliving that awful day in prison... it makes my heart race just thinking about it. I'm not sure I can handle it.",
    "Therapist: Your anxiety is understandable. This process is challenging but crucial for healing.",
    "Client: I appreciate your understanding. It's just... ever since that day, I've tried so hard to push those memories away. The thought of purposely bringing them back terrifies me. What if I can't handle it? What if I fall apart completely?",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. You're in control throughout the session.",
    "Client: That's somewhat reassuring. But what exactly will happen during this exposure? Will I have to close my eyes and imagine everything in detail? I'm worried about getting overwhelmed by the emotions and memories.",
    "Therapist: Yes, you'll recount the event with eyes closed. I'll guide you through it supportively.",
    "Client: Okay... I think I can try that. But what if I start panicking? Or if I can't continue? I'm worried about disappointing you or failing at this somehow.",
    "Therapist: Your safety is paramount. We can pause anytime you need.",
    "Client: That's good to know. I suppose I'm also concerned about what happens after the session. Will I be okay to drive home? Will these memories keep haunting me even more intensely?",
    "Therapist: We'll debrief after and ensure you're grounded before leaving. Follow-up support is available.",
    "Client: Alright, that makes me feel a bit better. I guess I'm just scared of facing these memories head-on. They've controlled my life for so long, and the idea of voluntarily revisiting them seems counterintuitive. But if you think this will help...",
    "Therapist: It's a proven method for reducing PTSD symptoms. Your courage is admirable.",
    "Client: Thank you. I know you wouldn't suggest this if you didn't believe it would help. It's just hard to imagine how reliving this trauma could possibly make things better. But I trust you, and I'm willing to give it a try. I'm tired of letting this experience control my life.",
    "Therapist: Your trust means a lot. This process will help reclaim your life.",
    "Client: I hope so. I really do. It's been such a long journey already, dealing with the aftermath of that imprisonment. The depression, the nightmares, the constant fear... I'm ready for it to end. If this is the path to healing, then I'll do my best to walk it, no matter how difficult it might be.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is inspiring. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Just... please be patient with me if I struggle. This isn't easy, but I'm committed to trying. Let's do this."
