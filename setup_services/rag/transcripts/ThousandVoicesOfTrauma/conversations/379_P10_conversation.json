    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is terrified. It's like there's a storm brewing inside me, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start slowly. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Just... give me a moment to collect myself. *deep breath* Okay, I think I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Good. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see the sky first. It's this eerie, greenish-gray color. The air feels heavy, like it's pressing down on me. I'm standing on my front porch, and the wind is picking up. It's... it's howling, really. My wind chimes are going crazy.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear this... this roar. It's distant at first, but it's getting louder. My neighbor, Mrs. Johnson, she's yelling something, but I can't make it out over the wind. I should go inside, I know I should, but I'm... I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. My heart is racing so fast I think it might burst out of my chest. I can't breathe properly. The roar is getting louder, and I finally snap out of it. I turn to go inside, but the door... the door won't budge. It's like the pressure has sealed it shut.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'd say... maybe a 70? It's pretty intense.",
    "Therapist: Okay, take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Alright. So, I'm yanking on the door, and it finally gives. I stumble inside, and that's when I hear this... this crack. It's so loud, it makes my ears ring. I look out the window, and I see my neighbor's oak tree... it's... it's coming down. Oh god, it's heading straight for Mrs. Johnson's house.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I scream. I'm screaming her name, but she can't hear me. The tree crashes through her roof like it's made of paper. I want to run out there, to help her, but I can't move. I'm paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe 85? My hands are shaking just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here in this room. You're safe. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: *voice trembling* Okay... okay. So, I'm watching through the window, and suddenly, everything goes dark. The power's out. I can hear things hitting the house - branches, debris, I don't know. It sounds like the world is ending. I'm huddled in the corner, my arms over my head. I can feel the house shaking. I'm... I'm so sure this is it. This is how I die.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: The noise is deafening. I can hear glass breaking somewhere in the house. I'm crying, praying, begging for it to stop. And then... and then it does. Just like that. The roaring fades, the wind dies down. It's... it's eerily quiet.",
    "Therapist: What do you do in that moment of quiet?",
    "Client: I... I don't move at first. I'm afraid it's just the eye of the storm or something. But after a few minutes, I slowly stand up. My legs are like jelly. I make my way to the front door, and I... I hesitate. I'm terrified of what I might see.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My mouth is dry. I feel like I might be sick.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here with me. You're safe.",
    "Client: *takes a shaky breath* Right. Okay. So, I open the door, and it's... it's like a war zone. There are trees down everywhere. Power lines scattered across the street. And Mrs. Johnson's house... oh god, it's... it's half collapsed.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that image. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I start running. I'm calling out for Mrs. Johnson. My feet are getting cut on debris, but I don't care. I reach her house, and I'm trying to climb over the fallen tree. My hands are bleeding from the bark, but I keep going. I can hear her. She's calling for help.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. Maybe 90? I can feel my heart pounding just like it did that day.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Sarah. Remember, you're here in this room, safe.",
    "Client: *nods* I... I finally spot her. She's pinned under a beam. There's blood... so much blood. I'm trying to lift the beam, but it won't budge. I'm screaming for help, but nobody's coming. Mrs. Johnson, she's... she's looking at me. Her eyes are so scared. She's saying something, but I can't hear her over my own screaming.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm helpless. Utterly helpless. I want to save her so badly, but I can't. I'm not strong enough. I'm failing her. The guilt... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you did everything you could. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel sick. My stomach is in knots. I can still see her face, hear her voice. It's... it's too much.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I stay with her. I hold her hand. I'm telling her help is coming, even though I don't know if it is. She's... she's getting weaker. Her grip on my hand is loosening. And then... and then she's gone. Just like that. I'm... I'm alone, holding the hand of my dead neighbor.",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly difficult. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm numb. It's like everything inside me has shut down. I can't cry, I can't scream. I just... sit there. I don't know how long. It could have been minutes or hours.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. You're here, you're safe.",
    "Client: *takes a deep breath* Eventually, I hear sirens. People are shouting. Someone... someone pulls me away from Mrs. Johnson. I'm in shock, I think. They're asking me questions, but I can't answer. I just keep staring at her house, at her hand sticking out from under the beam.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 85? I can feel the exhaustion setting in, just like it did that day.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Sarah. We're almost done. What happens after that?",
    "Client: It's... it's a blur. I remember being checked by paramedics. They wanted to take me to the hospital, but I refused. I couldn't leave... couldn't leave her. I sat on what was left of my porch for hours, watching as they... as they removed her body. The guilt... it was crushing me. Why didn't I check on her earlier? Why couldn't I save her?",
    "Therapist: Those are normal thoughts to have, but remember, it wasn't your fault.",
    "Client: *nods slowly* I know that now, but then... then it felt like it was all on me. The days after were... were hell. I couldn't sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw her face. I heard the roar of the tornado. I... I started drinking, just to numb myself.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, as you recall all of this?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. Emotionally and physically. But there's also this... this weight that's lifted a bit. Talking about it... it helps, somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's good, Sarah. You've done incredibly well today. Let's take a few deep breaths together.",
    "Client: *breathes deeply* Thank you. I... I never thought I could talk about this without falling apart.",
    "Therapist: You're stronger than you realize. How would you rate your distress now?",
    "Client: It's... it's lower. Maybe a 60? I'm exhausted, but I feel... I don't know, maybe a little lighter?",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's end here for today. You've shown immense courage.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I needed this more than I realized.",
    "Therapist: You did very well, Sarah. We'll continue to work through this together."
