    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. It's like I was right back there, you know? Watching it all happen again. I could hear the shouting, see the fear in my mother's eyes. It's so vivid, even after all these years.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. I remember feeling so small, so powerless. I wanted to do something, anything to make it stop, but I couldn't. I was frozen, just watching it all unfold. And the guilt... god, the guilt is overwhelming. I keep thinking, \"Why didn't I do something?\" Even though I know, logically, that there was nothing a child could have done.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt feel in your body right now?",
    "Client: It's like a weight on my chest. Heavy, oppressive. Makes it hard to breathe sometimes. And there's this knot in my stomach that just won't go away. It's always there, but it gets so much worse when I think about these memories.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does this connect to your day-to-day life?",
    "Client: Well, I... I guess it explains a lot about my anxiety. I'm always on edge, always waiting for something bad to happen. I have trouble trusting people, especially in my relationships. Even with my spouse, who's been nothing but supportive. It's like I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop, you know?",
    "Therapist: That makes sense. What did you learn from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I'm starting to see how much this experience has shaped me. How it's affected my relationships, my work, everything. It's not just a memory, it's like it's woven into the fabric of who I am. But at the same time, going through it again, as painful as it was, I feel like I'm starting to process it differently. Like maybe I can start to separate myself from it, bit by bit.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's scary, I won't lie. Part of me wants to run away from all of this. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a glimmer of hope? Like maybe if I keep facing this, I can start to heal. To live without this constant fear and guilt. It's exhausting, living like this, and I'm ready for a change. Even if it's hard, I think I need to keep going.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. What support do you need moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I need reassurance. That what I'm feeling is normal, that I'm not crazy for still being affected by this after so many years. And maybe some strategies for coping with the anxiety between sessions? Sometimes it feels overwhelming, especially after we've dug into these memories.",
    "Therapist: Those are great suggestions. Let's discuss some coping strategies now.",
    "Client: That would be really helpful. I've been trying some breathing exercises, but sometimes they don't feel like enough. Especially when the memories are really vivid, or when I'm in a situation that reminds me of... of what happened. I find myself getting panicky, my heart racing, and I can't seem to calm down.",
    "Therapist: What else have you found helpful in those moments?",
    "Client: Well, sometimes I try to ground myself by focusing on my surroundings. You know, naming things I can see, hear, touch. It helps a bit. And talking to my spouse can be calming, when I'm able to open up. But sometimes I feel like I'm burdening them with all of this.",
    "Therapist: It's important to have support. How else could you expand your support network?",
    "Client: I've thought about joining a support group, actually. I've been hesitant because the idea of sharing with strangers is intimidating, but maybe it would help to talk to people who've been through similar experiences. And I've been considering getting back into painting. I used to love it, and I think it might be a good way to express some of these emotions I'm dealing with.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like excellent ideas. How do you feel about our progress today?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, honestly. But also like we've made some headway. It's strange, I feel both exhausted and somehow lighter at the same time. Like I've set down a burden I've been carrying for a long time. I know we still have a lot of work to do, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. What's one thing you'll take away from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... the realization that I'm not alone in this. That what I'm feeling is a normal response to an abnormal situation. And that there's no shame in needing help to process it all. It's going to be a long journey, but I'm starting to believe that it's one worth taking. That maybe I can find peace, even if I can't change what happened.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How would you like to end our session today?",
    "Client: I think I'd like to spend a few minutes just sitting quietly, if that's okay. Maybe do one of those grounding exercises we talked about. I want to leave feeling centered, ready to face the rest of my day. And... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It means more than I can express.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Let's take those few minutes now."
