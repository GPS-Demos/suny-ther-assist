    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, John?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. The memory of losing Sarah, it's still so raw, you know? And then thinking about how that ties into what I've learned about human trafficking... it's overwhelming. I feel drained, but also kind of... alert? If that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. When Sarah died, I felt so powerless. And now, learning about trafficking victims, it's like... it's the same feeling. I couldn't save her, and I can't save them either. It's crushing.",
    "Therapist: How does that connect to your daily life?",
    "Client: Well, I... I guess I've been avoiding a lot of things. Taking on new projects at work, meeting new people. It's like I'm afraid to care about anything or anyone because I might lose them too. And hearing about trafficking, it just reinforces that fear. The world seems so dangerous now.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts came up during the exposure?",
    "Client: I kept thinking, \"Why her? Why couldn't I do something?\" And then with the trafficking info, it was like, \"Why them? Why can't someone help?\" It's... it's frustrating. Makes me angry at the world, you know?",
    "Therapist: How did your body feel?",
    "Client: Tense. Really tense. My chest felt tight, and I noticed I was clenching my fists. I still am, actually. And there's this knot in my stomach that won't go away.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. How does it feel now?",
    "Client: (inhales deeply) A little better, I guess. The knot's still there, but... maybe not as tight? It's hard to tell sometimes.",
    "Therapist: What did you learn about yourself today?",
    "Client: I... I think I realized how much I'm still carrying this grief. And not just for Sarah, but for... for the state of the world, I guess? It's like I'm grieving for all these strangers too. But also, I noticed that I could sit with the discomfort longer this time. That's progress, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How might you use this insight?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I could try to channel some of this energy into something positive? Like, I've been thinking about volunteering at a local shelter. It's scary, but... it might help me feel less powerless.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great idea. How else can you apply this?",
    "Client: I suppose I could... try to be more open with my roommates about what I'm going through. They've noticed I've been withdrawn. And maybe... maybe it's time to consider dating again? Not right away, but... eventually.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent goals. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: It's tough, not gonna lie. But I think it's helping. Each time, it gets a little easier to face these memories and feelings. And learning about trafficking, as hard as it is, it's... it's making me want to do something, you know? To make a difference somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's very encouraging. What's your takeaway today?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's that I'm stronger than I realized. And that maybe, just maybe, I can use my experience to help others. It doesn't fix everything, but it gives me a sense of purpose, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How will you care for yourself now?",
    "Client: I think I'll go for a long walk. Clear my head a bit. Maybe call my sister later. She's always been a good listener. And... I'll try to be kind to myself. Remember that it's okay to have these feelings, that they're part of healing.",
    "Therapist: Excellent plan. Anything else you want to discuss?",
    "Client: No, I think... I think I'm good for now. This was intense, but... I feel like I've made some progress. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today, John. Take care."
