    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm alright, I suppose. A bit on edge, if I'm honest. I know we're diving into some heavy stuff today.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in the market. It's hot, dusty. The air feels thick with tension. I can smell spices and sweat. There are people everywhere, but something feels off.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's shouting. I turn and see... oh God, I see men with guns. They're grabbing people, forcing them into a building. My heart's racing.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 7. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a deep breath. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I try to run, but there's nowhere to go. They're herding us like cattle. I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: We're pushed into this dark room. It smells of fear and sweat. I can hear people crying, praying. I'm trying to stay calm, to think of a way out, but my mind's blank.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking. I feel nauseous. It's like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here in the present. You're safe. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. Hours pass. It feels like days. We're given little water, no food. The captors are shouting demands in a language I don't understand. I keep thinking about my wife, my kids. Will I ever see them again?",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. This is tough.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. Keep going.",
    "Client: There's a commotion outside. Gunfire. People are screaming. I don't know if it's rescue or if we're all about to die. I'm... I'm curled up in a corner, trying to make myself small. My heart's pounding so hard I think it might burst.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: I'm trying... God, it feels so real. The door bursts open, and there's smoke everywhere. I can't see, can't breathe. Someone grabs me - I fight back, but then I realize it's one of our guys. We're being rescued.",
    "Therapist: How does that feel?",
    "Client: Relief... but also terror. We're not safe yet. We're running, stumbling through the streets. Bullets are flying everywhere. I can hear explosions, smell gunpowder. It's chaos.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still at 8. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're here now, you're safe.",
    "Client: Right, right... We make it to the extraction point. I'm shaking so hard I can barely climb into the chopper. As we lift off, I look down at the city. It's surreal, like a nightmare I can't wake up from.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: We land at the base. There are medics, debriefings. It's all a blur. I remember calling my wife, hearing her voice... I break down. I can't stop crying.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful moment. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Drained. Exhausted. But... also a bit lighter? Like I've let something out that's been trapped inside for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's good, John. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 6. Still high, but... better.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Let's take a few deep breaths together.",
    "Client: Okay... [deep breath] That helps. It's strange, talking about it like this. It's painful, but... I don't know, maybe necessary?",
    "Therapist: Many find it helpful. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Tired. Really tired. But also... maybe a little proud? I didn't think I could do this.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You've shown incredible strength.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's... it's not easy. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever really be 'okay' again.",
    "Therapist: Healing takes time. You're making progress.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess so. It's just... some days are harder than others, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Can you tell me more about those hard days?",
    "Client: Well, sometimes I'll hear a loud noise, or smell something that reminds me of that day, and suddenly I'm right back there. My heart starts racing, I can't breathe...",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with those moments?",
    "Client: I try to use those grounding techniques we've talked about. Focusing on my surroundings, naming things I can see or touch. It helps, but... sometimes it's not enough.",
    "Therapist: What happens when it's not enough?",
    "Client: I... I shut down. I isolate myself. My wife tries to help, but I push her away. I feel guilty about that.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to struggle. Have you talked to your wife about this?",
    "Client: Not really. I don't want to burden her with all this... darkness.",
    "Therapist: Sharing can actually lighten the load. How do you think she'd respond?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. She's always been supportive, but this is different. I'm different.",
    "Therapist: Consider opening up to her. It might help. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 5. Talking about home... it helps ground me, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Let's focus on that feeling of being grounded. What else helps you feel secure?",
    "Client: Being with my kids. Working in my garden. Simple things, I guess. Things that remind me life goes on.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent coping strategies. How often do you engage in them?",
    "Client: Not as often as I should, probably. It's easy to get caught up in the bad stuff.",
    "Therapist: I encourage you to make time for those activities. They're important for your healing.",
    "Client: Yeah, you're right. I'll try to do that more.",
    "Therapist: Good. As we wrap up, how are you feeling?",
    "Client: Drained, but... okay. Better than I expected, actually.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, John. Remember, healing isn't linear. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's... it's tough, but I'm trying.",
    "Therapist: That's all we can ask. Same time next week?",
    "Client: Yeah, I'll be here. Thanks, doc.",
    "Therapist: Take care, John. Remember to practice your coping strategies."
