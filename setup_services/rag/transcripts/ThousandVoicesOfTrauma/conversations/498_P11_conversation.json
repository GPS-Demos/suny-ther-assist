    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, John?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of drained. Going through that memory of the abuse... it's like I was right back there, you know? I could almost smell the musty basement and feel the cold floor. It's intense.",
    "Therapist: That sounds overwhelming. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. I remembered feeling so small and powerless. It's frustrating because I'm an adult now, but reliving it... those feelings came rushing back. I felt like that scared kid again, unable to stop what was happening.",
    "Therapist: How does that connect to your day-to-day experiences?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... I often feel like I'm not in control of my life. Like I'm still that powerless kid. It's probably why I'm still living with my parents at 37. I struggle to take charge of my life, always waiting for someone else to make decisions or tell me what to do.",
    "Therapist: I see. What else did you notice during the exposure?",
    "Client: The shame. God, the shame is suffocating sometimes. I felt it so strongly during the memory. It's like... even though I know logically it wasn't my fault, there's this voice in my head saying I should have done something, anything, to stop it.",
    "Therapist: How does that shame affect you now?",
    "Client: It's... it's always there, lurking. In my relationships, my work. I second-guess everything I do. I'm afraid to put myself out there, to be vulnerable. It's probably why I'm single. I mean, how can I expect someone to love me when I can barely stand myself sometimes?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What else?",
    "Client: I noticed something else too. As terrifying as it was to go through that memory... I did it. I faced it. And I'm still here. That's... that's kind of huge, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Proud, I guess. And maybe a little hopeful? Like, if I can face this, maybe I can face other things too. Maybe I'm stronger than I thought.",
    "Therapist: That's a great observation. How might you apply this?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe I could try to be more assertive at work? Or... or maybe even think about moving out on my own. It's scary, but if I can face these memories, maybe I can face real-world challenges too.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like great goals. Anything else from today's session?",
    "Client: Yeah, um... I realized that while the memory is painful, it doesn't have the same power over me that it used to. It's still awful, but... I don't know, it feels more manageable somehow. Like I'm starting to see it as something that happened to me, not something that defines me. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. How does this shift feel?",
    "Client: It feels... liberating, I guess? Like I'm starting to take back some control. I mean, I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this and come out okay on the other side.",
    "Therapist: That's fantastic progress, John. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm scared, honestly. This isn't easy. But I also feel determined. I want to keep going. I want to see where this leads. I want my life back, you know? I'm tired of letting the past control my present. So yeah, it's tough, but I'm in. I want to keep working at this.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is commendable. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I guess. For guiding me through this. For helping me see things I couldn't see on my own. I know we have more work to do, but I feel like I'm finally on the right path. It's a good feeling, even if it's scary too."
