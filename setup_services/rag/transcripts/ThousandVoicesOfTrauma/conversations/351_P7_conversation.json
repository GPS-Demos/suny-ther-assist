    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the combat experience you mentioned?",
    "Client: Okay... It was a hot day in Afghanistan. We were on patrol in a small village. The air was thick with dust, and I remember feeling sweat dripping down my back. Suddenly, there was a loud explosion. I felt the ground shake beneath my feet, and my ears were ringing...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you saw and felt.",
    "Client: I saw smoke rising from a building about 50 meters away. People were screaming, and I could hear my squad leader shouting orders. I instinctively raised my rifle and scanned the area for threats. My heart was pounding so hard I thought it might burst out of my chest.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happened next?",
    "Client: We started moving towards the explosion site. I remember the smell of burning rubber and... something else. As we got closer, I saw... I saw bodies. Some were moving, others weren't. There was so much blood...",
    "Therapist: I know this is difficult. You're safe here. Take a deep breath and continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) There was a young boy, couldn't have been more than 10 years old. He was lying on the ground, his leg... it was gone. He was looking right at me, his eyes wide with fear and pain. I froze. I couldn't move. I was supposed to help, but I just stood there...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: I finally snapped out of it when my buddy grabbed my arm. We started treating the wounded, applying tourniquets, calling for medevac. But that boy's eyes... they still haunt me. I keep thinking, what if I had reacted faster? Could I have saved his leg? His life?",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you can't change the past, but you're working through it now.",
    "Client: (voice breaking) I know, but it's so hard. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night, and I can still hear the screams, smell the blood. I feel so guilty for surviving when others didn't.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. Keep going, you're making progress.",
    "Client: After the medevac arrived, we had to secure the area. We found out later it was an IED planted by insurgents. The boy... he didn't make it. I remember feeling numb as we finished our patrol. When we got back to base, I couldn't even talk about it. I just went to my bunk and stared at the ceiling for hours.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How do you feel right now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. Sad. Angry. But also, somehow... lighter? Like I've been carrying this weight for so long, and now I'm finally starting to let it go.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. We'll work through these feelings together.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to talk about, but I think it's helping. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever be able to forgive myself for what happened that day.",
    "Therapist: Self-forgiveness is a process. We'll continue to work on that.",
    "Client: I hope so. I want to be able to think about my time in the military without feeling this overwhelming guilt and sadness. There were good moments too, you know? Camaraderie, a sense of purpose. But this memory... it overshadows everything else.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We'll work on processing all aspects of your experience.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's just... sometimes I feel like I don't deserve to be happy or move on with my life when so many others didn't get that chance.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid, but remember, healing isn't disrespectful to those lost.",
    "Client: I guess you're right. It's just hard to accept sometimes. But I'm trying. I really am. I want to be able to talk about my experiences with my family without breaking down. I want to be able to sleep through the night without nightmares. I want to feel... normal again. Is that even possible?",
    "Therapist: It is possible. You're taking important steps towards healing.",
    "Client: Thank you for saying that. It gives me hope. I know this process isn't easy, and there are days when I wonder if it's worth it. But then I think about my wife, my kids... they deserve to have me fully present, not haunted by the past.",
    "Therapist: Your motivation is admirable. Let's continue working together towards your goals.",
    "Client: I'm ready. It's not easy, but I'm committed to this process. I want to honor the memory of those we lost by living my life to the fullest. I think... I think that's what they would have wanted. Not for us to be trapped in guilt and pain, but to move forward and make a difference in the world.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful perspective. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter. Still sad, still a bit anxious, but also... hopeful. Like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this and come out stronger on the other side. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. It's a sign of progress. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Thank you. I know we still have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I might actually be able to get there. To a place where I can think about my experiences without being overwhelmed by them. Where I can honor the memories of those we lost without losing myself in the process.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent goal. We'll continue working towards it together.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. And I appreciate you listening and guiding me through this. It's not easy to talk about, but I know it's necessary. I'm grateful for the opportunity to work through these experiences in a safe environment.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your courage is commendable. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. I feel emotionally drained, but in a productive way, if that makes sense. Thank you again for your guidance and support. I'm looking forward to our next session, even though I know it won't be easy.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Take care of yourself until next time."
