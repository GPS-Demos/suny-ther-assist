    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart is still racing, and I feel this tightness in my chest. The memory of that night, seeing the violence unfold... it's so vivid. I can still hear the shouting, the sound of glass breaking. It's like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... guilt? I keep thinking about my brother. If I had done something differently that night, maybe he'd still be here. It's been five years, but the pain feels so fresh.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt manifest for you?",
    "Client: It's like a heavy weight in my stomach. I feel nauseous thinking about it. I should have been braver, should have stepped in somehow. But I just froze. I couldn't move. I keep replaying that moment over and over, wondering what if...",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind as you recall that moment?",
    "Client: I... I'm thinking, \"I'm a coward. I let my brother down.\" And then I hear his voice, calling out for help. God, it's so clear. I can see the fear in his eyes. I feel so helpless, both then and now. It's like I'm failing him all over again.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as these thoughts come up?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking. I feel cold, but I'm sweating. There's this tension in my shoulders, like I'm bracing for something. And my throat feels tight, like I can't get enough air. It's as if my body is stuck in that moment of panic.",
    "Therapist: What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Part of me wants to run away from these feelings, to forget it all. But another part knows I need to face this. I just... I wish I could talk to my brother one last time. Tell him I'm sorry. Ask for his forgiveness.",
    "Therapist: How might facing these feelings help in your healing process?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe it could help me let go of some of this guilt? It's been eating away at me for so long. Maybe if I can accept that I did the best I could in that terrifying situation, I could start to forgive myself. But it feels impossible right now.",
    "Therapist: What's the hardest part about that idea?",
    "Client: The hardest part is... feeling like I don't deserve forgiveness. Like I'm betraying my brother if I move on. And I'm scared that if I let go of this guilt, I'll somehow forget him. The pain is... it's all I have left of him now.",
    "Therapist: How else might you honor your brother's memory?",
    "Client: I... I hadn't thought about it that way. Maybe... maybe I could volunteer at the youth center he loved so much? Or set up a small scholarship in his name? It feels both scary and... a little hopeful to think about doing something positive.",
    "Therapist: What emotions come up as you consider these ideas?",
    "Client: There's a mix of sadness and... something lighter. Hope, maybe? It's like a tiny spark. For the first time in years, I'm thinking about my brother and not just feeling crushed by guilt. There's a warmth there, remembering his smile, his laugh. It hurts, but it's a different kind of pain.",
    "Therapist: How does this shift feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's strange. The tightness in my chest is still there, but it's not as constricting. I feel like I can breathe a little deeper. My shoulders have relaxed a bit. There's still a heaviness, but it's not as overwhelming. It's like... like I'm starting to see a way forward, even if it's just a glimmer.",
    "Therapist: What does this glimmer mean to you?",
    "Client: It means... maybe there's a chance I can heal. That I can honor my brother's memory without being crushed by guilt. It's scary to think about, but also... I feel a tiny bit of relief. Like maybe I don't have to carry this burden alone anymore.",
    "Therapist: How might this perspective impact your daily life?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I could start talking about my brother more. Share stories about him with my family. We've all been so afraid to mention him, like it would break us. But maybe remembering the good times could help us heal together. And maybe... maybe I could start sleeping better, without the nightmares haunting me every night.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you could take this week?",
    "Client: I... I think I could look through our old photo albums. I've avoided them for years, but maybe it's time to remember the happy moments. And maybe... maybe I could reach out to the youth center, just to ask about volunteer opportunities. It's terrifying, but also... it feels right.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about our session today?",
    "Client: It's been intense. I'm exhausted, emotionally drained. But there's also this... I don't know, a glimmer of something new. Like I've taken a tiny step forward. It hurts, but it's a different kind of hurt. More like... growing pains, maybe? I'm grateful, but also scared about what comes next.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for your courage today. We'll continue this journey together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I never thought I'd be able to talk about this. It's overwhelming, but I feel... heard. Understood. Like maybe there's hope after all. I'm dreading our next session, but also... looking forward to it, in a way. Is that strange?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a natural part of the healing process.",
    "Client: I see. Well, I guess I'll try to hold onto this tiny bit of hope until next time. It's not much, but it's more than I've had in years. Thank you for... for helping me see that there might be a way forward."
