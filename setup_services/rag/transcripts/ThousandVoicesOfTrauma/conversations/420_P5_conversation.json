    "Therapist: Hello, Ali. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Sarah. I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares lately about that day at the zoo. It's like I can still hear the screams and see the blood...",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you ready?",
    "Client: I think so... but I'm not entirely sure what that means. Can you explain it a bit more? I'm worried it might make things worse.",
    "Therapist: Of course. It's revisiting the memory to process it. What concerns you most?",
    "Client: Well, I'm afraid that talking about it in detail will make the nightmares worse. Or that I might panic and not be able to handle it. It's been so hard just trying to avoid thinking about it all this time.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace and I'll support you throughout.",
    "Client: Okay, that's reassuring. So, what exactly will we be doing? Do I just... start talking about what happened?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the event in present tense, as if it's happening now. I'll guide you.",
    "Client: In the present tense? That sounds intense. I'm not sure if I can do that without breaking down. What if I can't get through it?",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel emotional. We can pause anytime you need. Your safety is priority.",
    "Client: Alright, I appreciate that. I guess I'm just scared of reliving it all again. It was so horrific... seeing that poor child being attacked. I still feel guilty for not doing more.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are normal. This process helps reduce PTSD symptoms over time.",
    "Client: I hope so. I really want to get better, for my family's sake too. They've been so patient with me. How long will this take? Will we do this every session?",
    "Therapist: We'll do this for several sessions, adjusting as needed. Your progress determines the pace.",
    "Client: Okay, I think I understand better now. It's still scary, but I'm willing to try. Is there anything I should do to prepare myself before we start?",
    "Therapist: Just remember to breathe. You're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Alright, I'll try my best. I'm ready... I think. Just... please stop me if it looks like I'm getting too overwhelmed, okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Your well-being is my priority. Let's start when you're comfortable."
