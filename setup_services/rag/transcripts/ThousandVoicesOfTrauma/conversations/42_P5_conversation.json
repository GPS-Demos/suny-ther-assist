    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit anxious, to be honest. Work has been really stressful lately, and I've been having trouble sleeping. The cyberbullying incident keeps popping into my mind, especially at night.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you familiar with this?",
    "Client: Not really. I've heard you mention it before, but I'm not sure what it entails. Can you explain it to me? I'm feeling a bit nervous about trying something new.",
    "Therapist: Of course. It's a technique to process traumatic memories. Ready to learn more?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm just worried about reliving those awful moments. The online harassment was so intense, and I felt so helpless. I'm not sure I'm strong enough to face it again.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I appreciate your understanding. Can you tell me more about what we'll actually be doing? Will I have to talk about every detail of what happened?",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit the memory gradually. You'll describe it aloud while I guide you. Thoughts?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a mix of emotions. Part of me wants to get past this, but another part is terrified. Will this really help me overcome my anxiety about going online or using social media again?",
    "Therapist: Many find it helpful for reducing anxiety. It may be challenging, but you're resilient.",
    "Client: Thank you for saying that. I do want to feel better and move past this. I miss connecting with friends online without fear. How long will this process take? Will we do this every session?",
    "Therapist: We'll do this for several sessions, adjusting as needed. Your progress determines the pace.",
    "Client: Okay, that makes sense. I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still nervous, but I think I'm ready to give it a try. Will you be there to support me if it gets too overwhelming?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'll be here throughout. We can pause anytime you need. You're in control.",
    "Client: That's comforting to know. I think I can do this with your support. Is there anything I should do to prepare for our next session when we start this process?",
    "Therapist: Just come as you are. Your willingness is all we need. Any other questions?",
    "Client: I think that covers most of my concerns for now. Thank you for explaining everything so patiently. I feel more prepared and a little less anxious about trying this technique.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your courage is admirable. Shall we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that's good. I feel more grounded now and I'm actually looking forward to our next session, despite my nerves. Thank you again for your support and guidance.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, Sarah. See you next week."
