    "Therapist: Mrs. Johnson, today we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. I've been dreading this part. The idea of reliving that horrible day with the police... it makes my heart race just thinking about it. I've spent so long trying to forget, you know? Why do we have to bring it all back up?",
    "Therapist: Your hesitation is understandable. This process, while challenging, aims to help you heal. Shall we discuss how it works?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I need to understand why we're doing this. It feels like we're opening old wounds, and at my age, I'm not sure I have the strength for it anymore. But I trust you, so I'm willing to listen.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for your trust. Imaginal exposure helps by processing traumatic memories. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about falling apart. What if I can't handle it? I've kept it together for so long, for my family's sake. And frankly, I'm scared of what might come out. There's so much anger and pain I've bottled up over the years. Will this make things worse?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace, and I'll support you throughout. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's somewhat reassuring. But can you tell me more about what to expect? Will I have to close my eyes and relive everything in detail? The thought of that makes me feel panicky.",
    "Therapist: You'll describe the event aloud while I guide you. We can pause anytime. Your safety is our priority.",
    "Client: Okay, that helps a bit. I appreciate your patience with all my questions. It's just... this is bringing up so many emotions. I feel vulnerable, like I'm about to expose a part of myself I've hidden away for decades. But I also feel a glimmer of hope. Maybe this could help me finally move past what happened?",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. This process can indeed lead to healing. How else can I support you?",
    "Client: Thank you, that means a lot. I guess I'm wondering, after we do this, will I be able to talk about what happened without feeling so overwhelmed? It's affected my relationships, especially with my grandchildren. I want to be able to discuss our family history without breaking down.",
    "Therapist: Many find it easier to discuss their experiences after this process. Your goal is achievable.",
    "Client: That gives me some hope. I've carried this burden for so long, it's hard to imagine life without it. But I'm willing to try. I want to be free from these memories that have haunted me. I want to be present for my family without this shadow looming over me. So, even though I'm scared, I think I'm ready to take this step.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is inspiring. Shall we begin with some relaxation exercises first?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would help. My hands are shaking a bit, and my heart is racing. Some relaxation would be good. And... thank you. For listening, for understanding. It means more than you know to have someone really hear me after all these years.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Let's start with deep breathing. Close your eyes when you're ready."
