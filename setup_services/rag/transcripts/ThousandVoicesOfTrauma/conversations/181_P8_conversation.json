    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. I can still see the images so clearly, you know? The violence, the shouting, the fear on people's faces. It's all there, like it just happened yesterday.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: My heart is pounding. I can feel this tightness in my chest, like I can't get enough air. And my hands are shaking a little. It's like my body is reacting to something that's not even happening anymore. I keep thinking about how helpless I felt, watching it all unfold and not being able to do anything.",
    "Therapist: I see. How do these physical sensations connect to your emotions?",
    "Client: I guess... I'm feeling scared. But also angry. Angry that this happened, angry that I couldn't stop it. And there's this overwhelming sense of sadness too. It's like a heavy weight on my shoulders. I'm sad for the people who were hurt, sad for the world that allows this kind of hatred to exist.",
    "Therapist: Those are powerful emotions. What thoughts are accompanying them?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why did this have to happen?\" And then I wonder if I could have done something, anything, to prevent it or help. But I know that's not rational. I couldn't have stopped it. But then I feel guilty for not trying harder. It's like this loop of thoughts that I can't escape from.",
    "Therapist: How does this experience relate to your broader trauma journey?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a reminder of how unfair and cruel the world can be. I've always tried to see the good in people, but after witnessing that... it's shaken my faith in humanity, you know? And it's made me more anxious in public spaces. I'm always on edge, always watching for signs of trouble. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: I hear you. What do you notice about how you're coping now?",
    "Client: Well, I... I guess I'm talking about it more openly now. Before, I would just try to push it down, ignore it. But now, even though it's painful, I'm facing it head-on. And I'm here, doing this therapy. That's something, right? It's hard, but I think it's helping. I don't feel as overwhelmed by the memories as I used to.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. How else has your perspective shifted?",
    "Client: I'm starting to realize that while I can't change what happened, I can control how I respond to it. I'm trying to channel some of that anger and sadness into something positive. I've been looking into volunteering for organizations that promote racial harmony. It feels like a small step, but it gives me a sense of purpose.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful shift. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm learning to be kinder to myself. I used to beat myself up for not doing more during the incident, but now I understand that I was in shock. I'm trying to accept that I did the best I could in that moment. And I'm starting to see that by working through this trauma, I'm becoming stronger. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm on the right path.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of emotions, really. There's a sense of relief, like I'm finally giving myself permission to heal. But there's also this sadness, you know? Sadness for the person I was before this happened, for the innocence I lost. And yet, there's a glimmer of hope too. Hope that I can use this experience to become more compassionate, more understanding of others who've been through trauma.",
    "Therapist: That's very insightful. What do you want to focus on moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I want to work on feeling safe again. Not just physically safe, but emotionally safe too. I want to be able to trust people and situations without constantly being on high alert. And I want to find a way to honor the memory of what happened without letting it control my life. Maybe by sharing my story, I can help others who've been through similar experiences.",
    "Therapist: Those are meaningful goals. How do you feel about our session today?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've released some of the pressure that's been building up inside me. It's still painful to talk about, but I don't feel as overwhelmed by it anymore. I'm grateful for this space to process everything. It's hard work, but I feel like I'm making progress, even if it's slow.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. We'll continue next time. How would you like to close today?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to take a moment to just breathe. To remind myself that I'm here, I'm safe, and I'm moving forward. Maybe we could do a quick grounding exercise? Something to help me transition back to the present moment before I leave. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's do that now."
