    "Therapist: Welcome back, Ahmed. Are you ready to continue our exposure session?",
    "Client: I think so, yes. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay. So, last time we talked about my experience with the cult. I was thinking about the day I first attended one of their meetings. It was in this old warehouse on the outskirts of town. I remember feeling both excited and apprehensive as I approached the building.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: As I walked in, the smell hit me first. It was a mix of incense and something else I couldn't quite place. The room was dimly lit, with candles everywhere. There were about 30 people, all dressed in white robes. I felt out of place in my regular clothes.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I remember feeling uncomfortable, but also curious. The leader, a tall man with piercing blue eyes, approached me. He smiled, but it didn't reach his eyes. He put his hand on my shoulder and said, \"Welcome, brother. We've been waiting for you.\" I felt a chill run down my spine.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: I wanted to leave, but I felt frozen in place. The leader guided me to a circle where others were seated on the floor. They started chanting something in a language I didn't understand. I sat down, feeling trapped. My heart was racing, and I was sweating. I kept telling myself I could leave anytime, but deep down, I knew it wouldn't be that easy.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: The chanting got louder, and people started swaying. Someone handed me a cup with a strange-smelling liquid. I didn't want to drink it, but everyone was staring at me expectantly. I felt pressured, scared. I took a small sip, and it tasted bitter. That's when I realized I might be in real danger.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. Keep going.",
    "Client: I started feeling dizzy, and the room seemed to spin. The faces around me became distorted, almost demonic. I wanted to scream, to run, but my body wouldn't respond. I felt like I was falling into a dark pit. I... I can't... It's too much.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) I'm sorry, it just feels so real again. I can still taste that bitter drink, still see those faces. I feel so ashamed that I let myself get into that situation.",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. You're incredibly strong.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to believe that sometimes. After that first meeting, I kept going back. It's like I was under a spell. They made me feel special, chosen. But every time, I lost a bit more of myself. It took me years to finally break free.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of breaking free.",
    "Client: I am, in a way. But I also feel angry at myself for wasting so much time, for believing their lies. I lost touch with my family, my friends. I missed my sister's wedding, my nephew's birth. I can never get that time back.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Keep expressing them.",
    "Client: Sometimes I have nightmares about it. I dream that I'm back there, trapped. I wake up in a cold sweat, terrified that it wasn't just a dream. It's been years, but it still affects me. I struggle to trust people now, always wondering if they have hidden agendas.",
    "Therapist: That's a natural response. You're processing it well.",
    "Client: I guess so. It's just... I feel like I should be over it by now. But certain things still trigger me. Like the smell of incense, or seeing people in white robes. Even large gatherings sometimes make me anxious. I worry that I'll never fully recover.",
    "Therapist: Recovery takes time. You're making progress.",
    "Client: You're right. I know I've come a long way. I can talk about it now without completely breaking down. And I've reconnected with my family. They've been so supportive, even though they don't fully understand what I went through. I'm grateful for that.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant achievement. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. It helps to talk about it like this. To face those memories head-on instead of trying to bury them. It's painful, but I think it's helping me process everything. I just hope that one day, these memories won't have such a strong hold on me.",
    "Therapist: They won't. You're doing the work.",
    "Client: I hope you're right. I want to be able to move forward, to trust again, to not let this experience define me. It's a part of my past, but it doesn't have to control my future, right?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. You're on the right path.",
    "Client: Thank you for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel a bit lighter after each session. Like I'm slowly but surely reclaiming parts of myself that I thought were lost forever.",
    "Therapist: You're very welcome. Shall we end here today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. This session was intense, but I'm glad we did it. Thank you again for your support and guidance.",
    "Therapist: You did excellent work today, Ahmed. Take care."
