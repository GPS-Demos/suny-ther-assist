    "Therapist: Welcome back, Mrs. Johnson. Are you ready to continue our imaginal exposure exercise today?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with your SUDS rating. How distressed are you feeling right now, on a scale of 0 to 100?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 40. My stomach's a bit tight, but I'm trying to stay calm.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Let's begin. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day in the office...",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Alright... I'm there. I can see the fluorescent lights, smell the coffee from the break room. My boss calls me into his office...",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue...",
    "Client: He... he closes the door. I feel trapped. My heart's racing now. He's standing too close, I can smell his cologne. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's up to 65. My palms are sweating, and I feel dizzy.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: He's touching my shoulder. I want to run, but I'm frozen. I hear myself say \"No,\" but it's like I'm outside my body. The shame is crushing me.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: (Voice shaking) 80. I feel like I can't breathe. It's like it's happening all over again.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Remember, this is a memory. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I push him away. He looks angry. I'm terrified he'll fire me. I need this job. I feel so powerless, so small.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's at 90. My chest is so tight. I feel like I might be sick.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it.",
    "Client: I run out of his office. I'm shaking so hard I can barely walk. I lock myself in the bathroom and cry. I feel so dirty, so ashamed.",
    "Therapist: And now?",
    "Client: (Sobbing) It's still at 90. I can't... I can't do this anymore.",
    "Therapist: You can. You're incredibly strong. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Inhales shakily) Okay... okay. I'm trying. I see myself in the mirror. I look so broken. But... but I straighten my clothes. I wash my face.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's happening now?",
    "Client: I... I leave the bathroom. I go back to my desk. I'm numb, but I'm moving. My coworker asks if I'm okay. I lie and say I am.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: The SUDS is down to 75. I feel drained, but... but also a little proud that I got through it.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You've shown incredible courage.",
    "Client: (Sighs) Thank you. I... I think I can open my eyes now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Drained. But... maybe a little lighter? My SUDS is down to about 50 now.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've done important work today.",
    "Client: I never thought I could talk about it like this. It's still hard, but... it feels different now.",
    "Therapist: Different how?",
    "Client: Like... like maybe I'm not as powerless as I thought. Like maybe I can face this.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: Down to 35. I feel... I feel okay. Tired, but okay.",
    "Therapist: You've made significant progress today. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's scary, but... I think I'm ready. I want to keep going.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. We'll pick up here next session. For now, let's work on grounding you..."
