    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Patel. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is terrified of reliving that day. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I suppose we should. *deep breath*",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in my car. It's a crisp autumn morning, and I'm driving to work. The leaves are just starting to turn golden. I remember thinking how beautiful it looked...",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I approach the intersection. The light is green, so I start to go through. Then... then I see this blur from the corner of my eye. It's... it's a truck, and it's not slowing down.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Oh God... my heart is racing. I can feel the panic rising in my chest. I... I want to move, to do something, but I'm frozen. It's like time has slowed down.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 70. I can feel my palms getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember to breathe. What happens next?",
    "Client: The truck... it slams into the passenger side of my car. There's this deafening crash, and I feel my body being thrown to the side. The windows... they're shattering, and I can feel the glass cutting my skin.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What do you hear?",
    "Client: I hear... I hear the screeching of metal, the blaring of horns. And then... silence. For a moment, everything goes quiet, and all I can hear is my own ragged breathing.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My chest feels tight. It's like I'm back there again.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What do you notice next?",
    "Client: I... I smell gasoline. And something burning. I'm afraid the car might explode. I try to move, but my leg is trapped. I can taste blood in my mouth.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 85. I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you survived this. You're here now. What happens after?",
    "Client: I hear sirens in the distance. People are shouting outside the car. Someone... someone is trying to open my door, but it's jammed. I'm starting to feel dizzy from the pain.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. I keep thinking about my family, wondering if I'll ever see them again. I'm angry too... angry at the truck driver, angry at myself for not seeing it coming.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: The firefighters arrive. They're using some kind of tool to cut through the car. The noise is awful, like a shrieking metal demon. I can feel the vibrations through my whole body.",
    "Therapist: How are you coping with this memory?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. My heart is pounding. But... but I know I'm here, telling you about it. I'm safe now.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Keep going. What do you experience as they're working?",
    "Client: I'm in and out of consciousness. The pain is... it's overwhelming. Every movement sends shockwaves through my body. I hear them talking, saying something about my leg being crushed.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: There's... there's a firefighter. He's holding my hand, telling me to stay awake. His voice is calm, reassuring. It's... it's like an anchor in all this chaos.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Grateful. So incredibly grateful. In all this terror and pain, there's this... this human connection. It gives me hope.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 60. Focusing on that moment of connection helps.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens as they get you out?",
    "Client: They finally cut through the car. As they pull me out, the pain intensifies. I scream... I can't help it. They're careful, but every movement is agony.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with it. What do you experience next?",
    "Client: I'm on a stretcher. The light is so bright... it hurts my eyes. I can hear the paramedics talking rapidly, but I can't make out the words. Everything feels... surreal.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel at this point?",
    "Client: Heavy. So incredibly heavy. And yet... disconnected. Like I'm floating above myself, watching it all happen. The pain is there, but it feels... distant.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response to extreme stress. What happens in the ambulance?",
    "Client: It's a blur of motion and noise. The siren is wailing. I'm in and out of consciousness. I remember... I remember one of the paramedics. She keeps talking to me, asking me questions. I try to answer, but my words come out slurred.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking during this time?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm scared. But also... determined. I keep thinking about my family, my children. I need to survive for them. It's like... like a mantra in my head.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful motivator. How does the memory continue?",
    "Client: We arrive at the hospital. There's a flurry of activity. Doctors and nurses swarming around me. I'm whisked away to surgery. The last thing I remember is the anesthesiologist telling me to count backward from 100.",
    "Therapist: And how do you feel now, recalling all of this?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. My heart is still racing a bit. But... but I also feel a sense of... I don't know, accomplishment? Like I've faced this memory head-on.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. What's your final distress level?",
    "Client: I'd say... about a 40 now. It's still there, but it feels more manageable.",
    "Therapist: You've done remarkably well today. How do you feel about the session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, honestly. But also... lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common and positive response. Let's take a few deep breaths together to close out.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Thank you. This... this wasn't easy, but I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself. We'll end here for today. Well done."
