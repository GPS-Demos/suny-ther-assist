    "Therapist: Good morning, Esther. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure exercise today?",
    "Client: Good morning, Dr. Johnson. I... I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with your current SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10. My stomach feels a little tight, but I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Now, close your eyes and recall the memory we discussed.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm back in the refugee camp. It's hot, dusty. I can smell sweat and hear children crying. My heart is starting to race a little.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: There's a commotion near the food distribution area. People are pushing, shoving. I'm trying to hold onto my daughter's hand. Suddenly, a man grabs my arm roughly. He's yelling something I can't understand. I'm... I'm scared.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 6. My palms are sweaty, and I feel shaky.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: The man is trying to pull me away from my daughter. I'm resisting, screaming for help. Other people are just watching. Why won't they help? I feel so helpless, so angry. My daughter is crying, and I can't protect her. I... I can't breathe...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Esther. You're doing great. SUDS?",
    "Client: (gasping) It's... it's an 8 now. My chest feels tight, and I'm trembling all over.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep breathing. What happens next?",
    "Client: Another man intervenes. He's speaking my language. He's trying to calm the situation. The first man lets go of me, but he's still yelling. I grab my daughter and hold her close. We're both shaking. I feel... I feel so ashamed that I couldn't protect her better.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: The fear is subsiding a bit, but the shame is still there. Maybe a 7?",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel that way. You did your best in a difficult situation.",
    "Client: (sighs) I know, but it's hard to believe sometimes. The memory of her terrified face... it haunts me.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's back down to a 6. I'm feeling less shaky, but still anxious.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Let's continue.",
    "Client: After the incident, we went back to our tent. I held my daughter all night. I couldn't sleep. Every noise made me jump. I felt so... vulnerable, so powerless. But also angry. Why did we have to live like this? Why did we have to flee our home?",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, Esther?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm surprised. The anger feels stronger now. My SUDS is about a 5, but it's different. Less fear, more... frustration, I guess?",
    "Therapist: That's insightful. Emotions can shift as we process memories.",
    "Client: Yes, I... I never realized how angry I was about the whole situation. Not just that man, but everything that led to us being there.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 4 again. I feel... drained, but also a bit lighter somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's common after processing difficult memories. How about we end here for today?",
    "Client: (exhales deeply) Yes, I think that would be good. Thank you, Dr. Johnson. This was hard, but... I think it helped.",
    "Therapist: You did excellent work today, Esther. Let's discuss what you've learned."
