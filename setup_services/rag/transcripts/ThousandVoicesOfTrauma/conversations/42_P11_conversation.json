    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. Going through that cyber bullying experience again, it just... it brought back so many emotions. I felt like I was right back there, you know? My heart was racing, and I could feel that same sense of panic and helplessness.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The isolation, I think. Even though it happened online, it felt so real and overwhelming. I remembered how I couldn't sleep, constantly checking my phone, afraid of what new horrible message I'd see. It's like... like the whole world was against me, and I had nowhere to turn.",
    "Therapist: How does that connect to your daily life now?",
    "Client: Well, I... I guess I still struggle with trust. Even though I'm self-employed and work alone, I'm always on edge about what people might be saying about me online. It affects my business, my relationships... I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop, you know?",
    "Therapist: I see. What did you learn about yourself today?",
    "Client: (long pause) I... I realized I'm stronger than I thought. Reliving that experience was hard, but I got through it. And talking about it now, I can see how far I've come. I'm not that same scared person anymore, even if I still have those moments of fear.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How might you use this strength?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe I could start putting myself out there more? For my business, I mean. I've been so afraid of negative comments or reviews, but maybe I can handle it better than I thought. And in my personal life too, maybe I could try to be more open with people instead of always expecting the worst.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a positive step. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: It's scary, but... also kind of exciting? Like, maybe I don't have to let this experience control me forever. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm still anxious about it. But there's a little glimmer of hope there too.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What else came up for you?",
    "Client: I... I realized how much anger I still have. Not just at the people who bullied me, but at myself for not standing up more. I keep thinking, \"If only I had done this\" or \"If only I had said that.\" It's... it's exhausting, carrying all that around.",
    "Therapist: How might you address that anger?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. I guess... maybe I need to work on forgiving myself? And maybe... maybe I need to find a way to use my experience to help others who are going through similar things. Turn it into something positive, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a thoughtful approach. How does that idea sit with you?",

    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a common and often healing perspective.",
    "Client: That's... that's good to hear. I just... I want to feel normal again, you know? Like I can go online or meet new people without this constant fear hanging over me. Today was hard, but... I think it helped. Like I'm starting to see a way forward.",
    "Therapist: You've shown a lot of courage today. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm nervous, but I want to keep going. This is the first time in a long time that I've felt like there might be light at the end of the tunnel. It's not easy, but... I think it's worth it. I want my life back, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... maybe we could work on some strategies for managing my anxiety when I'm online? And maybe... maybe start talking about how I can rebuild my confidence in my work and my relationships. Is that something we can do?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll work on that together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I really appreciate your help with all this. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't judge me for what happened. I know I have a long way to go, but... I'm starting to feel like maybe I can do this after all.",
    "Therapist: You're making great progress. How would you like to end today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to take a moment to just breathe and remind myself that I'm safe now. That what happened is in the past, and I'm here, in this room, working towards a better future. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's do that together."
