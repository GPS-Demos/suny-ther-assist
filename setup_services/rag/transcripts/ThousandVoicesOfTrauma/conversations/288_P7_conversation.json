    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Patel. Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Are you ready to revisit the car accident?",
    "Client: I think so, Dr. Johnson. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's perfectly normal. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm driving home from work. It's raining heavily, and visibility is poor. I'm gripping the steering wheel tightly, trying to focus on the road. Suddenly, I see headlights coming towards me in my lane. My heart starts racing, and I feel panic rising in my chest.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with that feeling.",
    "Client: The other car is getting closer. I try to swerve, but the road is so slippery. I can hear the screeching of tires. My body tenses up, and I'm bracing for impact. I can't breathe. I... I don't want to remember this part.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The crash is so loud. Glass is shattering everywhere. I feel a sharp pain in my chest as the airbag deploys. Everything is spinning. I can smell gasoline and burning rubber. I'm trapped, and I can't move. I'm so scared. I think I'm going to die.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I can hear people shouting outside the car. Someone's telling me to stay still, that help is coming. But I'm in so much pain, and I'm terrified. I keep thinking about my family, wondering if I'll ever see them again. The rain is still pouring in through the broken windows, and I'm shivering. I feel so helpless and alone.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory bravely. Continue.",
    "Client: The paramedics arrive. They're talking to me, but I can barely focus on their words. They're cutting me out of the car, and every movement sends waves of pain through my body. As they lift me onto the stretcher, I catch a glimpse of the other driver. He looks unharmed, and I feel a surge of anger. Why was he on the wrong side of the road? Why did this happen to me?",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel angry. Stay with those emotions.",
    "Client: In the ambulance, everything becomes a blur. The sirens are so loud, and the lights are blinding. I keep drifting in and out of consciousness. I'm scared I might not wake up again. I can hear the paramedics talking about my injuries, but I don't understand everything they're saying. I just want the pain to stop. I want to be home with my family.",
    "Therapist: You're doing exceptionally well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. Reliving it brings back all those feelings of fear and helplessness. But I also feel a bit relieved, like I'm starting to process it better. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. That's a positive sign.",
    "Client: I think what scares me most is how quickly everything changed. One moment I was just driving home, thinking about what to make for dinner, and the next, I was fighting for my life. It makes me realize how fragile everything is. I still get anxious when I'm in a car, especially when it's raining. But talking about it like this... it feels like I'm slowly regaining some control.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. Let's continue.",
    "Client: After arriving at the hospital, everything was chaotic. Doctors and nurses were rushing around, asking me questions, but I was struggling to stay conscious. The pain was overwhelming. I remember feeling so vulnerable lying there, unable to move, surrounded by strangers. They were cutting off my clothes, attaching monitors, and I felt completely exposed and helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The next few days in the hospital were a blur of pain, medication, and worried faces. My husband and children visited, and seeing their fear and concern was almost worse than the physical pain. I felt guilty for putting them through this. The doctors kept talking about my recovery, but all I could think about was whether I'd ever feel safe again. The accident replayed in my mind constantly, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I could have done something to prevent it.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have those thoughts. You're processing them well.",
    "Client: As I started to recover physically, the emotional impact hit me harder. I had nightmares about the crash almost every night. During the day, loud noises would make me jump, and the sound of screeching tires would send me into a panic. I felt like I was constantly on edge, waiting for something terrible to happen again. It was exhausting, and I didn't feel like myself anymore. I wanted to be strong for my family, but inside, I felt like I was falling apart.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength by sharing this. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: It's still difficult to talk about, but I feel... lighter, somehow. Like I'm starting to see the accident as something that happened to me, not something that defines me. I know I have a long way to go, but being able to talk about it without completely breaking down feels like progress. Thank you for guiding me through this, Dr. Johnson.",
    "Therapist: You've done remarkably well today. Let's end here."
