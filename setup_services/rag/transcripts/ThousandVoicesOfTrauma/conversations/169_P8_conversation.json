    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is foggy, you know? I can still see the floodwaters rising, hear the sound of the wind... It's all so vivid. My heart is racing a bit, and I feel this tightness in my chest. It's hard to shake off the memory of losing my home, everything we built...",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I think. No, wait... it's more like helplessness. Yeah, that's it. I feel so powerless, like I did when the flood hit. It's... it's overwhelming. I keep thinking about how quickly everything changed, how we lost so much in just a matter of hours. And then... then I remember my neighbor, Maria. She... she didn't make it. God, I can't believe she's gone.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. How does remembering Maria affect you?",
    "Client: It's... it's crushing. Maria was more than a neighbor, she was like family. We'd known each other for years, shared so many moments. And now... now she's just gone. I keep replaying that last time I saw her, waving from her porch, telling me not to worry. If only I'd insisted she come with us... maybe... maybe she'd still be here.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind about that?",
    "Client: I... I feel guilty. Like I should have done more. I know, logically, that I couldn't have forced her to leave, but... but there's this voice in my head saying I didn't try hard enough. And then I feel angry, you know? Angry at the storm, at the world, at myself. It's not fair. None of it is fair. And I'm... I'm scared. What if it happens again? What if next time it's my family? I don't know if I could handle losing anyone else.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when the event first happened?",
    "Client: They're... they're not as intense, I guess. When it first happened, I was numb. I couldn't process anything. Now, it's like... like I'm finally feeling everything I couldn't back then. It hurts, but... but it's also a relief, in a way? Like I'm finally acknowledging what happened. But it's also terrifying. I'm afraid if I let myself feel too much, I'll just... break.",
    "Therapist: What do you mean by \"break\"?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like... if I fully accept what happened, if I really let myself feel all of it, I'll lose control. I'll fall apart and won't be able to put myself back together. I've been trying so hard to be strong for my family, to rebuild our lives. But underneath... I'm so fragile. I feel like I'm hanging on by a thread, and one strong gust could just... shatter me.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you share this?",
    "Client: I... I feel tense. My shoulders are tight, and my stomach is in knots. It's like my whole body is bracing for impact, you know? Like it's expecting another disaster. I can feel my heart pounding, and my hands are a bit shaky. It's... it's exhausting, always feeling on edge like this.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I need to feel safe. God, I just want to feel safe again. To know that my family is okay, that we're not going to lose everything again. I want... I want to be able to remember Maria without this crushing guilt. I want to be able to look at rain without panicking. I just... I want my life back. The life I had before all of this.",
    "Therapist: How might you start to create that sense of safety?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe by talking about it more? This is hard, but it also feels... necessary. Like I'm finally facing it instead of running from it. And... and maybe by doing more to prepare. Having emergency plans, supplies. It won't prevent a disaster, but... but it might help me feel more in control. And... and I think I need to let myself grieve. For Maria, for our old life. I've been pushing it away for so long...",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful approach. How does it feel to consider these steps?",
    "Client: It's... it's scary, but also a little hopeful? Like maybe there's a way forward. It's not going to be easy, and I know I can't change what happened. But maybe... maybe I can learn to live with it. To honor Maria's memory and rebuild, not just our home, but our sense of safety. It's overwhelming, but... but I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you could take this week?",
    "Client: I... I think I could start by creating an emergency kit. Just something small, with essentials. It might help me feel more prepared. And... and maybe I could look into some local support groups? For people who've been through similar experiences. I've been so isolated, it might help to talk to others who understand.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like positive steps. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired, but in a good way? Like I've finally started to unpack this heavy burden I've been carrying. There's still so much to process, but... but I feel a little lighter. A little more hopeful. It's like... like I can see a tiny glimmer of light at the end of this long, dark tunnel. And for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can make it through.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to talk more about Maria. About my memories of her, the good times we shared. Maybe... maybe that could help me start to process my grief, to remember her without so much pain and guilt. And... and I'd like to explore more ways to manage my anxiety. Especially when it comes to weather and natural disasters. I know I can't control nature, but... but maybe I can learn to control my reactions better.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How do you feel about ending our session here?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm okay with that. This was hard, but... but good. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I've taken a small step forward. Thank you for... for guiding me through this. For helping me face these memories and feelings. I know we have a long way to go, but... but I'm grateful for your support.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
