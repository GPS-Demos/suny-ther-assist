    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like my whole body is buzzing. That memory of the cyclone, it's so vivid now. I can still hear the wind howling and see the trees bending like they were made of rubber. It's strange, I thought I'd gotten past this, but reliving it just now... it's brought everything back.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's not as intense as it was during the actual event, but it's there, lurking. I keep thinking about how helpless I felt, trapped in my house, wondering if the roof would hold. And... and there's this guilt too. I survived when others didn't.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does that guilt manifest for you?",
    "Client: It's like a weight in my chest. I keep asking myself why I was spared when my neighbors... they lost everything. Their homes, their lives. I remember hearing their screams over the wind, and I... I couldn't do anything to help. I just froze.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. What thoughts are going through your mind as you recall this?",
    "Client: I keep thinking I should have done more. Maybe if I'd been braver, I could have helped someone. But then another part of me knows that was impossible. The storm was too strong, too dangerous. It's like my mind is at war with itself. Logically, I know I couldn't have done anything, but emotionally... I feel like a coward.",
    "Therapist: How do these conflicting thoughts affect you now?",
    "Client: They... they make me doubt myself in other areas of my life. Like, if I couldn't act then, how can I trust myself to act in other crises? It's affected my confidence at work, in my relationships. I find myself hesitating to take on new challenges or responsibilities. It's like that moment of freezing during the cyclone has spread to other parts of my life.",
    "Therapist: I understand. What physical sensations are you noticing as we discuss this?",
    "Client: My heart is racing a bit. My palms are sweaty, and there's this tightness in my throat. It's almost like my body is preparing for another disaster, even though I know I'm safe here. And there's this heaviness in my limbs, like I'm carrying around the weight of that day.",
    "Therapist: How does this compare to how you felt immediately after the cyclone?",
    "Client: It's... it's less intense now, but similar. Back then, I was in a constant state of high alert. I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat. Every loud noise made me jump. Now, it's more like a low-level anxiety that spikes when I think about it or when there's bad weather. But this exercise... it's brought back a lot of those initial feelings.",
    "Therapist: I see. What do you think this tells us about your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I guess... I guess it shows I've made progress, but there's still work to do. I thought I'd put this behind me, but clearly, it's still affecting me. It's frustrating, but also... maybe a bit hopeful? Like, now that I'm aware of how much it still impacts me, maybe I can work on it more directly.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. How might you apply what you've learned today?",
    "Client: Well, I think I need to be more honest with myself about how this experience has shaped me. Maybe... maybe I can start challenging some of those guilty thoughts, recognize that I did the best I could in an impossible situation. And perhaps I can work on rebuilding my confidence, taking small risks to prove to myself that I can act when needed.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like positive steps. How are you feeling now compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also somewhat lighter. It's like I've unpacked a heavy bag I've been carrying around. I'm tired, but there's a sense of relief too. And I feel... I don't know, maybe more connected to myself? Like I understand my reactions better now.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to explore more about how to challenge those guilty thoughts. And maybe we could talk about strategies for managing my anxiety when there's bad weather. I want to feel more in control, less at the mercy of my memories and fears.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. We'll definitely address those areas. How will you take care of yourself for the rest of the day?",
    "Client: I think I'll take a long walk by the beach. The sound of the waves usually calms me. And maybe I'll call my sister. I've been avoiding talking about this with my family, but I think it might help to open up a bit. Is that... is that a good idea?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful plan. How do you feel about ending our session here?",
    "Client: I think I'm ready. This was tough, but... good. Thank you for guiding me through this. I feel like I've taken a big step today, even if it was difficult.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. I'll see you next week."
