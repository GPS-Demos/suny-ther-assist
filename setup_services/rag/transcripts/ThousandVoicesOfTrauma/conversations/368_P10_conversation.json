    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I want you to describe the event as vividly as possible, in the present tense, as if it's happening right now. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling a bit jittery, but I want to give this a try.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with a SUDS rating. How distressed are you from 0 to 100?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 40 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath and begin when you're ready.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm at the hospital. It's supposed to be a routine check-up, but something feels off. The waiting room is eerily quiet. I'm sitting there, flipping through a magazine, but not really reading it. My palms are sweaty.",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: There are other patients, but they look tense. A nurse calls my name, and I follow her down a long, white corridor. The fluorescent lights are too bright, making everything look stark and unreal.",
    "Therapist: Continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: We enter an examination room, but it's different from usual. There's a group of people inside, all wearing scrubs. Before I can react, two of them grab me. I'm confused and scared. My heart is racing. I try to yell, but a hand covers my mouth.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: I... I can feel my heart pounding in my chest. My muscles are tense, and I'm struggling to breathe. They're pushing me onto the examination table, and I can't move. I'm... I'm terrified.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 70. This is intense.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... They're tying me down to the table. I can feel the cold metal against my skin. One of them is saying something about an experimental procedure. I don't understand what's happening. I want to scream, but I can't make a sound. My throat feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Focus on your breathing. You're doing great.",
    "Client: There's a lot of medical equipment around me. Beeping machines, sharp tools. Someone's prepping an IV. I'm trying to reason with them, pleading with my eyes, but they won't look at me. It's like I'm not even human to them.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"This can't be real. This isn't happening.\" But it is. I'm wondering if I'll ever see my family again. If anyone knows I'm here. I feel so helpless and alone.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. You're doing well.",
    "Client: They're injecting something into the IV. It burns as it goes in. My vision starts to blur, and I feel dizzy. I'm fighting to stay conscious, but it's getting harder. The room is spinning. I can hear them talking, but their voices sound far away.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 85. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm fading in and out of consciousness. When I'm awake, I can feel them doing things to me. Cutting, prodding. It hurts, but I can't move. I'm trapped in my own body. Time loses all meaning. I don't know how long I've been here.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: At some point, I hear commotion. There are new voices, shouting. The people who were working on me start to panic. I'm still groggy, but I can sense the change. Someone's untying me, telling me I'm safe now. But I don't feel safe. I'm shaking uncontrollably.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. My whole body aches. I feel violated and broken. They're helping me sit up, but I'm so weak. I can see police officers in the room now. One of them is talking to me, asking if I'm okay, but I can't find my voice.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What happens next?",
    "Client: They're moving me to a stretcher. As they wheel me out, I catch glimpses of the hospital in chaos. Other patients are being rescued. I'm trying to process what happened, but my mind feels foggy. I'm relieved it's over, but I'm also terrified. What if it happens again?",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaken up. My heart's still racing, and I feel a bit nauseous. But... I also feel a sense of relief. Like I've confronted something I've been avoiding for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's completely normal. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 60. Still high, but not as bad as before.",
    "Therapist: You've done an incredible job. Let's take a few deep breaths together.",
    "Client: Okay... *deep breath* That helps a little.",
    "Therapist: Good. Can you tell me three things you see in this room right now?",
    "Client: Um, I see the clock on the wall, your desk lamp, and the painting behind you.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Now, let's reflect on what you've just shared. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: I guess... how helpless I felt. And how vivid the memories still are. I thought I'd forgotten a lot of it, but it all came rushing back.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. How do you feel about having gone through this exercise?",
    "Client: It was tough, but... I feel like I've taken a step forward. Like I'm not letting the fear control me as much.",
    "Therapist: That's a great insight. How do you think this experience might impact your daily life?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I'll feel less anxious about medical appointments. And maybe I'll be able to talk about it more with my family and friends.",
