    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Patel. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit uneasy, to be honest. It's been years since I've really talked about my divorce, and I'm not sure how I'll react.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Where should I start?",
    "Therapist: Let's begin with the day you decided to tell your wife about the separation. Close your eyes and describe what you see.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm in our living room. It's evening, and the warm light from the lamp casts long shadows across the room. I can smell the lingering aroma of the curry we had for dinner. My wife, Priya, is sitting on the sofa, engrossed in her book. I... I feel my heart pounding in my chest, and my palms are sweaty.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I clear my throat, and Priya looks up. Her eyes... they're so trusting. I feel a wave of guilt wash over me. I say, \"Priya, we need to talk.\" She puts her book down, and I can see concern etched on her face.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, about a 6... maybe 7.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I sit down next to her, but I can't look her in the eye. I start fumbling with my words, \"Priya, I... I don't know how to say this, but... I think we should separate.\" There's a long silence. It feels like an eternity. When I finally look at her, her face is... it's like stone. She doesn't say anything, just stares at me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... God, I feel like the worst person in the world. My chest is tight, and I can hardly breathe. I want to take it all back, but I know I can't.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Priya finally speaks, her voice barely above a whisper. \"Is there someone else?\" she asks. I shake my head no, but I can see she doesn't believe me. The hurt in her eyes... it's unbearable. I try to explain about feeling unfulfilled, about wanting different things, but my words sound hollow even to me.",
    "Therapist: What's happening in your body right now?",
    "Client: My stomach is in knots. I feel nauseous, and my hands are shaking. I... I need a moment.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. Focus on your breath.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... Priya starts to cry silently. Tears rolling down her cheeks, but she makes no sound. It's worse than if she were sobbing. I reach out to comfort her, but she flinches away from my touch. That... that hurts more than anything.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: She stands up abruptly and walks to the window. Her back is to me, and I can see her shoulders shaking. I want to go to her, but I know I've lost that right. She turns to me and says, \"Twenty-five years. Twenty-five years, and this is how it ends?\" Her voice is filled with pain and anger. I don't know what to say.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What do you see, hear, feel?",
    "Client: I see the hurt and betrayal in her eyes. I hear the clock ticking loudly in the background. I feel... I feel like I'm suffocating under the weight of what I've done.",
    "Therapist: Keep breathing. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Priya walks out of the room without another word. I hear her footsteps on the stairs, then the bedroom door slamming shut. I'm left alone in the living room, the silence deafening. I put my head in my hands and start to cry. I've just destroyed the life we built together.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... I'm thinking I've made a terrible mistake. But at the same time, I feel... relief? And that makes me feel even worse. What kind of person feels relief at causing so much pain?",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have conflicting emotions. How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's still high... maybe a 7.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's continue.",
    "Client: I... I don't know how long I sit there. Eventually, I get up and go to the guest room. I can hear Priya crying through the walls, and each sob is like a knife in my heart. I lie on the bed, staring at the ceiling, unable to sleep. The weight of what I've done, the finality of it... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What do you wish you could do in that moment?",
    "Client: I wish I could turn back time. Take back my words. But I also know that even if I could, the problems would still be there. I'm torn between guilt and the certainty that this is necessary.",
    "Therapist: That's a difficult position to be in. How does your body feel now?",
    "Client: I feel drained. Exhausted. My eyes are burning from crying, and my head is pounding. But there's also this... hollowness in my chest.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's come down a bit. Maybe a 6 now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's continue with the next morning.",
    "Client: The next morning... I wake up, and for a moment, everything seems normal. Then it all comes crashing back. I can smell coffee from the kitchen, and I'm surprised Priya is up. I cautiously make my way downstairs. She's sitting at the table, her eyes red and puffy. She looks up when I enter, and her gaze is... it's like looking at a stranger.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: She pushes a piece of paper towards me. It's a list of divorce lawyers. Her voice is cold when she says, \"I want this over with as quickly as possible.\" I nod, unable to speak. The finality of it... it's like a punch to the gut.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel like I'm watching my life crumble around me. Even though I initiated this, the reality of it is... it's overwhelming. I want to beg for forgiveness, to try and fix things, but I know it's too late.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's back up to a 7.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing well.",
    "Client: I try to talk to her, to explain myself better, but she holds up her hand. \"I don't want to hear it,\" she says. \"Just... just go.\" I can see the pain in her eyes, the betrayal. I gather some clothes and leave the house. As I'm driving away, I look back and see her standing at the window. She looks so small, so vulnerable. I've never felt more alone in my life.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind as you drive away?",
    "Client: I'm thinking about all the years we spent together. The good times, the bad times. I'm wondering if I'm making the biggest mistake of my life. But I also feel... I feel like I can breathe for the first time in years. And that contradiction... it's tearing me apart.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have mixed emotions. How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around a 6 now.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well today. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Look around the room and name five things you can see.",
    "Client: I see... the painting on the wall, the potted plant in the corner, your desk, the clock, and the bookshelf.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, take a deep breath. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. But also, somehow lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after these sessions. You've shown great courage today. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we end?",
    "Client: No, I... I think I'm okay for now. It was harder than I expected, but... I think it was necessary.",
    "Therapist: You've made excellent progress. Remember to use the coping strategies we've discussed if you feel overwhelmed later. We'll continue working through this in our next session.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I appreciate your help.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
