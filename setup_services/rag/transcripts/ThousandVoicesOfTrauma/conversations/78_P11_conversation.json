    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart is still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. Going through that memory of the workplace incident again was really intense. I could almost smell the coffee that had spilled on the floor when my colleague collapsed. It's like I was right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: What stood out to you most about revisiting that experience?",
    "Client: The sense of helplessness, I think. Watching my coworker fall and not knowing what to do... It was overwhelming. I kept thinking, \"I should be doing something,\" but I just froze. And then all the chaos afterward, people rushing around, the ambulance arriving. It all felt so loud and confusing in my head.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to go through that memory today compared to previous sessions?",
    "Client: It was... slightly easier, I suppose? I mean, it's still really difficult, and I felt anxious throughout. But I didn't feel as panicked as I did the first time we did this. I was able to stay with the memory a bit more, if that makes sense. It's like... I'm starting to see it as a past event rather than something that's happening right now.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant observation. How do you think this relates to your day-to-day experiences?",
    "Client: Well, I've noticed that I'm not having as many flashbacks at work. I still get anxious, especially when I'm in the break room where it happened, but it doesn't consume me like it used to. I'm able to remind myself that I'm safe now, which helps. It's like... the memory is still there, but it's not controlling me as much.",
    "Therapist: How does this progress align with your recovery goals?",
    "Client: It feels like a step in the right direction. One of my main goals was to be able to function at work without constant fear and anxiety. And while I'm not completely there yet, I can see improvement. I'm more present during meetings, and I've even started having lunch in the break room again, which I couldn't do for months after the incident.",
    "Therapist: What strategies have you found most helpful in managing your reactions?",
    "Client: The breathing exercises we've practiced have been really helpful. When I start feeling overwhelmed, I focus on my breath, and it helps ground me. Also, reminding myself that the event is in the past and that I'm safe now... that's been key. Oh, and writing in my journal after work has helped me process my feelings better.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about continuing with the exposure therapy?",
    "Client: It's tough, I won't lie. There are times when I dread coming to sessions because I know we'll be revisiting that memory. But... I can see that it's helping. It's like... each time we do it, the memory loses a bit of its power over me. So, even though it's hard, I want to keep going. I want to get to a point where I can think about what happened without feeling like I'm right back in that moment of panic.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is commendable. What else would you like to share about today's session?",
    "Client: I guess... I'm proud of myself for sticking with this. There were moments today when I wanted to stop the imaginal exposure, but I pushed through. And afterwards, even though I felt shaken up, there was also a sense of accomplishment. It's like... I'm facing this thing that's been haunting me, and slowly but surely, I'm taking back control. It's empowering, in a way.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How can we build on this for next time?",
    "Client: Maybe we could... I don't know, explore some of the guilt I still feel? Like, rationally I know I couldn't have prevented what happened, but there's still this nagging feeling that I should have done more. And perhaps we could work more on techniques for staying grounded when I'm at work? Sometimes I still find myself getting lost in worry about something similar happening again.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent suggestions. Is there anything else you'd like to address?",
    "Client: I think that covers the main things. Oh, actually, one more thing - I've been thinking about talking to my manager about what happened. I've been avoiding him since the incident, but maybe addressing it directly might help? I'm nervous about it, but it feels like a step I need to take. What do you think?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a brave and potentially beneficial step. Let's discuss that more next time.",
    "Client: Okay, yeah, that sounds good. Thank you for today. It was tough, but I'm glad we did it. I feel... I don't know, maybe a bit stronger? Like I'm making progress, even if it's slow. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Small steps lead to big changes. Well done today, Sarah."
