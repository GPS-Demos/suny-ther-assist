    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to dive into that animal attack again, and just thinking about it makes my heart race a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 5 out of 10 right now. Just talking about it brings back some of that tension.",
    "Therapist: Okay. When you're ready, close your eyes and take us back to that day.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Alright... I'm on my usual hiking trail near the coast. It's a beautiful day, the sun is shining, and I can hear the waves crashing in the distance. I'm alone, which I usually enjoy, but today it feels... different. There's this eerie quiet that I can't shake.",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: I see the dense bush on either side of the trail. The leaves are a vibrant green, almost too green. There's a bend in the path ahead, and I can't see what's beyond it. I'm walking slowly, my boots crunching on the gravel...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I hear a rustling in the bushes to my left. At first, I think it's just a bird or maybe a small marsupial. But then... oh God, I see these yellow eyes peering out at me. They're huge, and they're fixed right on me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe a 7? My palms are starting to sweat just thinking about those eyes.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Shaky breath) Okay... The eyes belong to a dingo. It's much larger than I expected, and its teeth... they're bared and gleaming. I freeze. I know I shouldn't run, but every instinct is screaming at me to get out of there. The dingo takes a step forward, and I can hear this low, guttural growl...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My heart is pounding so hard I can feel it in my throat. My legs are shaking, and there's this cold sweat breaking out all over. I want to run, but I'm paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The dingo lunges at me. I try to back away, but I stumble and fall. I can feel the gravel digging into my palms as I hit the ground. The dingo is on me in an instant. Its hot breath is on my face, and I can smell the... the rotting meat on its breath. Oh God, I thought I was going to die right there.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Remember, this is a memory. Stay with it.",
    "Client: (Breathing heavily) The dingo's teeth sink into my arm. The pain is... it's indescribable. Sharp and burning all at once. I'm screaming, but it feels like no sound is coming out. I'm thrashing, trying to push it off, but it's so strong. I can feel its claws digging into my chest as it holds me down.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I manage to grab a rock with my free hand. It's jagged and cuts into my palm, but I barely notice. I swing it as hard as I can at the dingo's head. There's a sickening thud, and it yelps, letting go of my arm. I hit it again and again until it finally backs off.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Terrified. Relieved. My whole body is shaking. The dingo is still there, circling, but it's keeping its distance now. I'm struggling to my feet, holding the rock out in front of me like a shield. My arm is bleeding badly, and the pain is... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What do you do?",
    "Client: I start backing away slowly, never taking my eyes off the dingo. It's watching me, licking its chops. I can see blood on its muzzle... my blood. I'm dizzy from the blood loss and the adrenaline. Every step feels like it might be my last.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's still high... maybe an 8? I can feel my heart racing just like it did that day.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) I keep backing away until I reach the bend in the trail. The dingo hasn't followed, but I can still see its eyes gleaming in the bushes. As soon as I round the corner, I turn and run. I'm stumbling, my vision blurry from tears and sweat. The pain in my arm is excruciating, but the fear of the dingo coming after me keeps me going.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking I might die out here. That no one knows where I am, that I could bleed out before I reach help. I'm angry at myself for hiking alone, for not being more prepared. And I'm... I'm praying. Praying to make it out alive.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those thoughts. What happens next?",
    "Client: I finally reach the trailhead. There's a couple getting ready to start their hike. They see me, covered in blood and dirt, and their faces... the shock and horror. The woman screams, and the man rushes towards me. I collapse, the adrenaline finally wearing off. They're calling for help, pressing something against my wound. I'm fading in and out of consciousness.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: Heavy. So heavy. The pain is... it's everywhere. My arm feels like it's on fire, and my chest aches where the dingo's claws dug in. I'm shivering uncontrollably, even though I feel hot. And there's this... this overwhelming relief. I made it. I survived.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe a 6? The relief is starting to outweigh the fear.",
    "Therapist: Good. Take us through what happens after that.",
    "Client: The ambulance arrives. The paramedics are asking me questions, but I can barely focus enough to answer. They're cutting away my shirt, cleaning my wounds. The sting of the antiseptic is nothing compared to the throbbing pain in my arm. They start an IV, and as the pain medication kicks in, everything starts to get hazy.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about how close I came to dying. About how I'll never be able to look at that trail the same way again. And I'm... I'm feeling guilty. Guilty that I couldn't stop the attack, that I wasn't stronger or smarter. That I let this happen.",
    "Therapist: It's important to remember that this wasn't your fault. How does your body feel now?",
    "Client: It feels... drained. Like I've run a marathon. My muscles are aching from the tension, and I feel this heaviness in my chest. But there's also this... this tingling sensation. Like my body is reminding me that I'm alive.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. Let's start to bring you back to the present. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 4 now. I can feel myself starting to relax a bit.",
    "Therapist: Good. Take a few deep breaths. When you're ready, open your eyes and come back to the room.",
    "Client: (Opens eyes, looks around) Wow... that was intense. I haven't let myself think about it in that much detail before.",
    "Therapist: You did an excellent job. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, to be honest. But there's also this sense of... I don't know, accomplishment? Like I faced it head-on for the first time.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You've taken a big step today. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay... yeah, that sounds good. I... I appreciate you guiding me through that. It was tough, but I think... I think it might be helping.",
    "Therapist: You've shown a lot of courage today, John. We'll continue to work through this together."
