    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. The pain in my back is acting up a bit, and I've been having more flashbacks about the earthquake lately. It's been tough to sleep.",
    "Therapist: I'm sorry to hear that. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you ready to discuss it?",
    "Client: Imaginal exposure? That sounds... intense. I'm not sure I understand what that means. Can you explain it to me?",
    "Therapist: Of course. It's a technique where you'll recount your trauma memory in detail. It helps process the event and reduce PTSD symptoms.",
    "Client: Wow, that sounds scary. I've been trying so hard not to think about the earthquake. Are you sure this is necessary?",
    "Therapist: I understand your concern. It can be challenging, but it's a crucial step in healing. How do you feel about trying?",
    "Client: I'm... nervous, to be honest. What if I can't handle it? What if it makes everything worse?",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. We'll go at your pace, and I'll support you throughout. Can you share more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about reliving the trauma. The shaking, the sounds, the fear... it was overwhelming. And with my back pain, I'm afraid it might trigger more physical discomfort too. Plus, I've been doing okay at work lately, and I don't want to mess that up by stirring up all these memories.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. Your safety is my priority. We'll take breaks if needed. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's... reassuring. I appreciate your understanding. I guess I'm willing to give it a try if you think it will help. But what exactly will we be doing?",
    "Therapist: You'll describe the earthquake in detail, including thoughts and feelings. We'll record it for homework. Ready to start?",
    "Client: Record it? That's unexpected. I'm not sure how I feel about that. Will I have to listen to it later? And what kind of details are we talking about here? I mean, there's so much that happened during and after the earthquake.",
    "Therapist: Yes, you'll listen to the recording between sessions. It aids processing. We'll focus on the most impactful moments.",
    "Client: Okay, I think I understand. It's just... it's been years since the earthquake, but sometimes it feels like yesterday. Especially when there's a loud noise or if I feel any shaking. Even being in tall buildings makes me nervous now. I used to love the view from my office on the 20th floor, but now I can barely look out the window without panicking.",
    "Therapist: Those reactions are common with PTSD. This technique can help reduce them. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: I guess so. I'm still nervous, but I trust you. And honestly, I'm tired of feeling this way. I want to be able to enjoy life again without constantly looking over my shoulder or fearing the ground beneath my feet. My wife and kids have been so patient with me, but I know they miss the old me too. So yes, let's do this. Where should I start?",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Start with where you were when the earthquake began. Take your time.",
    "Client: Okay. Well, I was at work. It was just after lunch, and I remember feeling so full from the burrito I had eaten. I was sitting at my desk, staring at my computer screen, when suddenly...",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue describing what happened next, including your thoughts and feelings."
