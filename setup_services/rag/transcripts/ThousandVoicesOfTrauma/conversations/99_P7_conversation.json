    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the event involving police brutality?",
    "Client: Okay... I was walking home from work late one night. It was dark, and I heard sirens. Suddenly, a police car pulled up beside me, and two officers got out. They started yelling at me to stop and put my hands up. I was confused and scared. I didn't know what was happening.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I tried to explain that I was just walking home, but they wouldn't listen. One officer grabbed my arm roughly and slammed me against the car. I felt a sharp pain in my shoulder. The other officer started patting me down aggressively. I was terrified. I kept thinking, \"What did I do wrong? Why is this happening to me?\"",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What were you feeling?",
    "Client: I felt... helpless. Angry. Scared. My heart was racing, and I could barely breathe. I wanted to run, but I knew that would make things worse. I felt like I was going to throw up. The officers kept yelling at me, asking for ID, accusing me of being in the area of a reported crime. But I hadn't done anything wrong!",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: It's hard to talk about... I remember the cold metal of the handcuffs as they put them on me. They were so tight, cutting into my wrists. I tried to tell them they were hurting me, but they ignored me. They threw me into the back of the police car, and I hit my head on the door frame. I was in pain, confused, and terrified.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I sat in the back of that car for what felt like hours. They were running my information, I guess. I could hear them talking and laughing outside, like this was just a normal night for them. But for me, my whole world was falling apart. I kept thinking about my family, my job... what if I went to jail? What would happen to me?",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: Finally, they came back and told me it was all a misunderstanding. They had the wrong person. They uncuffed me and let me go, just like that. No apology, nothing. I was left standing there on the street, rubbing my wrists, feeling... I don't know... violated? Angry? Relieved? All of it at once. I walked home in a daze, looking over my shoulder the whole time.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Talking about it... it brings it all back. My hands are shaking, and I feel that same fear and anger rising up. But also... I feel a little relieved to finally tell someone. To have someone listen and believe me. It's been eating me up inside for so long.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard, but I want to get better. I want to be able to walk down the street without feeling afraid. I want to trust people in authority again. But right now, it feels impossible. Every time I see a police car, I tense up. I avoid going out at night. It's affecting my whole life.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. We'll continue to work on this.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It helps to know I'm not crazy for feeling this way. Sometimes I wonder if I'm overreacting, you know? Like, maybe it wasn't as bad as I remember. But then I'll have a nightmare about it, or I'll see something on the news about police brutality, and it all comes flooding back.",
    "Therapist: You're not overreacting. Your experience was traumatic.",
    "Client: Yeah... I guess it was. It's just hard to accept that something like this could happen to me. I've always tried to be a good citizen, you know? I follow the laws, I work hard... or at least I did before I lost my job. Now I feel like I don't know the rules anymore. Like the world isn't as safe as I thought it was.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to feel that way. Let's explore that further.",
    "Client: Okay. I guess... I feel like my trust in the system has been shattered. I used to believe that if you did nothing wrong, you had nothing to fear. But now I know that's not true. I could be walking home from work, minding my own business, and suddenly my whole life could be turned upside down. It makes me feel powerless.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great insight. How does that powerlessness affect you?",
    "Client: It affects everything. I'm always on edge now. I've become more isolated. I don't want to go out, especially at night. I've pushed away friends because I don't want to explain why I'm always canceling plans. My wife... she tries to understand, but I can see the frustration in her eyes. I'm not the same person I was before this happened.",
    "Therapist: It's important to acknowledge these changes. We'll work on coping strategies.",
    "Client: I hope so. I want to be that person again - the one who felt safe in his own neighborhood, who could laugh and enjoy life. But right now, it feels so far away. Every day is a struggle. I wake up with this weight on my chest, reliving that night over and over. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: You're taking important steps by talking about this. Let's end here for today.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you for listening. It's hard, but I think it helps to talk about it. I just hope that one day I can think about that night without feeling like this.",
    "Therapist: You've made great progress today. We'll continue next session."
