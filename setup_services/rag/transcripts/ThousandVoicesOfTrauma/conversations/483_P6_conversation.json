    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I understand why we're doing this.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Take a deep breath and begin when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in the office. It's early morning, and I'm the first one there. I can smell the coffee brewing, and I hear the hum of the air conditioning. I'm at my desk, organizing my files for the day when I hear the elevator ding. My stomach immediately tightens because I know it's her - my supervisor.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4. I'm feeling tense, but it's manageable.",
    "Therapist: Okay, continue.",
    "Client: She walks in, and I can feel her eyes on me. She doesn't say good morning, just marches straight to her office. I try to focus on my work, but I'm hyper-aware of her presence. Then, I hear her call my name. Her voice is sharp, cutting through the quiet office. My hands start to shake as I walk to her office.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. My heart is beating faster just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Keep going, you're doing well.",
    "Client: As I enter her office, she starts berating me about a report I submitted yesterday. She's saying I'm incompetent, that I'm too old to keep up with the job. Her words sting, and I feel myself shrinking. I want to defend myself, but my voice catches in my throat. I'm frozen, just standing there as she continues to berate me.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating at this point?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. I feel so helpless and humiliated.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really difficult. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) I can feel tears welling up in my eyes. I'm trying so hard not to cry in front of her. My chest feels tight, and I'm having trouble breathing. She keeps going on about how I'm dragging the team down, how I should consider early retirement. I feel so small, so worthless. I've worked here for 20 years, and now I'm being treated like this...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: (taking a shaky breath) It's a 9. I feel like I'm right back there, feeling all those awful emotions.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it if you can.",
    "Client: (nodding) She finally stops talking and just glares at me. I mumble an apology and practically run out of her office. I rush to the bathroom, lock myself in a stall, and let the tears flow. I'm shaking all over, feeling sick to my stomach. I can't believe this is happening to me. I've always been a good employee, always worked hard. Why is she treating me like this? Is it because of my age? My ethnicity? I feel so alone and scared.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: (wiping tears) It's still at a 9. I can feel the panic, the hurt, the anger... it's all so overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Let's stay with it a bit longer.",
    "Client: (nodding) I stay in the bathroom for what feels like hours, trying to compose myself. When I finally emerge, I feel drained and defeated. I return to my desk, but I can't focus on anything. The rest of the day is a blur. I just keep replaying her words in my head, feeling more and more worthless with each repetition. When it's time to leave, I practically run out of the office, desperate to get home where I feel safe.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating as you're leaving the office?",
    "Client: It's dropped to about a 7. I feel relief at leaving, but I'm dreading coming back tomorrow.",
    "Therapist: I see. How are you feeling now, as we finish this exercise?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm at about a 5 now. It was hard to go through that again, but I feel a bit lighter having shared it with you.",
    "Therapist: You did an excellent job. Let's take a few deep breaths together."
