    "Therapist: Good morning, John. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: Hey, Dr. Thompson. I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is dreading it. My stomach's in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to help you process these experiences. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I guess so. As ready as I'll ever be.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm back in Afghanistan. It's hot, so damn hot. The sun's beating down, and I can feel sweat trickling down my back. We're on patrol, me and... and Jake. God, Jake...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What's happening?",
    "Client: We're walking through this village. It's quiet, too quiet. I can hear our boots crunching on the dusty ground. Jake's to my left, scanning the windows of the buildings. He looks tense, we all are.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My heart's racing. I'm on edge, like every shadow could be a threat. I keep thinking about Jake's wife back home, how she's pregnant with their first kid.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling?",
    "Client: Uh, maybe a 60? It's... it's getting there.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're doing well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Right... So we're moving down this narrow street. Suddenly, there's a loud crack. Gunfire. I dive for cover, but Jake... he's not fast enough. I see him go down, blood spreading across his chest. I'm yelling, screaming for a medic, but deep down, I know... I know it's too late.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you experiencing?",
    "Client: I... I can't breathe. My hands are shaking as I try to apply pressure to his wound. There's so much blood. Jake's eyes are wide, he's gasping for air. I'm telling him, \"Hang on, buddy. Help's coming.\" But I can see the life draining from his eyes.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up there. Maybe 80? God, this is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. Remember, you're safe here. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: (deep breath) Okay... Jake's grip on my arm is weakening. I can hear the chaos around us, but it's like I'm in a bubble with him. He's trying to say something, but he can't get the words out. And then... then he's gone. Just like that. My best friend, gone.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in that moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm numb. Shocked. There's this hollow feeling in my chest. But at the same time, I'm angry. So damn angry. Why him? Why Jake?",
    "Therapist: Allow yourself to feel those emotions. They're a natural response to what you experienced.",
    "Client: (voice breaking) I keep replaying it in my head. If I had been faster, if I had seen the threat sooner... maybe Jake would still be alive. Maybe his kid would have a father.",
    "Therapist: John, remember what we've discussed about those thoughts. You did everything you could in that situation.",
    "Client: I know, I know. But it doesn't make it any easier. (pause) After Jake... after he died, everything's a blur. I remember being pulled away from his body, the sound of more gunfire. But all I could think about was how I was going to tell his wife.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. Sad. It's like I'm reliving that loss all over again.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's still pretty high. Maybe 75?",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, John. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you tell me five things you can see in this room?",
    "Client: Uh, okay. I see... your desk, the painting on the wall, the plant in the corner, my shoes, and the clock.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, let's continue. What happened after you were pulled away?",
    "Client: We... we completed the mission. But it felt hollow. Empty. When we got back to base, I had to write the report. Every word felt like a betrayal. How do you sum up a man's life, his sacrifice, in a few paragraphs?",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly difficult.",
    "Client: It was. And then... then came the hardest part. Calling Jake's wife. (long pause) I can still hear her voice when I told her. The way it cracked, the sob that followed. It haunts me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Guilt. Overwhelming guilt. And sadness. It's like this weight pressing down on my chest. I failed him. I failed her.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up there. 85, maybe 90.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, John. Remember, you're here in my office. You're safe.",
    "Client: (deep breath) Yeah... yeah, I know. It just feels so real.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Can you tell me what you see around you now, in the present?",
    "Client: I see... I see your office. The sunlight coming through the window. My hands... they're not covered in blood anymore. They're clean.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with the present. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I can hear the traffic outside. The hum of the air conditioning. It's... it's grounding me a bit.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Now, let's go back to that day. What happened after the phone call?",
    "Client: After I hung up... I just sat there. Staring at the wall. I couldn't move. Couldn't think. It was like everything had stopped. And then... then the anger came. I wanted to hit something, break something. But instead, I just... I just cried.",
    "Therapist: Allow yourself to feel those emotions, John. They're valid.",
    "Client: It's just... it's not fair, you know? Jake had so much to live for. He was going to be a dad. And now... now his kid will never know him.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Angry. Sad. Like the world is just... wrong. Like nothing makes sense anymore.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe 70?",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. Let's stay with this for a bit longer. What happened in the days following Jake's death?",
    "Client: It was a blur. We had a memorial service on base. I spoke at it, but I don't remember what I said. Everything felt numb. And then... then we had to pack up his things. That was... that was hard.",
    "Therapist: What was hard about it?",
    "Client: Just... seeing all his stuff. His photos, his letters from home. It made it real, you know? Like, this isn't just a bad dream. He's really gone.",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly difficult.",
    "Client: It was. And the whole time, I kept thinking about his wife. How she'd never see him again. How their child would never know their father. It just... it felt so unfair.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, John?",
    "Client: Tired. Really tired. But also... I don't know. Maybe a little lighter? Like talking about it is... is helping somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's good to hear. Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's down to maybe a 50 now.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today, John. How about we start winding down? Can you bring yourself back to the present moment?",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, I can do that. (deep breath) I'm here. In your office. It's... it's 2023, not 2010. Jake... Jake's gone, but I'm still here.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You're here, you're safe. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. But... but okay. Like I've run a marathon or something.",
    "Therapist: That's normal after an intense session like this. You've done really well today, John. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I just... I want to thank you. For listening. For helping me work through this. It's still hard, but... but I think it's getting easier.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, John. You're doing the hard work here. I'm just here to guide you. Is there anything you'd like to focus on for self-care this week?",
    "Client: I think... I think I might visit Jake's grave. I haven't been in a while. Maybe... maybe talk to him a bit.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good idea. Remember to be gentle with yourself. We'll pick this up in our next session. Take care, John.",
    "Client: Thanks, Doc. See you next week."
