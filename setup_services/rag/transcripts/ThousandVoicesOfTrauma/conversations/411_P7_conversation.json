    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Are you ready to revisit the hostage situation?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm at the bank, waiting in line to deposit some checks. It's a quiet morning, not many people around. Suddenly, I hear shouting and a loud bang. I turn to see three men with masks bursting through the doors, waving guns. My heart starts racing, and I freeze in place.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: One of the men yells for everyone to get down on the ground. I'm shaking as I lower myself, my knees feeling weak. The cold tile floor presses against my cheek. I can hear sobbing from somewhere nearby, and harsh whispers as the robbers argue about something.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure I can continue. My chest feels tight, just like it did then.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm trying. I remember the sound of shuffling feet, and then a rough hand grabbing my arm, pulling me up. One of the men drags me to the center of the room. He's shouting at the bank manager, demanding access to the vault. I can smell his sweat, see the wild look in his eyes through the mask. I'm terrified he's going to hurt me.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: The manager is hesitating, and the man holding me presses his gun to my temple. I can feel the cold metal, and I'm certain I'm going to die. My legs are shaking so badly, I think I might collapse. I close my eyes, thinking about my husband, my children...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a commotion outside. Police sirens. The robbers start panicking. The one holding me pushes me away roughly, and I fall to the ground. There's shouting, more gunshots. I curl up, covering my head, praying it will be over soon.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory courageously.",
    "Client: It felt like hours, but it was probably only minutes before the police stormed in. When it was finally over, I couldn't stop shaking. I remember a kind officer helping me up, asking if I was hurt. I couldn't even speak. I just nodded, tears streaming down my face.",
    "Therapist: You've done an excellent job. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. My heart is still racing a bit, but I feel better than I expected. It's strange, but talking about it like this... it doesn't feel as overwhelming as it used to.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive sign. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I think so too. It's still hard, but I feel like I can face the memory now without completely falling apart. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. It's a common part of the healing process.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I remember feeling so helpless during the incident, but now, talking about it, I feel stronger. Like I'm taking back some control.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without breaking down. It's still painful, but it feels different now. Less overwhelming, more... manageable, I suppose.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How do you feel about continuing these sessions?",
    "Client: I think I'd like to continue. It's difficult, but I can see how it's helping. Each time we do this, I feel a little bit stronger, a little more in control of my memories and emotions.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. You've shown remarkable courage.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your guidance through this. It makes a big difference knowing I'm not facing these memories alone.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. That's what I'm here for.",
    "Client: I think I'm ready to end for today. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've done great work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm looking forward to our next session, even though I know it won't be easy. But I feel more prepared now, more capable of facing these memories.",
    "Therapist: That's a very positive attitude. Well done."
