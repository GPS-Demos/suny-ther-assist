    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure exercise. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the moment when your divorce became real to you?",
    "Client: I... I remember sitting in our living room. Sarah had just told me she wanted a divorce. The room felt so cold, and I could hear the clock ticking on the wall. It was like time had stopped, but also like everything was moving too fast.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: I felt my heart racing, and my hands were shaking. I kept thinking, \"This can't be happening. We've been together for 40 years.\" I looked at Sarah, and she seemed so distant, like a stranger. I wanted to reach out and touch her, but I couldn't move.",
    "Therapist: That's it. Keep going.",
    "Client: I remember feeling a wave of nausea. The room started spinning, and I had to grip the armrest of the chair to steady myself. I could hear Sarah's voice, but it sounded muffled, like I was underwater. She was saying something about growing apart, but all I could think was, \"What am I going to do now?\"",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. It's okay to feel these emotions.",
    "Client: I... I started to cry. I hadn't cried in years, not since my mother passed. But now, the tears just wouldn't stop. I felt so ashamed, so weak. Sarah just sat there, watching me fall apart. I wanted her to comfort me, to tell me it was all a mistake, but she didn't move.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: I remember thinking about our kids, our grandkids. How would we tell them? Would they blame me? I felt like such a failure. Forty years of marriage, and it was ending like this. I started to hyperventilate, my chest felt so tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I managed to catch my breath, but then the anger hit me. I wanted to yell at Sarah, to demand answers. But I couldn't find my voice. I just sat there, feeling helpless and furious at the same time. I looked around the room, at all our photos, our memories. It felt like my whole life was crumbling around me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job describing this. Keep going.",
    "Client: I finally managed to speak, but my voice sounded strange, hoarse. I asked her why, what I had done wrong. Sarah just shook her head and said it wasn't about me, that she needed to find herself. I felt so confused, so lost. How could she need to find herself after all these years?",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel confused. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: I stood up, my legs felt weak. I needed to get out of that room, away from her gaze. I stumbled to the kitchen, gripping the countertop for support. I could hear Sarah calling my name, but I couldn't respond. I felt like I was having an out-of-body experience, watching myself fall apart from a distance.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Reliving that moment, it's like I'm right back there. My chest feels tight again, and I can feel the tears threatening to spill. But there's also a strange sense of relief, like I'm finally letting out something I've been holding in for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to talk about this, but I think I needed to. I've been avoiding these memories for so long. I still feel the pain, the confusion, the anger. But maybe... maybe talking about it like this can help me start to process it all.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent insight. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: I think I can keep going. It's difficult, but I want to face this. After I left the kitchen, I remember going to our bedroom. I sat on the edge of the bed, our bed, and it hit me that soon, it would just be my bed. I felt so alone at that moment, more alone than I'd ever felt in my life.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage. Keep going.",
    "Client: I looked at Sarah's side of the room, her dresser, her clothes in the closet. I wondered how long it would take for all of that to disappear. I felt a mix of sadness and anger. Part of me wanted to throw all her things out the window, but another part wanted to cling to them, to pretend this wasn't happening.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have conflicting emotions. You're doing well.",
    "Client: I remember picking up a photo from our nightstand. It was from our 30th anniversary. We looked so happy. I couldn't understand how we had gone from that to this. I felt a surge of grief, like I was mourning not just the end of our marriage, but the death of that happy couple in the photo.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful image. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's strange. Talking about it like this, I can see how much pain I was in. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I've survived this once, and I can survive talking about it now. It still hurts, but maybe not as sharply as before.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. You've shown great resilience.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think I need a break now, if that's okay. This has been... intense. But I think it's helping. I've never really talked about that day in such detail before.",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've done excellent work today. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves."
