    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's always hard to go back there, you know? To that place, that time... It feels like my body's still on high alert, even though I know I'm safe here.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you this time?",
    "Client: The sounds. God, the sounds were so vivid. The explosions, the shouting, the... the screams. But this time, I noticed something different. There was this moment of... almost silence, right before all hell broke loose. It was eerie, you know? Like the calm before the storm.",
    "Therapist: How did that moment of silence feel?",
    "Client: It was... terrifying. Like holding your breath, knowing something awful was about to happen. I felt so helpless, so small. And then when everything started, it was like... like being swept away in a tidal wave of chaos.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. How does it feel to share that?",
    "Client: It's... it's a relief, actually. I've never really put that into words before. It's like... by talking about it, I'm taking some of its power away? Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How does this connect to your day-to-day experiences?",
    "Client: I think... I think that's why I'm always on edge. I'm constantly waiting for that \"silence before the storm\" in my everyday life. Every calm moment feels like a threat. And then when something does startle me, it's like I'm right back there in the chaos.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. How might we use this awareness?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I need to remind myself that silence doesn't always mean danger? That it's okay to relax in quiet moments? It's hard though. Sometimes I feel like I don't deserve peace, you know? After everything I've seen, everything I've done...",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. How can we challenge that thought?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. I guess... maybe by recognizing that holding onto that guilt isn't helping anyone? It's not bringing back the people we lost, it's just... keeping me stuck. Maybe allowing myself some peace could help me be more present for the people in my life now?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's one small step you could take?",
    "Client: I could... maybe try to sit in silence for a few minutes each day? Without the TV or music or anything. Just... exist in the quiet and remind myself that it's okay. That I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Excellent idea. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired, but in a good way? Like I've done something important. And I feel... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've put down a bit of the weight I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Sarah. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to dig deeper into that guilt. Maybe explore ways to forgive myself? It feels like that might be the key to really moving forward.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a good plan. Is there anything else you'd like to share?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like there might actually be a light at the end of this tunnel.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work, Sarah. I'm here to support you. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yeah, definitely. See you then."
