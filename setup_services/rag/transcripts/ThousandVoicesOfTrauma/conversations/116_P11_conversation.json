    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Patel?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's strange, you know? I've lived through so many years since that awful hostage situation, but reliving it just now... it felt so real again. My heart is still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you this time?",
    "Client: The sounds, I think. I could hear the gunshots so clearly, and the screaming... It was like I was right back there in that bank. I remember feeling so helpless, thinking about my husband and our children. I... I didn't know if I'd ever see them again.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. Scary, but also... different. I noticed I could breathe through it better this time. I kept reminding myself that I'm safe now, that it's over. But there was this moment when one of the robbers yelled, and I felt my whole body tense up. It's like... even after all these years, my body still remembers.",
    "Therapist: You're noticing your body's responses. That's excellent awareness.",
    "Client: Yes, I suppose so. It's strange how our bodies hold onto these things, isn't it? I've been thinking about how this experience relates to the typhoon we lived through when I was a child. Both times, I felt so powerless against forces beyond my control.",
    "Therapist: How do you see those experiences connecting?",
    "Client: Well, in both situations, I felt like my life could end at any moment. But with the typhoon, it was nature's fury. With the hostage situation, it was human cruelty. Somehow, that made it harder to process. Humans should protect each other, not... not threaten and harm.",
    "Therapist: That's a profound insight. How does this realization affect you?",
    "Client: It makes me sad, honestly. But also... I don't know, maybe a bit stronger? I survived both. I'm still here, still fighting to overcome these memories. It's exhausting sometimes, but I'm doing it.",
    "Therapist: You're showing remarkable resilience. What helps you keep going?",
    "Client: My family, definitely. And... well, this therapy, as difficult as it is sometimes. I want to be free from these nightmares, these constant fears. I want to enjoy my retirement, to be present with my grandchildren without always looking over my shoulder.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful motivation. How do you feel you're progressing?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard to say sometimes. Some days I feel like I'm making great strides, and other days it feels like I've gone backwards. But overall, I think I'm improving. I'm sleeping better most nights, and I've been able to go to the bank without having a panic attack. That's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Those are significant improvements.",
    "Client: Thank you. It helps to hear that. Sometimes I wonder if I'm just too old to be dealing with this, if I should just accept that this is how I'll always be. But then I think about my granddaughter's wedding next year, and I want so badly to be able to enjoy it fully, without these intrusive thoughts and fears.",
    "Therapist: That's a beautiful goal. How might today's session contribute to that?",
    "Client: I think... well, maybe it's helping me separate the past from the present more clearly. When I picture my granddaughter's wedding now, I can focus on the joy and love, rather than immediately thinking about what could go wrong. It's still there, that worry, but it's... softer, I suppose.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. What do you think has helped most?",
    "Client: The breathing exercises have been surprisingly helpful. And... talking about it, I suppose. Facing it head-on instead of trying to push it away all the time. It's uncomfortable, but I can feel it's making a difference.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm ready to keep going. It's not easy, but I can see the light at the end of the tunnel now. I want to get there. For myself, and for my family.",
    "Therapist: That's a strong commitment. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: I don't think so. Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It means more than I can express.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your courage is truly admirable. Shall we schedule our next session?",
    "Client: Yes, please. Same time next week?",
    "Therapist: That works perfectly. Take care, Mrs. Patel.",
    "Client: Thank you, doctor. You too."
