    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's a bit overwhelming, to be honest. The memories of that earthquake... they're so vivid now. I can still feel the ground shaking beneath my feet, hear the rumbling... It's like I'm right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: Fear, mostly. A deep, paralyzing fear. I remember feeling so helpless, watching buildings crumble around me. And guilt... oh, the guilt. I left my shop without checking on my employees. I just... ran. What kind of person does that make me?",
    "Therapist: It sounds like you're experiencing some intense emotions. Can you tell me more about that guilt?",
    "Client: It's eating me up inside. I've known some of those employees for years, treated them like family. But when it mattered most, I abandoned them. I keep thinking, what if something happened to them? What if... what if they didn't make it out? I'll never forgive myself.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt manifest in your body right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a heavy weight on my chest. My stomach feels twisted in knots. I can feel my heart racing, and my hands are clammy. It's hard to breathe sometimes, like I'm suffocating under the weight of it all.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind as you experience these sensations?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"I'm a coward. I failed them.\" It's on a loop in my head. And then I think about my wife, how I couldn't protect her either. She was at home, and I couldn't get to her for hours. I feel like I've failed everyone who ever counted on me.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts relate to your experiences growing up?",
    "Client: I... I never thought about it that way before. But now that you mention it, it reminds me of how I felt as a child. My parents... they were always working, never there when I needed them. I promised myself I'd never be like that, that I'd always be there for others. But when it really mattered, I wasn't. I'm just like them.",
    "Therapist: What emotions come up as you make that connection?",
    "Client: Anger, surprisingly. I'm angry at myself for breaking that promise. But I'm also angry at my parents. Maybe if they had been there for me, I would've known how to be there for others. And sadness... a deep, overwhelming sadness. It's like I'm grieving for the person I thought I was.",
    "Therapist: How does this realization impact your view of the earthquake experience?",
    "Client: It's... it's complicated. On one hand, I still feel guilty about my actions during the earthquake. But on the other, I'm starting to see that maybe I'm being too hard on myself. I was scared, just like everyone else. Maybe... maybe it's not fair to expect myself to be a hero when I never learned how to be one.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to forgive myself. Not just for the earthquake, but for all the times I couldn't live up to my own expectations. It's not going to be easy, but I'm starting to see that holding onto this guilt isn't helping anyone, least of all me.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to acknowledge that need?",
    "Client: It's... liberating, in a way. Like a small weight has been lifted. But it's also scary. I've been carrying this guilt for so long, it's become a part of me. Letting it go feels like I'm losing a piece of myself. But maybe... maybe that's not such a bad thing.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you can take towards self-forgiveness?",
    "Client: I suppose... I could start by reaching out to my former employees. Not to apologize, necessarily, but to check on them, see how they're doing. Maybe reconnecting with them will help me see that things aren't as bad as I've imagined.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... it's both terrifying and exciting. I'm scared of what I might find out, but I also feel a glimmer of hope. Maybe this could be the start of healing, not just for me, but for all of us who went through that terrible day.",
    "Therapist: What support do you need to take that step?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'll need my wife's support. She's always been my rock. And maybe... maybe I could use some help from you, to prepare for any outcome. I'm not sure I'm strong enough to handle it on my own just yet.",
    "Therapist: It's brave of you to recognize that. Shall we discuss this more next session?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be helpful. Thank you for guiding me through this. It's been difficult, but I feel like I'm finally starting to see a way forward. I'm... I'm grateful for your help.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. How are you feeling as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted, emotionally drained. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, lightness? Like I've finally put down a heavy burden I've been carrying for years. It's a strange mix of feelings, but overall, I think I feel... hopeful. For the first time in a long while, I feel hopeful.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful progress. We'll continue next week."
