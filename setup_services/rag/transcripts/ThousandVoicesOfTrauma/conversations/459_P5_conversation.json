    "Therapist: Today, we'll be doing imaginal exposure. Are you ready to discuss this?",
    "Client: I guess so. To be honest, I'm feeling a bit nervous about it. What exactly does imaginal exposure involve?",
    "Therapist: It's a way to process trauma memories. We'll go through the event step-by-step. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: That sounds pretty intense. I'm not sure if I can handle reliving the hostage situation. It's been giving me nightmares for months now.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. Remember, you're safe here. How can I support you?",
    "Client: I appreciate that. Maybe you could explain a bit more about why we're doing this? I mean, I've been trying so hard to forget about it all. Won't this just make things worse?",
    "Therapist: By facing the memory, we reduce its power. It may be difficult, but it often leads to relief. What do you think?",
    "Client: I see. It's like facing your fears head-on, right? I've always been told to be brave, but this feels different. It's not just about physical courage, is it?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. This takes emotional courage. You've shown tremendous strength already. How do you feel about trying?",
    "Client: I'm still scared, but I think I'm willing to give it a shot. Will you be there to guide me through it? I'm worried I might get overwhelmed or panic.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'll be here throughout. We can pause anytime. What else might help you feel safe?",
    "Client: That's reassuring. Maybe having a stress ball to squeeze? And... could we agree on a signal if I need to stop? Sometimes when I'm anxious, I struggle to speak.",
    "Therapist: Great ideas. We'll use those. Anything else you'd like to know before we start?",
    "Client: I think I'm okay for now. Just... thank you for being patient with me. This isn't easy, especially given my history with... you know, the sexual abuse. It makes trusting people difficult.",
    "Therapist: Your trust means a lot. You're incredibly brave. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm still nervous, but I feel a bit more prepared now. Let's do this before I change my mind.",
    "Therapist: Alright. We'll start slowly. Remember, you're in control. Shall we begin?"
