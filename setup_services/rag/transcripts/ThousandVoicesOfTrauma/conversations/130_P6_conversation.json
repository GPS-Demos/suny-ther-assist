    "Therapist: Welcome back, John. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure exercise today?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with your SUDS rating. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 40. My stomach's a little tight, but I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Let's begin. Close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back at the compound. It's early evening, and I can hear chanting in the distance. The air feels heavy, almost oppressive. I'm standing near the main building, watching as a group of people are led out. My heart's starting to race a bit...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to about 55. I can feel my palms getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Continue describing what you see.",
    "Client: The group is being led to the center of the compound. There's a... a wooden platform there. I can see the leader, he's wearing those ridiculous robes he always wore for \"ceremonies.\" God, I feel sick just thinking about it...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's happening now?",
    "Client: They're... they're making one of the members step up onto the platform. It's a young woman, maybe early 20s. She looks terrified. The leader is shouting something about purification and sin. I... I can't believe I was ever part of this...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 70. My heart's pounding, and I feel like I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Right, right... Okay, so the leader is circling the woman on the platform. He's got this... this whip in his hand. I remember feeling frozen, unable to do anything. The first crack of the whip... God, I can still hear it. The woman's scream... I... I can't...",
    "Therapist: You're safe, John. Take a moment. How's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's at 85 now. I feel like I'm right back there, watching it happen.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Thanks... I... The whipping continues. I can see blood on the woman's back. People around me are cheering, but I feel sick. I want to run, to stop it, but I'm too afraid. I hate myself for not doing anything...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS now, John?",
    "Client: It's still at 85. My hands are shaking, and I feel nauseous.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: The whipping finally stops. The woman collapses on the platform. They're dragging her away now, and I can hear the leader talking about how this is for the good of the community. I... I remember feeling so conflicted. Part of me still believed in the cult's teachings, but another part knew this was horribly wrong.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually down to about 75 now. I'm still shaky, but the nausea is fading a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this well.",
    "Client: After the... the ceremony, everyone disperses. I remember walking back to my quarters in a daze. I couldn't stop seeing that woman's face, hearing her screams. That night, I couldn't sleep. It was the first time I really started to question everything about the cult.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. Current SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to 65 now. I'm feeling... I don't know, sad? Angry at myself?",
    "Therapist: Those are normal feelings. Continue.",
    "Client: I... I think that's all I can manage for today. I'm feeling drained.",
    "Therapist: That's perfectly fine. Let's end here. Final SUDS?",
    "Client: About 50. I'm feeling tired, but... maybe a little relieved too?",
    "Therapist: Thank you for your courage today, John. We'll process this next session."
