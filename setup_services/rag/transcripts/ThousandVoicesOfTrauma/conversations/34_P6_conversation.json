    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your current SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and recall the memory. Describe what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: I'm... I'm back in the office breakroom. I can smell the coffee brewing. I see a group of coworkers huddled together, whispering and glancing in my direction. Their eyes... they're full of judgment and... disgust. I feel so small, so out of place.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's happening now?",
    "Client: One of them, Sarah, she's walking towards me with this fake smile. She says, \"Hey, Ming, is that some kind of exotic lunch you've got there?\" Her tone is... mocking. I can feel my cheeks burning, my heart racing. I want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Maybe a 6 or 7.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I try to smile back, but my lips are trembling. I manage to say, \"It's just leftovers from home.\" But Sarah's already turned back to the group, and they're all giggling. I hear someone whisper, \"Does she ever eat normal food?\" I feel so... so isolated. Like I don't belong here, like I'll never belong.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: My stomach is in knots. My hands are shaking. I... I can feel sweat forming on my forehead. It's like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. It's okay to feel distressed. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I grab my lunch and hurry out of the breakroom. I can hear their laughter behind me. In the hallway, I bump into my boss. He looks at me with concern and asks if I'm okay. I want to tell him, to explain what's happening, but... but I can't find the words. I'm afraid he won't understand, that he'll think I'm overreacting. So I just nod and rush to my desk.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel in this moment?",
    "Client: I feel... ashamed. Angry. Helpless. Like no matter what I do, I'll always be seen as different, as less than.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's still an 8. Maybe even a 9 now.",
    "Therapist: That's intense. Remember, you're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: I sit at my desk, trying to hold back tears. I can't focus on my work. All I can think about is how I don't fit in, how I'll never be accepted. I... I start to wonder if I should just quit, find a job where I won't stand out so much. But then I feel angry at myself for even thinking that. Why should I have to change? Why can't they accept me?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid feelings. How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're processing this well. Continue.",
    "Client: As the day goes on, I try to act normal. But every time I see one of them, I tense up. I feel like they're all talking about me behind my back. By the end of the day, I'm exhausted. I rush out of the office as soon as I can. In my car, I finally break down and cry. I feel so... so alone.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling drained. Sad. But also... maybe a little relieved to have talked about it.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 5 now.",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. Let's take a few deep breaths together.",
    "Client: (Inhales and exhales slowly) That helps. I... I never realized how much this incident affected me.",
    "Therapist: It's a significant experience. How do you feel about discussing it?",
    "Client: It was hard, but... I think it was important. I've been carrying this for so long.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great courage. Final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: I'd say it's back down to a 4 now.",
    "Therapist: Excellent work today. Let's end here and discuss what you've learned."
