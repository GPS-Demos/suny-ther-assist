    "Therapist: Welcome, Jake. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess so. I'm feeling a bit... I don't know, jittery? Like my skin's too tight or something.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember your SUDS scale. Where are you now?",
    "Client: Uh, probably around a 4 or 5.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath and start when you're ready.",
    "Client: Alright... *exhales* So, it was a Tuesday. I remember because I had just finished my morning lecture and was heading to the campus caf\u00e9. My phone buzzed, and it was Mum. I... I knew something was wrong. She never calls during the day.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What did you feel?",
    "Client: My stomach dropped. I answered, and her voice was... it was shaky. She said, \"Jake, it's about Grandpa.\" I felt like the world was moving in slow motion. People were walking by, laughing, living their normal lives, but everything felt muffled.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's creeping up... maybe a 6?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Keep going. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Mum told me Grandpa had a massive stroke. He was in the hospital, but... but it didn't look good. I remember sliding down the wall, sitting on the cold floor. My hands were shaking so much I could barely hold the phone.",
    "Therapist: What were you thinking?",
    "Client: I... I kept thinking, \"No, not him. Please, not him.\" Grandpa was... he was my rock, you know? After all the shit with Dad, Grandpa was the one who... *voice breaks* who showed me what a real man should be like.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. Where are you in your SUDS?",
    "Client: *breathing heavily* It's... it's an 8. God, it feels so real.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Jake. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Yeah... okay. So, I somehow made it to my car. I don't even remember the drive to the hospital. It's all a blur of traffic lights and my heart pounding in my ears. When I got there, Mum was in the waiting room. Her eyes were red, and she just... she just crumpled when she saw me.",
    "Therapist: What did you do?",
    "Client: I hugged her. I tried to be strong, you know? But I was falling apart inside. The doctor came out, and... *long pause* and told us Grandpa didn't make it. He'd passed while I was on my way.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happened next?",
    "Client: I... I couldn't breathe. It felt like someone had punched me in the gut. I remember stumbling out of the waiting room, needing air. I ended up in the parking lot, just... screaming. Screaming and punching the side of my car until my knuckles bled.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: *voice trembling* It's... it's a 9. Fuck, it hurts so much.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well, Jake. Remember, you're here now, safe.",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, I know. *deep breath* After that, everything's a bit of a haze. We had to go identify the body. God, seeing him there, so still... it didn't seem real. He looked like he was sleeping, but I kept waiting for him to open his eyes, to smile and tell me it was all a bad joke.",
    "Therapist: What were you feeling?",
    "Client: Angry. So fucking angry. At the world, at God, at myself for not being there. And guilty... why wasn't I there? Why didn't I visit more? *starts crying* I should've been there.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. Let them out.",
    "Client: *sobbing* I miss him so much. He was the only one who really got me, you know? After Dad... after the abuse... Grandpa was the one who taught me that not all men are like that. He showed me how to be kind, how to be strong without hurting others.",
    "Therapist: Take a few deep breaths. Where are you on the SUDS scale?",
    "Client: *breathing slowly* It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8 now?",
    "Therapist: That's progress. Keep going.",
    "Client: The funeral was the worst. All these people talking about what a great man he was, and I just wanted to scream. They didn't really know him. They didn't know how he'd sit up with me all night when the nightmares got bad, or how he taught me to fish even though his hands shook from arthritis.",
    "Therapist: What do you remember most about that day?",
    "Client: The smell of lilies. They were everywhere, and now I can't stand them. And the sound of dirt hitting the coffin. *shudders* It was so final. I remember thinking, \"This is it. He's really gone.\"",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. Empty. Like someone scooped out my insides.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS?",
    "Client: Down to a 6, I think. It still hurts, but... it's not as sharp.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's continue.",
    "Client: After the funeral, I just... I fell apart. Started drinking, skipping classes. I couldn't see the point anymore. Grandpa was always the one pushing me to do better, to be better. Without him... I felt lost.",
    "Therapist: How did that manifest?",
    "Client: I'd stay up all night, drinking and watching old videos of him on my phone. During the day, I'd sleep or just... exist. I stopped answering calls, stopped going out. It felt like the world had ended, but somehow I was still here.",
    "Therapist: What about your substance use?",
    "Client: It... it got worse. I started mixing alcohol with whatever I could get my hands on. Anything to numb the pain, you know? I knew Grandpa would be disappointed, but... I couldn't stop.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling talking about this?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. But not as bad as before. Maybe a 5 on the SUDS scale now?",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. Keep going.",
    "Client: There was this one night, about a month after the funeral. I was wasted, stumbling around my apartment. I found the pocket watch Grandpa had left me. *long pause* I... I smashed it against the wall. I was so angry at him for leaving me.",
    "Therapist: What happened next?",
    "Client: I broke down. Completely. I sat there, surrounded by broken glass, holding the pieces of the watch, and just... sobbed. For hours. It was like all the grief I'd been holding back just exploded out of me.",
    "Therapist: How did that feel?",
    "Client: Awful. But also... kind of cleansing? Like, for the first time since he died, I could actually feel something other than numbness or anger.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 4 now. Talking about it... it's not easy, but it's not as overwhelming as before.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Let's continue.",
    "Client: After that night, I knew I had to change. Grandpa wouldn't have wanted me to destroy myself like this. I started going to grief counseling, cut back on the drinking. It was hard, really fucking hard. There were days I wanted to give up, to just sink back into that numbness.",
    "Therapist: What kept you going?",
    "Client: Memories of Grandpa. His voice in my head, telling me to keep pushing, to be the man he knew I could be. And... and the thought that maybe, just maybe, I could make him proud, even if he wasn't here to see it.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that now?",
    "Client: It's... it's bittersweet. I still miss him every day. There are times when something good happens, and my first thought is still to call him. But... the pain isn't as sharp. It's more like a dull ache now.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to a 3. Talking about it... it helps. It's like I'm reconnecting with him, in a way.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress, Jake. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Tired. Really tired. But... lighter? Like I've set down a heavy backpack I've been carrying for months.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after these sessions. You've done incredibly well today.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's... it's not easy, but I think it's helping. I can talk about him now without feeling like I'm going to fall apart.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. We'll end here for today. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later.",
    "Client: I will. Thanks, doc. This... this means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Jake. I'll see you next week."
