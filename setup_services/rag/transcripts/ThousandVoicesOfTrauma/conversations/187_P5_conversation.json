    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. My chronic pain has been acting up, which always makes me more anxious.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's discuss today's plan.",
    "Client: Alright. I remember you mentioning something about imaginal exposure last time. To be honest, I'm not sure I'm ready for that. The idea of reliving my trauma... it's terrifying.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. Shall we explore the process?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I need to know what I'm getting into. Will it make my pain worse? Will I be able to handle it emotionally?",
    "Therapist: It shouldn't worsen pain. We'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: That's a relief. But I'm still worried about how I'll react. What if I completely fall apart?",
    "Therapist: You're stronger than you think. I'll be here throughout.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's just... my military experience is so intertwined with the sexual abuse I endured. It's all so complicated and painful.",
    "Therapist: Your experiences are complex. This process helps untangle them.",
    "Client: I see. So, what exactly will we be doing? How does this imaginal exposure work?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the traumatic event in detail. We'll record it.",
    "Client: Record it? Oh god, I don't know if I can do that. Hearing my own voice describing... that. It's overwhelming to think about.",
    "Therapist: It's challenging, but a crucial step towards healing.",
    "Client: I understand that, logically. But emotionally, I'm terrified. Will this really help my PTSD symptoms?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it's proven effective. Your courage is admirable.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm trying to be brave, but it's hard. What should I expect to feel during and after?",
    "Therapist: Intense emotions are normal. We'll process them together.",
    "Client: Okay. And you'll be there the whole time? You won't leave me alone with these memories?",
    "Therapist: I'll be right here, supporting you throughout.",
    "Client: That helps. I trust you, but this is still scary. How long will the exposure last?",
    "Therapist: About 30-45 minutes. We can pause if needed.",
    "Client: That's longer than I expected. But I suppose it's necessary to really process everything. Will we do this every session?",
    "Therapist: We'll do it regularly, adjusting as needed.",
    "Client: I see. I'm still nervous, but I think I understand better now. Thank you for explaining it all to me.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your readiness shows tremendous strength.",
    "Client: I don't feel very strong right now, but I'm willing to try. This might help me finally move past what happened, right?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it's a powerful tool for healing.",
    "Client: Alright. I think... I think I'm ready to give it a try. Can we start slowly?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll begin gently. You're in control.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you for your patience and support. I couldn't do this without you. Let's... let's do this.",
    "Therapist: I'm proud of you. Let's start when you're ready."
