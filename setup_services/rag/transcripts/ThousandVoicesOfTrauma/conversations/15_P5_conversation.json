    "Therapist: Hello, Carlos. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi, Dr. Martinez. I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been thinking about it since our last session, and I'm not sure I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... talking about my illness in detail feels overwhelming. I've spent so much time trying to forget those hospital stays and the pain. The idea of reliving it all... it's scary. Plus, I'm worried about how it might affect my work. What if I can't handle it and need to take time off?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. Shall we discuss the purpose of this exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I mean, I know you've mentioned it before, but I'm still not sure I fully understand why we need to do this. It seems counterintuitive to purposely bring up painful memories.",
    "Therapist: The goal is to process the trauma, reducing its power over time. How does that sound?",
    "Client: I see... So, it's like facing the memories head-on instead of avoiding them? That makes sense, but it still feels daunting. How exactly will this help with my symptoms? I've been having such a hard time concentrating at work lately, and the nightmares are really affecting my sleep.",
    "Therapist: Exposure can help decrease anxiety and improve sleep. It may also enhance focus.",
    "Client: Really? That would be amazing. I've been so worried about my job performance lately. My team has been incredibly understanding, but I can't help feeling like I'm letting them down. If this could help me get back on track... Well, I guess it's worth trying. What exactly will we be doing in this session?",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit your illness experience. You'll describe it in detail, present tense.",
    "Client: In the present tense? Wow, that sounds intense. I'm not sure I can do that without breaking down. What if I start panicking or can't continue? And... I'm a bit embarrassed to admit this, but what if I cry? I've always tried to be strong for my family, and the idea of losing control like that in front of you is uncomfortable.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to express emotions. I'm here to support you throughout.",
    "Client: Thank you, that's reassuring. I appreciate your support. I guess I'm just worried about opening this can of worms. Once we start talking about it, will I be able to stop thinking about it? I've worked so hard to keep these memories at bay, and I'm scared of undoing all that progress.",
    "Therapist: It may be challenging initially, but it often leads to long-term relief.",
    "Client: I see. That makes sense, even if it's scary to think about. I suppose it's like cleaning out a wound - it hurts at first, but it's necessary for proper healing. Alright, I think I'm willing to give it a try. What should I expect during the session? How long will it last, and what will you be doing while I'm talking?",
    "Therapist: We'll go for about 45 minutes. I'll guide you and ensure your safety.",
    "Client: Okay, 45 minutes... that's a long time to be talking about such a difficult experience. But I guess that's the point, right? To really face it head-on. I'm feeling a mix of nervousness and... maybe a little hope? Is it normal to feel conflicted like this?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Your feelings are normal and valid. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do this. I'm scared, but I'm also ready to start healing. Thank you for being here with me through this process. I'm grateful for your guidance and support.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your courage is admirable. Let's start when you're ready."
