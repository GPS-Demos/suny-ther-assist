    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Are you ready to revisit the memory of your imprisonment?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm back in that small cell. The walls are closing in on me. It's dark, and I can barely see anything. The air feels thick and stuffy. I can hear the sound of keys jingling in the distance, and my heart starts racing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm sitting on the cold, hard floor. My back is against the wall, and I'm hugging my knees to my chest. I feel so alone and scared. I keep thinking about my family, wondering if I'll ever see them again. The uncertainty is killing me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: It's hard to breathe. I feel like I'm suffocating. The guard's footsteps are getting closer, and I'm terrified of what might happen next. My hands are shaking, and I'm trying to make myself as small as possible.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Keep going.",
    "Client: I hear the cell door opening, and I flinch. The guard's silhouette is intimidating in the doorway. He barks an order at me, but I can barely understand what he's saying. My mind is foggy with fear. I slowly stand up, my legs weak and trembling.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, it's just a memory.",
    "Client: As I follow the guard down the dimly lit corridor, I can hear other prisoners shouting and banging on their cell doors. It's deafening and disorienting. I'm led into a room for questioning, and the bright lights hurt my eyes after being in the dark cell for so long.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here with me.",
    "Client: The interrogator is sitting across from me, his face stern and unforgiving. He starts asking me questions, but I can't focus. My mind keeps drifting to my family, my job, my life outside these walls. I feel so helpless and powerless.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're handling it well.",
    "Client: I try to answer his questions, but my voice is shaky and weak. I'm afraid of saying the wrong thing, of making my situation worse. The interrogator's voice gets louder, more aggressive. I'm sweating, and my heart feels like it's going to burst out of my chest.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: Suddenly, he slams his fist on the table, and I jump. I can feel tears welling up in my eyes, but I'm trying hard not to cry. I don't want to show weakness. The room feels like it's spinning, and I'm struggling to stay focused.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to express your emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I'm... I'm sorry, but I need a moment. This is really intense.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take your time. You're doing well.",
    "Client: (After a pause) Okay, I think I can continue. After the interrogation, I'm led back to my cell. I feel drained, both physically and emotionally. As the cell door closes behind me, the finality of it all hits me. I sink to the floor, finally letting the tears flow freely.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Keep going if you can.",
    "Client: I lose track of time in that cell. Days and nights blur together. The only thing that keeps me going is the hope of seeing my family again. I try to stay strong, but there are moments when I feel like I'm losing my mind.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. Remember, you survived this.",
    "Client: It's true, I did survive. But sometimes, even now, I feel like a part of me is still trapped in that cell. The fear, the helplessness, the isolation - it all comes rushing back at unexpected moments.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response to trauma. You're doing great work here.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think... I think I need to stop for now. This has been really draining.",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've done excellent work today. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive sign. We'll end here for today. You should be proud of yourself."
