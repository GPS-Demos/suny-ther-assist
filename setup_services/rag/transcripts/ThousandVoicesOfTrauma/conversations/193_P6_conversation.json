    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's begin when you're comfortable.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in the war zone. The air is thick with dust and smoke. I can hear distant explosions and gunfire. My heart is racing, and my palms are sweaty. I'm crouched behind a crumbling wall, trying to catch my breath. The weight of my gear feels suffocating.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um... probably a 6 out of 10. I'm definitely anxious, but it's manageable.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: I peek around the corner and see a group of civilians being herded into a truck. They look terrified. I recognize some of them from the local village. My stomach twists as I realize what's happening \u2013 they're being trafficked. I feel so helpless, like I should do something, but I'm frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My chest is tight, and I'm starting to feel dizzy. The guilt is overwhelming. SUDS is maybe an 8 now.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I watch as they force a young girl into the truck. She can't be more than 15. Her eyes meet mine for a split second, and I see the desperation. I want to scream, to run out there and help her, but I know I'd be killed instantly. The truck engine starts, and I feel like I'm going to be sick.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I can barely breathe. My hands are shaking, and I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a deep breath. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I close my eyes and try to block it out. But I can still hear the truck driving away, the muffled cries. When I open my eyes, they're gone. I'm left with this crushing weight of failure and guilt. I should have done something, anything.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: I feel... hollow. Empty. Like I've failed as a soldier and as a human being. My SUDS is still at a 9. I can't shake this feeling of despair.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: I slump against the wall, my rifle feels so heavy in my hands. I can taste the dust in my mouth, and my eyes sting from the smoke. I keep replaying that girl's face in my mind. I wonder what happened to her, where they took her. The guilt is crushing me.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down a bit. Maybe an 8? I still feel awful, but the initial panic is subsiding.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Keep going.",
    "Client: I hear footsteps approaching, and I tense up. It's my squadmate, Jake. He looks at me and just... knows. He doesn't say anything, just sits next to me. We sit in silence for what feels like hours. I feel tears on my cheeks, but I don't bother wiping them away.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm calmer. Maybe a 6? Having Jake there, even though we didn't speak, it helped somehow. Like I wasn't alone in this nightmare.",
    "Therapist: That connection seems important. Continue.",
    "Client: As the sun starts to set, we finally move. We have to return to base. Every step feels heavy, like I'm carrying the weight of what I witnessed. The sky is a deep orange, almost beautiful if it weren't for the context. I keep thinking about how I'll never forget this day, how it'll haunt me forever.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5. I feel drained, emotionally and physically. The intensity has faded, but there's this lingering sadness and guilt.",
    "Therapist: You've done well. How do you feel about ending the exercise?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'm ready to stop. It's exhausting, but I feel like I've processed some of it.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great courage today. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves."
