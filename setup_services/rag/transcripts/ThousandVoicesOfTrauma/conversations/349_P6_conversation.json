    "Therapist: Alright, Mr. Johnson, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: I suppose so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. But I understand why we're doing this.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the home invasion. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I'm in my living room. It's late evening, and I'm watching TV. Suddenly, I hear a loud crash from the kitchen. My heart starts racing immediately.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10. I'm tense, but okay.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: I slowly get up from my chair, my legs feeling weak. As I approach the kitchen, I hear rustling sounds. I'm terrified, but I need to see what's happening. I peek around the corner and... oh god, there's a man in a black mask rifling through my drawers.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: My chest is tight, I can barely breathe. I'm frozen in place, wanting to run but unable to move.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to a 7. I can feel my hands shaking just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The intruder turns and sees me. His eyes widen in surprise. He lunges toward me, grabbing my arm roughly. I cry out in pain and fear. I can smell alcohol on his breath as he shouts at me, demanding to know where I keep my valuables.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. I feel like I'm right back there. My arm hurts where he grabbed me, and I feel so helpless and scared.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: (taking deep breaths) Yes, yes, I know. It just feels so real. The intruder is dragging me through the house, threatening me. I'm begging him not to hurt me, telling him where my safe is. I feel so ashamed that I gave in so easily.",
    "Therapist: It's a natural reaction. What happens next?",
    "Client: He forces me to open the safe. As soon as it's open, he shoves me to the ground. I hit my head on the corner of the dresser. Everything goes fuzzy for a moment. When I come to, he's gone, and my grandson is kneeling beside me, calling my name.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 6. I feel relieved it's over, but my body is still tense and shaky.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. How are you feeling now, here in the room with me?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. My heart is still racing a bit, but I feel safe. It's strange how vivid the memory becomes when I really focus on it.",
    "Therapist: That's the point of this exercise. You did well.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was tough, but I think I understand why we're doing this now. It feels like... like I'm starting to process it differently.",
    "Therapist: Excellent observation. Let's take a break and discuss what you experienced."
