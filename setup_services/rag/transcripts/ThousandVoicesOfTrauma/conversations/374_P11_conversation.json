    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Maria?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like I'm right back there in the field hospital, you know? The sounds, the smells... it's all so vivid. I can still hear the constant beeping of the monitors and the groans of the wounded soldiers. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The helplessness. I felt so powerless. There were so many injured, and I couldn't save them all. I keep seeing this one young soldier's face. He couldn't have been more than 20. His eyes... they were pleading with me to save him, but I couldn't. I just... I couldn't.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... God, it was awful. But also... different? I mean, it still hurts, but I didn't feel as trapped as I usually do when I think about it. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. Can you tell me more about that?",
    "Client: Well, usually when I remember that day, it's like I'm right back there, completely consumed by the panic and the guilt. But this time, even though it was still painful, I felt like I could... I don't know, observe it a bit? Like, I knew I was here, in your office, talking about it, not actually there. It's a strange feeling.",
    "Therapist: That's an important observation. How does this relate to your daily life?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe it means I don't have to be so afraid of my memories? Like, they're still there, still painful, but they don't have to control me completely. It's just... it's hard to believe that sometimes, you know?",
    "Therapist: I understand. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much this experience has affected my relationships. I've been pushing my partner away because I didn't want her to see this side of me. But maybe... maybe I don't have to do that anymore?",
    "Therapist: That's a valuable insight. How might this change things?",
    "Client: I think... I think I might be ready to open up to her a bit more. Maybe explain why I've been so distant. It's scary, but... I'm tired of feeling alone in this, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a big step. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: Nervous, definitely. But also... hopeful? For the first time in a long while, I feel like maybe things can get better. Like maybe I'm not broken beyond repair.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress, Maria. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I want to keep working on this. It's hard, and it hurts, but I think it's helping. And... I think I'm going to talk to my partner tonight. Just a little bit, about why I've been struggling. Baby steps, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How can I support you in this?",
    "Client: Just... keep pushing me, I guess? Don't let me hide from this. I need to face it, even when it's hard. Especially when it's hard. And maybe... maybe we could work on some strategies for talking to my partner? I'm not sure where to start.",
    "Therapist: We can definitely do that. Anything else?",

    "Client: Yeah, see you next week. Thank you again."
