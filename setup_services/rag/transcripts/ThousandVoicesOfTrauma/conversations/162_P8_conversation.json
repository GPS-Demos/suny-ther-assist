    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing but also blank at the same time. I can still see my grandmother's face so clearly, you know? Her eyes closed, lying there in the hospital bed. It's... overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: There's this tightness in my chest. It's hard to breathe. I keep thinking about how I should've been there more often. I was so busy with work, and... and... I just didn't make enough time. God, why didn't I make more time?",
    "Therapist: It sounds like you're experiencing some guilt.",
    "Client: Yeah, guilt. That's exactly it. It's crushing me. I feel like I failed her. She was always there for me, especially after... after what happened when I was a kid. She was my safe haven, and I couldn't even be there for her in her final days.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a heavy weight on my shoulders. And my stomach is in knots. I feel nauseous, actually. It's like my body is trying to reject these memories, but they're stuck inside me.",
    "Therapist: And what thoughts are accompanying these physical sensations?",
    "Client: I keep hearing her voice, you know? Calling me by that nickname she gave me when I was little. \"My little sunshine,\" she'd say. But now it feels more like an accusation. Like, how could her \"sunshine\" abandon her when she needed me most?",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly painful.",
    "Client: It is. And there's anger too. I'm angry at myself, at the circumstances, at... at everything. I was supposed to be strong, you know? I've always been the one who held it together. But when it really mattered, I... I broke down.",
    "Therapist: Can you tell me more about that anger?",
    "Client: It's... it's hot. Like a fire in my chest. I want to scream, to break things. But then I remember how gentle she always was, and I feel ashamed of my anger. She wouldn't want me to feel this way, but I can't help it.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel angry. How else has this loss affected you?",
    "Client: I've been drinking more. I know it's not good, but it numbs the pain for a while. It's like... like I'm trying to drown out her voice in my head. But then when I sober up, the guilt is even worse. It's a vicious cycle.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. How do you think this connects to your earlier experiences?",
    "Client: I... I never thought about it before, but... when those bad things happened when I was a kid, my grandmother was the one who noticed. She was the one who protected me, who made me feel safe again. And now... now I feel like that scared child all over again, but she's not here to make it better.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful connection. How does recognizing that make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's strange. Sad, but also... I don't know, maybe a little comforting? Like, even though she's gone, I can still feel her influence. But it also makes me realize how much I've been relying on others to feel safe. Maybe... maybe I need to learn how to do that for myself now.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation.",
    "Client: Yeah, I... I never thought about it that way before. It's scary, the idea of being my own source of comfort. But maybe... maybe that's what she would have wanted for me. To be strong on my own, you know?",
    "Therapist: How does that idea sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... it's bittersweet. Part of me wants to cling to the memories, to that feeling of safety she gave me. But another part knows I need to move forward. I just... I don't know how to do that without feeling like I'm betraying her memory.",
    "Therapist: It's a complex process. What do you think the first step might be?",
    "Client: I... I think maybe I need to start by forgiving myself. For not being there enough at the end, for struggling now. She always told me to be kind to myself, but that's been so hard lately. Maybe... maybe that's where I need to start.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a compassionate approach.",
    "Client: Yeah, it... it feels right. But also terrifying. I've been so angry at myself for so long. I'm not sure I even remember how to be kind to myself anymore. But I want to try. For her, and... and for me too, I guess.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel now, compared to when we started?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also lighter somehow. Like I've set down a heavy burden I didn't even realize I was carrying. There's still pain, and guilt, but... but maybe also a tiny bit of hope? Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a natural part of the process.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I needed to hear that. It's been so long since I've felt anything close to hope. I know there's still a long way to go, but... but maybe I can do this. Maybe I can find a way to honor her memory and still move forward.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. We'll work on that together.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I... I'm glad I have this space to work through these feelings. It's hard, but... but I think it's important. I want to get better. For her, for myself, for everyone in my life. I just hope I have the strength to see it through.",
    "Therapist: You've shown tremendous strength today. How about we end here?",
    "Client: Yeah, I... I think that's good. Thank you for guiding me through this. It's been intense, but... but I feel like I've made some progress. Even if it's just a small step, it feels significant.",
    "Therapist: You've done well. We'll continue next session."
