    "Therapist: Hello, Mr. Johnson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: G'day, doc. To be honest, I'm a bit on edge. This chronic pain's been acting up, and I've been having more flashbacks about that cyclone lately. It's like I can still hear the wind howling and see the trees snapping like twigs.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Imaginal exposure? That sounds a bit intense. What exactly does that involve?",
    "Therapist: It's revisiting your trauma memory in a safe environment. Can you share your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried it might make things worse. I've been trying so hard to avoid thinking about it. And with my pain flaring up, I'm not sure I can handle more stress.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How do you think this might help?",
    "Client: I suppose... if I face it head-on, maybe it won't have such a hold on me? But it's scary, you know? I'm not sure I'm strong enough to relive it all.",
    "Therapist: You're stronger than you think. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: How long will this take? And what if I panic? I don't want to lose control, especially not here.",
    "Therapist: It'll last about 30-45 minutes. I'll guide you throughout. What else?",
    "Client: Will this really help with the nightmares and the jumpiness? I'm tired of feeling on high alert all the time.",
    "Therapist: Yes, it can significantly reduce those symptoms. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It sounds promising, I guess. But I'm still nervous. What if I can't do it right?",
    "Therapist: There's no \"right\" way. Your experience is what matters. Ready to try?",
    "Client: I... I think so. Yeah, let's give it a go. But can we stop if it gets too much?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're in control. Your bravery is commendable.",
    "Client: Thanks, doc. That means a lot. I just hope this helps. I'm ready to feel like myself again, you know?",
    "Therapist: Understood. Let's begin. Close your eyes and take a deep breath..."
