    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Maria?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's always intense to revisit that moment when my ex-husband told me he was leaving. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel this tightness in my chest. It's like I'm right back there in our kitchen, you know? I can see the sunlight streaming through the window, smell the coffee I had just made... it's so vivid.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you this time?",
    "Client: Well, I noticed how much anger I felt. I mean, I've always known I was hurt and sad, but this time I really felt the anger bubbling up. I wanted to scream at him, ask him how he could do this to us, to our family. But I didn't. I just stood there, frozen. And now I'm wondering if that anger has been there all along, just... buried.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. How does recognizing this anger feel?",
    "Client: It's... liberating, in a way. But also scary. I've always tried to be the peacekeeper, you know? In my family, in my business relationships. Acknowledging this anger feels like I'm breaking some unspoken rule. But at the same time, it feels right. Like I'm finally being honest with myself.",
    "Therapist: Valid feelings. How might this relate to your anxiety?",
    "Client: Oh wow, I hadn't thought about that. But now that you mention it... I think my anxiety might be partly because I'm always trying to keep that anger in check. Like, I'm constantly on edge, worried that if I let my guard down, all these feelings will come pouring out. And what if I can't control them? What if I lash out at someone who doesn't deserve it?",
    "Therapist: Understandable concern. What could help manage these emotions?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe I need to find healthier ways to express my anger? Like, maybe I could start journaling or take up kickboxing or something. And I think I need to practice being more assertive in my day-to-day life. It's just... it's scary to think about changing how I've always done things.",
    "Therapist: Change can be daunting. What's one small step you could take?",
    "Client: Hmm... maybe I could start by being more honest with my current partner about how I'm feeling? Not in an aggressive way, but just... not bottling things up so much. And maybe I could talk to my sister about some of the resentment I've been holding onto from our childhood. Baby steps, right?",
    "Therapist: Excellent ideas. How do you feel about your progress in therapy?",
    "Client: It's... it's been tough, but I think I'm making progress. Today was hard, but I feel like I've uncovered something important. It's like I'm slowly peeling back layers of myself that I didn't even know were there. And even though it's painful sometimes, I also feel like I'm finally starting to understand myself better. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Your insight and courage are commendable.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot. I know I still have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel hopeful. Like maybe I can work through this and come out stronger on the other side. It's just... it's a lot to process, you know? Sometimes I worry that I'm not doing enough or that I'm not making progress fast enough.",
    "Therapist: Progress isn't always linear. What helps you stay motivated?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's the little moments of clarity, like today. And the thought of being a better mom to my kids, a better partner. I want to break this cycle, you know? I don't want my anxiety and unresolved trauma to affect them the way my parents' issues affected me. And I guess... I'm starting to believe that I deserve to feel better, to be happy. That's new for me.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful motivation. How can we build on today's insights?",
    "Client: Maybe we could... could we spend some time in our next session talking more about healthy ways to express anger? And perhaps we could work on some assertiveness techniques? I think that would help me feel more prepared to start making these changes in my life.",
    "Therapist: Excellent suggestions. We'll focus on that next time.",
    "Client: Great, thank you. I'm nervous but... I'm also kind of excited. It feels like I'm finally starting to take control of my life instead of just reacting to everything. And... I appreciate your guidance through all of this. It means a lot to have someone I can trust to help me navigate these choppy waters.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work. Any final thoughts for today?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for pushing me when I need it, and for helping me see things I couldn't see on my own. I know I have a long journey ahead, but I'm starting to believe that I can do this. And that's... that's huge for me."
