    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do. I've been having more nightmares about the earthquake lately, and I'm not sure if I'm ready to talk about it in detail.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's discuss the imaginal exposure we'll be doing.",
    "Client: Imaginal exposure? That sounds... intense. What exactly does that mean?",
    "Therapist: It's a way to process your trauma memories safely. We'll go through the event step-by-step.",
    "Client: (taking a deep breath) I don't know if I can do that. Just thinking about it makes my heart race. What if I panic?",
    "Therapist: Your reactions are normal. I'll be here to support you throughout.",
    "Client: Okay... I trust you. But can you tell me more about what to expect? I'm feeling really anxious about this.",
    "Therapist: We'll start slowly, focusing on manageable parts. You're in control throughout.",
    "Client: That helps a little. But what if I start crying or can't continue? I'm worried I'll fall apart.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to show emotions. We can pause anytime you need.",
    "Client: Alright. I appreciate that. I guess I'm just scared of reliving it all again. Since my brother died in the earthquake, I've been trying so hard to avoid thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Avoidance is common, but facing memories can reduce their power over you.",
    "Client: That makes sense. I do want to feel better. It's just... it's been so hard. Do you really think this will help?",
    "Therapist: Yes. Many have found relief through this process. Your courage is admirable.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot. I'm still nervous, but I'm willing to try. Can we start slowly?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll go at your pace. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Yes, I think I'm ready. Let's do this."
