    "Therapist: Hello, Mrs. Thompson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Oh, hello Dr. Anderson. I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. I've been feeling quite anxious about today's session. I know we've talked about doing something different, and it's been weighing on my mind.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, you mentioned last time that we'd be doing something called imaginal exposure. It sounds... frightening. The idea of reliving those moments from my childhood, it makes my heart race just thinking about it. I've spent so many years trying to forget, and now you want me to remember?",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Shall we discuss the purpose behind this exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I need to understand why we're doing this. It feels counterintuitive to dig up painful memories when I've tried so hard to bury them.",
    "Therapist: Imaginal exposure helps process traumatic memories. It can reduce PTSD symptoms over time.",
    "Client: But how? Won't it just make everything worse? I'm afraid I'll fall apart if I start talking about... about what I saw.",
    "Therapist: It may be difficult initially, but you'll be supported throughout. How do you feel about trying?",
    "Client: I'm terrified, to be honest. But I also know that what I've been doing hasn't been working. The nightmares, the constant anxiety... I'm tired of living like this. If you think this might help, I'm willing to give it a try. Can you tell me more about what to expect?",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. You'll describe the memory, and I'll guide you through it. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It sounds challenging, but I appreciate that we'll go at my pace. Will I have to share every detail? There are some things... some things I've never told anyone.",
    "Therapist: Share what you're comfortable with. We can pause anytime. Your safety is priority.",
    "Client: Okay, that makes me feel a bit better. I'm still nervous, but knowing we can stop if it becomes too much helps. How long will this process take? Will we do this every session?",
    "Therapist: We'll do this for about 30-45 minutes today. We'll continue in future sessions as needed.",
    "Client: I see. That's longer than I expected, but I suppose it takes time to work through these things. Dr. Anderson, do you really think this will help? I've carried this burden for so long, it's hard to imagine ever being free from it.",
    "Therapist: Many find relief through this process. Your courage is admirable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Thank you for saying that. It helps to know that others have found it useful. I'm still scared, but I'm also... hopeful, I think. Yes, let's begin. But please, if you see me getting too distressed, can you help me calm down?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll use grounding techniques if needed. Ready to start?",
    "Client: Okay, I'm ready. Or as ready as I'll ever be, I suppose. Thank you for being patient with me, Dr. Anderson. I know this isn't easy, but I trust you. Let's do this."
