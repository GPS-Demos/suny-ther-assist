    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the hostage situation?",
    "Client: Okay... I was at the bank, just a regular day. I remember the smell of coffee from the nearby caf\u00e9. Suddenly, there was shouting. A man with a gun burst in, waving it around. My heart started racing...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Everyone was screaming and dropping to the floor. I froze. I couldn't move. The gunman was yelling for money, but all I could think about was my family. What if I never saw them again? My hands were shaking so badly...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: It's hard... I can feel my chest tightening just like it did then. The gunman grabbed a young woman as a shield. She was crying, begging him to let her go. I wanted to help, but I was so scared. I felt so helpless...",
    "Therapist: That's natural. Keep describing what happened.",
    "Client: Hours passed. It felt like days. The police arrived, and there was so much tension. I kept thinking about my partner, wondering if I'd ever see them again. The gunman was getting more agitated, screaming at the negotiators...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How were you feeling?",
    "Client: Terrified. Angry. Guilty for not doing anything. I remember the sound of a child whimpering nearby, and it broke my heart. I wanted to comfort them, but I was paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there was a loud bang. I thought it was a gunshot, but it was a flash-bang from the police. Everything happened so fast after that. The SWAT team rushed in, there was shouting, more bangs... I closed my eyes and curled up, praying it would end.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: When I opened my eyes, it was over. The gunman was subdued. People were crying, hugging each other. I felt... numb. Like it wasn't real. I walked out of the bank in a daze, and that's when I saw my partner. They were behind the police line, looking so worried...",
    "Therapist: How do you feel now, recalling this?",
    "Client: It's... intense. My heart is racing, and I feel a lump in my throat. But... I also feel a bit lighter? Like I'm finally letting it out after holding it in for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. You did well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to talk about, but I think it's helping. I've been having nightmares about it, but they're less frequent now. Sometimes I still get jumpy in public places, especially banks. But I'm trying to remind myself that what happened was rare.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: I'm nervous but willing. I want to get better, to not let this control my life anymore. It's affecting my relationship and my work. I want to feel safe again, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. We'll work on that together.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. There's one thing that still bothers me a lot. The young woman who was used as a shield... I saw her at a support group meeting. She's struggling with PTSD, and I can't help but feel guilty. Like I should have done something to help her.",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. You were all victims.",
    "Client: I know that logically, but emotionally... it's hard. I keep thinking about what I could have done differently. But then I remember how paralyzed with fear I was. It's a constant battle in my mind.",
    "Therapist: That's what we'll work on. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm trying. Some days are better than others. I'm grateful for my partner's support through all this. They've been so patient, even when I wake up screaming from nightmares or when I cancel plans because I'm too anxious to go out.",
    "Therapist: Support is crucial. We'll end here for today.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you for guiding me through this. It's tough, but I think it's helping. I feel drained, but also a bit lighter. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's very common. Take care of yourself today.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again. I'll see you next week."
