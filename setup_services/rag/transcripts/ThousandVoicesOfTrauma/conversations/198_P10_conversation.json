    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A little jittery, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about the accident again, and it's making my stomach do flip-flops.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in my car. It's a sunny afternoon, and I'm driving home from a meeting with a client. The radio's on, playing some pop song. I remember feeling good about how the meeting went.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm approaching an intersection. The light's green, so I'm not slowing down. Then... oh God... I see this blur from the right. It's coming so fast.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: My heart's racing. I'm... I'm panicking. I try to swerve, but it's too late. There's this awful screeching sound, and then... CRASH!",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 70. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing well. What happens after the crash?",
    "Client: Everything's spinning. There's this ringing in my ears. I smell gasoline and... and something burning. I'm trying to move, but my seatbelt's jammed.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in that moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. I keep thinking, \"Am I going to die here?\" I can hear people shouting outside, but it all seems far away.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I'm fumbling with the seatbelt, my fingers feel clumsy. Finally, it clicks open. I push the door, but it's stuck. I'm starting to panic more.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 85. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe what you see around you?",
    "Client: I see... I see cracks in my windshield. There's smoke coming from somewhere. And then... then I see someone at my window. They're trying to open the door.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens then?",
    "Client: The door finally opens. This man, he's asking if I'm okay, but his voice sounds muffled. He's helping me out of the car. My legs feel wobbly.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling as you get out of the car?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm relieved, but also in shock. Everything seems surreal, like I'm watching it happen to someone else. I can see the other car now. It's... it's so mangled.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you notice?",
    "Client: There are people gathered around. Someone's on the phone, probably calling 911. I hear sirens in the distance. I'm... I'm shaking all over.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Maria. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still pretty high. Maybe 80.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay... okay, I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: The paramedics arrive. They're checking me over, asking me questions. I can barely focus. I keep looking at the other car, wondering if the driver is okay.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking, \"How did this happen? Was it my fault? What if someone died?\" It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those thoughts. How does your body feel?",
    "Client: My neck is starting to hurt. My hands won't stop shaking. I feel nauseous.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Maria. Keep going. What happens after the paramedics check you?",
    "Client: They want to take me to the hospital. I'm trying to call my husband, but my phone... my phone's broken. A police officer offers me his phone.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about calling your husband?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm scared. I don't want to worry him, but I need him. My voice is shaky when I talk to him.",
    "Therapist: What do you tell him?",
    "Client: I... I tell him I've been in an accident. That I'm okay, but they're taking me to the hospital. He sounds panicked. Says he'll meet me there.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 75. Talking to my husband helped a little.",
    "Therapist: Good. Take another deep breath. What happens as you're taken to the hospital?",
    "Client: I'm in the ambulance. The paramedic is talking to me, trying to keep me calm. I'm... I'm starting to feel the pain more now. My neck, my back... everything hurts.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The sirens are so loud. I can feel every bump in the road. I keep replaying the accident in my head, wondering if I could have done something differently.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are you experiencing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm scared. Guilty. Confused. It's all mixed up.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Maria. How are you feeling right now, in this moment?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. My heart's still racing. But... but I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You are safe. Let's take a moment to breathe together.",
    "Client: (takes several deep breaths) Okay... okay, I think I'm ready to continue.",
    "Therapist: Alright. What happens when you arrive at the hospital?",
    "Client: It's... it's chaotic. They wheel me in on a stretcher. There are so many people, so many noises. I'm trying to answer their questions, but everything's a blur.",
    "Therapist: What stands out to you in that moment?",
    "Client: The bright lights. The smell of antiseptic. A nurse holding my hand, telling me it's going to be okay.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's comforting, but also scary. Like, if she's saying that, maybe it's worse than I thought.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: They're taking me for x-rays. I'm lying there, trying not to move. My mind keeps going back to the accident. I can't stop thinking about the other driver.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking about the other driver?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm worried. Scared. What if they're badly hurt? What if... what if they didn't make it?",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 85 again. My chest feels tight thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Maria. You're doing well. What happens after the x-rays?",
    "Client: I'm back in the ER. A doctor comes to talk to me. He says I have whiplash, some bruising, but no major injuries. I feel... I feel relieved, but also guilty for feeling relieved.",
    "Therapist: Can you explain that guilt?",
    "Client: It's... it's like, how can I feel okay when I don't know what happened to the other person? I keep asking about them, but no one seems to know.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with that uncertainty?",
    "Client: I... I try to focus on what the doctor's saying. On the fact that I'm okay. But it's hard. My mind keeps racing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Maria. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Emotionally drained. But also... also a little proud that I got through telling it.",
    "Therapist: That's a big accomplishment. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 60 now. Still there, but not as intense.",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves again. Can you tell me three things you see in this room?",
    "Client: I see... I see the plant in the corner. The blue painting on the wall. And... and the box of tissues on the table.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Now, two things you can hear?",
    "Client: I hear... I hear the air conditioning. And... and a car passing outside.",
    "Therapist: Great. Lastly, one thing you can feel?",
    "Client: I can feel... I can feel the softness of this chair I'm sitting on.",
    "Therapist: Very good, Maria. You've done incredible work today. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. But also... also a little lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after processing trauma. You've shown great courage today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It... it wasn't easy, but I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: I'm proud of the progress you've made. Let's end our session here and discuss how you can take care of yourself for the rest of the day."
