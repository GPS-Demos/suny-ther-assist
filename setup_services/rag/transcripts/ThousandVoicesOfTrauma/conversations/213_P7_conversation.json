    "Therapist: Welcome, Rahul. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit anxious, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about some difficult things, and I'm not sure if I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We'll take it step by step.",
    "Client: Okay. I guess we're going to talk about that night again, aren't we? The night my sister... when the domestic violence happened.",
    "Therapist: Yes, if you're comfortable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Alright. I'll try. It was late, around 11 PM. I was in my room, trying to study for an exam. I could hear my sister and her husband arguing downstairs. It wasn't unusual, but this time it sounded more intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The shouting got louder. I heard something crash. I was frozen, unsure if I should intervene. Then I heard my sister scream. It was a sound I'd never heard before, filled with fear and pain. I rushed downstairs and...",
    "Therapist: Take your time. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I saw her on the floor, curled up. Her husband was standing over her, his fist raised. There was blood... so much blood. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. My sister, always so strong and vibrant, looked so small and broken.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: I shouted at him to stop. He turned to me, his eyes wild with anger. For a moment, I thought he might attack me too. But then he just... left. Walked out the door. I ran to my sister, tried to help her up. She was sobbing, her face swollen and bleeding.",
    "Therapist: That must have been terrifying. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I called an ambulance. While we waited, I held her, feeling so helpless. She kept apologizing, saying it was her fault. I felt angry, scared, and guilty all at once. Why didn't I intervene sooner? Why didn't I see the signs?",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. You did what you could.",
    "Client: The paramedics arrived and took her to the hospital. I rode with her, holding her hand the whole time. At the hospital, they told us she had a concussion and several fractures. I stayed with her all night, watching her sleep, afraid to close my eyes.",
    "Therapist: You were there for her. That's important.",
    "Client: In the following days, I helped her move out, get a restraining order. But the image of her on the floor, the sound of her scream... it haunts me. I have nightmares about it. Sometimes I wake up in a cold sweat, thinking I hear her screaming again.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're processing trauma.",
    "Client: I know she's safe now, but I can't shake this fear. What if I had done something different? What if it happens again and I'm not there to help? I feel like I failed her somehow.",
    "Therapist: You didn't fail. You supported her when she needed it most.",
    "Client: I guess... It's just hard. I feel like I should have known, should have done more. And now, every time I hear a loud noise or an argument, I tense up. I'm always on edge, waiting for something bad to happen.",
    "Therapist: Your reactions are normal. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. It helps to talk about it, even though it's painful. I want to move past this, to not let it control my life. But it's hard. Sometimes I feel like I'll never be the same person I was before that night.",
    "Therapist: Change is part of healing. You're showing great strength.",
    "Client: I hope so. I want to be strong for my sister, to help her heal too. But sometimes it feels like too much. I've been having trouble sleeping, concentrating on my studies. I've even thought about dropping out of school.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are valid. We'll work on coping strategies.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's just... sometimes I feel so angry. At her husband, at myself, at the world. Other times, I feel numb, like nothing matters anymore. Is this normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, these emotions are common after trauma. You're not alone.",
    "Client: Thank you for saying that. It helps to know I'm not crazy for feeling this way. I just want to feel normal again, you know? To be able to hear a loud noise without flinching, to sleep through the night without nightmares.",
    "Therapist: That's a good goal. We'll work towards it together.",
    "Client: I hope so. I'm tired of feeling this way, of reliving that night over and over. But talking about it like this... it's hard, but I think it's helping. At least I hope it is.",
    "Therapist: It is helping. You're making progress with each session.",
    "Client: Thank you. I know we're almost out of time, but there's one more thing. Since that night, I've been... I've been drinking more. To help me sleep, to numb the memories. I know it's not healthy, but I don't know how else to cope.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad you shared that. We'll address it in our next session.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm nervous about tackling that, but I know I need to. Thank you for listening, for helping me through this. It means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Rahul. We'll continue this work next time."
