    "Therapist: Alright, Mrs. Johnson, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's begin. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day of the hostage situation.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm there. I can see the bank lobby. It's busy, people are going about their business. I'm in line, waiting to deposit my pension check. Suddenly, there's shouting. A man with a gun bursts through the door. My heart starts racing immediately.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: It's about a 6. I can feel my palms getting sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Okay, continue.",
    "Client: The man is waving the gun around, screaming at everyone to get down. I'm frozen in place. I can't move. My legs feel like lead. People are screaming and crying. I smell something acrid... maybe it's fear. The gunman grabs a young teller and puts the gun to her head. I'm terrified he's going to shoot her.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. My chest feels tight. I'm having trouble breathing, just like I did then.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: (Voice shaking) The police arrive outside. The gunman is getting more agitated. He's shouting demands. I'm on the floor now, trying to make myself as small as possible. Hours pass. It's hot, stuffy. People are crying softly. I keep thinking about my late husband, wishing he was here to protect me.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: Still an 8. My hands are shaking. I feel so helpless, just like I did then.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with it.",
    "Client: The negotiator is talking to the gunman. There's a moment when I think it's all over, but then the gunman fires a shot into the ceiling. The sound is deafening. I feel like my heart might burst out of my chest. I'm certain I'm going to die here.",
    "Therapist: And now?",
    "Client: (Breathing heavily) It's... it's a 9. I feel like I can't breathe. My chest hurts.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here, Mrs. Johnson.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) The standoff continues. I'm so thirsty, so tired. Finally, after what feels like days, there's a commotion. The police storm in. There's shouting, more gunshots. I cover my ears and squeeze my eyes shut. When I open them, it's over. The gunman is down. We're being led out by officers.",
    "Therapist: How about your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's coming down... maybe a 7. I feel drained, like I've lived through it all over again.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. How are you feeling overall?",

    "Client: I'm willing to try. It's hard, but I think it might be helping.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive attitude. We'll take it step by step."
