    "Client: I think so. I'm nervous, but I'll try.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in Afghanistan. It's hot, dusty. The sun is beating down on us. We're on patrol in a small village. Everything seems quiet, but there's this tension in the air. I can feel my heart racing already.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud explosion. I'm thrown to the ground. My ears are ringing, and I can taste dirt in my mouth. I'm disoriented, but I know we're under attack. I scramble to my feet, trying to find cover.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see... I see chaos. People are screaming. There's smoke everywhere. I spot one of my squad members lying motionless on the ground. I want to help him, but I can't move. I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I feel so guilty. I should have helped him. But I was paralyzed with fear. I can still see his face, covered in blood and dirt. I... I don't know if I can continue.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm trying. The gunfire is getting closer. I finally snap out of it and start moving. I crawl towards my fallen comrade, bullets whizzing past me. When I reach him, I realize... he's already gone. His eyes are open, staring blankly at the sky. I feel sick.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I want to mourn, but there's no time. I grab his dog tags and start dragging his body behind cover. My muscles are screaming, but adrenaline keeps me going. I can hear my sergeant yelling orders, but it all seems muffled and far away.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Continue.",
    "Client: Once we're behind cover, I try to catch my breath. But then I see a young local boy, couldn't be more than ten, running towards us. He looks terrified. For a split second, I think he's coming to us for help. But then I see it - he's wearing a vest. Oh god, he's a suicide bomber.",
    "Therapist: This is tough. You're doing well.",
    "Client: I raise my weapon. I know what I have to do, but everything in me is screaming not to. He's just a child. But if I don't... everyone around me will die. My finger is on the trigger. I'm shaking. I close my eyes and...",
    "Therapist: It's okay. You're here now, safe.",
    "Client: I pull the trigger. The sound is deafening. When I open my eyes, the boy is on the ground. There's so much blood. I feel numb. I can't believe what I've just done. I've killed a child. I drop my weapon and fall to my knees. I'm crying, screaming. But the battle rages on around me. I've never felt so alone, so horrified by my own actions.",
    "Therapist: You survived an impossible situation.",
    "Client: But at what cost? I can't shake the image of that boy's face. It haunts me every night. I know it was him or us, but... how do I live with this? How do I move on knowing I took a child's life?",
    "Therapist: It's a heavy burden. You're brave for sharing.",
    "Client: Sometimes I wish I had died there instead. The guilt is overwhelming. I've tried to rationalize it, to tell myself I had no choice. But it doesn't help. I see his face everywhere - in crowds, in my dreams. I can't escape it.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. We'll work through this.",
    "Client: I don't know if I can ever forgive myself. The weight of it all... it's crushing me. I've pushed away everyone I care about. I can't bear to be close to anyone, knowing what I've done. I feel like a monster.",
    "Therapist: You're not a monster. You're human.",
    "Client: But how can I be? A human wouldn't do what I did. I took an oath to protect, and instead, I... I killed an innocent. I know he was being used as a weapon, but he was still just a child. I robbed him of his future, of everything he could have been.",
    "Therapist: You were in an impossible situation.",
    "Client: I know, logically, that's true. But my heart... my soul... they can't accept it. Every day is a struggle. I wake up reliving that moment, feeling the weight of the gun in my hands, hearing the shot. It's like I'm trapped in that moment forever.",
    "Therapist: You're here now. You're surviving.",
    "Client: Am I really? Sometimes it feels like I left the real me back there in that village. Like I'm just a shell going through the motions. I don't know how to find my way back to who I was before. I don't know if that person even exists anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's what we're working towards. Small steps.",
    "Client: I hope so. I really do. Because right now, I feel lost. Completely and utterly lost. The guilt, the trauma, the nightmares - they're consuming me. I want to find a way forward, but it feels impossible.",
    "Therapist: It's not impossible. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I guess... I guess talking about it like this is a start. It's the first time I've really described it in detail to anyone. It's painful, but... maybe it's necessary. I just hope one day I can look in the mirror without seeing that boy's face staring back at me.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful hope. We'll work towards it.",
    "Client: Thank you. I know this isn't easy to hear either. But I appreciate you listening, really listening, without judgment. It's more than I've allowed anyone else to do. Maybe... maybe this is the first step towards healing.",
    "Therapist: It is. You've shown immense courage today.",
    "Client: I don't feel courageous. But I do feel... I don't know, maybe a tiny bit lighter? Like sharing this burden, even a little, has helped. It's still there, still heavy, but maybe not quite as crushing as before.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Drained. But also... maybe a little hopeful? Is that weird? To feel hope after reliving something so horrible?",
    "Therapist: It's not weird. It's a positive sign.",
