    "Therapist: Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: I'm honestly a bit nervous. I've heard about exposure therapy, but I'm not entirely sure what to expect. Can you tell me more about what we'll be doing?",
    "Therapist: Of course. It involves revisiting your trauma memory in a safe environment. What concerns do you have?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about reliving the emotional abuse I experienced through cyberbullying. It was a really dark time for me, and I've worked hard to move past it. I'm afraid that talking about it in detail might bring back all those negative feelings and set me back. How can you be sure this won't make things worse?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. This process helps by allowing you to process the memory safely. How do you typically cope with difficult emotions?",
    "Client: I usually try to distract myself with work or exercise. Sometimes I'll talk to my partner, but I don't like to burden them too much with my problems. I've also been trying meditation, but it's hard to stick with it when I'm feeling really anxious or upset. Do you think those strategies will be enough during this process?",
    "Therapist: Those are good strategies. We'll also develop additional coping techniques together. What questions do you have about the process?",
    "Client: I'm wondering how detailed I need to be when describing the cyberbullying incidents. There were so many instances, and some were particularly hurtful. Do I need to go through every single one? And what if I get too overwhelmed during the session? Can we stop if it becomes too much?",
    "Therapist: You don't need to cover everything at once. We'll go at your pace, and can pause anytime. What's your biggest fear about this?",
    "Client: I think my biggest fear is that I'll lose control of my emotions. I've worked hard to maintain a professional image, and the idea of breaking down or showing vulnerability is really uncomfortable for me. I'm also worried that revisiting these memories might affect my current relationship. My partner has been so supportive, but they don't know all the details of what happened. What if this process changes how they see me?",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are normal. Remember, this is a safe space. How can I support you during this process?",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I think it would help if you could give me some kind of warning or heads up before we dive into the really difficult parts. Maybe we could establish a signal or code word that I can use if I need a break? And if possible, I'd like to spend a few minutes at the end of each session talking about something positive or focusing on how far I've come since the cyberbullying incidents. Would that be okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll use a code word and end positively. Your courage in facing this is commendable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Thank you, that means a lot to hear. I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Just to clarify, we're starting with the imaginal exposure today, right? Not just talking about it? I want to make sure I'm mentally prepared. And yes, let's begin. I trust you to guide me through this process.",
    "Therapist: Yes, we're starting today. Remember, you're in control. Are you ready to begin the exercise?",
    "Client: Okay, I understand. Yes, I think I'm ready. I'm still nervous, but I know this is an important step in my healing process. Can you just remind me one more time what I should focus on as we start? Should I close my eyes, or keep them open? And how detailed should I be in describing what happened?",
    "Therapist: Focus on the memory, eyes closed if comfortable. Be as detailed as you can. Shall we start now?",
    "Client: Alright, I'll close my eyes and try to focus on the memory. I'll do my best to be detailed, but please bear with me if I struggle at times. Yes, let's start now. I'm taking a deep breath, and I'm ready to begin."
