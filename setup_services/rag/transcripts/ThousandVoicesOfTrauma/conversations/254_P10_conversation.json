    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Johnson. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit apprehensive, to be honest. We're diving into some pretty heavy stuff today, aren't we?",
    "Therapist: Yes, we are. Remember, you're in control. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. As ready as I'll ever be, I guess.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day at work. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in the office. It's early, maybe 8:30 AM. The fluorescent lights are harsh, and there's a faint smell of coffee in the air. I can hear the hum of computers starting up and people shuffling in.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm at my desk, organizing some files when I hear her voice. It's Sandra, my supervisor. She's talking loudly to someone else, but I know it's about me. \"Can you believe she messed up that report again? At her age, you'd think she'd have learned by now.\"",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel in the moment?",
    "Client: I... I feel my cheeks burning. My hands are shaking a little. I want to disappear, to sink into the floor. It's like I'm back in high school, being mocked by the popular kids.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Um... probably around a 60.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Right... So, I'm trying to focus on my work, but I can still hear them. Sandra's laughing now, and I hear footsteps approaching. My heart is racing, and I'm gripping my pen so tightly my knuckles are white.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: Sandra stops at my desk. She's smiling, but it's not friendly. It's... predatory. She says, \"Oh, Elizabeth. I need you to redo that entire quarterly report. It's a mess, just like your desk.\" Her voice is dripping with condescension.",
    "Therapist: How do you respond?",
    "Client: I... I don't. I just nod and mumble, \"Yes, of course.\" But inside, I'm screaming. I want to stand up and tell her off, but I can't. I feel so small, so... insignificant.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's higher. Maybe 75?",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're doing well. What do you notice in your body?",
    "Client: My shoulders are tense, and there's this knot in my stomach. I feel like I might be sick.",
    "Therapist: Focus on those sensations. What happens after Sandra leaves?",
    "Client: I... I try to work, but I can't concentrate. My hands are shaking too much to type properly. I keep making mistakes, which only makes me more anxious. I can feel eyes on me from around the office. Are they all laughing at me too?",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking that maybe Sandra's right. Maybe I am too old for this job. Maybe I should just quit before they fire me. I feel so... worthless.",
    "Therapist: Remember, these are just thoughts. They're not facts. How does your body feel now?",
    "Client: It's like there's a weight on my chest. I can't seem to catch my breath properly. And my head... it's pounding.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *takes several deep breaths* Okay... I'm... I'm still at my desk. The day drags on, and every time I hear laughter or whispering, I'm convinced it's about me. By lunchtime, I can't take it anymore. I grab my purse and practically run to the bathroom.",
    "Therapist: What happens in the bathroom?",
    "Client: I... I lock myself in a stall and just... break down. I'm crying, trying to muffle the sound with my hand. I feel so pathetic, so weak. I'm a grown woman, for god's sake! I shouldn't be hiding in a bathroom stall crying like a teenager.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's pretty high. Maybe 85?",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're in control here. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I try to pull myself together. I splash some water on my face, reapply my makeup. But when I look in the mirror, all I see is this sad, old woman who doesn't belong. I take a few deep breaths and head back to my desk.",
    "Therapist: How do others react when you return?",
    "Client: I can feel their eyes on me. Some look away quickly, others whisper to each other. Sandra walks by and says, \"Oh, Elizabeth. You look flushed. Maybe you should go home if you're not feeling well.\" Her tone is mock concern, but her eyes... they're cold.",
    "Therapist: What do you want to do in that moment?",
    "Client: I want to... I want to scream at her. Tell her how cruel she is, how she's making my life miserable. But I don't. I just nod and say, \"I'm fine, thank you.\" My voice sounds small, even to me.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Angry. So angry at myself for not standing up to her. But also... defeated. Like there's no point in fighting back.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still pretty high. Maybe 80?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with those feelings. What happens for the rest of the day?",
    "Client: I... I try to focus on my work, but I keep making mistakes. Every time Sandra walks by, I tense up. By the end of the day, I'm exhausted. As I'm packing up to leave, I overhear Sandra telling someone, \"We really need some fresh blood in this department. Some of these old-timers just can't keep up anymore.\"",
    "Therapist: How does that comment affect you?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a punch to the gut. I feel sick, literally nauseous. I grab my things and practically run out of the office. In the elevator, I'm fighting back tears. I just want to get home, away from all of them.",
    "Therapist: What happens when you get home?",
    "Client: I... I collapse on the couch. My husband asks how my day was, and I just... I break down. I'm sobbing, telling him everything. He's angry, wants me to report Sandra to HR, but I... I can't. I'm too afraid of making things worse.",
    "Therapist: How does your husband respond to your fears?",
    "Client: He's supportive, but I can tell he's frustrated. He doesn't understand why I won't stand up for myself. I feel... I feel like I'm letting him down too.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe 70?",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you name five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: Um... I see the painting on the wall, your desk, the bookshelf, the clock, and the plant in the corner.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, take a deep breath. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: A bit calmer, I think. But still... shaky.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've been very brave today. Is there anything else about that day you want to share?",
    "Client: I... I couldn't sleep that night. I kept replaying everything in my head, thinking of all the things I should have said or done. I felt so... powerless. And the next morning, I almost called in sick. The thought of facing Sandra again... it terrified me.",
    "Therapist: How did you find the strength to go back?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. I guess I knew I couldn't hide forever. But walking into that office... it felt like walking into a lion's den.",
    "Therapist: That took a lot of courage. How do you feel now, thinking back on all of this?",
    "Client: It's... it's still painful. But maybe... maybe a little less overwhelming? I don't know.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down. Maybe 55?",
    "Therapist: That's great. You've done really well today. Let's take a few more deep breaths together before we end the session.",
    "Client: *takes several deep breaths* Thank you. This... this wasn't easy.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Remember, you're stronger than you think. We'll continue working through this together."
