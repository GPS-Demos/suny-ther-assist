    "Therapist: Good morning, Mr. Singh. Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: Good morning, Doctor. To be honest, I'm feeling quite nervous. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of revisiting those painful memories... it's unsettling. I've spent years trying to push them away, and now you're asking me to bring them to the forefront. It's... well, it's scary.",
    "Therapist: I understand. It's natural to feel apprehensive. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about losing control of my emotions. What if I break down completely? Or what if reliving those experiences makes my depression worse? I've been managing it reasonably well lately, but this feels like it could upset that balance. And... I'm ashamed to admit it, but I'm also concerned about how you might perceive me after hearing about my experiences with bullying. It's not exactly something a professional man my age likes to discuss.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. Let's address them one by one. First, about control...",
    "Client: Yes, that's a big one for me. I've always prided myself on being composed, especially at work. The thought of falling apart here... it's uncomfortable. And what if I can't stop the memories once they start? Will I be able to function normally after the session?",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. You're in control. If it becomes overwhelming, we'll pause. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's somewhat reassuring. But I'm still worried about the aftermath. Will I be able to go home to my family and act normally? Or will this stir up so much that I'll be a mess for days?",
    "Therapist: It's common to feel emotional after, but many find relief. We'll end with grounding exercises. Any other concerns?",
    "Client: Yes, actually. Given recent events and our discussion topic of police brutality, I'm worried about how this might affect my view of authority figures. I've always taught my children to respect the police, but after revisiting my own trauma... I'm not sure how to reconcile these feelings.",
    "Therapist: That's a complex issue. We'll explore those feelings as they come up. Your experiences are valid.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's just... there's so much wrapped up in this. My cultural background, my role as a father and husband, my professional life. It feels like opening this box might change everything. But I also know I can't keep running from it. I've seen how it's affected my relationships, my work... even my physical health. I'm tired of carrying this weight. So, while I'm terrified, I'm also... ready, I suppose. If that makes any sense.",
    "Therapist: It makes perfect sense. Your readiness is a strength. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. But... can you just walk me through what exactly is going to happen? Just so I feel a bit more prepared?",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll start with a relaxation exercise, then you'll describe the traumatic event in detail...",
    "Client: In detail? That's... intimidating. Will I need to close my eyes? I'm not sure I can do that. It might make me feel too vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: You can keep your eyes open if you prefer. The goal is to process the memory in a safe environment.",
    "Client: Okay, that's good to know. And you'll be here the whole time, right? You won't leave me alone with these memories?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'll be here throughout, guiding and supporting you.",
    "Client: Alright. I think... I think I'm ready. Or as ready as I'll ever be. Let's do this before I lose my nerve.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. Remember, this is a step towards healing. Shall we begin the relaxation exercise?"
