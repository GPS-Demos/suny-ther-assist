    "Therapist: Welcome, Sam. Today we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of revisiting those memories of the cyclone... it's scary. I'm worried it might bring back all those intense feelings I've been trying to avoid.",
    "Therapist: Your anxiety is understandable. This process can be challenging, but it's crucial for healing.",
    "Client: I get that, but... what if I can't handle it? What if I completely break down or have a panic attack during the session?",
    "Therapist: We'll take it slow, and I'll be here to support you throughout. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... ever since the cyclone hit our island, I've been trying so hard to push those memories away. The sound of the wind, the destruction everywhere... it's overwhelming. And now, with all this news about police brutality, it feels like danger is everywhere. I'm not sure I'm ready to face all of that head-on.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. This exercise aims to process these memories safely. Shall we discuss what to expect?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think knowing what's coming might help me feel a bit more prepared. But I'm still worried about how intense it might get. Will I be able to stop if it becomes too much?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're in control. We can pause or stop anytime. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's a relief to hear. I guess I'm just scared of feeling out of control, you know? After the cyclone, everything felt so chaotic and unpredictable. And now, seeing all these incidents of police brutality on the news, it's like the world isn't safe anymore. I'm constantly on edge.",
    "Therapist: I hear you. This exercise will help you regain control over these memories and reduce anxiety.",
    "Client: Okay, I think I understand. But can you tell me more about what exactly we'll be doing? Will I need to close my eyes and relive everything in detail?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the experience aloud while I guide you. Eyes closed often helps, but it's your choice.",
    "Client: That sounds intense. I'm worried about getting stuck in those memories and not being able to pull myself out. And... I'm embarrassed to admit this, but what if I cry or react in a way that seems weak?",
    "Therapist: There's no shame in emotional reactions. They're a normal part of healing. Your courage is admirable.",
    "Client: Thank you, that means a lot. I guess I'm just used to trying to be strong all the time. It's hard to let my guard down. But if this can really help me deal with these memories and feel safer in the world again, I want to try. I'm tired of feeling so anxious and on edge all the time.",
    "Therapist: Your willingness to engage is a significant step. Shall we begin with some relaxation exercises?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would help. I can feel my heart racing just thinking about it. But I'm also feeling a glimmer of hope. Maybe this could be the key to moving forward and not letting these traumatic experiences control my life anymore. I'm ready to give it a try.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's start with deep breathing. Remember, you're safe here. Ready?"
