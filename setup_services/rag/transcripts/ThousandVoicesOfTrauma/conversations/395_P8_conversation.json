    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is still tense, you know? My heart's racing a bit, and I feel this heaviness in my chest. The memory of Carlos yelling at me, his face so close to mine... it's still vivid. I can almost smell his breath.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how scared I was in that moment. How I felt so small and helpless. But there's also this... anger bubbling up. I'm angry at myself for not leaving sooner, for letting it get to that point. And I'm furious at him for treating me that way. It's all mixed up inside me.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a fire in my stomach. My fists are clenched, and I notice I'm gritting my teeth. Part of me wants to scream, but another part feels ashamed for feeling this way. Is it wrong to be this angry?",
    "Therapist: There's no right or wrong way to feel. What else comes up for you?",
    "Client: I... I feel sad too. Sad for the person I was then, so desperate for love that I put up with his abuse. I remember thinking, \"If I can just be better, he won't get so angry.\" God, it's embarrassing to admit that now. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little proud? That I eventually found the strength to leave.",
    "Therapist: How does that pride feel different from the other emotions?",
    "Client: It's... warmer, I guess? Like a small light in my chest. It doesn't take away the pain or fear, but it's there. It reminds me that I'm not that same person anymore. I've grown, even if it doesn't always feel like it.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your body now?",
    "Client: I... huh. My breathing's a bit easier. My shoulders aren't as tight. The memory's still there, but it feels... I don't know, less overwhelming? Like I can look at it without being completely consumed by it. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Everyone's experience is unique. What meaning do you make of that change?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe it means I'm healing? Or at least starting to? It's like, before, this memory was this huge, terrifying thing that I couldn't face. But now, even though it's still painful, I can look at it. I can talk about it without falling apart completely. That feels... significant somehow.",
    "Therapist: How does this experience compare to previous exposures?",
    "Client: It's... it's different. Before, I felt like I was right back in that moment, completely overwhelmed. This time, there's still fear and pain, but also... distance? Like I can see it happening, but I also know I'm here, safe, talking to you. And those other feelings - the anger, the sadness, the pride - they're all part of it too. It's more... complex, I guess?",
    "Therapist: What do you think has contributed to this change?",
    "Client: I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's because we've done this a few times now? Or because I've been practicing the breathing exercises you taught me? Or... maybe it's just time. Like, each time we do this, it gets a tiny bit easier to face. Don't get me wrong, it's still hard. But it feels... I don't know, more manageable somehow.",
    "Therapist: How might this experience influence your view of yourself?",
    "Client: That's... that's a big question. I think... maybe it shows me that I'm stronger than I thought? That I can face these memories and not be completely destroyed by them. And maybe... maybe it means that what happened to me doesn't define who I am now. I'm not just a victim anymore. I'm a survivor, I guess. Is that too cheesy to say?",
    "Therapist: There's no right or wrong way to express yourself here. What else?",
    "Client: Well, I'm also realizing that it's okay to have all these mixed-up feelings. Like, I can be angry and sad and proud all at the same time. And that doesn't make me crazy or weak. It just makes me... human, I guess. And maybe... maybe that's okay.",
    "Therapist: How does this realization sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... comforting, in a way. Like a weight's been lifted. For so long, I've been trying to push down all these feelings, thinking they were wrong or that I shouldn't have them. But allowing myself to feel them, to really experience them... it's scary, but also kind of freeing? Like I'm finally giving myself permission to just... be.",
    "Therapist: What do you think this means for your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I think... I think it means I'm on the right track. That even though it's painful and scary sometimes, facing these memories and feelings is helping me heal. It's not a straight line, you know? Some days are harder than others. But overall, I feel like I'm moving forward. And that... that gives me hope.",
    "Therapist: How does that hope feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's warm. Like a small flame inside me. It doesn't erase all the pain or fear, but it makes them feel... manageable, I guess? Like, I can see a future where these memories don't control me anymore. Where I can think about what happened without feeling like I'm right back there. That future still feels far away sometimes, but... it feels possible now. And that's... that's huge for me.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to remember from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I want to remember that it's okay to have all these different feelings. That facing these memories is hard, but it's making me stronger. And that... that I'm not alone in this. That you're here, listening and guiding me through this process. It makes me feel... supported, I guess. Like maybe I can actually do this, you know?",
    "Therapist: Is there anything else you'd like to share before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I just... I want to say thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. I know I have a long way to go, but... I feel like I'm making progress. And that feels good. Scary, but good. I'm... I'm grateful for this space to work through all of this.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. How would you like to ground yourself before leaving?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I could do some of those deep breathing exercises we've practiced? And maybe just sit here for a moment, feeling my feet on the ground, reminding myself that I'm here, in the present, safe. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's do that together."
