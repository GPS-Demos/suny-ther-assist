    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken up, to be honest. It's like I was right back there, you know? My heart's still racing a bit, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. The memory of my partner's angry face, the sound of things breaking... it all felt so real again.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how powerless I felt in that moment. Like, I should have been able to do something, to stop it somehow. But I just froze. And then there's this voice in my head saying, \"Maybe if I had just been a better partner, this wouldn't have happened.\" I know that's not rational, but it's hard to shake off.",
    "Therapist: I see. How do these thoughts make you feel?",
    "Client: They make me feel... guilty, I guess. And angry at myself. But also scared, like it could happen again at any moment. It's this weird mix of emotions that I can't quite untangle. And underneath it all, there's this deep sadness. Like I've lost something I can never get back.",
    "Therapist: What do you think that loss represents?",
    "Client: I think... it's the loss of safety, you know? Before this happened, I always felt safe at home. It was my sanctuary. But now, even though I'm with a different partner, I can't shake this feeling that I'm never truly safe. It's like the world has become this unpredictable, dangerous place.",
    "Therapist: How does that impact your current relationship?",
    "Client: It's... it's complicated. I love my current partner, and they're nothing like my ex. But sometimes, I catch myself flinching when they move too quickly, or I overanalyze every little disagreement we have. I'm always on edge, waiting for something to go wrong. It's not fair to them, and I know it's pushing them away.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice in your body as you talk about this?",
    "Client: I... I feel this heaviness in my stomach, like a rock sitting there. And my shoulders are so tense, they're practically up to my ears. It's like my body is still in fight-or-flight mode, even though the danger is long gone. Sometimes I get these headaches too, right at the base of my skull. It's exhausting, carrying all this tension around all the time.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with these physical sensations?",
    "Client: I've been trying some of the breathing exercises we've talked about. They help a little, but sometimes it feels like putting a band-aid on a gaping wound, you know? I've also been going for long walks when it gets really bad. Something about the physical movement and being outside helps ground me. But... I don't know. Sometimes I feel like I'll never be free of this.",
    "Therapist: What does being \"free\" mean to you?",
    "Client: Being free... I guess it would mean not constantly looking over my shoulder. Being able to trust people again, especially my partner. Not having my past dictate my present. I want to be able to disagree with someone without feeling like the world is going to end. To feel joy without waiting for the other shoe to drop. To just... exist, without this constant undercurrent of fear and anxiety.",
    "Therapist: How does talking about this now make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a bit relieving. Like I'm letting out a breath I didn't know I was holding. There's still this sadness and fear, but it feels less overwhelming when I put it into words. And there's a tiny spark of hope too, I think. Like maybe, just maybe, I can work through this and come out the other side.",
    "Therapist: What gives you that hope?",
    "Client: I think... it's the fact that I'm here, talking about it. A year ago, I couldn't even say the words \"domestic violence\" without breaking down. And now, even though it's still hard, I can talk about it. I can face these memories without completely falling apart. That has to mean something, right? And my current partner, they've been so patient and supportive. It makes me want to keep trying, to keep pushing through this for both of us.",
    "Therapist: How does this progress make you feel about yourself?",
    "Client: It makes me feel... stronger, I guess. Like maybe I'm not as broken as I thought I was. There's still a long way to go, but looking back, I can see how far I've come. It's like I'm slowly reclaiming pieces of myself that I thought were lost forever. And that feels... it feels good. Scary, but good.",
    "Therapist: What's next for you in this journey?",
    "Client: I think... I want to work on trusting my instincts more. For so long, I've second-guessed every feeling and thought I've had. But maybe it's time to start believing in myself again. And I want to be more open with my partner about what I'm going through. They deserve to understand why I react the way I do sometimes. It's terrifying, the thought of being that vulnerable again, but I think it might be necessary for healing.",
    "Therapist: How can we support you in those goals?",
    "Client: I... I'm not entirely sure. Maybe we could work on some strategies for communicating with my partner? And... I think I need help distinguishing between real danger and perceived threats from my past. Sometimes it's hard to tell the difference, you know? And maybe... maybe we could explore more ways to deal with the physical symptoms. The tension, the anxiety... it's so draining.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but in a good way? Like after a really intense workout. There's this sense of accomplishment mixed with exhaustion. And I feel... lighter, somehow. Like I've set down a heavy load, even if it's just for a moment. It's nice to feel heard and understood. Thank you for listening.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue this next time."
