    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Johnson. I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been thinking a lot about our last session and the idea of this imaginal exposure thing. It's been making me anxious.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... I've been trying so hard to avoid thinking about losing my brother. And now you're asking me to deliberately relive it? I'm worried it'll be too much. Plus, with all the online harassment I've been dealing with lately, I feel like I'm already on edge. I'm not sure I can handle more stress.",
    "Therapist: I hear your concerns. Shall we discuss the purpose of this exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I need to understand why we're doing this because right now, it just seems like unnecessary pain.",
    "Therapist: The goal is to process the trauma, reducing its power over time. It may be difficult initially, but it often leads to relief.",
    "Client: I see. But how does reliving it help? Won't it just make everything worse?",
    "Therapist: By facing the memory in a safe environment, we can work through the emotions attached to it. This can decrease its impact over time.",
    "Client: Okay, that makes sense. But what if I can't handle it? What if I completely fall apart?",
    "Therapist: I'll be here to support you throughout. We can pause or stop anytime you need. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I appreciate that you'll be there with me. I guess I'm just scared of what might come up. With everything going on - the loss, the depression, the cyberbullying - I feel like I'm barely holding it together as it is.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Remember, this is at your pace. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Well, what exactly will we be doing? And how long will it take? I'm trying to prepare myself mentally.",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit the memory of losing your brother. You'll describe it in present tense. It usually lasts about 30-45 minutes.",
    "Client: That sounds intense. Will I have to close my eyes? I'm not sure I'll be comfortable doing that.",
    "Therapist: It's your choice. Some find it helpful, but it's not necessary. What would work best for you?",
    "Client: I think I'd prefer to keep my eyes open, at least to start. It makes me feel more... in control, I guess. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. This is about your comfort and healing. Any other concerns?",
    "Client: I'm worried about how I'll feel afterwards. Will I be able to function normally? I have a big project due at work this week, and I can't afford to fall behind.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel emotional after. We'll debrief and ensure you're stable before leaving. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's good to know. I appreciate your thoughtfulness. I guess... I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Can you tell me one more time why this is important?",
