    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Karim?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. Going back to that moment when my ex-wife told me she wanted a divorce... it's still so vivid, you know? I can still see the look on her face, the way her hands were shaking. It's like I'm right there again.",
    "Therapist: What stood out to you most about revisiting that memory?",
    "Client: The overwhelming sense of failure, I suppose. I've always prided myself on being successful in my career, but in that moment, I felt like I'd failed at the most important job of all \u2013 being a husband. It's funny, I can still hear the clock ticking in the background. Tick, tick, tick... like a countdown to the end of my marriage.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to experience those emotions again?",
    "Client: It was... intense. My chest felt tight, and I had this knot in my stomach. But you know what's strange? It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Don't get me wrong, it was still painful, but... I don't know, maybe I'm starting to see it differently?",
    "Therapist: That's an interesting observation. Can you elaborate?",
    "Client: Well, I've always seen that moment as the end of everything good in my life. But today, I found myself thinking about the good times we had before things fell apart. It's like... maybe the divorce doesn't negate all the positive experiences we shared? I'm not sure if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: It makes perfect sense. How does this new perspective relate to your current life?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe it means I'm not as broken as I thought I was. For years, I've avoided relationships because I was convinced I'd fail again. But if I can see some good in my past marriage, despite how it ended, maybe I'm not doomed to repeat the same mistakes. It's a small thing, but it feels... hopeful?",
    "Therapist: That's a significant insight. How might this affect your future choices?",
    "Client: I... I'm not entirely sure. But I think I might be more open to the idea of connecting with people again. Not necessarily romantically, but just... allowing myself to be vulnerable. I've isolated myself for so long, convinced that I wasn't worthy of meaningful relationships. But maybe it's time to challenge that belief.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's one small step you could take?",
    "Client: Hmm... Maybe I could reach out to an old friend I've lost touch with? Just for coffee or something casual. It's been years since I've done anything like that, but... I think I might be ready to try.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great idea. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Surprisingly... okay. A bit drained, but also... lighter? Like I've put down a heavy burden I've been carrying for years. It's strange, but I feel more at peace than I have in a long time. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: It's a common experience. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to explore more of these memories. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm finally starting to make progress. Maybe we could delve into some of the good times in my marriage? I think it might help me balance out my perspective even more.",
    "Therapist: That's a thoughtful approach. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. I know I was skeptical about this therapy at first, but I'm starting to see its value. It's not easy, reliving these memories, but I think it's helping me move forward. I appreciate your guidance through this process.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your hard work is paying off. See you next week?",
    "Client: Absolutely. I'll be here. Thank you again."
