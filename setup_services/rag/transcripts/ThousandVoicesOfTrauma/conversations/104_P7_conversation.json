    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you start by describing the day your husband passed away?",
    "Client: It was a Tuesday morning. I remember waking up and feeling something was off. John, my husband, he wasn't in bed next to me. I called out his name, but there was no answer. I got up, my legs feeling weak, and walked to the living room. That's where I found him... he was slumped in his favorite armchair, so still. I... I can't...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a deep breath. What did you see next?",
    "Client: His face was pale, and his eyes were closed. For a moment, I thought he was just sleeping, but deep down, I knew. I rushed over, calling his name, shaking him gently. His skin felt cool to the touch. I... I started to panic. My heart was racing, and I couldn't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I fumbled for my phone, my hands shaking so badly I could barely dial 911. The operator's voice seemed so far away. I kept begging John to wake up, pleading with him. The paramedics arrived, but it felt like hours. They tried to resuscitate him, but... but it was too late. He was gone. My John was gone.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How did your body feel in that moment?",
    "Client: I felt numb, like I was watching everything happen from outside my body. My legs gave out, and I sank to the floor. I couldn't stop shaking. It was like all the warmth had been sucked out of the world. I kept thinking, \"This can't be real. This can't be happening.\"",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: The paramedics were kind, but their words didn't make sense. They said something about a heart attack, but all I could focus on was John's face. He looked so peaceful, like he was just sleeping. I wanted to wake him up, to tell him how much I loved him, but I couldn't. I felt so helpless, so alone.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. What happened next?",
    "Client: Our daughter arrived. I don't remember calling her, but she was suddenly there, holding me. We cried together as they took John away. The house felt so empty, so quiet. I kept expecting to hear his voice, to see him walk through the door. But he never did. That night, I couldn't sleep. I just lay in our bed, clutching his pillow, trying to remember his scent.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. My chest feels tight, and there's this lump in my throat. But talking about it... it hurts, but it also feels like I'm honoring John's memory. I miss him so much. Sometimes, I still reach for him in the middle of the night.",
    "Therapist: That's natural. You're doing great processing these emotions.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's been over a year now, but some days it feels like it just happened. I keep thinking about all the things we didn't get to do, all the plans we had. We were supposed to travel, to spend our retirement together. Now, I'm left trying to figure out how to live without him.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to grieve. You're showing incredible strength.",
    "Client: I try to stay busy, to keep his memory alive. I volunteer at the veteran's center where he used to go. It helps, being around people who knew him, who understand what it's like to lose someone. But sometimes, when I'm alone, the grief just overwhelms me. I wonder if it will ever get easier.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I hope so. I know John wouldn't want me to be sad all the time. He always said I was the strong one, but I never felt strong without him. Now, I'm trying to find that strength he always saw in me. It's hard, but I'm trying to live in a way that would make him proud.",
    "Therapist: You're honoring his memory beautifully. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Drained, but... lighter, somehow. Talking about it, reliving those moments... it's painful, but it also reminds me of how much love we shared. I'm grateful for the life we had together, even if it ended too soon. I just wish... I wish I could have said goodbye.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. You've done very well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It means a lot to have someone listen, to really understand. Sometimes I feel like I'm burdening my family when I talk about John, but here... here I can let it all out. It's exhausting, but it's also... freeing, in a way.",
    "Therapist: That's the goal. You've made significant progress today.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I know there's still a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe... maybe I can get through this. John always believed in me, and I want to believe in myself too. It's what he would have wanted.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. We'll end here for today."
