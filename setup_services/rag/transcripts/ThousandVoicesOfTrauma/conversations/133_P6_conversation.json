    "Therapist: Welcome, Amira. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I understand why we're doing this.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your current SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10. My hands are a little clammy.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Please close your eyes and describe the accident scene.",
    "Client: I'm driving home from work. It's late, around 10 PM. The streets are quiet, and I'm tired after a long day. Suddenly, I see flashing lights in my rearview mirror. A police car is signaling me to pull over. I'm confused because I know I wasn't speeding or doing anything wrong.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My heart is starting to race a bit. I can feel my palms getting sweatier on the steering wheel. I'm... I'm starting to feel that same anxiety I felt that night.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. I can feel my chest tightening.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue with what happened next.",
    "Client: I pull over to the side of the road. The officer approaches my car, and I roll down the window. He's... he's aggressive from the start. He demands my license and registration, but his tone is so harsh. I fumble with my purse, trying to find my wallet. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. I can feel my throat closing up, just like it did that night.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: The officer... he starts yelling at me. He accuses me of being drunk, but I hadn't had anything to drink. I try to explain, but he won't listen. He orders me out of the car. I'm terrified. I can't stop shaking. As I step out, I stumble slightly, and he roughly grabs my arm.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel helpless. My heart is pounding so hard. I can barely breathe. It's like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I don't know if I can continue.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. The officer pushes me against the car. He's so rough, and I can feel the cold metal against my cheek. I'm crying now, begging him to listen. But he just keeps yelling, telling me to shut up. I hear him calling for backup, saying he's got a \"resisting suspect.\"",
    "Therapist: How are your emotions now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm angry. So angry. And scared. My whole body is tense. I can feel tears on my face, just like that night.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's still a 9. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: More police cars arrive. They're all shouting. One officer twists my arm behind my back, and I cry out in pain. They force me to the ground. The gravel is digging into my skin. I can't breathe. I keep trying to tell them I haven't done anything wrong, but no one is listening.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel so small. So powerless. My chest hurts from crying. I can taste the dirt in my mouth from when they pushed me down.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down a bit. Maybe an 8 now. I'm starting to remember that I survived this. That I'm here now, telling you about it.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You're safe now. What happened next?",
    "Client: They handcuff me and put me in the back of a police car. I'm sobbing, begging them to call my husband. One officer finally listens and agrees to do a breathalyzer test. Of course, it comes back negative. They... they finally realize their mistake.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm starting to feel relief. But also this overwhelming sense of injustice. My arms hurt from where they grabbed me. I feel so... violated.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6 now. I'm starting to come back to the present.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. Let's start winding down.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I didn't think I could get through that. But I did.",
    "Therapist: Yes, you did. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted. But also... I don't know, maybe a little proud? My heart rate is slowing down. I feel drained, but... okay.",
    "Therapist: Final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's back down to a 4. I'm okay. I'm here, in your office. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Well done, Amira. Let's take some deep breaths together."
