    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Maria?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a mix of emotions, really. My heart is still racing a bit, and I feel kind of drained. But there's also this weird sense of relief, you know? Like I've finally let something out that I've been holding in for so long.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sounds. I could hear the shouting so clearly, the crash of things breaking. It was like I was right back there in that moment. I could even smell the coffee that had spilled on the carpet. It's strange how vivid those details are, even after all this time.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory?",
    "Client: It was... intense. At first, I felt that familiar panic rising in my chest. I wanted to run away, to stop the memory. But as I kept going, describing what happened, it was like... I don't know, like I was watching it from a distance. I could see myself there, but I wasn't trapped in it anymore. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it does. What do you make of that change?",
    "Client: I think... maybe it's a sign that I'm starting to process what happened? Like, before, whenever I thought about that day, it felt like I was reliving it. But now, it's more like... a memory. A painful one, sure, but just a memory. Not something that's happening to me right now.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. How does this relate to your recovery goals?",
    "Client: Well, one of my main goals was to stop feeling so controlled by these memories. To be able to think about what happened without falling apart. And I think... I think I'm starting to get there. It's still hard, but I feel like I have more control now.",
    "Therapist: I see. What else have you noticed?",
    "Client: I've been thinking about how this relates to my current relationship. You know, I've always been so scared of conflict with my husband. Even small disagreements would send me into a panic. But going through this process, I'm realizing that not every argument leads to violence. It's helping me separate the past from the present.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant connection. How might this impact your daily life?",
    "Client: I think... I might be able to communicate more openly with my husband now. Maybe I won't freeze up every time we have a disagreement. And that could really improve our relationship, you know? It's exhausting always being on edge, always waiting for the other shoe to drop.",
    "Therapist: Mm. What's been most challenging about this process?",
    "Client: Honestly? Showing up. Every week, I think about cancelling. It's so tempting to just avoid all of this. But I keep reminding myself why I'm doing this. For myself, for my marriage, for my future. It's hard, but... I think it's worth it.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your honesty. How can we support your continued engagement?",
    "Client: I think... maybe we could spend a little time at the end of each session talking about the progress I've made? Sometimes I get so focused on how far I have to go that I forget how far I've come. And that might help me stay motivated for the next session.",
    "Therapist: That's a great idea. Anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: Actually, yes. I've been having these moments lately where I feel... almost normal. Like, I'll be grocery shopping or watching TV, and I'll realize that I haven't thought about the trauma in hours. It's such a strange feeling, but in a good way. Is that... is that progress?",
    "Therapist: What do you think?",
    "Client: I think it is. It feels like I'm reclaiming parts of my life that I thought were lost forever. Like I'm finally starting to heal. It's scary, in a way, because it's so unfamiliar. But it's also... hopeful. For the first time in a long time, I feel hopeful about my future.",
    "Therapist: That's powerful, Maria. How does it feel to recognize that?",
    "Client: It feels... amazing. And terrifying. And exciting. All at once. Like I'm standing on the edge of something new, and I'm not sure what's on the other side, but I'm ready to find out. I never thought I'd get to this point, you know? There were times when I thought I'd be trapped in that trauma forever. But now... now I can see a way forward.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. What's your main takeaway today?",
    "Client: I think... I'm stronger than I realized. And that healing is possible, even when it feels impossible. It's not easy, and it's not quick, but it's happening. And that's... that's everything."
