    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Johnson. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a knot in my stomach. I know we're going to talk about my brother's imprisonment, and it's bringing up a lot of mixed emotions.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 60. It's not overwhelming, but definitely uncomfortable.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm standing in the courtroom. The wood paneling feels oppressive, like it's closing in on me. My brother, Tom, he's sitting at the defendant's table. His shoulders are slumped, and he looks... God, he looks so defeated already.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The judge is speaking, but it's like I'm underwater. I can't make out the words clearly. My heart is racing. I keep looking at Tom, willing him to look back at me, but he's just staring straight ahead.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My hands are clammy. I'm gripping the back of the bench so hard my knuckles are white. There's this pressure in my chest, like I can't get enough air.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: The judge... he's announcing the sentence. Twenty years. Twenty years! I feel like I've been punched in the gut. Tom finally looks at me, and his eyes... they're just... empty. It's like he's already gone.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I can't believe this is happening. We grew up together, shared everything. And now... now he's going to spend the next two decades behind bars. I feel so helpless, so angry at the system, at Tom for making such stupid choices. But mostly, I feel... I feel like I've lost him already.",
    "Therapist: Your emotions are intense. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's up to 80. This is harder than I thought it would be.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take another deep breath. What happens after the sentencing?",
    "Client: They're... they're taking him away. I try to push through the crowd to get to him, but the bailiff is already leading him out. I'm calling his name, but he doesn't turn around. My voice sounds strange, like it's not even mine. I feel like I'm watching this happen to someone else.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I stumble out of the courtroom. The hallway is so bright, it hurts my eyes. People are rushing past me, but I feel frozen. I lean against the wall, trying to catch my breath. My sister finds me there. She's crying, and I realize I haven't shed a single tear. I feel numb.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: Heavy. So heavy. Like gravity has suddenly increased. My legs are shaky, and there's this ringing in my ears. I slide down the wall until I'm sitting on the floor. I can't seem to move.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still around 80. Maybe even 85.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor. What happens next?",
    "Client: My sister... she's kneeling next to me, talking, but I can't focus on her words. All I can think about is Tom in handcuffs, being led away. Twenty years. He'll be an old man when he gets out. Our parents won't even be alive anymore. I... I start to cry then. It's like a dam breaking. I'm sobbing, right there in the courthouse hallway, and I don't care who sees.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those emotions. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Grief. Overwhelming grief. It's like Tom died, but it's worse because he's still alive, just... gone. And anger. I'm so angry at him for throwing his life away, for leaving us like this. And guilt. Could I have done something? Should I have seen this coming?",
    "Therapist: These are all normal reactions. How's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually down to about 75 now. Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also a relief somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Let's continue. What happens after you cry?",
    "Client: My sister helps me up. We... we walk out of the courthouse together. The sun is so bright, it feels wrong. Like the world should be dark to match how I feel. We get in her car, and I just sit there, staring at nothing. She asks if I want to go home, but I can't face that empty apartment. We end up driving to a park Tom and I used to play in as kids.",
    "Therapist: What do you do at the park?",
    "Client: We sit on a bench, not talking much. I'm watching kids play on the swings, thinking about how Tom and I used to do that. It hits me then, really hits me, that those days are gone forever. Even when he gets out, we can never go back. I feel this deep, aching loss in my chest.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, reliving this memory?",
    "Client: It's... it's still painful, but not as raw. My SUDS is probably around 70 now. It's like... I'm sad, but I can breathe through it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: We sit in the park for a long time. The sun starts to set, and I realize we've been there for hours. My sister suggests we get some food, but I'm not hungry. I just want to go home and be alone. She drives me back to my apartment, and I can see she's worried about leaving me.",
    "Therapist: What do you do when you get home?",
    "Client: I... I walk into my apartment, and it feels so empty. Tom used to come over all the time. We'd watch games together, argue about politics. Now... now it's just silence. I sit on the couch and stare at the blank TV screen. I should call our parents, but I can't bring myself to do it. I don't know how to tell them their son is going to prison for two decades.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: Lost. Completely lost. Like the ground has disappeared from under my feet. I keep thinking this must be a nightmare, that I'll wake up and everything will be normal again. But I know it's real, and that makes it so much worse.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually down to about 65. Talking through it... it's helping, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I finally force myself to call our parents. It's the hardest phone call I've ever made. Mom starts crying immediately, and Dad... he just goes quiet. I can hear the pain in his silence. I promise to come over tomorrow, to be with them. After I hang up, I just sit there, holding the phone, feeling... I don't know. Empty, I guess.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel at this point?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Like I've run a marathon. My eyes are sore from crying, and there's this dull ache in my chest. I feel drained, physically and emotionally.",
    "Therapist: You've been through a lot. How are you feeling now, after reliving this memory?",
    "Client: It's... it's not as overwhelming as I thought it would be. My SUDS is down to about 60 now. It still hurts, but... I feel like I can handle it better.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay. I'm... I'm here.",
    "Therapist: You did very well today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm surprised, actually. It was hard, but... I feel a bit lighter. Like I've released some of the weight I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. Would you like to share any final thoughts?",
    "Client: I... I think I understand now why we're doing this. It's painful, but it's also... freeing, in a way. I've been avoiding these memories for so long, and facing them... it's hard, but it feels like a step forward.",
    "Therapist: That's a great insight. We'll end here for today. Remember to practice self-care.",
    "Client: Thank you. I will. This... this helped more than I expected.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. We'll continue next session. Take care, Mr. Johnson."
