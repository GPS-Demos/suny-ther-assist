    "Therapist: Alright, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's begin when you're comfortable.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back there, in that room. It's dark, and I can smell the musty odor of old carpet. My heart is racing already. The man with the gun is pacing back and forth, muttering to himself. I'm huddled in the corner, trying to make myself as small as possible.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 6. It's intense, but I'm managing.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The man is getting more agitated. He's shouting at someone on the phone. I can feel my palms getting sweaty, and there's this tightness in my chest. I'm... I'm scared he might hurt me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: My mouth is dry. I can hear my own heartbeat in my ears. The room feels like it's closing in on me. God, this is harder than I thought it would be.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Maybe an 8 now. I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Remember, you're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: Right, safe... The man's hanging up the phone now. He's walking towards me. I can see the anger in his eyes. I'm frozen, I can't move. My whole body is trembling. I... I think I might be sick.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Overwhelmed. My heart's pounding so hard. I can feel sweat running down my back. It's like I'm right there again.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. This is really intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you survived this. You're here now, safe.",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, you're right. I did survive. The man, he's yelling at me now, but... but I know I make it out of this.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm trying to focus on my breathing, like we practiced. In and out. The man is still there, but I'm... I'm starting to feel a little calmer. The room isn't spinning as much now.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7 now. I can still feel the fear, but it's not as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. Continue.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm still in the room, but I'm starting to notice other things. There's a window, and I can see a sliver of sunlight. It reminds me that there's a world outside this room. I'm... I'm going to be okay.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Better, I think. My heart's still racing, but not as badly. The tightness in my chest is easing up a bit.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5 now. I can handle this. I know how it ends.",
    "Therapist: You're doing very well. Let's continue for a few more minutes.",
    "Client: Alright. The man is calming down now. He's sitting in a chair, still holding the gun, but he's not as agitated. I'm starting to think about how I might get out of this situation. I remember feeling a spark of hope.",
    "Therapist: That's good. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. My breathing is steadier. I can still feel some anxiety, but it's manageable.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's a 4 now. I think I'm ready to end the exercise.",

    "Therapist: You did excellently. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, but also... kind of proud? I didn't think I could face that memory so directly.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. This was a significant step. Let's take a moment to process what you experienced."
