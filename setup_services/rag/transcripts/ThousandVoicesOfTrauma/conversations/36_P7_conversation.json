    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure exercise. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the day of the animal attack?",
    "Client: Okay... It was a sunny afternoon. I was walking in the park near my house. I remember feeling relaxed, enjoying the warmth on my skin. Then I heard a growl...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: It was a large dog, maybe a Rottweiler. Its teeth were bared, and before I could react, it lunged at me. I felt its jaws clamp down on my arm. The pain was excruciating. I screamed, but no one was around. I... I can still feel the pressure of its bite.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) I tried to fight it off, but it was so strong. I could smell its breath, feel its fur against my skin. I thought I was going to die. My arm was bleeding heavily, and I felt dizzy. I... I don't know if I can keep going.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. It's okay to feel overwhelmed. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay... The dog finally let go when a man came running, yelling. I collapsed on the ground, shaking uncontrollably. Everything seemed hazy, like a nightmare. The pain was unbearable, and I could see the torn flesh on my arm. I felt so helpless, so vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: The ambulance arrived, but I was barely conscious. I remember the sirens, the voices of the paramedics, but it all felt distant. At the hospital, everything was a blur of bright lights and urgent voices. They had to perform emergency surgery to repair the damage. I woke up feeling groggy and in pain. The realization that I had nearly died hit me hard.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... shaky. My heart is racing, and I can almost feel the phantom pain in my arm. But I also feel a strange sense of relief, like I'm finally facing this memory head-on. It's scary, but I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're making progress.",
    "Client: The recovery was long and painful. Physical therapy was grueling, and I had nightmares for months. I couldn't go near dogs without panicking. Even now, years later, I still feel anxious in parks or around large dogs. But talking about it like this... it's different. It's like I'm reclaiming some control over the memory.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard, but I feel like I'm starting to process it differently. The fear is still there, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming as before. I'm realizing that I survived something terrible, and that makes me feel... I don't know, maybe a little stronger?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization.",
    "Client: It is. I've never really allowed myself to think about it this deeply before. Always pushed it away, you know? But facing it, describing it in detail... it's like I'm seeing it from a new perspective. I'm not just a victim anymore. I'm a survivor.",
    "Therapist: You've done exceptionally well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I feel drained, but also... lighter somehow. Like I've shed some of the weight I've been carrying. Is this normal? To feel both exhausted and relieved?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's a common response.",
    "Client: I see. Well, I think I'd like to stop here for today if that's okay. This has been intense, but I feel like I've made some progress. I'm curious to see how I'll feel about this memory moving forward.",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've done excellent work today."
