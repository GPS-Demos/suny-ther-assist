    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. The airplane crash scene was so vivid in my mind. I could almost feel the turbulence, hear the panic in people's voices. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What stood out most?",
    "Client: The helplessness. I felt completely powerless, just like when I was neglected as a child. It's like... no matter what I do, I can't change the outcome. I'm just along for the ride, you know?",
    "Therapist: How did that feeling affect you?",
    "Client: It made my chest tight. I wanted to curl up and disappear. But also... there was this anger. Like, why is this happening to me? Why can't I control anything in my life?",
    "Therapist: What do you make of that anger?",
    "Client: I guess... it's not just about the crash. It's about everything. My childhood, my struggles now. I'm angry that I've had to deal with so much. But I'm also angry at myself for not being stronger.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your daily life?",
    "Client: It's everywhere. I avoid responsibility because I'm scared of failing. I push people away because I'm afraid they'll leave anyway. It's like I'm always bracing for impact, you know?",
    "Therapist: What did you learn about yourself today?",
    "Client: That maybe... maybe I'm stronger than I think. I faced that memory. It was hard, but I did it. And I'm still here, talking about it. That's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How can you use this strength?",
    "Client: I could... try to take more risks. Maybe apply for that internship I've been avoiding. Or tell my parents how their neglect affected me. It's scary, but no scarier than reliving that crash.",
    "Therapist: That's insightful. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: Nervous, but... determined. I want to keep pushing. These sessions are hard, but I think they're helping. I want to feel in control of my life again.",
    "Therapist: What support do you need moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... just this. Having someone to talk to, who understands. And maybe some techniques for when the anxiety gets bad between sessions. Sometimes I feel like I'm right back in that crash.",
    "Therapist: We can definitely work on that. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this."
