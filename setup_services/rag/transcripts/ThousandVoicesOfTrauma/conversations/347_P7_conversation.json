    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Take a deep breath and describe the natural disaster you experienced.",
    "Client: Okay... It was about five years ago. I was visiting family in Bangladesh when a cyclone hit. The wind was howling, and the rain was relentless. I remember looking out the window and seeing trees bending sideways.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you saw and felt.",
    "Client: The power went out, and it became pitch black. We could hear things crashing outside. My heart was racing, and I felt so helpless. I kept thinking about the sexual abuse I experienced as a child, feeling that same sense of powerlessness.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The water started seeping in under the doors. My relatives were panicking, and I felt like I should be the strong one, but inside I was terrified. I wanted to drink so badly to numb the fear, but there was no alcohol.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. Keep going.",
    "Client: We huddled in the center of the house, away from windows. The sound of the wind was deafening. I could smell the damp, and it reminded me of... of the basement where the abuse happened. I felt nauseous and dizzy.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure I can continue. This is bringing up so many painful memories.",
    "Therapist: I understand it's difficult. You're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: Okay... The storm raged on for hours. We could hear things hitting the roof. I kept imagining the worst - that we'd be swept away or crushed. It felt like it would never end, just like when I was a child and the abuse seemed endless.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Keep going.",
    "Client: As dawn broke, the storm started to subside. We ventured outside and saw the devastation. Trees uprooted, homes destroyed, debris everywhere. The air was thick with dust and the smell of seawater. I felt a mix of relief and guilt for surviving when others might not have.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those feelings. You're processing this well.",
    "Client: In the days that followed, I helped with the cleanup. But at night, I couldn't sleep. The sounds of the storm kept replaying in my head, mixed with memories of my childhood trauma. I started drinking heavily to cope, even though I knew it was wrong.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel drained, but also... lighter somehow. Like I've finally let some of this out after holding it in for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. You've done excellent work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to talk about, but I think it's helping. I just wish I could shake this connection between the cyclone and my childhood experiences.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel truly safe again. The world just seems so unpredictable and dangerous.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. We'll focus on building your sense of safety.",
    "Client: I hope so. It's exhausting always being on edge, waiting for the next disaster or trauma to hit. And then turning to substances to numb it all...",
    "Therapist: Your awareness is a big step. We'll address your coping mechanisms too.",
    "Client: I know I need to find healthier ways to deal with stress and memories. It's just... it's been my go-to for so long. Especially living alone, it's easy to fall into those habits.",
    "Therapist: Change takes time. You're making progress by recognizing this.",
    "Client: You're right. I'm trying to be more open with my housemates about what I'm going through. It's not easy, but it helps to not feel so isolated.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. How else has this experience affected your daily life?",
    "Client: Well, I've become hyper-vigilant about weather reports. Any hint of a storm sends me into a panic. And certain smells \u2013 like damp earth or seawater \u2013 can trigger flashbacks. It's affecting my work too. I find it hard to concentrate sometimes.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. We'll work on managing these triggers.",
    "Client: I hope so. I feel like I'm constantly on edge, waiting for the next disaster. It's exhausting, and it makes me want to isolate myself even more.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are understandable. We'll develop coping strategies together.",
    "Client: That would be helpful. I'm tired of feeling this way, of letting my past control my present. I want to be able to enjoy life again without this constant fear and need to numb myself.",

    "Client: Thank you. It means a lot to have someone listen and understand. I've kept this bottled up for so long, afraid of being judged or seen as weak.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage. Is there anything else you'd like to share?",
    "Client: I think that's enough for today. I feel drained, but also somewhat relieved. It's like I've finally started to unpack this heavy burden I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. We'll end here and continue next session."
