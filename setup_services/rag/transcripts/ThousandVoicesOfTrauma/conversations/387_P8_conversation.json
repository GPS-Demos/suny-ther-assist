    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also frozen at the same time. The memory of the earthquake, it just... it brought everything back so vividly. I could almost feel the ground shaking beneath me again.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What physical sensations are you noticing right now?",
    "Client: My heart is still pounding. I can feel this tightness in my chest, like I can't get enough air. My hands are clammy, and there's this... this trembling in my legs. It's like my body is still bracing for impact, you know?",
    "Therapist: I see. And what thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. How I couldn't do anything to stop it. And then... then I start thinking about the abuse. It's like the two traumas are intertwined now. I feel so... vulnerable. Like at any moment, everything could fall apart again.",
    "Therapist: That sounds overwhelming. How are you coping with those feelings?",
    "Client: I'm trying to remind myself that I'm safe now. That it's over. But it's hard. There's this voice in my head telling me I should have done more, should have been stronger. I know it's not rational, but I can't shake this feeling of guilt.",
    "Therapist: What do you think that guilt is about?",
    "Client: I... I guess it's about surviving. Both the earthquake and the abuse. Why me? Why did I make it through when others didn't? And with the abuse, I keep wondering if I could have stopped it somehow. If I had just spoken up earlier or... I don't know. It doesn't make sense, but the feeling is there.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt affect you now?",
    "Client: It's like a weight I carry everywhere. Sometimes it makes me hesitant to enjoy life or pursue my goals. Like I don't deserve good things. And in moments like this, when the memories are so fresh, it makes me feel small and powerless all over again.",
    "Therapist: I hear you. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: There's anger too. At the abuser, of course, but also at the world in general. Why do these terrible things happen? And then I feel guilty for being angry, like I don't have the right. It's this cycle that just keeps going round and round in my head.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to express that anger here?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a relief. I've spent so long trying to keep it all bottled up, to be the \"good survivor\" who's got it all together. But letting it out, it's like... it's like I can breathe a little easier. Even though it hurts, it feels more honest.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to feel grounded. To remember that I'm here, now, and that I'm safe. And maybe... maybe I need to hear that it's okay to have all these conflicting feelings. That it doesn't make me weak or ungrateful.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are all valid. What else?",
    "Client: I need to believe that I can move forward. That these experiences don't define me. Sometimes it feels like my whole life is shaped by trauma, and I... I want to reclaim some control. To feel like I have a say in my own story.",
    "Therapist: How might you start to do that?",
    "Client: I think... maybe by acknowledging my strength. Not just in surviving, but in being here, doing this work. It's not easy, facing these memories. But I'm doing it. And maybe that's the first step in writing my own story.",
    "Therapist: That's insightful. What else comes to mind?",
    "Client: I'm realizing that I've been holding onto this idea that I need to be \"fixed\" or to go back to who I was before. But maybe... maybe it's about integrating these experiences into who I am now. Finding a way to carry them that doesn't weigh me down so much.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea sit with you?",
    "Client: It's both scary and liberating. Scary because it means accepting that I've been changed by what happened. But liberating because it feels more... achievable, I guess? Like I don't have to erase the past, just learn to live with it in a different way.",
    "Therapist: What might that look like for you?",
    "Client: I think it might mean being more open about my experiences. Not hiding them away like something shameful. Maybe even using them to connect with others who've been through similar things. And... and giving myself permission to have good days without feeling guilty.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful vision. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, honestly. But there's also this sense of... I don't know, possibility? Like I've opened a door that I've been afraid to look behind for a long time. It's overwhelming, but not in the same suffocating way as before. More like... like I'm standing at the edge of something new.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think that would be good. This has been intense, but... but I'm glad we did it. I feel like I understand myself a little better now. It's a lot to process, but I'm grateful for the opportunity to do this work.",
    "Therapist: You've done well today. How will you care for yourself?",
    "Client: I think I'll take a long walk when I get home. Feel the ground beneath my feet, remind myself that it's solid. Maybe call my partner and share a bit of what we talked about. And definitely some deep breaths. Lots of deep breaths.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a good plan. We'll continue next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I appreciate your guidance through this. It means a lot to have someone listen without judgment. I'll see you next week."
