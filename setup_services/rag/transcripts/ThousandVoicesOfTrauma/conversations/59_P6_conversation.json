    "Therapist: Alright, Raj. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the memory.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm at the protest. It's loud, people are chanting. I can smell sweat and... something like tear gas in the air. My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: Um, about a 6 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue.",
    "Client: The police are forming a line. They're in riot gear, faceless. I'm scared, but I stand my ground. Someone next to me shouts something. Suddenly, there's chaos. People are running, screaming. I feel a hand grab my arm roughly.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. My palms are sweating, and I feel dizzy.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The officer is shouting at me, but I can't understand. His grip tightens, and I'm thrown to the ground. The pavement is cold and rough. I... I can't breathe. It reminds me of... of when I was...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What's happening?",
    "Client: I'm panicking. It's like I'm a child again, helpless. The weight on my back, I can't move. I feel so ashamed, so weak.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. Maybe higher. I feel like I'm going to be sick.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: I'm trying. The officer is cuffing me, but in my mind, it's mixed with memories of the abuse. I feel violated, angry, and terrified all at once. My whole body is shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. SUDS?",
    "Client: Still a 9. It's not getting better.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. It will. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm being lifted up. The world is spinning. I hear sirens, shouting. Someone is reading me my rights, but it sounds far away. I feel so alone, so misunderstood. Why is this happening to me?",
    "Therapist: SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe an 8? I feel exhausted.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. How does your body feel?",
    "Client: My muscles are tense. I have a headache. But the nausea is less.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's continue for a few more minutes.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm in the police van now. It's dark and cold. I can hear others crying. I'm angry at the police, at the world. But mostly, I feel powerless, just like when I was abused. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: Back to a 9. The feelings are so intense.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Stay with it.",
    "Client: I'm trying. My mind keeps flashing between the protest and my childhood. The fear, the shame, it's all mixed together. I feel like I can't trust anyone, like the world is against me.",
    "Therapist: Last SUDS check. Where are you now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 again. I feel drained, but the panic is subsiding a bit.",
    "Therapist: Excellent work, Raj. Let's start winding down.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm... I'm here. In your office. I can feel the chair beneath me. My breathing is slowing down.",
    "Therapist: Good. Open your eyes when you're ready.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay, I'm back. That was... intense.",
    "Therapist: You did very well. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Tired. Shaky. But... also a bit relieved? It's hard to explain.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves before we discuss further."
