    "Therapist: Hello Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Thompson. I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been thinking about it all week, and I'm not sure I'm ready for this.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... the idea of reliving that time when I was so sick, it's terrifying. I remember feeling so helpless and alone in the hospital. The doctors weren't sure what was wrong with me at first, and I thought I was going to die. I don't know if I can handle going back to that place mentally.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How about we discuss the process?",
    "Client: Okay, that might help. I just... I've been trying so hard to forget all of that. The thought of purposely remembering it makes me feel sick to my stomach. But I know you said this is important for my treatment. Can you explain again why we need to do this?",
    "Therapist: It's to process the trauma and reduce its power over you.",
    "Client: I see. But won't reliving it just make it worse? I mean, I've been having nightmares about it already. And with everything else going on in my life - the stress at work, my drinking... I'm worried this might push me over the edge.",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. You're in control throughout.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I appreciate that you're not pushing me to do more than I can handle. It's just... this illness, it changed everything for me. Before, I felt invincible, you know? And then suddenly, I was facing my own mortality. It's hard to come back from that. How exactly will this help me move forward?",
    "Therapist: It helps by integrating the experience into your life story.",
    "Client: Integrating it into my life story... that's an interesting way to look at it. I guess I have been trying to pretend it never happened, which clearly isn't working. But the thought of facing it head-on is scary. What should I expect during the actual exercise?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the experience in detail. I'll guide you through it.",
    "Client: Okay. And you'll be there the whole time? I'm worried I might... I don't know, break down or something.",
    "Therapist: Yes, I'll be here supporting you throughout.",
    "Client: That's good to know. I trust you, Dr. Thompson. It's just... this is a big step. I've been avoiding thinking about this for so long. But I want to get better. I want to be able to go to doctor's appointments without having panic attacks. I want to stop self-medicating with alcohol. Do you really think this will help?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it's a proven method for addressing PTSD symptoms.",
    "Client: Alright. I think I'm ready to try. Or as ready as I'll ever be. Can we start slowly? And if it gets too overwhelming, can we take a break?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll go at your pace. You're very brave, Sarah.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot. I'm scared, but I'm also... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful? Like maybe after this, things might start to get better. I'm tired of feeling stuck. So, what do we do first?",
    "Therapist: Let's start with a relaxation exercise. Ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I'm ready. Let's do this."
