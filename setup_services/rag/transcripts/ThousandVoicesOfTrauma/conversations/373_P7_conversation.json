    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and take a deep breath.",
    "Client: Okay, I'm closing my eyes. I feel a bit nervous about this.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I'm trying to picture that day of the earthquake. It was just after lunch, and I was at my desk in the office. Everything seemed normal until...",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue.",
    "Client: Suddenly, the ground started shaking. At first, it was gentle, and I thought maybe it was just a truck passing by. But then it got stronger. The windows were rattling, and I could hear people starting to shout.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with that memory.",
    "Client: I... I remember feeling frozen for a moment. My heart was racing, and I couldn't think clearly. Then someone yelled, \"Get under your desks!\" That snapped me out of it, and I dove under my desk.",
    "Therapist: That's it. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: The shaking got more intense. I could hear things falling off shelves and crashing to the floor. The lights went out, and someone screamed. I... I remember feeling so helpless and scared.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I kept thinking about my family, wondering if they were okay. The shaking seemed to last forever, but I think it was only about a minute. When it finally stopped, everyone was silent for a moment. Then there was chaos as people tried to evacuate.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job describing this. Keep going.",
    "Client: As we were leaving, I saw cracks in the walls and broken glass everywhere. Outside, car alarms were going off, and people were crying and hugging each other. I tried to call my family, but the cell networks were jammed.",
    "Therapist: That must have been frightening. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard to talk about. My hands are shaking a bit, and I feel a tightness in my chest. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little proud that I can talk about it?",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You're very brave.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's strange, but talking about it makes it feel less overwhelming. I remember walking home that day because the trains had stopped. The city looked so different - buildings damaged, roads cracked. It was like being in a movie, but it was real.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an incredible job. Continue.",
    "Client: I finally got home and found my apartment a mess, but intact. I was lucky. Some of my neighbors had serious damage. That night was the worst - there were aftershocks, and every time the building shook, I thought it was happening all over again.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. You're safe now.",
    "Client: For weeks after, I jumped at every little sound or vibration. I had trouble sleeping and concentrating at work. I felt... I felt like I couldn't trust the ground beneath my feet anymore. Like at any moment, everything could just... fall apart.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great strength in sharing this.",
    "Client: It's been years now, but sometimes I still get anxious when I'm in tall buildings or when I hear a loud noise. But talking about it like this... it helps me realize that I survived it. I got through it.",
    "Therapist: You did. You're resilient.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think... I think I'm ready to open my eyes now. That was intense, but I feel a bit lighter somehow.",
    "Therapist: You've done exceptionally well today. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm feeling drained, but also... relieved? Like I've let go of something I've been holding onto for a long time. It's a strange mix of exhaustion and calm.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. You should be proud.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about it in such detail without completely falling apart. It's still hard, but it feels... manageable now.",
    "Therapist: You've made significant progress. We'll end here for today."
