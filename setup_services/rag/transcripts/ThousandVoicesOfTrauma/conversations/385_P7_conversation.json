    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Are you ready to revisit the memory we discussed?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm back in my old apartment. It's late at night, and I hear shouting from the neighboring unit. My heart starts racing as I recognize the voices of my neighbors, John and Sarah. The yelling gets louder, and I hear a loud crash. I'm frozen, unsure of what to do.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I creep towards the wall separating our apartments, trying to make out what's happening. Suddenly, I hear Sarah scream, \"Stop! Please!\" There's another crash, and the sound of glass breaking. I'm shaking now, my hand over my mouth to stifle my own cries.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can continue. It's too much.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're handling this bravely.",
    "Client: Okay... I... I decide I need to do something. With trembling hands, I reach for my phone to call the police. As I'm dialing, I hear more thuds and Sarah's muffled sobs. I'm whispering to the dispatcher, terrified that John might hear me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The wait for the police feels endless. I can hear Sarah pleading, and John's angry voice. There's more crashing, and I'm convinced he's going to kill her. I feel so helpless, so scared. I want to go help her, but I'm paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: Finally, I hear sirens in the distance. There's a moment of silence from next door, then hurried movements. The police arrive, and I hear them pounding on John and Sarah's door. I'm still shaking, tears streaming down my face, as I listen to the commotion.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this so well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The police take John away. I see Sarah as they lead her out to an ambulance. Her face is bruised, and she's holding her arm. Our eyes meet for a moment, and I see such pain and shame in her expression. I feel guilty for not doing more, for not helping her sooner. That image of her face... it haunts me still.",
    "Therapist: You've done an excellent job. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. My heart is still racing, and I feel a bit nauseous. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've shared some of the weight I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. You've shown great courage.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was hard, but I think it helped to talk through it all. I've never described it in such detail before.",
    "Therapist: You've made significant progress today. How about we end here?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. I need some time to process all of this.",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll discuss this further in our next session."
