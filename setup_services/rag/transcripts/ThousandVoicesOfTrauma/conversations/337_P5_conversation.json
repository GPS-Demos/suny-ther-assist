    "Therapist: Mrs. Johnson, today we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: Oh, dear. I'm not quite sure what to expect. It sounds a bit daunting, to be honest. My anxiety is already creeping up just thinking about it. Can you tell me more about what we'll be doing?",
    "Therapist: Of course. It's a way to process your trauma memories safely. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about reliving those awful experiences from when I had to flee my home. It was such a chaotic and frightening time. I've tried so hard to put it behind me. Won't talking about it make things worse?",
    "Therapist: I understand your concern. This process actually helps reduce symptoms over time. How does that sound?",
    "Client: I suppose that makes sense, but it's still scary. I've been having nightmares about those days lately. Will this make them more frequent?",
    "Therapist: Nightmares might increase initially, but they usually decrease with treatment. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: Okay, that's somewhat reassuring. I trust you, but I'm still nervous. What exactly will we be doing? Do I need to close my eyes and picture everything?",
    "Therapist: You'll describe the memory aloud while I guide you. Eyes open or closed is your choice.",
    "Client: I see. I think I'd prefer to keep my eyes open if that's alright. It might help me feel more grounded in the present. How long will this take? And what if I become overwhelmed?",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. You can pause anytime. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's a relief. I appreciate your patience with all my questions. I suppose I'm ready to give it a try. But I have to admit, my heart is racing a bit just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Remember, this helps heal trauma. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Thank you for saying that. It means a lot to hear you acknowledge how difficult this is. Yes, I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Where should I start? Should I begin with the day we had to leave our home, or is there a specific point you want me to focus on?",
    "Therapist: Start with the most vivid memory. Take a deep breath, and when you're ready, describe it.",
    "Client: Alright. I'm taking a deep breath. The most vivid memory... it's the sound of the sirens. They were so loud, piercing through everything. I remember the panic rising in my chest as I realized we had to leave immediately. My husband was frantically packing a bag, and I was just frozen, staring out the window at our neighbors running down the street. It felt surreal, like a nightmare I couldn't wake up from.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: I... I can feel my hands shaking, just like they did that day. The air felt thick, hard to breathe. I remember grabbing our family photo album, clutching it to my chest. It was all I could think to take, besides some clothes. The streets were chaos - people shouting, cars honking. I kept looking back at our house, wondering if I'd ever see it again. It's... it's overwhelming to think about.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Take a moment if you need. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. It's strange, but talking about it feels both terrifying and somewhat relieving. Like I'm finally acknowledging what happened instead of pushing it away. My heart is still racing, but I think I can continue. Should I go on?",
    "Therapist: Yes, if you're comfortable. Remember, you're safe here now.",
    "Client: Thank you for reminding me. It helps to hear that. As we were leaving, I remember the weight of uncertainty. Where would we go? How long would we be gone? The fear of the unknown was almost paralyzing. But we had to keep moving. I recall the sound of my own ragged breathing as we walked, joining a stream of other refugees. It felt like we were part of a terrible, surreal parade.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's pause here. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm actually feeling a bit lighter. It's like I've been carrying this heavy secret, and now I'm finally sharing it. It's still painful, but somehow less overwhelming than I expected. Is this normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it's a common experience. You did wonderfully. How about we end here for today?",
    "Client: Thank you, I think that would be good. I'm surprised at how draining this is, but also how... I don't know, maybe cathartic? I'm grateful for your guidance through this. When will we do this again?",
    "Therapist: We'll continue next session. For now, practice self-care. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a mix of emotions - exhausted but also a bit proud of myself for facing this. I'll try to take it easy for the rest of the day. Thank you for your support. I'm nervous about our next session, but I think I'm starting to see how this could help in the long run.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. Rest well, and we'll continue next time."
