    "Therapist: Welcome back, John. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... a bit on edge, to be honest. Talking about my time as a refugee always brings up a lot of mixed emotions. Part of me wants to just get it over with, but another part is dreading it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Yeah, I think so. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that moment. Where are you?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm on the boat. It's cramped and dark. The smell of sweat and fear is overwhelming. I can hear the waves slapping against the side of the boat, and there's a constant hum of the engine. My wife is next to me, holding our son. He's so small, only two years old. I can feel her trembling.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's happening now?",
    "Client: The boat is rocking more violently. People are starting to panic. I hear shouting from the front of the boat. Something about a storm. My heart is racing. I... I can't breathe properly. The air feels thick.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Remember, you're safe here. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 7.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're doing well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (inhales shakily) The storm hits us hard. Waves are crashing over the sides of the boat. People are screaming, praying. I'm holding onto my family so tightly. I'm terrified we'll be separated. The boat is pitching wildly. I can hear things breaking, people falling. Oh God, I think we're going to capsize.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. My chest feels like it's going to explode. I can taste salt water. It's so cold. I keep thinking, \"This is it. We're going to die here.\" But I can't let my family see how scared I am. I have to be strong for them.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. What happens next?",
    "Client: Somehow, we make it through the night. As dawn breaks, I can see the damage. The boat is barely holding together. There are people injured, some... some didn't make it. The guilt is overwhelming. Why did we survive when others didn't?",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault, John. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My SUDS is probably around an 8. It's... it's hard to relive this.",
    "Therapist: I understand. You're doing really well. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: (takes a few deep breaths) Okay. We're still adrift. The engine's dead. People are getting desperate. There's not enough food or water. My son is crying constantly, and I feel so helpless. I keep scanning the horizon, praying for a ship or land. Anything.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm questioning everything. Did we make the right choice? Was it worth risking our lives like this? But then I remember why we left. The violence, the oppression. We had no choice. Still, the uncertainty is killing me.",
    "Therapist: That's a heavy burden. How does your body feel?",
    "Client: Tense. So tense. My jaw is clenched, my fists are balled up. My back aches from sitting in the same position for so long. And I'm so thirsty. My lips are cracked and bleeding.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What happens next?",
    "Client: On the third day, someone spots a ship. There's a moment of pure joy, then fear. What if they turn us away? As they approach, I can see it's a naval vessel. I'm holding my breath, praying they'll help us.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix. Relief, hope, but also dread. My SUDS is maybe a 6 now. The uncertainty is still there, but at least we're not alone anymore.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. Keep going.",
    "Client: They start bringing people aboard. There's chaos, people pushing, desperate to be saved. I'm trying to keep my family together. As we're pulled onto the ship, I feel this rush of emotions. We're safe, but... what now? Where will they take us? Will they separate us?",
    "Therapist: Stay in that moment. What do you notice?",
    "Client: The contrast is stark. The ship is so clean, so orderly compared to our boat. I feel... out of place. Dirty. The crew is efficient but distant. They're speaking a language I don't understand. I'm clutching my son, afraid they'll take him away.",
    "Therapist: How does that fear manifest in your body?",
    "Client: My arms are tight around him. My muscles are aching from the tension. I can feel my heart pounding in my throat. I'm sweating, even though it's cool on the ship.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens as you settle on the ship?",
    "Client: They take us to a large room. There are cots, blankets. It feels surreal after days on the boat. They give us water, food. I'm so grateful, but also wary. I keep thinking, \"What's the catch?\" I can't relax. I'm watching everyone, trying to figure out what's going to happen next.",
    "Therapist: That hypervigilance is understandable. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's complicated. Relief, gratitude, but also fear and uncertainty. My SUDS is around a 5 now. The immediate danger is past, but the future is still so unclear.",
    "Therapist: You've been through so much. How do you see yourself in this moment?",
    "Client: I see... I see someone who's both strong and vulnerable. I got my family through this ordeal, but I also feel so powerless. We're at the mercy of others now. I'm a professional, I had a good life, and now... now I'm a refugee. It's hard to reconcile.",
    "Therapist: That's a profound shift. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm thinking about home, about everything we left behind. I'm wondering if we'll ever feel safe again, if we'll find a new home. I'm worried about my son's future. Will he remember this? How will it affect him?",
    "Therapist: Those are heavy thoughts. How does your body feel now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Every muscle aches. My eyes are burning from lack of sleep and salt water. But there's also this nervous energy. I can't relax, can't let my guard down.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (inhales deeply) Okay. I'm... I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a bit lighter? Talking about it is hard, but it also feels like I'm starting to process it more.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, John. Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 3 now. Still there, but manageable.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. You've done really well today. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you. This... this helps, even though it's tough.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, John. Your resilience is remarkable. We'll continue to work through this together."
