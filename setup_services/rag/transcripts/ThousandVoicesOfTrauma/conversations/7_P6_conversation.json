    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important. Let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day. Describe what you see and feel.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in my car, driving home from work. It's late, maybe around 9 PM. The streets are quiet, and it's dark outside. I can see the streetlights reflecting off the wet pavement. It had been raining earlier.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 3. I'm a little tense, but okay so far.",
    "Therapist: Understood. Continue, please.",
    "Client: As I'm driving, I notice a car behind me. It's been following me for a while, and I'm starting to feel uneasy. I try to shake it off, thinking I'm just being paranoid. But then the car speeds up and cuts me off, forcing me to brake hard. My heart starts racing, and I'm gripping the steering wheel so tight my knuckles are turning white.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 5. I can feel my palms getting sweaty as I remember this.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The car that cut me off stops abruptly, blocking the road. Two men jump out and start running towards my car. I'm frozen in fear, my mind racing with thoughts of what might happen. I fumble for my phone, but it slips from my shaking hands. I can hear my own rapid breathing, and my vision starts to blur at the edges.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. I feel like I can't breathe properly. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Sarah. You're safe here. This is just a memory.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) Okay... The men are at my car now. One of them is trying to open my door, while the other is yelling something I can't understand. I'm pressing the lock button over and over, terrified they'll get in. I can smell their cigarette breath through the small crack in my window. My whole body is trembling, and I feel like I might throw up.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's a 9 now. I feel so helpless and scared, just like I did then.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Remember, you survived this. Keep going.",
    "Client: Suddenly, I hear sirens in the distance. The men look at each other, panicked. They start running back to their car. I'm still frozen, unable to move or think clearly. As they speed away, I realize I've been holding my breath. I gasp for air, feeling dizzy and nauseous.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 7. I feel shaky, but relieved that part is over.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this well. What happened next?",
    "Client: The police arrive, and I'm struggling to explain what happened through my tears. An officer asks if I need medical attention, but I just want to go home. I feel so vulnerable and exposed sitting there on the side of the road. When I finally get home, I collapse on my bed, still in my work clothes, and cry for hours.",
    "Therapist: And your current SUDS?",
    "Client: It's a 6 now. I feel drained, but also a bit proud that I got through telling it.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You've shown incredible strength. How are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: My shoulders are tense, and I have a bit of a headache. But I feel like I can breathe easier now.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Look around the room and name five things you see.",
    "Client: Okay... I see the blue painting on the wall, your desk lamp, the plant in the corner, my water bottle, and the clock on your shelf.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 4. I feel more present in the room with you.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today, Sarah. How do you feel about the exercise?",
    "Client: It was intense, but... I feel like I faced something I've been avoiding. It's empowering in a way.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. We'll end here for today. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later."
