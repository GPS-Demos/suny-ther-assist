    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. It's like I was right back there, you know? I can still feel the tightness in my chest, and my hands are a bit clammy. It's strange how vivid it all becomes when I close my eyes and really let myself go there.",
    "Therapist: What's the most prominent emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I think. No, wait... it's more like a mix of fear and anger. I'm angry that I let myself be treated that way for so long, but I'm also scared of being alone now that the relationship is over. It's confusing, really.",
    "Therapist: Can you tell me more about that confusion?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... I know logically that leaving was the right thing to do. The physical abuse was destroying me. But there's this part of me that still misses her, you know? We had good times too, and I keep second-guessing my decision. Then I feel guilty for even considering going back. It's a constant battle in my head.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you noticing as you talk about this?",
    "Client: My stomach feels like it's in knots. There's this heaviness in my chest, and I notice I'm clenching my jaw. It's like my body is reliving the stress of those moments. I can feel my heart racing a bit too, especially when I think about the times she would get angry.",
    "Therapist: How do these sensations compare to what you felt during the abuse?",
    "Client: They're... they're actually quite similar. It's like a shadow of what I used to feel. During the abuse, it was more intense - I'd feel paralyzed, unable to breathe properly. Now, it's like an echo of that, but it still affects me deeply. I didn't realize how much my body was holding onto these memories.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why didn't I leave sooner?\" And then I feel ashamed for not being strong enough. But there's also this voice saying, \"You did leave. You're safe now.\" It's a constant back-and-forth. I'm also worried about the future. Will I ever trust someone again? Can I have a healthy relationship after this? It's overwhelming sometimes.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts impact your daily life?",
    "Client: They... they affect everything, really. I find myself being overly cautious with people, always looking for signs of aggression or manipulation. It's exhausting. And sometimes, I avoid social situations altogether because I'm afraid of getting close to someone again. Work is a struggle too - I have trouble concentrating when these thoughts creep in.",
    "Therapist: What's one thing you've learned about yourself through this experience?",
    "Client: I've learned that I'm... I'm actually stronger than I thought. Despite all the fear and self-doubt, I did manage to leave. I'm here, working on myself. That takes courage, doesn't it? I never saw myself as particularly brave before, but maybe I am.",
    "Therapist: How does recognizing that strength make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's empowering, actually. It gives me a glimmer of hope. Like maybe I can get through this and come out the other side. It doesn't erase the pain or fear, but it gives me something to hold onto when things get tough.",
    "Therapist: What do you think is the next step in your healing journey?",
    "Client: I think... I need to work on forgiving myself. Not for the abuse - that wasn't my fault. But for staying as long as I did, for the choices I made. And maybe... maybe start to consider the possibility of trusting others again. Not rushing into anything, but at least being open to the idea. It's scary, but I think it's necessary if I want to move forward.",
    "Therapist: How can we support you in taking that step?",
    "Client: I'm not entirely sure. Maybe... maybe we could work on some strategies for managing my anxiety in social situations? And perhaps explore ways to recognize healthy relationships. I feel like I need to relearn what's normal and what's not. And... I think I need help processing the guilt. It's still weighing heavily on me.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling now compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also a bit lighter. Like I've unpacked some of the weight I've been carrying. There's still a lot to work through, but I feel like I've taken a step forward today. It's exhausting, facing all of this, but I also feel a sense of... I don't know, maybe accomplishment? For being able to talk about it without completely falling apart.",
    "Therapist: What will you do to take care of yourself for the rest of the day?",
    "Client: I think I'll go for a walk in the park near my house. Being in nature always helps ground me. And then maybe call my sister - she's been a great support through all of this. Just hearing her voice helps. Oh, and I'll make sure to eat something nourishing. I tend to forget about food when I'm stressed, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. We'll continue this work in our next session.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's not easy, but I'm grateful for the support. I'll see you next week."
