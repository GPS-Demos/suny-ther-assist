    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit anxious, to be honest. I know we're going to be talking about my workplace trauma, and it's making me nervous.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'll try to keep that in mind. It's just... every time I think about that day at the office, my heart starts racing.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Okay... So, it was a regular Tuesday morning. I was at my desk, reviewing some reports when suddenly, I felt this sharp pain in my chest. At first, I thought it was just indigestion, but it kept getting worse.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that memory. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I remember feeling scared and confused. My colleague, Maria, noticed something was wrong and asked if I was okay. I tried to stand up, but my legs felt weak, and I stumbled. That's when I realized this was serious.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Carlos. Keep going.",
    "Client: Everything after that is a blur. I remember Maria calling for help, and then there were people all around me. Someone was loosening my tie, another person was on the phone with 911. I could hear their voices, but they sounded far away. I thought... I thought I was dying.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're here now.",
    "Client: The paramedics arrived, and they were asking me questions, but I could barely speak. I was gasping for air. They put me on a stretcher, and as they were wheeling me out, I saw all my coworkers staring. I felt so embarrassed and vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. Continue.",
    "Client: In the ambulance, they told me I was having a heart attack. I couldn't believe it. I kept thinking about my kids, my ex-wife... I was terrified I'd never see them again. The pain was excruciating, and I felt so alone.",
    "Therapist: You're not alone now. Keep going, you're doing well.",
    "Client: At the hospital, everything happened so fast. Doctors and nurses were rushing around, attaching wires and tubes. I remember the cold operating room and the anesthesiologist telling me to count backward from 10. I didn't even make it to 7 before I was out.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory bravely. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: It's hard, but I'm okay. When I woke up after surgery, I felt disoriented and weak. The doctor explained what had happened, but all I could think about was how my life had changed in an instant. I was afraid to go back to work, afraid it might happen again.",
    "Therapist: That fear is natural. You're doing great processing this.",
    "Client: Ever since then, I've struggled with anxiety, especially at work. Every time I feel a twinge in my chest, I panic. I'm constantly worried about my health, and it's affecting my performance. I feel like I'm not the same person I was before the heart attack.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. You've come a long way.",
    "Client: I know I need to move past this, but it's so hard. I feel like I've lost my confidence, my sense of security. How do I get that back?",
    "Therapist: We'll work on that together. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I hope so. I want to feel normal again, to not be afraid every time I walk into the office. But right now, it feels impossible.",
    "Therapist: It's not impossible. You're stronger than you realize.",
    "Client: Maybe you're right. It's just... every time I think about that day, all those feelings come rushing back. The fear, the helplessness, the pain. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. You're processing it well.",
    "Client: I guess I am. It's the first time I've talked about it in such detail. It's draining, but also... I don't know, maybe a little freeing? Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a positive sign. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Tired, but also a bit lighter. Like I've let go of something I've been holding onto for too long. Is this what healing feels like?",
    "Therapist: Often, yes. You've done excellent work today, Carlos.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think... I think I'm ready to end for today. This was intense, but I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself. We'll continue next session.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you for guiding me through this. I'll see you next week.",
    "Therapist: Take care, Carlos. Remember to use your coping strategies."
