    "Therapist: Alright, Hamid, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I understand why we're doing this.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the memory of your divorce. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm in our living room. Sarah is standing there, her face stern. She's holding divorce papers. I feel... I feel like the floor is dropping out from under me.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: It's about a 6. My hands are starting to sweat.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: Sarah's saying she can't do this anymore. That we've grown apart. I'm trying to speak, but my throat feels tight. I... I remember thinking, \"This can't be happening. Not after 30 years.\"",
    "Therapist: And now? Your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's gone up to an 8. My chest feels heavy, like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: That's tough. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm pleading with her, asking for another chance. But her eyes... they're so cold. I've never seen her look at me like that before. I feel... I feel worthless, like everything I've done means nothing.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. My heart is racing. I feel dizzy, like I might fall.",
    "Therapist: That's intense. Remember, you're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *deep breath* She's walking out now. The door closes behind her. I'm alone in our... in my house. It's so quiet. I can hear the clock ticking. It's deafening. I sink to the floor, and I... I start to cry. I haven't cried in years, but now I can't stop.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's still at 9. My face feels hot, and my eyes are stinging. I can almost feel the tears again.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I spend the night on the floor. I can't bring myself to sleep in our bed. When morning comes, I feel... empty. Like a part of me is gone. I go through the motions of getting ready for work, but everything feels meaningless.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's dropped to a 7. I feel... drained. Exhausted.",
    "Therapist: That's a noticeable change. What do you think caused the decrease?",
    "Client: I guess... talking about it, I realize I survived that day. It was awful, but I got through it.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: My SUDS is down to a 5. I'm feeling... less overwhelmed. Still sad, but... maybe a little stronger.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. Let's pause here. How was this experience for you?",
    "Client: It was tough, but... I feel like I understand my emotions better now. It's still painful, but maybe... maybe I can handle it.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent insight, Hamid. We'll work through this together."
