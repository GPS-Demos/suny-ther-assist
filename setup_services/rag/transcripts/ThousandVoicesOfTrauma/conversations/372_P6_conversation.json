    "Therapist: Alright, Rahul, let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the memory of your severe illness.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in the hospital room. The beeping of the machines is so loud. I can smell the antiseptic... it's making me nauseous. My parents are there, looking worried. I feel so weak, like I can't even lift my arm.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: Um, probably a 6 out of 10. My heart is starting to race a bit.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The doctor comes in. He's talking to my parents, but I can't really focus on what he's saying. I just keep thinking, \"Am I going to die?\" My chest feels tight, and I'm struggling to breathe normally. The room feels like it's spinning...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to an 8. I feel like I'm back there, and it's terrifying.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Right, okay... The nurse comes to change my IV. It hurts, and I start crying. I feel so helpless and scared. My mom is trying to comfort me, but I can see the fear in her eyes too. I've never felt so alone and vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level?",
    "Client: Still at an 8. My palms are sweating, and I feel shaky.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I remember looking out the window and seeing other people walking around, living their lives. And I just felt so angry and jealous. Why did this happen to me? What did I do to deserve this? I... I can feel that anger rising in me now.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's actually dropped a bit. Maybe a 6 now. The anger feels... different from the fear.",
    "Therapist: Interesting. Continue.",
    "Client: The nights were the worst. Everything was quiet, but my mind wouldn't stop racing. I'd lie awake, feeling every ache and pain in my body, wondering if I'd ever feel normal again. Sometimes, I'd pretend to be asleep when the nurses came in because I just couldn't bear to interact with anyone.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's back up to a 7. My throat feels tight, like I'm choking back tears.",
    "Therapist: That's alright. You're doing great, Rahul.",
    "Client: Thanks... I remember the day they told me I could go home. I should have felt happy, but I was terrified. What if something went wrong? What if I ended up back here? As my dad helped me into the wheelchair, I felt so weak and useless. I was supposed to be in my prime, but instead, I felt like an old man.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually down to a 5. Talking about leaving the hospital feels a bit better.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's wrap up the exercise. Take a deep breath and slowly open your eyes.",
    "Client: *exhales deeply* Wow, that was intense. I didn't realize how vivid those memories still were.",
    "Therapist: You did exceptionally well, Rahul. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a bit lighter? Like I've released something.",
    "Therapist: That's common. We'll discuss this more next session."
