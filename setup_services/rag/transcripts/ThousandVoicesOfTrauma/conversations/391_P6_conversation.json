    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Can you close your eyes and describe the animal attack? Remember to stay present in the memory. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm closing my eyes. Um, I'm 8 years old, playing in our backyard. It's hot, and I can smell the dry grass. I see the neighbor's dog approaching... it looks angry. My SUDS is about 40 right now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: The dog's getting closer. Its teeth are bared, and I'm frozen in place. I can hear my heart pounding in my ears. The dog lunges at me, and I feel its teeth sink into my arm. The pain is... it's intense. My SUDS is climbing... it's about 65 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm screaming, but it feels like no sound is coming out. The dog is shaking its head, and I can feel my skin tearing. I'm terrified... I think I'm going to die. My arm is on fire with pain. I... I can smell the dog's breath, and it's making me nauseous. My SUDS is at 80 now. It's... it's really intense.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear my father yelling. He's running towards us with a garden hose. The dog lets go of my arm when the water hits it. I collapse to the ground, sobbing. My arm is bleeding badly, and I can see bits of flesh hanging... God, it's awful. My SUDS is still at 80.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm shaking. My heart is racing, and I feel like I can't catch my breath. The memory feels so real... I can almost feel the pain in my arm again. My stomach is in knots. SUDS is about 75 now.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're doing great. What happens after your father intervenes?",
    "Client: He scoops me up and rushes me inside. My mother is crying, wrapping my arm in a towel. Everything's a blur of motion and noise. We're in the car, speeding to the hospital. I'm in shock, I think. The pain is starting to hit me in waves. My SUDS is dropping a bit... maybe 70 now.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're processing this well. Continue.",
    "Client: At the hospital, there's a flurry of activity. Doctors, nurses, bright lights. They're cleaning my wound, and it stings horribly. I'm getting stitches, and each one feels like a new bite. I'm exhausted and scared. My parents look terrified. I... I feel so small and vulnerable. My SUDS is back up to 75.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. How are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling drained. My body feels heavy, and I'm sweating. There's a tightness in my chest, but it's starting to ease a bit. The memory doesn't feel as vivid now. My SUDS is coming down... it's about 60 now.",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. Let's continue for a few more minutes.",
    "Client: Okay. After the stitches, they're wrapping my arm. The doctor is talking to my parents about rabies shots and follow-up care. I'm starting to feel drowsy from the medication they gave me. The pain is duller now, but I'm afraid to look at my arm. I keep thinking about the dog's teeth, the sound of its growl. My SUDS is hovering around 55.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How do you feel about your progress today?",
    "Client: I... I'm surprised. It was intense, but I got through it. My heart rate is slowing down now. I feel a bit shaky, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I faced something I've been avoiding for a long time. My SUDS is down to about 45 now.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's start wrapping up. Take a few deep breaths.",
    "Client: (Deep breaths) Okay. I'm feeling more grounded now. The memory is fading, and I'm becoming more aware of the room. My arm feels a bit tingly, but I know it's just a phantom sensation. I'm back in the present. My SUDS is down to 30.",
    "Therapist: Well done. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. Tired, but okay. It was tough, but I feel like I understand the memory better now. It doesn't have the same power over me. I'm grateful for your guidance. My SUDS is at 25 now.",
    "Therapist: You've made significant progress today. Let's end here and discuss your experience."
