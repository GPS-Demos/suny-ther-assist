    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also kind of blank at the same time. My heart's still pounding a bit. I can feel this tightness in my chest, you know? It's like I'm back there again, feeling so small and powerless.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how unfair it all was. How I didn't deserve any of that. But then there's this other part of me that wonders if maybe I did something to provoke it. Like, maybe if I had just been quieter or... I don't know, less visible somehow? It's confusing because I know logically that it wasn't my fault, but emotionally, I still feel this... this shame, I guess.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does that shame feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's heavy. Like this weight pressing down on my shoulders. And my stomach feels all knotted up. I notice I'm hunching over a bit, like I'm trying to make myself smaller. It's weird because I'm safe here, but my body doesn't seem to know that.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm angry. Really angry. Not just at the person who hurt me, but at everyone who saw what was happening and didn't do anything. I remember looking around, hoping someone would step in, but they all just... looked away. It makes me furious, but also so sad. I feel let down by the whole world, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. How do you cope with those feelings?",
    "Client: Usually, I try to push them down. Distract myself with work or... anything really. But now, sitting here, letting myself feel it all... it's overwhelming. But also, maybe a little freeing? Like, I've been carrying this weight for so long, and now I'm finally setting it down. It hurts, but it's also... I don't know, maybe necessary?",
    "Therapist: Mm. What do you mean by necessary?",
    "Client: I guess... I've spent so long running from these feelings, trying to pretend they don't exist. But they're a part of me, aren't they? A part of my story. And maybe by facing them, I can start to... not exactly move on, but maybe integrate them somehow? Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. How does that idea sit with you?",
    "Client: It's scary, honestly. The thought of really diving into all of this... it makes me nervous. But there's also a part of me that feels... hopeful? Like maybe this is the path to actually healing, instead of just coping. I'm tired of feeling like I'm always on edge, always waiting for the next bad thing to happen.",
    "Therapist: What would healing look like for you?",
    "Client: I... I'm not entirely sure. I guess being able to think about what happened without feeling like I'm right back there. Being able to trust people again, to feel safe in my own skin. To not flinch every time someone raises their voice or moves too quickly near me. To feel like I have control over my own life and my own reactions.",
    "Therapist: Those are important goals. How do you feel about working towards them?",
    "Client: It's daunting, but... I think I'm ready. I'm tired of letting this control my life. I want to reclaim my power, you know? I want to be able to look in the mirror and see someone strong, someone who survived. Not just a victim. It's going to be hard work, I know that. But I think... I think it'll be worth it.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's coming up for you as you say that?",
    "Client: A mix of things, really. There's fear, definitely. Fear of the pain I'll have to go through to get there. But there's also this... determination, I guess? Like, for the first time in a long time, I feel like I have a direction, a purpose. It's not just about surviving day to day anymore. It's about actually living, you know?",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How does that shift feel?",
    "Client: It feels... good. Scary, but good. Like I'm finally taking back some control. I've spent so long feeling powerless, both because of what happened and because of how it's affected me since. But this... this feels like I'm making a choice. Like I'm deciding that my story isn't over, that I get to write the next chapters.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant shift. What do you think has led to this change?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's been building for a while. But doing these exercises, facing these memories head-on instead of trying to avoid them... it's shown me that I'm stronger than I thought. That I can face this stuff and come out the other side. It's not easy, but it's possible. And that possibility... it gives me hope.",
    "Therapist: How does that hope feel?",
    "Client: It feels... warm. Like a little flame inside my chest. It's small, and sometimes I worry it'll go out. But it's there, and it's mine. No one can take it away from me. And maybe... maybe with time and work, it'll grow stronger. I want to nurture it, you know? To see where it can lead me.",
    "Therapist: That's beautiful. Where do you want to go from here?",
    "Client: I think... I want to keep doing this work. As hard as it is, I can see that it's helping. I want to learn more tools to manage when the memories and feelings get overwhelming. And I want to start rebuilding my life. Not just surviving, but actually living. Maybe... maybe even start thinking about dating again, or making new friends. It's scary, but I think I'm ready to start taking those steps.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive direction. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... tired, honestly. But it's a good kind of tired, if that makes sense? Like I've done something important, something meaningful. I feel a bit raw, but also... lighter somehow. Like I've set down a burden I didn't even realize I was carrying. It's a strange mix of exhaustion and hope.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I think... I think I just need to sit with these feelings for a bit. To let them settle. Maybe do something kind for myself later, like take a long bath or read a book I enjoy. Just... be gentle with myself, you know? This work is hard, but I'm doing it. And that's something to be proud of.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How would you like to close our session today?",
    "Client: Could we... could we just sit in silence for a moment? I'd like to take a few deep breaths, kind of ground myself before I head back out into the world. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's do that.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I'm ready to go now. Same time next week?",
