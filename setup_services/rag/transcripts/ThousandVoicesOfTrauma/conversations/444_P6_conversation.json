    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the memory.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in the prison cell. It's dark and cold. The concrete walls feel like they're closing in on me. I can hear the distant sound of metal doors slamming and muffled voices. The air is thick with a musty smell, and I can taste the metallic flavor of fear in my mouth.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 6. My heart is starting to race a bit.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: I'm sitting on the hard floor, my back against the wall. My uniform is scratchy and uncomfortable. I can feel my muscles tensing up, especially in my shoulders and jaw. There's this constant knot in my stomach, like I'm going to be sick. I keep thinking about how I ended up here, replaying the mission that went wrong...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to an 8. I can feel my hands shaking.",
    "Therapist: That's alright. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I can hear footsteps approaching. My whole body goes rigid. I'm terrified they're coming for me again. The interrogations... they're brutal. I can still feel the sting of the slaps, the ache in my ribs from the kicks. My breath is coming faster now, and I feel like I can't get enough air.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: I'm trying, but it's hard. I can hear them unlocking the door. The sound of the key turning is so loud in my ears. I want to run, but there's nowhere to go. I'm trapped. My heart is pounding so hard I think it might burst out of my chest. I feel so helpless, so alone...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still a 9. Maybe even a 9.5. I feel like I'm going to pass out.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it.",
    "Client: The door opens, and the light blinds me for a moment. I can smell their sweat and cigarettes. One of them grabs my arm, and I flinch. I hate how weak I feel. They're dragging me out of the cell, and I know what's coming next. I'm trying to brace myself, but I'm so scared. I can feel tears starting to form in my eyes, but I refuse to let them see me cry.",
    "Therapist: How about your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually gone down a bit. Maybe an 8. I think... I think I'm starting to remember that I survived this. That I'm not there anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Keep going.",
    "Client: As they're taking me down the hallway, I start to focus on my breathing. In and out. In and out. I'm still terrified, but there's a small part of me that feels... defiant. I made it through this before, and I'll make it through again. The fear is still there, but it's not consuming me completely anymore.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to a 7 now. I can feel my heartbeat starting to slow down a little.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. You're doing really well.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I want to stop here for now. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's end the exercise. Open your eyes when you're ready."
