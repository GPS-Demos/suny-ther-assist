    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. You know? I can still see the room, the way the light filtered through those heavy curtains. It's making my stomach churn.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you noticing?",
    "Client: My hands are clammy, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's like I can't get enough air. And my heart... it's pounding so hard I can hear it in my ears. It reminds me of how I felt every time I had to attend one of those... those meetings.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are coming up for you?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"How could I have been so stupid?\" I mean, looking back now, it all seems so obvious. The way they isolated us from our families, how they always had an answer for everything. But at the time, I felt... special, you know? Like I was part of something bigger than myself.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel now?",
    "Client: Angry. So angry at myself, at them. But also... sad. There's this deep sadness, like I've lost something I can never get back. My youth, my trust in people. It's gone, and I don't know if I'll ever feel whole again.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to run away, to forget all of this. But another part knows I need to face it. I guess... I need to feel safe. To know that it's okay to have all these conflicting emotions.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: There's this... shame. It's like a heavy blanket wrapped around me. I'm embarrassed that I fell for their lies, that I let them manipulate me. And I'm scared... scared that I might be vulnerable to something like this again.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your broader experience?",
    "Client: It's... it's like this experience has colored everything in my life. My relationships, my work, even how I see myself. I'm always second-guessing my decisions, afraid of being taken advantage of again. And the substance use... I think it was my way of trying to numb all these feelings, to escape from the constant doubt and fear.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you make that connection?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. Like I'm seeing my life through a new lens. I feel... exposed, I guess. But also, there's a tiny bit of relief. Like maybe understanding this connection is the first step to breaking free from it. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What else?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much this has affected my current relationship. I have such a hard time trusting my partner, always looking for hidden motives. And when they try to get close, I push them away. It's like... it's like I'm still in that cult mindset, always on guard.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization feel?",
    "Client: It's... painful. Really painful. But also, it's like a light bulb moment, you know? I've been carrying this weight for so long, and now I can see why. It doesn't make it easier, but... maybe it makes it more manageable?",
    "Therapist: What do you think this means for your recovery?",
    "Client: I think... I think it means I have a lot of work to do. But for the first time, I feel like I have a roadmap. Like, I can see how all these pieces fit together - the trauma, the substance use, my trust issues. It's scary, but also... hopeful? Like maybe if I can understand it, I can change it.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I want to... I want to work on rebuilding trust. With myself first, I think. And then with others. And I want to learn how to sit with these uncomfortable feelings without turning to substances. It's going to be hard, but... I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, honestly. Emotionally drained. But there's also this weird sense of lightness. Like I've put down a heavy backpack I've been carrying for years. I'm scared about what comes next, but I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little bit stronger? Like I can face this.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for helping me see these connections. I know we have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this."
