    "Therapist: Welcome back, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to dive into some heavy stuff today, and part of me wants to just bolt out the door. But I'm here, right? That's something.",
    "Therapist: It is. Your courage is admirable. Are you ready to begin the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I guess so. As ready as I'll ever be. Where do we start?",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes and take us to that day. Describe what you see, hear, and feel.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm... I'm at work. It's a normal day, or at least it started that way. I can smell the coffee from the break room. My computer screen is bright, hurting my eyes a bit. I'm working on a report, but I keep getting distracted by hushed whispers behind me.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I hear footsteps approaching. My heart starts racing. It's my supervisor, Mark. He's... he's always had it out for me, I think. He stops at my desk, looming over me. I can smell his cologne, it's overpowering. He asks to see me in his office.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 40? It's uncomfortable, but I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue. What happens in his office?",
    "Client: I follow him in. The door closes behind me, and suddenly the room feels so small. He starts criticizing my work, but it's not just about the job. He's making comments about my race, saying I only got hired because of diversity quotas. His voice is getting louder, and I'm shrinking into the chair.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling so small. Humiliated. Angry, but also scared. My hands are shaking, and I'm trying not to cry. I want to defend myself, but the words won't come out.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's higher. Maybe 70?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Take a deep breath. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... He's still yelling. Suddenly, he slams his hand on the desk. I flinch, and he laughs. He says, \"See? You people are all the same. Weak.\" I'm frozen. I can't move. Then... then he comes around the desk. I can see the vein pulsing in his forehead. He grabs my arm, hard. It hurts. I try to pull away, but he's so much stronger.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he twists my arm behind my back. I cry out in pain. He's hissing in my ear, telling me I should be grateful for this job, that no one else would hire someone like me. I can feel his spit on my cheek. I'm crying now, silently. I feel so helpless, so... so worthless.",
    "Therapist: Your emotions are valid. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. 90, maybe? I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Focus on your breathing. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... okay. I'm... I'm still there, but I can breathe a little better.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: The door opens. It's Janet from HR. Mark immediately lets go of me and steps back. He's all smiles now, acting like nothing happened. Janet looks confused, concerned. She asks if everything's okay. I... I want to tell her, but I'm terrified. Mark's staring at me, daring me to say something. I... I shake my head and say everything's fine. Janet leaves, and Mark smirks at me. He tells me to get back to work. I stumble out of his office, feeling sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Disgusted. Angry at myself for not speaking up. Scared of what might happen next time. My arm still hurts where he grabbed me.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe now. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down a bit. Maybe 75?",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Can you describe what happened after you left his office?",
    "Client: I... I went to the bathroom. Locked myself in a stall and cried silently. I could see the bruise forming on my arm. I felt so... so dirty. Like his touch had left a stain on me. I wanted to scrub my skin raw. I stayed there for what felt like hours, trying to pull myself together. When I finally came out, I avoided everyone's eyes. I couldn't bear to see if they knew, if they could tell what had happened.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you remember this?",
    "Client: Tense. My shoulders are up to my ears. My stomach is in knots. I feel... I feel like I did that day. Small. Powerless.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Ground yourself in the present. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... okay. I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happened when you went home that day?",
    "Client: I... I couldn't stop shaking. I took a scalding hot shower, trying to wash away the feeling of his hands on me. I couldn't eat. I just curled up in bed, replaying the scene over and over. Wondering what I could have done differently. If I had spoken up, fought back... but I was so scared of losing my job. Of not being believed.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 60, I think. Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also... I don't know. Releasing something?",
    "Therapist: That's good. Keep going. What happened in the following days?",
    "Client: I... I called in sick the next day. I couldn't face going back there. When I finally did return, I was a nervous wreck. Every time I heard footsteps, I'd flinch. Mark acted like nothing had happened, but he'd give me these... these looks. Like he knew he had power over me. I started having nightmares. Panic attacks in the middle of the night. I felt like I was losing my mind.",
    "Therapist: How did this affect your relationships?",
    "Client: I... I pushed everyone away. My partner couldn't understand why I was so jumpy, so irritable. I couldn't tell them what happened. I felt... ashamed. Like it was my fault somehow. I stopped going out with friends. I was afraid of running into Mark outside of work. I felt like I was living in a constant state of fear.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 50 now. Talking about it... it's making it feel less overwhelming, somehow.",
    "Therapist: You're doing very well. How did this experience change you?",
    "Client: It... it changed everything. I used to be confident, outgoing. After that, I became this shell of myself. I was always looking over my shoulder, always afraid. I started doubting myself, my abilities. I wondered if Mark was right, if I really didn't deserve my job. The worst part was... I started to hate my own skin. Like my race was this... this target on my back. I wanted to disappear.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix. I'm sad for that version of me, angry at Mark, frustrated with the system that allowed this to happen. But there's also... I don't know. A glimmer of something else. Like talking about it is taking away some of its power.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive sign. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 40, I think. It's still there, but it feels... manageable.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. How do you feel about the progress you've made?",
    "Client: I... I'm surprised, actually. When we started, I didn't think I could get through this. But now... it's like I can see it from a distance. It's still painful, but it doesn't consume me the way it used to. I feel... I feel a bit stronger.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's end here for today. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I will. This was hard, but... I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself. We'll continue next session. Take care."
