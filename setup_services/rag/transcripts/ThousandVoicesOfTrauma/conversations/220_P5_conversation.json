    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares lately, and I'm not sure if I'm ready for this.",
    "Therapist: I understand. It's natural to feel anxious. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about reliving the trauma. What if I can't handle it? I mean, I know I wasn't in the military, but talking about combat... it just brings up so many feelings related to my own experiences. I'm scared I'll fall apart.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. How do you think this exercise might help?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. I guess it might help me process what happened? But it's terrifying to think about facing it head-on. I've spent so long trying to avoid these memories.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. Avoidance can maintain PTSD. This exercise aims to help you process those memories safely.",
    "Client: That makes sense, but it's still scary. How exactly will this work? What am I supposed to do?",
    "Therapist: You'll describe the traumatic event in detail, in the present tense. I'll guide you through it.",
    "Client: In the present tense? That sounds intense. Will I be able to stop if it gets too overwhelming?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We can pause anytime. Remember, you're in control here.",
    "Client: Okay, that's a relief. I'm still nervous, but I think I can do this. What should I expect to feel during the exercise?",
    "Therapist: You might experience strong emotions or physical sensations. This is normal and will pass.",
    "Client: I'm worried about having a panic attack. What if I can't breathe or something?",
    "Therapist: I'll be here to support you. We'll use grounding techniques if needed. Your safety is my priority.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I appreciate your support. I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be. How long will this take?",
    "Therapist: We'll do about 30-45 minutes of exposure today. Remember, it's a process. You're very brave for doing this.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot. I know this won't be easy, but I'm tired of letting my past control my life. I want to get better, for myself and for my relationship. My partner has been so patient, but I know my anxiety affects them too.",
    "Therapist: Your motivation is inspiring. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do this. I'm scared, but I'm ready to face this head-on. Thank you for being here with me through this."
