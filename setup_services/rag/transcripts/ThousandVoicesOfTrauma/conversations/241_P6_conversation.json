    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. Today we'll continue with imaginal exposure. Remember, you can stop anytime. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and describe the memory. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's about a 4. I'm in that dingy room again. The walls are peeling, and there's a musty smell. I can hear muffled voices outside.",
    "Therapist: Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: The door opens, and he comes in. My heart starts racing. His eyes... they're so cold. I feel frozen.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's up to a 6 now. My palms are sweating, and I feel nauseous. He's walking towards me, and I can't move.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm thinking, \"Please, not again.\" I want to run, but I'm paralyzed with fear. My throat feels tight.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's an 8 now. I can feel his hands on me, and I'm fighting back tears. My body is shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) He's... he's hurting me. I feel so helpless, so ashamed. Why can't I stop this?",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's a 9. I feel like I can't breathe. My chest is so tight. I want this to stop.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay present.",
    "Client: (crying) I'm curled up on the floor now. Everything hurts. I feel so alone, so broken.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: Still a 9. I can't stop shaking. I feel like I'll never be clean again.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. What do you need?",
    "Client: I... I need to remind myself it's over. That I survived. My breathing is slowing down a bit.",
    "Therapist: Good. SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's coming down to a 7. I'm starting to feel more present in the room with you.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm remembering how I got out. How I found help. It's still painful, but I feel stronger.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5 now. I'm feeling drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little proud that I got through it.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but also relieved. It's like a weight has lifted a bit. My SUDS is down to a 3.",
    "Therapist: Well done, Maria. Let's end here and discuss what you experienced."
