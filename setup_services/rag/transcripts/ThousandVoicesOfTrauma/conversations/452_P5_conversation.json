    "Therapist: Welcome, Maia. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi there. I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares about the cyclone lately, and I'm not sure if I'm ready to talk about it in detail.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Your feelings are valid. Shall we discuss the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: Yeah, I suppose we should. But can you explain it to me again? I'm not entirely sure what to expect, and that's making me even more anxious.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Imaginal exposure involves revisiting your trauma memory in a safe environment. It can help reduce PTSD symptoms over time.",
    "Client: That sounds... intense. I'm worried about getting overwhelmed. What if I can't handle it? I mean, I'm already struggling with anxiety on top of everything else.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are normal. We'll go at your pace, and I'll support you throughout. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It's a little reassuring, I guess. But what exactly will happen during the session? Will I have to close my eyes and relive everything?",
    "Therapist: You'll describe the event in present tense, with eyes open or closed. We can pause anytime. Your safety is priority.",
    "Client: Okay, that doesn't sound as bad as I imagined. But I'm still scared about how I'll feel afterward. Will this make my anxiety worse?",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel uneasy. Some distress may occur, but it typically decreases with each session. Your courage is admirable.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate that. I guess I'm just worried about disappointing you or not doing it right. This whole refugee experience has been so challenging, and sometimes I feel like I'm not making progress fast enough.",
    "Therapist: There's no \"right\" way. Your pace is perfect. Your resilience through this refugee journey is remarkable.",
    "Client: That means a lot to hear. I've been feeling so alone in this, even though my parents try to understand. It's hard being away from everything familiar, you know? But I want to get better, for them and for myself.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is inspiring. Remember, healing isn't linear. Every step counts. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm still nervous, but I trust you. And I want to work through this. Can we start with something small, maybe just describing the day before the cyclone hit? That might be easier to handle.",
    "Therapist: Excellent suggestion. We'll start there. Remember, you're in control. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do it. I'm taking a deep breath... okay, I'm ready. Thank you for being here with me through this."
