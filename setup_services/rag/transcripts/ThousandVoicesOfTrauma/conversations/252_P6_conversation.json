    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's begin. Close your eyes and recall the day of your medical procedure.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in the hospital room. The lights are so bright, and there's this constant beeping from the machines. I can smell the antiseptic, and it's making me nauseous. The doctor comes in, and he looks so serious. I'm starting to panic...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: It's about a 6. My heart is racing, and my palms are getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The doctor starts explaining the procedure, but I can barely focus. His words are just a blur. I'm thinking about all the things that could go wrong. What if I don't wake up? What if there are complications? I feel so alone and scared...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to an 8. I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: They're preparing me for the procedure now. The nurse is trying to be kind, but I can't even look at her. I'm shaking uncontrollably. As they wheel me into the operating room, I start crying. I've never felt so helpless in my life...",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. This feels so real, like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: The anesthesiologist is talking to me, but his voice sounds far away. I'm counting backward, and everything starts to fade. When I wake up, I'm in so much pain. It's worse than I ever imagined. I feel betrayed by my own body...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's still at a 9. My chest feels tight, and I'm having trouble catching my breath.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I'm trying... The recovery is so slow. Every day is a struggle. I keep replaying the procedure in my mind, wondering if I made the right choice. I feel so isolated from my friends who don't understand what I'm going through...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating at this point?",
    "Client: It's... actually gone down to a 7. I'm starting to feel a bit calmer.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's continue.",
    "Client: As the weeks pass, I start to heal physically, but emotionally, I'm a wreck. I have nightmares about being back in that hospital room. I avoid anything that reminds me of the procedure. I feel like a part of me was left behind on that operating table...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's a 6. I'm feeling sad, but not as panicked as before.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I try to talk to my boyfriend about it, but he doesn't get it. He tells me to just move on, that it's over now. But for me, it's not over. It's like this cloud that follows me everywhere. We start arguing more and more...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's back up to an 8. Thinking about the breakup on top of everything else is really hard.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Continue.",
    "Client: Eventually, he leaves. Says he can't handle my mood swings and anxiety anymore. I feel so betrayed and alone. It's like the trauma of the procedure has taken everything from me - my health, my relationship, my peace of mind...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a 7. I feel sad, but also a little angry.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted, but... I also feel like I've faced something I've been avoiding for a long time. It's painful, but there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe relief?",
