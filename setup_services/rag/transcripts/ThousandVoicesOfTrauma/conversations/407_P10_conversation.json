    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Ah, doctor... I'm... I'm not sure. My hands are a bit shaky. It's been so long since... since that day. I don't know if I'm ready to talk about it.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's start slowly. Can you rate your distress from 0 to 100?",
    "Client: Hmm... I'd say about 60. My heart's already beating faster just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: S\u00ed... yes. I'll try. It was a warm afternoon in July. I was walking home from the mercado, my arms full of groceries. The street was quiet, unusually so for that time of day. I remember the smell of jasmine from Se\u00f1ora Ramirez's garden...",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay in that moment. What happened next?",
    "Client: I... I heard shouting. Angry voices. Then I saw them - two police officers. They were... they were pushing a young man against a wall. He looked so scared, like my grandson when he has nightmares. I stopped, my heart pounding. I wanted to help, but I was afraid.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's higher. Maybe 75? My palms are sweating.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here with me, safe in my office.",
    "Client: Gracias... The officers, they were so rough. One of them had his knee on the boy's back. I couldn't stay quiet anymore. I called out, \"Por favor, stop! He's just a child!\" That's when they noticed me. The taller one, he turned and... and...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it, Maria. You're doing great.",
    "Client: He... he came towards me. His face was red, twisted with anger. I've never seen such hate in someone's eyes before. I tried to back away, but I stumbled. The groceries... they fell everywhere. Tomatoes rolling on the sidewalk, like little red balls. It would be funny if it wasn't so terrifying.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. It's like I'm there again. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Focus on your breath. In and out.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Okay... The officer, he grabbed my arm. So tight. I can still feel his fingers digging into my skin. He was yelling, but I couldn't understand. Everything was a blur. I tried to pull away, but he was so strong. Then... then he pushed me. I fell hard on the sidewalk. The pain... it shot through my hip like lightning.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave, Maria. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. 90, maybe? I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Let's pause for a moment. Look around the room. Name three things you see.",
    "Client: I... I see your bookshelf. The blue painting on the wall. And... and the plant by the window.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, can you continue?",
    "Client: S\u00ed... I was on the ground, crying. My hip hurt so much. People were gathering, watching. I felt so helpless, so humiliated. The officer was still yelling, telling everyone to go away. But a young woman, she came to help me. She put her arm around me, helped me sit up.",
    "Therapist: How did you feel when she helped you?",
    "Client: Grateful... but still so scared. My hands wouldn't stop shaking. I kept thinking about my husband, my grandchildren. What if they had seen this? What if it had been one of them instead of me?",
    "Therapist: Those are normal thoughts. How does your body feel as you remember this?",
    "Client: My shoulders are so tense. It's like I'm carrying a heavy weight. And my stomach... it's in knots.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. You're doing well.",
    "Client: (Inhales deeply) The young woman, she was arguing with the officer. Demanding his badge number. He seemed... less aggressive now. Like he realized he'd gone too far. The other officer came over, looking worried. They were talking quietly, glancing at me.",
    "Therapist: What happened next?",
    "Client: An ambulance came. I didn't want to go, but my hip was throbbing. As they helped me onto the stretcher, I saw the young man they had been arresting. He was sitting in the police car, watching me with wide, scared eyes. I wanted to tell him it wasn't his fault, but I couldn't find my voice.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a bit better. Maybe 80? My heart isn't racing as much.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Can you tell me about the ride to the hospital?",
    "Client: It was... surreal. The paramedic was so kind, holding my hand. I kept thinking about how quickly everything had changed. One minute I was buying groceries, the next I was in an ambulance. I felt... I felt old. Vulnerable. Like the world wasn't safe anymore.",
    "Therapist: Those are very normal feelings after such an experience.",
    "Client: At the hospital, everything was a blur of x-rays and questions. My husband arrived, looking so worried. When I saw him, I finally broke down. I cried and cried. I felt so ashamed, even though I knew I hadn't done anything wrong.",
    "Therapist: It's important to remember that, Maria. You didn't do anything wrong.",
    "Client: I know, but... it's hard. The bruises faded, my hip healed, but something inside me... it changed that day. I used to love walking in our neighborhood, chatting with neighbors. Now, every time I see a police car, my heart races. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: How does talking about this now make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. But also... maybe a little relieving? Like I'm finally letting out a breath I've been holding for months.",
    "Therapist: That's a good sign. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: I think... maybe 70? It's coming down, slowly.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. Let's continue. What happened in the days after?",
    "Client: It was... difficult. My grandchildren came to visit, and I tried to act normal. But I couldn't stop thinking about what happened. Every loud noise made me jump. I had nightmares... still do sometimes. In them, I'm always falling, but no one comes to help me up.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with these nightmares?",
    "Client: I... I try to remind myself that I'm safe. Sometimes I get up, make some tea. My husband, he's been so patient. He holds me when I wake up crying. But I feel guilty for worrying him.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to lean on your support system. How else has this affected your daily life?",
    "Client: I... I don't go out as much anymore. Especially not alone. I used to love my independence, but now... now I'm always looking over my shoulder. And I worry about my family. What if something like this happens to my son, or my grandchildren?",
    "Therapist: Those are understandable concerns. How do you handle these worries?",
    "Client: I pray a lot. It helps... sometimes. And I try to focus on the good things. My family, my garden. But it's hard. I feel like I lost something that day, and I don't know how to get it back.",
    "Therapist: You're very resilient, Maria. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. But maybe a little lighter? Talking about it... it's hard, but maybe it helps? My distress... it's probably around 60 now.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. You've done very well today.",
    "Client: Gracias, doctor. I... I never thought I could talk about this. It's still painful, but... maybe there's hope? Maybe one day I can walk down the street again without fear.",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal to work towards. Shall we end here for today?",
    "Client: S\u00ed, I think so. I'm exhausted, but... thank you. For listening, for helping me face this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Maria. You've shown great courage today."
