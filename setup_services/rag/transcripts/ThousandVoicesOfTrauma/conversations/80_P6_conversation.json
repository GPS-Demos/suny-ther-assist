    "Therapist: Okay, John. Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the workplace incident.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm in the office. It's a Tuesday morning, and I can smell coffee. My boss walks in, looking angry. He starts yelling about a report I submitted yesterday. His face is red, and he's pointing at me. I feel my heart racing, and my palms are getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: Uh, probably a 6 out of 10. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Keep going. You're doing well.",
    "Client: He's getting closer, still yelling. I can see the veins in his neck bulging. I'm trying to explain, but he won't let me speak. I feel so small, like I'm shrinking in my chair. My mouth is dry, and I'm having trouble swallowing.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to an 8. I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Stay with the memory. You're safe here.",
    "Client: He's slamming his hand on my desk now. Papers are flying everywhere. I flinch with each slam. My colleagues are watching, but no one's helping. I feel so alone and humiliated. My eyes are stinging; I think I'm about to cry.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: Still an 8... maybe 8.5. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: He's telling me I'm useless, that I'll never amount to anything. His words feel like physical blows. I want to disappear, to melt into the floor. My vision is blurry, and there's a ringing in my ears. I can barely focus on what he's saying anymore.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can continue. It feels too real.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Can you stay with it a bit longer?",
    "Client: I'll try... The yelling stops suddenly. He's glaring at me, waiting for a response. But I can't speak. My throat feels closed up. The silence is deafening. Everyone's staring at me. I feel so exposed, so... worthless.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7? I'm starting to remember I'm here with you.",

    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6 now. I'm feeling a bit calmer.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. You're processing this well.",
    "Client: Thanks... The memory is fading now. I can feel myself back in this room with you. My breathing is slowing down, but my hands are still shaky.",
    "Therapist: What's your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's about a 4 now. I feel drained, but... okay.",
    "Therapist: You did wonderfully, John. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... kind of relieved? It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.",
    "Therapist: That's common. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves before we discuss further."
