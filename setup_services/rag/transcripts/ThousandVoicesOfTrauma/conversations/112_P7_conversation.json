    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the scene?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in my childhood home. It's late at night, and I can hear shouting from downstairs. My heart is racing, and I'm trying to stay quiet in my room.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: I can hear my father's voice getting louder. There's a crash, like something being thrown. My mom is crying. I'm so scared, I want to help her, but I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) I... I can't. It's too much. I feel like I'm back there again.",
    "Therapist: You're brave for facing this. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (inhales deeply) Okay... I remember creeping down the stairs. I can see my father towering over my mom. She's on the floor, crying. There's a broken vase nearby.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: My father turns and sees me. His eyes are so angry. I've never seen him like this before. I want to run, but I can't move.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're here, in the present.",
    "Client: He starts yelling at me to go back to my room. I'm shaking, tears running down my face. I look at my mom, and she just nods at me to go. I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: I run back upstairs, my heart pounding. I can still hear them arguing. I curl up in my bed, covering my ears, wishing it would all stop. I feel so alone and scared.",
    "Therapist: You're not alone now. Keep going.",
    "Client: The shouting continues for what feels like hours. Eventually, it gets quiet. I'm too afraid to check on my mom. I just lie there, wide awake, wondering if it will happen again tomorrow.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) It's... it's hard. I feel drained, but also a bit relieved. Like I've let out something I've been holding in for years.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You did well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I didn't think I could get through it, but somehow I did. It still hurts, but maybe a little less now.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. We'll end here for today."
