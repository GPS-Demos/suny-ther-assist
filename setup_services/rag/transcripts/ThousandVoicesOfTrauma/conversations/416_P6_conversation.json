    "Therapist: Alright, let's begin the imaginal exposure. Can you close your eyes and describe the memory of your relationship breakup?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm sitting in our living room. The air feels heavy. My partner is across from me, looking... distant. I can feel my heart racing already.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 5 or 6.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: He's telling me it's over. His words are like knives. I feel... I feel like I can't breathe. The room is spinning. I want to scream, but no sound comes out.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's happening in your body?",
    "Client: My chest is so tight. My hands are shaking. I... I feel like I'm going to be sick.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. God, this feels awful.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm trying to understand why. Why now? After everything we've been through. I feel so betrayed, so... worthless. It's bringing up all these feelings from when I was a kid, you know? Like I'm not good enough, never have been.",
    "Therapist: I hear you. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm crying now. In the memory, I mean. I can feel the tears on my face. My throat hurts from trying not to sob. I just want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: Still an 8... maybe edging towards 9.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I watch him pack a bag. Each item he takes feels like he's tearing a piece of me away. I'm begging him to stay, to talk about it. But he's so cold, so distant. It's like I don't even know him anymore.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in this moment?",
    "Client: That I'll never be happy again. That I'm going to be alone forever. That maybe... maybe if I had been better, this wouldn't be happening.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down a bit. Maybe a 7 now.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Keep describing what's happening.",
    "Client: He's at the door now. I'm on the floor, just... broken. I can't even stand. As he leaves, it's like all the air is sucked out of the room. I can't breathe. I'm gasping, crying. I feel so small, so insignificant.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's your body doing?",
    "Client: I'm curled up in a ball. My whole body is shaking. I feel nauseous, dizzy. Like the world is ending.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's back up to an 8. This is so hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I don't know how long I stay there. Hours, maybe. I can't move. Can't think. It's like I'm not even real anymore. Just this... this hollow shell of pain.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: That I'm not worthy of love. That I'll never trust anyone again. That maybe... maybe I deserve this pain.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down. Maybe a 6 now.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this well.",
    "Client: I finally get up. The apartment feels so empty. I go to our... his room. His closet is half empty. It hits me all over again. I collapse on the bed, surrounded by his scent. I feel so alone, so abandoned.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel now?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Drained. Like I've been hit by a truck. My eyes hurt from crying. My throat is raw.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 5 now. I feel... I don't know. Sad, but... calmer?",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're doing great. Let's start to wrap up. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *takes a deep breath* Okay. I'm... I'm back in the room with you now.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel?",
    "Client: Drained, but... okay. Like I've survived something.",
    "Therapist: You have. You did really well today."
