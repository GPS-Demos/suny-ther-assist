    "Therapist: Mrs. Patel, today we'll begin imaginal exposure. Are you ready to discuss this?",
    "Client: I suppose so, but I'm not entirely sure what that means. Can you explain it to me? I'm feeling a bit nervous about trying something new at my age.",
    "Therapist: Of course. It's a technique to help process traumatic memories. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: Well, to be honest, I'm quite apprehensive. I've spent so many years trying to forget about the neglect and violence I experienced. The idea of bringing it all up again is... unsettling. Will it make things worse?",
    "Therapist: Your concern is valid. How do you typically cope with difficult memories?",
    "Client: Oh, I usually try to keep busy. I'll clean the house, or work in my small garden. Sometimes I'll call my niece, though I don't like to burden her with my problems. But lately, even these distractions aren't working as well as they used to. The memories seem to be getting more persistent, especially at night when I'm trying to sleep.",
    "Therapist: I see. How do you think facing these memories might help?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. Part of me hopes it might finally give me some peace, but another part is terrified of reliving those experiences. What if I can't handle it? What if I break down completely?",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. We'll go at your pace. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Well, what exactly will I have to do? And how long will this process take? I'm worried about dredging up all these old feelings and then being left to deal with them on my own. Living alone, sometimes the silence can be overwhelming, and I fear it might be worse after sessions like this.",
    "Therapist: You'll describe a memory while I guide you. We'll work together throughout. What support do you have at home?",
    "Client: That doesn't sound too bad, I suppose. As for support, well, it's mainly just me. My niece calls regularly, and I have a few friends from my community center, but they don't know about my past. I've always been too ashamed to share it with anyone. I guess that's why I'm here now, trying to finally face it all.",
    "Therapist: Your willingness to open up is a big step. How can we make you feel safe during our sessions?",
    "Client: I appreciate that, thank you. I think it would help if we could take breaks when needed. And perhaps... could I bring something comforting with me? I have this small statue of Ganesha that's always brought me peace. Would it be alright to hold it during our sessions?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Breaks and comfort objects are welcome. Anything else you need?",
    "Client: That's a relief, thank you. I think just knowing that you'll be here to guide me through it helps. I've kept these memories bottled up for so long, it's both frightening and somewhat liberating to know I'll finally be sharing them. Is it normal to feel this mix of dread and hope?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's very normal. Your feelings are valid. Shall we schedule our first exposure session?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm ready to try. It won't be easy, but I understand now why it's important. Could we perhaps start with a shorter session at first? Just to ease into it? And maybe end with some of those breathing exercises you taught me? They've been quite helpful in managing my anxiety.",
    "Therapist: Excellent suggestion. We'll start small and end with grounding techniques. How does next Tuesday sound?",
    "Client: Tuesday works well for me. I'll make sure to clear my schedule for the rest of the day, just in case I need some time to recover afterwards. Thank you for your patience with me, dear. It means a lot to have someone listening without judgment after all these years.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your resilience is inspiring. See you Tuesday. Take care, Mrs. Patel.",
    "Client: Thank you, I'll do my best. See you on Tuesday, and I'll be sure to bring my Ganesha statue. Have a good week, and thank you again for your kindness and understanding."
