    "Therapist: Welcome back, Sarah. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I think so... I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control. Let's start when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay, I'm ready. I'll close my eyes and think about that day...",
    "Therapist: Good. Take your time. What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 4 out of 10. I'm tense, but not overwhelmed yet.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Go ahead and describe what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: I'm back in the barracks. It's dark, and I can hear the distant sound of explosions. My heart is starting to race a little...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm walking down the hallway, and I can smell the musty odor of old buildings. My palms are getting sweaty, and I'm starting to feel a knot in my stomach.",
    "Therapist: How would you rate your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to about a 6. I'm feeling more anxious, and my breathing is getting faster.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: I... I see him coming towards me. He's bigger than me, and I feel so small and powerless. My throat is tightening, and I'm starting to feel dizzy.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: He's... he's grabbing my arm. I can feel his rough hands, and I want to scream, but no sound comes out. My whole body is shaking now.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep breathing. What are you noticing in your body?",
    "Client: My heart is pounding so hard, I think it might burst out of my chest. I feel nauseous, and my legs are weak. I... I can't move.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: He's... he's pushing me against the wall. I can feel the cold concrete on my back. I'm frozen, I can't fight back. I feel so ashamed and helpless.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. This is just a memory. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I can't. It's too much. I feel like I'm going to pass out.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I... I need a moment. Can we pause?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take a break. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My heart is still racing, but I think I'm starting to calm down a little.",
    "Therapist: That's good. What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's coming down... maybe a 7 now. I still feel anxious, but not as overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: You did really well. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: I... I think I can try. It's hard, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: Okay. When you're ready, let's continue where we left off.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm back in that hallway. He's... he's touching me, and I feel so dirty and helpless. I want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What are you noticing in your body?",
    "Client: My skin is crawling. I feel nauseous, and there's this heavy weight on my chest. I can barely breathe.",

    "Therapist: How does that affect your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 6 now. I still feel shaky and scared, but also relieved.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. How do you feel about what we've done today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. Scary. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I faced something I've been avoiding for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How would you rate your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 4. I feel drained, but also a bit proud of myself.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You did amazing work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was hard, but... I think it helped. I feel like I understand my reactions better now.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. Let's end here and discuss how to care for yourself after this intense session."
