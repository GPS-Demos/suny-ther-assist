    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit shaken, to be honest. It's always intense reliving that accident. The screeching tires, the impact... it all feels so real again. But I think I managed better this time. I didn't feel as overwhelmed as before.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What stood out to you today?",
    "Client: Well, I noticed that I was able to breathe through some of the tougher moments. Like when I was describing the moment of impact, I could feel my heart racing, but I remembered to focus on my breathing. It helped me stay present and not get completely swept away by the memory.",
    "Therapist: Excellent observation. How did that feel?",
    "Client: It felt... empowering, I guess. Like I had a bit more control. Don't get me wrong, it was still difficult, but I didn't feel as helpless as I usually do when thinking about the accident.",
    "Therapist: That's significant. How does this relate to your daily life?",
    "Client: I've been thinking about that. You know, I've been avoiding driving since the accident, but maybe... maybe I could start small. Like, sitting in a parked car for a few minutes. If I can use the breathing techniques there, it might help.",
    "Therapist: That's a great idea. What else?",
    "Client: Well, there's something else that's been bothering me lately. It's not directly related to the accident, but... I've been experiencing some cyber bullying at work. It's bringing up a lot of those same feelings of helplessness and fear.",
    "Therapist: I see. How so?",
    "Client: It's like... the constant fear of what might pop up next in my inbox or on social media. It reminds me of that feeling right before the crash, you know? That moment of dread, knowing something bad is about to happen but feeling powerless to stop it.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful connection. How are you coping?",
    "Client: Not great, to be honest. I've been drinking more than usual to numb out. I know it's not healthy, but it feels like the only way to quiet my mind sometimes. Especially after a day of dealing with nasty comments or veiled threats online.",
    "Therapist: I understand. What might help?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe applying some of the techniques we've been working on here? Like the breathing exercises, or maybe even trying to face the situation head-on instead of avoiding it?",
    "Therapist: That sounds promising. What's your next step?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to talk to HR about the cyber bullying. It's scary, but I can't keep living in fear like this. And maybe I can try using some grounding techniques when I feel overwhelmed by it all, instead of reaching for a drink.",
    "Therapist: Excellent plan. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: A bit lighter, actually. Talking about it helps. And knowing that I have tools to deal with these feelings... it gives me hope. I'm still scared, but I feel like maybe I can handle it. Like maybe I'm stronger than I thought.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful progress. Anything else?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm finally starting to see a way forward. Both with the accident trauma and this new challenge at work. It's all connected, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: It often is. What's your takeaway today?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's that I'm not helpless. In the accident, in the face of bullying, in my recovery... I have more control than I realized. And that's huge for me. It's like a weight lifting off my chest.",
    "Therapist: Beautiful insight. How will you reinforce this?",
    "Client: I'm going to write it down. Maybe put a note on my mirror or something. \"I am not helpless.\" And I'll try to remind myself of that when things get tough. Use my breathing, use my grounding techniques. And reach out for help when I need it, instead of turning to alcohol.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a solid plan. Ready to wrap up?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I feel... tired, but in a good way. Like I've done some real work today. Thank you again. I'm actually looking forward to our next session, as hard as these can be sometimes.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work. See you next time."
