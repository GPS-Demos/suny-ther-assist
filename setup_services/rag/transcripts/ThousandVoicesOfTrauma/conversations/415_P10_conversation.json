    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Patel. How are you feeling about our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. There's a knot in my stomach. I've been dreading this all week, to be honest. It's hard to face these memories.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to help you process these experiences. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. As ready as I'll ever be.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in the hospital. The fluorescent lights are so harsh. I can smell the disinfectant. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's happening?",
    "Client: The doctor just walked in. His face is grim. I know something's wrong. My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: About... about 60, I'd say.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath and continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: He's telling me... he's saying I have cancer. Stage 4. I... I can't breathe. The room is spinning.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with the memory. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I... I'm thinking about my parents. They're in their 90s. Who will take care of them if I'm gone? I feel so... so helpless.",
    "Therapist: Allow yourself to feel those emotions. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I start to cry. The doctor is still talking, but I can't hear him. It's like I'm underwater.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 75.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going. What happens after the doctor finishes speaking?",
    "Client: I... I stumble out of the office. My legs feel weak. I make it to my car, but I can't drive. I just sit there, sobbing.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. I can't catch my breath. My hands are shaking so badly.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Take a deep breath. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... okay...",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I call my sister. I can barely get the words out. She's saying something, but I can't focus. All I can think is, \"This is it. This is how I die.\"",
    "Therapist: Stay with those thoughts. What else are you feeling?",
    "Client: Anger. So much anger. Why me? I've always taken care of myself. It's not fair!",
    "Therapist: Allow yourself to feel that anger. What do you do with it?",
    "Client: I... I start hitting the steering wheel. I'm screaming. I don't care if anyone sees me.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's 85. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're safe here. Continue with what happens next.",
    "Client: I... I finally calm down enough to drive home. The whole way, I'm in a daze. I keep thinking about my parents. How will I tell them?",
    "Therapist: What do you see when you get home?",
    "Client: My parents are in the living room. They look so... so frail. My mother asks if I'm okay. I... I can't tell them. Not yet.",
    "Therapist: What do you do instead?",
    "Client: I lie. I say I'm not feeling well and go to my room. I feel like such a coward.",
    "Therapist: It's okay. You were processing a lot. What happens in your room?",
    "Client: I collapse on the bed. I can't stop crying. I feel so alone, so scared.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking about all the things I'll never do. I'll never get married, never have children. I'll never see my parents' 100th birthday. It's all being taken away from me.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's 90 now. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Take another deep breath. Remember, you're here now, you're safe.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... okay...",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I spend the whole night researching. Looking up survival rates, treatment options. Everything looks so bleak.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Hopeless. Completely hopeless. I feel like my life is over before it really began.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What does hopelessness feel like in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's heavy. Like a weight on my chest. I can barely move.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What happens the next morning?",
    "Client: I... I have to tell my parents. I can hear them in the kitchen. I'm dreading it so much.",
    "Therapist: What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I force myself to get up. My legs feel like lead. I walk to the kitchen. They look so... so happy. I'm about to destroy their world.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's 95. This is the worst part.",
    "Therapist: You're almost through it. Take another deep breath. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I tell them. My mother starts wailing. My father just... just sits there, stunned. I feel like I've killed them.",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly difficult. How do you feel in that moment?",
    "Client: Guilty. So, so guilty. And scared. I'm supposed to be taking care of them, not the other way around.",
    "Therapist: Allow yourself to feel those emotions. What happens after you tell them?",
    "Client: My mother hugs me. She's crying so hard. My father joins in. We're all just... just holding each other.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What sensations do you feel?",
    "Client: Warmth. Despite everything, I feel... I feel loved. But also so, so sad.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to 80 now.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this well. What happens next?",
    "Client: We... we start talking about treatment options. My parents are so strong. They're trying to be positive for me.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Grateful. But also... also guilty. They shouldn't have to deal with this at their age.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have mixed feelings. What do you do after the conversation?",
    "Client: I go back to my room. I'm exhausted. But I feel... I feel a little less alone.",
    "Therapist: That's good. How are you feeling now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. But also... also a little relieved. Like I've shared some of the burden.",
    "Therapist: Your final SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to 65 now.",
    "Therapist: Well done, Mrs. Patel. You've done incredibly well today. How are you feeling about the session?",
    "Client: It was... it was hard. But I feel like I've faced something I've been avoiding for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Remember, each time we do this, it will get a little easier. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we end?",
    "Client: No, I... I think I need some time to process all of this.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take care of yourself for the rest of the day. We'll talk more about this in our next session."
