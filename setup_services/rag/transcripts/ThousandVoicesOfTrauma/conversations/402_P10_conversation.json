    "Therapist: Welcome, Fatima. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about the accident at my work-study job, and just thinking about it makes my heart race a little.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 6 out of 10 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath, and when you're ready, describe the day of the accident.",
    "Client: (inhales deeply) Alright... It was a Tuesday afternoon. I remember because I had just finished my chemistry lab. I was working at the campus coffee shop, and it was pretty busy. The smell of coffee was strong, and there was this constant chatter of students...",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay in that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I was carrying a tray of hot drinks to a table. My hands were shaking a bit because I was tired from my lab. As I approached the table, I felt my foot catch on something. I tried to regain my balance, but... (voice trembles) it all happened so fast.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What do you see and hear as this is happening?",
    "Client: I see the drinks tipping, hear the gasps from nearby students. There's this horrible moment where I know I can't stop it. The hot liquid... it's spilling everywhere. I can feel the heat on my hands, and... oh God, the screams. A girl at the table, the coffee landed right in her lap.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Panic. Pure panic. My heart is pounding so hard I can hear it in my ears. I'm frozen for a second, watching the girl jump up, her face contorted in pain. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) It's... it's an 8. Maybe even a 9.",
    "Therapist: Take a slow, deep breath. You're safe here, Fatima. This is just a memory.",
    "Client: (inhales shakily) Okay... okay. I'm trying.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens after the spill?",
    "Client: Everything's chaos. My manager rushes over. He's yelling something, but I can barely hear him over the commotion. The girl is crying, her friends are trying to help her. I'm just standing there, useless. I want to help, but I'm paralyzed.",
    "Therapist: Focus on your body. What physical sensations do you notice?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking uncontrollably. My chest feels tight, like I can't get enough air. There's this cold sweat breaking out all over my body. And my stomach... it's in knots.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I've ruined everything. I'm going to get fired. What if the girl is badly hurt? It's all my fault. I'm so stupid, so clumsy. I don't deserve this job. Everyone's staring at me, judging me. I want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: Remember, these are just thoughts. They're not facts. Continue with what happens next.",
    "Client: My manager tells me to go to the back room. As I'm walking away, I can hear people whispering. I feel like everyone's eyes are on me. In the back room, I just... I break down. I'm sobbing, I can barely catch my breath. I'm terrified of what's going to happen next.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's still high... maybe an 8.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Fatima. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Look around the room and name three things you see.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) Okay... I see the blue chair, the plant by the window, and your bookshelf.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, continue with what happened after you went to the back room.",
    "Client: I'm sitting there, trying to pull myself together. My coworker, Sarah, comes in. She looks worried. She tells me the girl is okay, just a bit burned, and they've called for medical help. I feel a tiny bit of relief, but I'm still so ashamed.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I ask Sarah if I should go out and apologize. She says to wait for the manager. So I just sit there, feeling useless and scared. Every minute feels like an hour. I keep replaying the accident in my head, thinking of all the ways I could have prevented it.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you're waiting?",
    "Client: Tense. So tense. My shoulders are up to my ears, and my jaw is clenched tight. My stomach is still in knots, and I feel lightheaded. I realize I'm holding my breath a lot, so I try to breathe, but it comes out shaky.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath now, Fatima. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: (inhales and exhales audibly)",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens when your manager comes in?",
    "Client: He walks in, and I immediately start apologizing. The words just tumble out. I'm saying I'm sorry over and over, telling him I'll pay for any damages, begging him not to fire me. He looks... tired. He tells me to calm down, that accidents happen.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel hearing that?",
    "Client: Surprised... and still scared. I don't quite believe him. I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop, for him to tell me I'm fired or that the girl is pressing charges or something.",
    "Therapist: What does he say next?",
    "Client: He... he asks if I'm okay. If I'm hurt. I hadn't even thought about myself. I realize my hands are a bit red from the hot liquid, but I tell him I'm fine. He says I should go home, that we'll talk tomorrow. I feel... numb. Like this isn't really happening.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's come down a bit... maybe a 6?",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this well. What do you do after leaving work?",
    "Client: I walk home in a daze. The campus looks the same, students are going about their day, but I feel like everything's changed. When I get to my apartment, my roommate asks why I'm home early. I just... I burst into tears again. I can't even get the words out.",
    "Therapist: How does your roommate react?",
    "Client: She's concerned. She sits me down, gets me some water. When I finally calm down enough to explain, she's really supportive. She keeps telling me it wasn't my fault, that accidents happen. But I can't shake this feeling of guilt and shame.",
    "Therapist: It's important to remember that accidents do happen, Fatima. How do you feel now, recounting all of this?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. My heart is still racing a bit, and I feel this heaviness in my chest. But it's not as overwhelming as it was when we started. I guess... I guess talking about it helps, even though it's painful.",
    "Therapist: You're showing a lot of strength. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: I'd say it's down to a 5. It's still there, but not as intense.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's take a moment to acknowledge how far you've come in this session.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Yeah... I made it through. I didn't think I could talk about it in so much detail without completely falling apart.",
    "Therapist: You did very well. How do you feel about the progress you've made today?",
    "Client: I feel... proud, I guess? And a little surprised. It's still hard to think about, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming as it did before. Maybe... maybe I can get past this.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude, Fatima. Remember, healing takes time, but you're on the right path.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I needed to hear that.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. As we wrap up, let's do one more grounding exercise. Name five things you can see in this room.",
    "Client: Okay... I see the clock on the wall, your degrees hanging up, the tissue box, the potted plant, and the painting of the ocean.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Calmer. Still a bit shaky, but definitely calmer than when we started.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Fatima. We'll continue working on this in our next session. Remember to use the coping strategies we've discussed if you feel overwhelmed between now and then.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you for helping me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
