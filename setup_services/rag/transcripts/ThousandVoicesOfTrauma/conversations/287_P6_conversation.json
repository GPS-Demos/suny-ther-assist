    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll give it a go.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day of the earthquake. Describe what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: I'm in my apartment. It's early morning, and I'm just getting ready for work. Suddenly, everything starts shaking. The walls are creaking, and I can hear things falling off shelves. My heart's racing, and I'm frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 5 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: The shaking's getting more intense. I'm trying to move, but I'm stumbling. I can hear car alarms going off outside and people screaming. I'm panicking, thinking the building might collapse. My palms are sweaty, and I'm having trouble breathing.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 7. My chest feels tight just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I manage to get under my desk, but things are falling all around me. There's a loud crash \u2013 I think it's my bookshelf toppling over. I'm curled up in a ball, shaking uncontrollably. I can smell dust and feel it in my throat. I'm terrified, thinking I might die here.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: I understand. You're doing great. Take a deep breath. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... The shaking starts to subside, but I'm too scared to move. I can hear sirens outside and people crying. My phone's ringing \u2013 probably my parents \u2013 but I can't bring myself to answer it. I'm just sitting there, trembling, covered in dust and surrounded by chaos.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: Still at an 8. My heart's pounding just talking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: I finally crawl out from under the desk. The apartment's a mess \u2013 broken glass everywhere, furniture overturned. I make my way to the window and see damaged buildings, people running in the streets. I feel so alone and helpless. I want to leave, but I'm afraid of aftershocks.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... actually down to a 6 now. Talking about it is helping a bit.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're processing it well. What happens next?",
    "Client: I gather some essentials in a backpack, hands shaking the whole time. As I'm about to leave, there's an aftershock. It's not as strong, but I panic all over again. I rush down the stairs, nearly falling. Outside, it's chaos \u2013 dust, debris, people crying and hugging each other.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level now?",
    "Client: Back up to a 7. Remembering that fear of not knowing what would happen next is intense.",
    "Therapist: That uncertainty can be frightening. You're doing well facing these memories.",
    "Client: Thanks. It helps to talk about it. I remember standing in the street, feeling so small and vulnerable. The ground had betrayed us, you know? Something we always thought was solid and dependable had suddenly become dangerous. It shook my sense of safety to the core.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: I'd say it's at a 5. Talking about it is draining, but also... I don't know, maybe a bit empowering?",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How about we start winding down the exercise?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think that would be good. I feel exhausted, but also a bit lighter, if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: It absolutely does. You've done excellent work today."
