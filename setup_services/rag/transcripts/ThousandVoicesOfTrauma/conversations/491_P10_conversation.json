    "Therapist: Welcome, Samantha. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to dive into some heavy stuff today, and part of me wants to just bolt out the door. But I'm here, and I'm trying to remind myself why I'm doing this.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your honesty. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Let's do this before I change my mind.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I'm in the mess hall. It's early morning, the air is thick with the smell of coffee and something greasy. I can hear the clatter of trays and muffled conversations. My hands are wrapped around a steaming mug, but I'm not really drinking it. I'm just... staring.",
    "Therapist: Good. What are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: Tense. So tense. My shoulders are like rocks, and there's this knot in my stomach that won't go away. I know we're heading out on patrol soon, and I can't shake this feeling of dread.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 60? It's building.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath and continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: We finish breakfast and head out to gear up. I'm putting on my vest, checking my weapon. It's all routine, but today it feels... different. Like I'm moving through molasses. Jenkins cracks a joke, trying to lighten the mood, but it falls flat. Nobody laughs.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I can't shake this feeling that something's going to go wrong. I want to tell someone, warn them, but I don't. I just... keep it all inside.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's creeping up. Maybe 70?",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here. What happens as you leave the base?",
    "Client: We pile into the Humvees. The air is already hot and dusty, even though it's early. I'm in the back, sandwiched between Torres and Miller. The radio crackles with chatter, but I'm barely listening. I'm scanning the road, my fingers twitching near my weapon.",
    "Therapist: What do you see as you're driving?",
    "Client: Dirt. Lots of dirt. And abandoned buildings. Everything looks... wrong. Too quiet. There are kids playing in the distance, but they stop and stare as we pass. I can feel their eyes on us, and it makes my skin crawl.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: We... we turn a corner, and suddenly there's a pop. Then another. Gunfire. Someone's shouting, but I can't make out the words. Everything's moving so fast, but also in slow motion. I'm returning fire, but I can't see where it's coming from. The air is filled with dust and the smell of cordite.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Samantha. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. Like 85, maybe 90.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay... okay. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: When you're ready, continue. What do you see happening around you?",
    "Client: Torres is hit. He's down, and there's so much blood. I'm trying to drag him behind cover, but he's heavy, and my hands are slippery. Miller's screaming for a medic, but it feels like no one can hear us over the gunfire. I can taste copper in my mouth, and I realize I've bitten my lip.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: Terrified. Angry. Helpless. I want to save Torres, but I also know I need to keep firing, to protect us. I feel like I'm being torn in two.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's maxed out. 100. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe with me. In... and out. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) It's... it's so real. I can smell the blood, the gunpowder...",
    "Therapist: I know it feels real, but remember, you're here in this room. What happens next?",
    "Client: The firefight seems to last forever, but it's probably only minutes. Suddenly, it's quiet. Too quiet. I'm still crouched over Torres, my hands pressed against his wound. He's... he's not moving. I'm calling his name, shaking him, but... nothing.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Numb. Like I'm watching it all happen to someone else. I can hear Miller sobbing nearby, but it sounds far away. Someone's pulling me back, telling me it's over, but I can't let go of Torres. I failed him. I failed everyone.",
    "Therapist: You didn't fail anyone, Samantha. You did everything you could. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 95. I feel like I'm going to be sick.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. Remember, you're safe here. What happens after that?",
    "Client: We... we load up the wounded. Torres is in a body bag. I'm moving on autopilot, helping where I can, but I feel disconnected from my body. The ride back to base is silent. No one talks. I keep replaying it all in my head, thinking of what I could have done differently.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those thoughts, but remember, you're not responsible for what happened. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Drained. Like I've lived a lifetime in just a few hours.",
    "Therapist: You've been through a lot. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe 80?",
    "Therapist: That's good. Can you tell me what happens when you get back to base?",
    "Client: We... we debrief. It's all a blur. I remember someone telling me I did a good job, but it feels hollow. How can I have done a good job when Torres is dead? After, I just... sit on my bunk, staring at nothing. I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see Torres' face.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction to trauma. How do you cope with those feelings in the moment?",
    "Client: I... I don't, really. I just push them down. Try to focus on the next mission, the next task. But it's always there, just under the surface.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's lower. Maybe 70? I feel drained, but also... I don't know. Like I've let some of it out.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well, Samantha. How are you feeling about the session?",
    "Client: It was... intense. Harder than I expected. But also... I feel like I've faced something I've been running from for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. You should be proud of yourself. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves before we end.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you... for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Remember, healing takes time. We'll continue to work through this together."
