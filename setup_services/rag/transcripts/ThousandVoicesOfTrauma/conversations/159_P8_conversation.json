    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I can still smell the gasoline and hear the screeching tires. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: I feel... scared. Vulnerable. Like it just happened yesterday, you know? I keep seeing the other driver's face, his eyes wide with panic. And then... the impact. God, the sound of metal crushing... it's deafening in my head.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What physical sensations are you noticing?",
    "Client: My hands are clammy. There's this tightness in my chest, like I can't get enough air. And my neck... it's so tense, just like it was after the accident. It's like my body remembers, even if I don't want it to.",
    "Therapist: I see. How do these sensations connect to your thoughts?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking, \"Why me?\" Why did I have to be on that road at that exact moment? And then I feel guilty for even asking that because I survived, and the other driver... he didn't. It's this cycle of fear and guilt that just won't stop.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really challenging. What else?",
    "Client: I'm angry too. Angry at the other driver for not paying attention, angry at myself for not being able to avoid it somehow. And then I feel ashamed for being angry at someone who lost their life. It's... it's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: How does this relate to your broader experience?",
    "Client: It's like... it's not just about the accident anymore. It's affected everything. I'm constantly on edge, waiting for the next bad thing to happen. I can't enjoy simple things like driving to the store or going for a walk. It's like the accident stole my peace, my sense of safety in the world.",
    "Therapist: I hear you. What thoughts come up about recovery?",
    "Client: Recovery... sometimes it feels impossible. Like I'm climbing this endless mountain. Some days I make progress, and others... it's like I'm right back at the bottom. But then I think about my family, how they need me to be present, and I want to fight. I want to get better for them, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful motivation. How does that feel?",
    "Client: It's... bittersweet, I guess. There's hope there, but also this pressure. What if I can't get better? What if I'm always haunted by this? But then I remember moments when I've felt okay, when I've laughed with my kids or enjoyed a meal with my wife, and I think maybe... maybe I can do this.",
    "Therapist: Those moments sound important. Can you elaborate?",
    "Client: Yeah, they're like... little lights in the darkness, you know? Like last week, I was playing with my grandson, and for a moment, I forgot about everything else. It was just pure joy. And afterwards, I realized I hadn't thought about the accident for hours. It felt... freeing.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful experience. What does it tell you?",
    "Client: I guess... it tells me that healing is possible. That the accident doesn't define me. It's a part of my story, sure, but it's not the whole story. There's still good in my life, still reasons to keep going. It's hard to remember that sometimes, but... it's there.",
    "Therapist: How does recognizing that impact you?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a weight lifting, just a little. Like maybe I can breathe a bit easier. Don't get me wrong, the fear and guilt are still there, but... there's something else too. Hope, maybe? Or determination? I'm not sure, but it feels... it feels like maybe I can face this after all.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant insight. What next?",
    "Client: I think... I want to focus on those good moments more. Maybe start a journal or something, to remind myself of the positive things when the memories get overwhelming. And... I want to talk to my wife about this. She's been so supportive, but I've been shutting her out. Maybe... maybe letting her in more could help.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful plan. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired, honestly. Emotionally drained. But there's also this weird sense of... I don't know, accomplishment? Like I've faced something really difficult and come out the other side. It's not over, I know that, but... I feel like I've taken a step forward. It's scary, but also... kind of empowering.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to process. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I think... I just need a moment. To breathe, to let all of this settle. And maybe... maybe to remind myself that it's okay to feel all of these things. That it's part of healing. Is that... is that alright?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Take your time. We're here to support you.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I appreciate that more than you know. It's not easy, but... I'm glad I'm doing this. I think... I think it's helping. Even if it doesn't always feel like it in the moment, I can see that I'm making progress. Slow progress, but... it's something.",
    "Therapist: Your resilience is remarkable. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think that would be good. I've got a lot to think about, but... I feel okay. Not great, but... okay. And right now, that feels like a win. Thank you for guiding me through this. It means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and we'll continue next time."
