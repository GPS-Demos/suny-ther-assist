    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, John?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, to be honest. Going through that memory of my accident and the aftermath... it's like I was right back there in that hospital room, you know? The beeping machines, the smell of antiseptic, the constant fear... It's all so vivid.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. I felt so trapped, both physically and emotionally. I kept reliving the moment when the doctor told me about the complications, and how it might affect my ability to work. I saw my whole life crumbling before my eyes. And then... then I thought about Sarah, my wife, and how this would impact her. God, I felt so guilty.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to share that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. Scary, but also... I don't know, maybe a little liberating? Like, I've been carrying this weight for so long, and finally letting it out... it's exhausting, but also kind of a relief. Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. Can you tell me more about that relief?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... for the first time, I'm not just pushing it down or trying to ignore it. I'm facing it head-on. And yeah, it's terrifying, but there's also this tiny voice in the back of my head saying, \"You're doing it. You're actually confronting this.\" It's a strange mix of pride and fear, I guess.",
    "Therapist: How do you think this relates to your overall recovery?",
    "Client: I... I think it's a big step. For so long, I've been avoiding anything that reminds me of the accident. It's affected my work, my relationships... especially with Sarah. But going through this, as hard as it is, makes me feel like maybe I can start to take control again. Maybe I can stop letting this trauma rule my life.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight, John.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's just... it's not easy, you know? Every time we do this, I worry I'll fall apart completely. But then I don't. I survive it. And maybe that's the point? That I can face these memories and still be okay?",
    "Therapist: How does that realization make you feel?",
    "Client: Stronger, I guess. A little braver. But also... scared. Because now I know I can do it, which means I have to keep doing it, right? Keep facing these memories? And that's... that's daunting.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. What helps you push forward?",
    "Client: Honestly? The thought of getting my life back. Being the husband Sarah deserves, the professional I used to be. And... and maybe finally being able to think about the future without this cloud of fear hanging over me. That's worth fighting for, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How can we build on this for next time?",
    "Client: I think... maybe we could dig a little deeper into the guilt I mentioned? About Sarah? It's something I've never really talked about, but it's always there, you know? And maybe... maybe addressing that could help me in my relationship with her now.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan, John.",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, I think so too. It's scary, but I'm starting to see that scary doesn't mean impossible. I just... I want to thank you. For guiding me through this. For not letting me give up when it gets tough. It means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work, John. I'm just here to support you.",
    "Client: Well, I appreciate it. I really do. I know we have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I might actually get there. Like I might actually beat this thing.",
    "Therapist: That's a great note to end on. We'll pick up here next week.",
    "Client: Sounds good. Thank you again. I'll see you next week."
