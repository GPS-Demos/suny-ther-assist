    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the bullying incident?",
    "Client: It was during my first year at university. I had just moved from my small town to the big city. I was so excited to start this new chapter of my life, but I felt out of place. One day, I was sitting alone in the cafeteria when a group of students approached me. They started making fun of my accent and the way I dressed. They called me a \"country bumpkin\" and laughed at me. I felt so humiliated and alone.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that memory.",
    "Client: I can still hear their laughter echoing in my ears. My face felt hot, and I wanted to disappear. I tried to ignore them, but they kept getting louder. Other students were starting to look our way, and I felt like everyone was judging me. I wanted to run away, but I was frozen in my seat.",
    "Therapist: That must have been difficult. Keep going.",
    "Client: One of them, a tall boy with dark hair, grabbed my textbook and started reading from it in a mocking tone, imitating my accent. The others were howling with laughter. I felt tears welling up in my eyes, but I was determined not to cry in front of them. My hands were shaking, and I could feel my heart pounding in my chest.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Remember, you're safe now.",
    "Client: I finally managed to gather my things and stand up. As I was leaving, one of the girls in the group stuck her foot out, and I tripped. My books scattered across the floor, and everyone in the cafeteria was staring at me. The group was laughing even harder now. I felt so small, so insignificant. I quickly picked up my things and ran out of there as fast as I could.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I ran all the way back to my dorm room and locked the door. I threw myself on the bed and cried for hours. I felt so alone and out of place. I wanted to call my parents, but I was too ashamed to tell them what had happened. I thought about quitting university and going back home. The thought of facing those bullies again terrified me.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's hard to talk about, but I feel a little lighter. Remembering it still hurts, but not as intensely as before. I'm realizing now that their behavior said more about them than it did about me. But at the time, it felt like my world was crumbling.",
    "Therapist: That's a valuable insight. Can you continue?",
    "Client: For weeks after that incident, I avoided the cafeteria. I'd eat alone in my room or find secluded spots on campus. Every time I saw that group in the hallways, my heart would race, and I'd take a different route. I started to isolate myself more and more. My grades began to suffer because I was too anxious to participate in class discussions. I was afraid of being mocked again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How did this affect you long-term?",
    "Client: It took me a long time to trust people again. Even now, at my age, I sometimes feel that insecurity creeping back when I'm in new social situations. I've always been a bit self-conscious about my background, and this incident really amplified those feelings. It made me doubt myself and my abilities for years.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling drained, but also a bit relieved. Talking about it helps me see how far I've come. Those bullies don't have power over me anymore, even though the memory still stings. I wish I could tell my younger self that it gets better, that those people's opinions don't define me.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. We'll end here for today.",
    "Client: Thank you. This wasn't easy, but I'm glad we did it. I feel like I'm starting to see this memory from a different perspective now. It's still painful, but I don't feel as overwhelmed by it as I used to. I'm looking forward to our next session.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Take care of yourself."
