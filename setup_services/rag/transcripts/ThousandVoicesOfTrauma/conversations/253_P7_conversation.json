    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit anxious, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about my experiences in the war zone, and it's making me nervous.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'll try to keep that in mind. Where should I start?",
    "Therapist: Begin with the day you fell ill in the field hospital.",
    "Client: Okay... It was a hot day in July. I remember the stifling heat in the tent. I was working my shift as a field medic when suddenly, I felt dizzy. At first, I thought it was just the heat, but then my vision started to blur. I tried to focus on the patient in front of me, but everything was spinning. I remember hearing someone shout my name, and then... darkness.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: When I came to, I was lying on a cot. The first thing I noticed was the overwhelming smell of antiseptic. It was so strong, it made me nauseous. I tried to sit up, but my body felt like lead. That's when I realized something was seriously wrong. I could hear the chaos around me - other patients moaning, doctors shouting orders. But I felt so isolated, like I was trapped in my own body.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I remember feeling so helpless. I was used to being the one helping others, and suddenly I was the patient. The doctor came over and told me I had contracted a severe form of malaria. They weren't sure if I was going to make it. I've never felt so scared in my life. The thought of dying there, so far from home, from my family... it was overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to talk about. The next few days were a blur of fever and pain. I remember hallucinating, seeing things that weren't there. At one point, I thought I saw my husband standing next to my bed, but when I reached out, there was nothing but air. The loneliness was crushing.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: The worst part was the uncertainty. Every time I woke up, I didn't know if I was getting better or worse. The doctors and nurses around me seemed worried, which only increased my fear. I kept thinking about my life back home, wondering if I'd ever see it again. The sound of gunfire and explosions in the distance was a constant reminder of where I was and the danger surrounding us.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job describing this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling shaky. My heart is racing, and I can almost smell that antiseptic again. But I also feel a bit relieved to be talking about it. It's like a weight is slowly lifting.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... As the days passed, I slowly started to improve. The fever broke, and I began to regain my strength. But the fear didn't go away. Every time I closed my eyes, I was back in that moment of terror, thinking I was going to die. Even as I recovered physically, I felt like a part of me was still trapped in that hospital bed.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How do you feel about sharing this?",
    "Client: It's difficult, but also... liberating? I've never really talked about this in detail before. It's bringing up a lot of emotions, but I think it's helping me process what happened.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Would you like to continue?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. After about two weeks, I was well enough to be evacuated. The relief of leaving was overwhelming, but so was the guilt. I felt like I was abandoning my unit, my patients. As the transport plane took off, I remember looking down at the camp getting smaller and smaller. I felt a mix of gratitude for surviving and deep sadness for those I was leaving behind.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have mixed feelings. You're doing well.",
    "Client: The journey home was long and uncomfortable. Every bump of the plane reminded me of how weak I still was. When I finally arrived home, seeing my husband at the airport... I broke down. All the emotions I had been holding back just came pouring out. I was so happy to be home, but also terrified. I kept thinking, 'What if I'm not the same person anymore?'",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. You're not alone in this.",
    "Client: Thank you. It helps to hear that. The recovery at home was slow. Physically, I got better, but mentally... I struggled. I had nightmares about the hospital, about dying alone in that tent. I felt guilty for leaving, guilty for getting sick in the first place. It took a long time for me to accept that what happened wasn't my fault.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable resilience. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but also a bit lighter. Talking about this is hard, but I think it's helping. I've never really put it all into words like this before.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. We'll stop here for today.",
    "Client: Thank you. This session was intense, but I'm glad we did it. I feel like I'm starting to understand my experiences better. Is it normal to feel both exhausted and somewhat relieved?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. That's a common reaction.",
    "Client: Okay, good to know. I appreciate your support throughout this. It makes a big difference knowing I'm in a safe space to talk about these difficult memories.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue next week."
