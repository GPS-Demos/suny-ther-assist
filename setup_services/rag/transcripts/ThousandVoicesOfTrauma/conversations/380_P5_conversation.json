    "Therapist: Welcome back. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm honestly quite nervous. I've been dreading this all week. The idea of revisiting those memories... it's overwhelming. I'm not sure I can handle it.",
    "Therapist: Your anxiety is understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about losing control. What if I can't stop reliving the violence I witnessed? It's been years, but sometimes it feels like yesterday. I don't want to fall apart in front of you.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your honesty. How can I support you today?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. Maybe... could you explain again why we're doing this? I know you've told me before, but I need reassurance that this isn't just pointless suffering.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Imaginal exposure helps process trauma memories. It can reduce PTSD symptoms over time. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: I understand the theory, but it's hard to believe reliving it will help. Won't it just make things worse? I've spent so long trying to forget.",
    "Therapist: Valid concern. Initially, it may be distressing. But with practice, the memory's power often diminishes. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It makes sense, I suppose. But I'm still scared. What if I freeze up or can't speak about it?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. We'll go at your pace. What might help you feel safer?",
    "Client: Maybe... could we have a code word if I need to stop? And could you remind me where I am if I seem too lost in the memory?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's use \"pause\" as our code word. I'll ground you as needed. Any other concerns?",
    "Client: I'm worried about how I'll feel afterwards. Will I be able to function normally? I have responsibilities at home and work.",
    "Therapist: Good point. How about we plan a calming activity for after our session?",
    "Client: That sounds helpful. Maybe I could take a walk in the park near my office. Being in nature usually helps me reset.",
    "Therapist: Excellent idea. Remember, you're in control. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm still nervous, but I trust you. And I want to get better, for myself and my family. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Shall we start with a breathing exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, please. That would help. And... thank you for being so patient with me. I know I'm not the easiest client.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's begin..."
