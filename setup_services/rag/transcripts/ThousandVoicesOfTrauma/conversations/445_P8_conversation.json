    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is buzzing, but my mind feels foggy. That memory of my supervisor yelling at me in front of everyone... it's still so vivid. I can feel my cheeks burning with embarrassment, just like they did that day.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What else are you noticing in your body right now?",
    "Client: My hands are clammy, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's hard to take a deep breath. I keep seeing everyone's faces, how they looked at me with pity or maybe even judgment. I felt so small in that moment, like I wanted the ground to swallow me up.",
    "Therapist: And what thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep hearing my supervisor's words echoing in my head. \"You're incompetent! How could you make such a stupid mistake?\" Part of me knows it wasn't fair, that everyone makes mistakes, but another part still believes I deserved it. I'm wondering if I really am incompetent, if I'll ever be good enough.",
    "Therapist: How does that belief affect you?",
    "Client: It... it paralyzes me sometimes. I second-guess every decision at work now. I'm constantly on edge, waiting for the next time I'll mess up and be humiliated. It's exhausting, and it's bleeding into my personal life too. I feel like I can't relax, even at home.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your emotions right now?",
    "Client: There's this deep sadness, like a heavy weight in my chest. But there's anger too, bubbling just beneath the surface. I'm angry at my supervisor for treating me that way, but I'm also angry at myself for not standing up for myself. And then there's this overwhelming shame that just washes over me when I think about that day.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your past experiences?",
    "Client: I... I never thought about it before, but it reminds me of how my parents would criticize me as a child. They were never satisfied with my achievements, always pointing out what I did wrong. I guess that's why this incident hit me so hard. It brought back all those feelings of never being good enough.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you make that connection?",
    "Client: It's like a light bulb moment, you know? I'm realizing that maybe my reaction to what happened at work isn't just about that specific incident. It's bringing up all these old wounds, this deep-seated belief that I'm fundamentally flawed. But at the same time, I'm feeling a glimmer of hope. Like maybe if I can work through these old feelings, the work incident won't have such a hold on me.",
    "Therapist: How does that glimmer of hope feel?",
    "Client: It's... refreshing. Like a cool breeze on a hot day. For so long, I've felt stuck in this cycle of self-doubt and fear. But now, I'm starting to see that maybe there's a way out. It's scary to think about confronting all these feelings, but there's also a sense of excitement. Like maybe I can finally break free from these patterns that have held me back for so long.",
    "Therapist: What do you think might be a first step?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I need to start challenging those negative thoughts when they come up. Like, when I hear my supervisor's voice in my head telling me I'm incompetent, maybe I can try to counter it with evidence of times I've succeeded. And maybe I need to be more compassionate with myself, the way I would be with a friend who was going through something similar.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to consider those steps?",
    "Client: It feels both daunting and empowering. There's a part of me that's afraid to hope, afraid of being disappointed if it doesn't work. But there's also this growing sense of determination. I'm tired of letting this incident and these old wounds control my life. I want to reclaim my confidence, my sense of self-worth. It's not going to be easy, but for the first time in a long time, I feel like it might be possible.",
    "Therapist: What support do you need moving forward?",
    "Client: I think I need to keep working on processing these memories and emotions in our sessions. But I also think I might need some practical tools to use in the moment when I'm feeling overwhelmed at work. And... I'm considering talking to my partner about this. I've been keeping it all bottled up, but maybe sharing with them could help me feel less alone in this.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about our session today?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but in a good way. Like I've finally started to unpack this heavy backpack I've been carrying around. There's still a lot to work through, but I feel like I've taken a significant step forward. Thank you for creating a safe space for me to explore all of this.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great courage today. We'll continue next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm nervous about what might come up next, but I'm also looking forward to it. See you next week."
