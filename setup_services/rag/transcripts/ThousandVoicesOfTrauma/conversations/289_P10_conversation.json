    "Therapist: Welcome, Raj. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. There's a lot going on in my head. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is... hesitant, I suppose. It's not easy to revisit these memories.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We'll take it step by step. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm standing in front of the police station. The building looks so imposing, all grey concrete and barred windows. My hands are shaking as I grip the summons paper. I can smell the exhaust from the busy street behind me, mixed with the scent of curry from a nearby restaurant. It's making my stomach churn.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I force myself to walk up the steps. Each step feels like I'm wading through molasses. My heart is pounding so hard I can hear it in my ears. I reach for the door handle, and it's cold against my sweaty palm. I pull it open, and the rush of air-conditioned air hits me. It smells sterile, like disinfectant.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um... probably a 6. It's... it's not easy being back here.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Right. Okay. I'm inside now. There's a desk sergeant looking at me with... with this bored expression. I stammer out why I'm there, showing him the summons. He barely glances at it before pointing me down a hallway. My legs feel weak as I walk. The fluorescent lights overhead are so harsh, making everything look washed out and unreal.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. Ashamed. I keep thinking about what my family would say if they knew. The disappointment in their eyes. I... I feel like I'm going to be sick.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. This is just a memory. Take another deep breath.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay. I'm at the end of the hallway now. There's a door with a small window in it. Through the window, I can see a small, bare room with a metal table and chairs. My mouth goes dry. This is it. This is where they're going to question me.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to an 8. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Raj. Stay with it. What happens when you enter the room?",
    "Client: The door creaks as I open it. The sound makes me flinch. Inside, the room is even smaller than it looked from outside. The walls are a sickly pale green, and there's a mirror on one wall that I know is two-way. I sit down in one of the chairs. The metal is cold and uncomfortable.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm sitting there, waiting. My palms are sweating so much I have to keep wiping them on my trousers. I can hear muffled voices and footsteps outside, but no one comes in. The clock on the wall ticks so loudly, it's like it's inside my head. Each second feels like an eternity.",
    "Therapist: How long do you wait?",
    "Client: It feels like hours, but the clock shows it's only been about 20 minutes. Then the door opens, and two officers walk in. One is older, with greying hair and a stern expression. The other is younger, maybe in his thirties. They both look at me like... like I'm nothing. Like I'm already guilty.",
    "Therapist: What do you feel when they look at you that way?",
    "Client: I feel... small. Worthless. Like maybe they're right, maybe I am guilty. Even though I know I didn't do anything wrong. My throat tightens up, and I can barely breathe.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe now. This is just a memory. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay. I'm okay. The older officer sits down across from me. He has a file in his hand, and he opens it slowly, like he's savoring the moment. The younger one remains standing, leaning against the wall with his arms crossed. The older one starts asking questions, his voice cold and accusatory.",
    "Therapist: What does he ask?",
    "Client: He asks about my relationship with... with the person who accused me. He twists my words, makes everything sound sinister. I try to explain, but he keeps cutting me off. The younger officer just stands there, watching. His silence is almost worse than the other one's questions.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm angry. Frustrated. Scared. My hands are clenched so tight under the table that my nails are digging into my palms. I want to shout, to defend myself, but I know that will only make things worse. I feel trapped, like the walls are closing in on me.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. This is... it's almost unbearable.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Raj. Remember, you're safe here. Can you ground yourself?",
    "Client: *deep breath* Yes, I... I can feel the chair beneath me. The carpet under my feet. I'm here, not there. Okay. I can continue.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next in the interrogation?",
    "Client: The questioning goes on for hours. They keep circling back to the same points, trying to trip me up. My mouth is so dry, but they won't give me water. The fluorescent light flickers occasionally, making me feel disoriented. I'm exhausted, my head is pounding, and I just want it to be over.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with the pressure?",
    "Client: I... I try to stay calm. I keep reminding myself that I'm innocent, that I have nothing to hide. But it's hard. Their words... they make me doubt myself. I start to wonder if maybe I did do something wrong without realizing it. The guilt and shame are overwhelming, even though I know I shouldn't feel this way.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. How does the interrogation end?",
    "Client: Finally, after what feels like an eternity, they tell me I can go. But the older officer... he leans in close and says, \"We'll be watching you. One wrong move, and you'll be back here.\" His breath smells like coffee and cigarettes. I feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8. The relief of it being over is there, but the fear and shame are still so strong.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a moment. How do you feel as you leave the station?",
    "Client: As I walk out, my legs are shaky. The sunlight outside is so bright it hurts my eyes. I feel... tainted somehow. Like everyone who looks at me can see what just happened. I want to run, to hide, but I force myself to walk normally. My car is parked nearby, and I practically fall into the driver's seat.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I sit there for a long time, just... trying to breathe. My hands are shaking so badly I can't even put the key in the ignition. I feel tears running down my face, but I can't stop them. I'm overwhelmed with this sense of... of injustice. Of helplessness. I didn't do anything wrong, but I feel like my whole life has just been torn apart.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to process. How are you feeling now, thinking back on this?",
    "Client: It's... it's still painful. But talking about it... it helps, somehow. Like I'm taking some of the power back from that memory. I still feel angry and hurt, but there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe relief? That I can talk about it now without completely falling apart.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Raj. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's come down to about a 6, I think. It's still there, but not as overwhelming as before.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well today. How do you feel about ending the exposure here?",
    "Client: I think... I think that's good. I feel drained, but also... lighter, somehow. Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after exposure. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you. This... this wasn't easy, but I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself, Raj. We'll continue working through this in our next session."
