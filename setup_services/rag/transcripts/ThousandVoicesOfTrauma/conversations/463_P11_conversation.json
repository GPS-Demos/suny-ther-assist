    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Rahul?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process, you know? Reliving that earthquake... it's like I was right back there. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. But also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved? It's hard to explain.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sounds, definitely. The rumbling of the earth, the crashing of things falling... and the screams. God, the screams. I remember holding onto my little sister so tightly, thinking we were going to die. It's funny, I hadn't thought about the smell in years, but it all came rushing back - the dust, the fear... it was so vivid.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. Scary, but not as overwhelming as I thought it would be. I kept reminding myself that I'm here now, safe in your office. It's strange, but I feel like I saw some things differently this time. Like, I realized how brave my parents were, keeping us all calm even though I'm sure they were terrified too.",
    "Therapist: That's an interesting observation. Can you tell me more?",
    "Client: Well, I've always focused on how scared I was, you know? But today, I really saw my dad's face as he was guiding us out of the building. He looked determined, focused. And my mom, she was singing softly to my sister the whole time. I never appreciated before how much they must have been struggling to keep it together for us kids.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization affect you now?",
    "Client: It's... comforting, in a way. Like, maybe I don't have to be so hard on myself for still being affected by this. If my parents, who I've always seen as these pillars of strength, were scared too... maybe it's okay that I still struggle sometimes. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How does this connect to your current symptoms?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe some of my anxiety isn't just about the earthquake itself, but about feeling like I should be \"over it\" by now. Like, when I have panic attacks during thunderstorms or when a truck rumbles by, I get so frustrated with myself. But if even my parents were affected, maybe it's more normal than I thought to still have these reactions.",
    "Therapist: That's a valuable insight. How might this change your approach?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I can be a bit kinder to myself when I do have those moments of panic. Instead of getting angry, I could try to remember that it's a normal response to a really traumatic event. And maybe... maybe I could try talking to my parents about it? I've always avoided the subject, but hearing their perspective might help.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive step. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's tough, not gonna lie. But I also feel like I'm finally starting to understand myself better. There's a part of me that's... almost excited? To see what else I might discover or work through. It's scary, but I think it's worth it.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... maybe we could explore more about how this has affected my relationship with my sister? We were so close during the earthquake, but we've drifted apart since. I wonder if there's a connection there.",
    "Therapist: That's a thoughtful idea. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... good. Like I've run a marathon or something. Emotionally drained, but also like I've accomplished something important. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today, Rahul. Take care of yourself this week.",
    "Client: I will, thank you. See you next time."
