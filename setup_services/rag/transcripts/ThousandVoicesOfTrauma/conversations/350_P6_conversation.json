    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your SUDS rating now.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10. My heart's beating a little faster than usual.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day on the airplane.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Alright. I'm... I'm sitting in my seat. The plane has just taken off. Everything seems normal at first. The seatbelt sign is still on, and I can feel the slight vibration of the engines.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud bang. The plane shakes violently. People start screaming. I... I can feel my heart racing now. The oxygen masks drop down. I'm fumbling to put mine on, my hands are shaking so much.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 7. I can feel my palms getting sweaty, and my chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The plane is losing altitude rapidly. I can see the ground getting closer through the window. Someone next to me is crying hysterically. I'm... I'm gripping the armrests so tightly my knuckles are white. I can't believe this is happening. I keep thinking about my family, wondering if I'll ever see them again.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Terrified. Just like I was then. My heart is pounding in my chest. I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's an 8 now. I feel so overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The plane is spiraling down. I can hear the engines screeching. The flight attendants are yelling instructions, but I can barely hear them over the noise. I'm praying, begging for it to stop. Then there's a massive jolt as we hit the ground. The impact is... it's indescribable. I'm thrown forward, my seatbelt cutting into me. There's smoke everywhere, and I can smell fuel.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I... I feel like I'm right back there. My heart is racing, and I'm shaking. I can almost smell the smoke and feel the heat.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I don't know if I can continue.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: (takes several deep breaths) Okay. After the impact, there's chaos. People are screaming, trying to get out. I'm struggling with my seatbelt, my fingers feel numb. I finally get it off and stumble into the aisle. The plane is filling with smoke, and I can barely see. I'm coughing, choking on the smoke. I'm pushing forward, desperately trying to find an exit.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel like I can't breathe. My chest is so tight. I'm sweating, and my hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's still at a 9. I feel so overwhelmed, just like I did then.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going if you can.",
    "Client: I... I finally see light ahead. It's an emergency exit. I'm pushing through the crowd, helping others along the way. We make it out onto the wing. The heat from the engines is intense. We're sliding down the inflatable slide. I hit the ground hard, scraping my knees. I'm running, stumbling away from the plane. I can hear explosions behind me. I don't stop running until I'm far away, collapsing on the ground, gasping for air.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. My heart is still racing, but I feel... I feel a bit of relief too. Like I've made it through again.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down to a 7. I still feel shaken, but not as overwhelmed as before.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You've done incredibly well. Let's start to bring you back to the present.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay. I'm... I'm starting to feel more grounded. My heart rate is slowing down.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little proud? I got through it.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. What's your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5 now. I'm feeling more calm, but still a bit shaky.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've made great progress today."
