    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the scene?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in the prison visiting room. It's cold and sterile. The guards are watching us closely. My father is sitting across from me, his eyes full of disappointment and anger. I feel so small, so ashamed.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: He starts berating me in hushed tones. \"How could you embarrass our family like this? You're weak. You've always been weak.\" I want to defend myself, but I can't speak. My throat feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I feel like I can't breathe. His words are suffocating me. I'm trying to hold back tears, but they're starting to fall. I'm so angry at myself for crying in front of him.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: He leans in closer and says, \"You're nothing but a disappointment. You'll never amount to anything.\" I feel my chest tightening, my hands are shaking. I want to run, but I'm frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: I manage to whisper, \"I'm sorry, Dad.\" But he just scoffs and stands up. He leaves without saying goodbye. I'm left there, feeling abandoned and worthless. The guard looks at me with pity, and that makes it even worse.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. My chest still feels tight, and I have this knot in my stomach. But there's also a sense of relief, like I've let go of something I've been holding onto for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've done excellent work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to talk about this, but I think it's helping. Sometimes I still hear his voice in my head, telling me I'm worthless. But being able to talk about it like this... it makes it feel less powerful somehow.",
    "Therapist: You're making great progress. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: I think I can go on. After he left, I remember sitting there for what felt like hours. The fluorescent lights were buzzing, and I could hear other inmates and visitors talking in the background. But I felt so alone, so isolated.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep describing what you remember.",
    "Client: I finally stood up, my legs felt weak. As I walked out, I caught a glimpse of myself in a reflective surface. I looked pale, defeated. I remember thinking, \"Maybe he's right. Maybe I am worthless.\" That thought stayed with me for years.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I walked out of the prison, and the sunlight felt too bright. Everything seemed surreal. I got in my car, but I couldn't drive right away. I just sat there, feeling numb. I wanted to cry, to scream, but nothing came out.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory very well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's strange. I feel sad, but also... lighter? Like I'm finally acknowledging how much that moment affected me. I've never really talked about this before.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. You're doing great work.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think... I think I need a break now. This is intense, but I'm glad we're doing this. It's hard, but I feel like I'm finally facing these memories instead of running from them.",
    "Therapist: That's perfectly okay. You've made excellent progress today."
