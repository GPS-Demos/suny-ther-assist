    "Therapist: Good afternoon, Carlos. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Honestly, doc, I'm a bit on edge. Been thinking about this all week, and I'm not sure I'm ready to dive into... you know, that stuff.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Can you rate your distress on a scale of 0-100?",
    "Client: Uh... probably around a 60? My stomach's in knots.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Let's start when you're ready. Remember to describe in present tense, as if it's happening now.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm... I'm at my cousin's house. It's a warm afternoon, and I can smell the grass that's just been cut. I'm supposed to be watching cartoons with my little cousin, but... but I hear shouting from the kitchen. It's my uncle and aunt.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see the old TV, flickering. My cousin's not paying attention, but I am. I'm straining to hear what they're saying. The voices are getting louder, and I'm... I'm getting scared.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: (Voice shaking) There's a crash. Like... like a plate breaking. My cousin starts crying, but I... I get up. I want to see what's happening. I shouldn't, but I can't help it.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Where are you in the house now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in the hallway. The kitchen door is slightly open. I can see... (pauses, breathing heavily)",
    "Therapist: It's okay, Carlos. You're safe here. Can you tell me your current SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 75 now. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're in control. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Swallows hard) I see my uncle. He's... he's got my aunt by the arm. He's shouting in her face. She looks so scared, and I... I feel helpless. I want to do something, but I'm just a kid. I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... why? Why is he doing this? I thought he loved her. I'm... I'm angry, but also terrified. What if he sees me? What if he comes after me next?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Carlos. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 80. My heart's racing.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Focus on your breathing. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Takes several deep breaths) Okay... I'm... I'm still watching. My aunt, she... she tries to push him away. But he's so much stronger. He slaps her. The sound... it's so loud. I flinch, and the door creaks.",
    "Therapist: What happens when the door creaks?",
    "Client: They both look at me. My uncle's face... it's like a mask of rage. My aunt, she looks... ashamed? Scared? I don't know. I want to run, but I can't move.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you feel in your body?",
    "Client: My legs are shaking. My mouth is dry. I feel like I might throw up. I want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Carlos. Remember, you're describing a memory. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (Nods, wiping sweat from his forehead) My uncle, he... he lets go of my aunt. He comes towards me. I back away, but I hit the wall. He grabs my arm, hard. It hurts. He's yelling at me, telling me to mind my own business, that this is adult stuff.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's 90. I can almost feel his grip on my arm.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave, Carlos. Remember, you're here in the office with me. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Breathes deeply) I... I nod at my uncle. I just want him to let go. My aunt, she's crying now. She tells him to leave me alone. He... he pushes me away. I stumble, almost fall. Then he turns back to my aunt. I... I run. I run back to the living room.",
    "Therapist: Good job staying with the memory. What are you feeling as you run?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm scared. Confused. Angry. I feel like a coward for running. I should have helped her, but... but I couldn't. I was too scared.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. You were a child in a difficult situation.",
    "Client: I get back to the living room. My cousin is still there, still crying. I... I don't know what to do. I sit down next to her, but I can't focus on the TV. All I can hear is the shouting from the kitchen.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm shaking. My stomach hurts. I feel... I feel sick. And helpless. So helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Carlos. Can you give me your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still around 85. It's not getting better.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. It's normal for it to stay high. Keep going when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Nods, takes a shaky breath) The shouting continues. I... I cover my cousin's ears. I want to protect her, even though I couldn't protect my aunt. Time... time seems to stretch out. I don't know how long we sit there.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: Eventually... eventually, it gets quiet. Too quiet. I'm scared to move. Then... then my aunt comes into the living room. Her... her face is red. She's been crying. She tries to smile at us, but it looks wrong. She tells us everything's okay, that we should keep watching TV. But I know... I know nothing's okay.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel towards your aunt in this moment?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel sorry for her. And angry. Why doesn't she leave him? Why does she let this happen? But... but I also understand. I'm scared of him too.",
    "Therapist: Those are complex feelings. It's okay to have them all at once.",
    "Client: (Nods) She... she sits down with us. Pretends to watch TV. But I can see her hands shaking. I want to say something, but I don't know what. So we just... we just sit there. Pretending everything's normal.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind as you sit there?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about how I'll never let anyone treat me or my family like that. I'm thinking about how I hate my uncle. And... and I'm scared. What if he comes after us next? What if this is my fault for watching?",
    "Therapist: Those are heavy thoughts for a child to carry. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 70. I think... I think talking about it is helping, even though it's hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job, Carlos. Do you want to continue or take a break?",
    "Client: I... I think I can keep going. (Takes a deep breath) We sit there for what feels like hours. My cousin eventually falls asleep. I wish I could sleep too, but I can't. I keep watching the door, waiting for my uncle to come in.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your body as you're watching the door?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tense. My shoulders are up to my ears. My hands are clenched. I feel like I can't breathe properly. Like the air is too thick.",
    "Therapist: Remember to take deep breaths. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Nods, takes a few deep breaths) Eventually... eventually, my mom comes to pick me up. She doesn't know what happened. My aunt acts like everything's fine. I... I don't say anything. I don't know if I should.",
    "Therapist: That must have been a difficult decision for a child.",
    "Client: It was. I... I felt like I was betraying my aunt by not saying anything. But I was also scared of what might happen if I did. On the way home, my mom asks if I had a good time. I... I lie. I say yes. But inside, I feel... I feel broken.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to talk about this now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. But also... I don't know, maybe a little freeing? Like I'm finally letting out this secret I've been carrying for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. Can you give me your final SUDS level?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's down to about 60 now. Still high, but... but better than before.",
    "Therapist: You've done an incredible job today, Carlos. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. But also... maybe a little proud? I didn't think I could talk about this, but I did.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You've shown great courage. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves before we end the session."
