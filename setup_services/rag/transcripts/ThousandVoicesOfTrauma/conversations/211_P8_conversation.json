    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. I can still see the cold, grey walls of that cell. The feeling of helplessness is overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you noticing right now?",
    "Client: My heart is pounding. I can feel it in my chest, and my hands are clammy. There's this tightness in my throat, like I can't swallow properly. It's hard to breathe normally.",
    "Therapist: And what thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"I shouldn't have been there. It wasn't fair.\" But then I wonder if maybe I deserved it somehow. Like, did I do something to bring this on myself? It's confusing and frustrating.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts make you feel emotionally?",
    "Client: Angry. So angry. But also... scared. It's like I'm right back there, feeling so small and powerless. And there's this deep sadness too, you know? Like something was taken from me that I can never get back.",
    "Therapist: Can you tell me more about that sadness?",
    "Client: It's... it's like mourning for the person I used to be. Before all this happened, I was confident, outgoing. Now, I feel broken. Like I'm carrying this heavy weight that I can't put down. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about how you're coping with these feelings now?",
    "Client: I... I guess I'm talking about it, which is something. Before, I'd just shut down or try to numb myself. But it's still so hard. Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning in these emotions.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you recognize that change in yourself?",
    "Client: It's strange. Part of me feels proud that I can face this now, even though it's painful. But there's also this fear... like, what if I can never fully move past this? What if I'm always going to be defined by what happened?",
    "Therapist: How does that fear affect you?",
    "Client: It makes me want to isolate myself. To protect myself from getting hurt again. But then I feel so lonely, and I miss the connections I used to have. It's this constant battle between wanting to reach out and wanting to hide.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in those moments of fear?",
    "Client: I... I think I need reassurance. That I'm not alone in this. That it's okay to feel scared, but also that I have the strength to get through it. Sometimes I forget that I've already survived the worst part.",
    "Therapist: How can you remind yourself of that strength?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe by acknowledging small victories? Like today, being able to talk about this without completely falling apart. Or when I manage to go out and socialize, even if it's just for a little while.",
    "Therapist: What else helps you feel grounded when these memories surface?",
    "Client: Deep breathing helps sometimes. And... this might sound silly, but touching something soft, like a blanket. It reminds me that I'm here, in the present, not back in that cold cell. And writing... getting the thoughts out of my head and onto paper.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about your progress in therapy so far?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of emotions. Some days I feel like I'm making real progress, like I can see a future where this doesn't consume me. Other days, it feels like I'm right back at the beginning. But overall, I think I'm moving forward. Slowly, but forward.",
    "Therapist: What gives you hope for your continued healing?",
    "Client: The fact that I can talk about it now, I suppose. That's huge for me. And... the moments when I realize I've gone a whole day without thinking about it. They're rare, but they happen. It's like glimpses of the person I could be, you know?",
    "Therapist: How does that vision of your future self look?",
    "Client: I see someone who's stronger, more resilient. Someone who can use this experience to help others, maybe. I want to be able to enjoy life again, to trust people. To feel... whole. Not defined by trauma, but shaped by how I've overcome it.",
    "Therapist: What small step can you take towards that vision this week?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I could try reaching out to an old friend. Just a text or something. Start rebuilding those connections I've been avoiding. It's scary, but... I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about setting that goal for yourself?",
    "Client: Nervous, definitely. But also... a little excited? It's been so long since I've allowed myself to look forward to something. It's a small step, but it feels significant.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to remember from our session today?",
    "Client: That I'm stronger than I often give myself credit for. That it's okay to have bad days, but also to celebrate the good ones. And that healing isn't linear, but I'm making progress, even when it doesn't feel like it.",
    "Therapist: Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I don't think so. This was... intense, but good. Thank you for guiding me through it. I feel drained, but also... lighter, somehow. Like I've put down a bit of the weight I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for your openness and courage today. We'll continue this work in our next session."
