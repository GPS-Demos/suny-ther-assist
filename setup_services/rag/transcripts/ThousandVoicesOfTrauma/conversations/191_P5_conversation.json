    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Amir. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. A bit nervous, I suppose. I've been thinking about our last session and what you mentioned about this imaginal exposure thing. It's been on my mind a lot.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... I've spent so long trying not to think about what happened. The idea of purposely reliving it... it's frightening. I've worked hard to build my business, to keep my life together after that incident with the police. The thought of going back there, even in my mind... I'm worried it might undo all the progress I've made.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How can I help?",
    "Client: I guess I need to understand why this is necessary. I mean, I've been managing, haven't I? My husband says I'm doing better. But then there are those nights when I can't sleep, when every little noise makes me jump. And sometimes, when I see a police officer... (voice trails off)",
    "Therapist: Imaginal exposure helps process trauma memories. Shall I explain more?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I want to understand. I've come this far, and if this can help me feel... normal again, then I want to try. But I'm scared. What if I fall apart? What if I can't handle it?",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel apprehensive. We'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: Okay... that's good to know. I appreciate your patience with me. It's just... this whole experience has shaken my faith in so many things. I came to this country for a better life, worked hard, built a business. And then in one moment, because of how I look... (takes a deep breath) I'm sorry, I know we haven't even started yet, and I'm already getting emotional.",
    "Therapist: Your emotions are valid. This is a safe space.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot. So, what exactly will happen during this imaginal exposure? Will I need to close my eyes? Will you be guiding me through it? I'm trying to prepare myself mentally.",
    "Therapist: Yes, you'll recall the event with eyes closed. I'll guide you.",
    "Client: Alright. And what if it becomes too much? Can we stop if I need to?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're in control. We can pause anytime.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I suppose I'm ready to give this a try. It's strange, you know. At my age, I thought I had experienced everything life could throw at me. But this... it's changed me in ways I'm still trying to understand. I want to feel strong again, to not be afraid in my own community.",
    "Therapist: Your resilience is admirable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm ready. Just... please be patient with me. This isn't easy, but I trust you. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: I'm here to support you. Take a deep breath."
