    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is terrified. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: Um... probably around 60. I can feel my heart racing already.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I guess so. Just... give me a moment to breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. When you're ready, close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm... I'm in the cell. It's dark, and the air feels heavy. I can smell the damp concrete. The guard, he's... he's coming down the hallway. I can hear his footsteps echoing.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... oh God, not again. Please, not again. My heart is pounding so hard. I'm trying to make myself small in the corner of the cell.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: He's... he's at my cell door now. I can hear the keys jingling. I want to disappear. The lock clicks and... and... I can't...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Maria. You're safe here. Can you tell me your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 80 now. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you name five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: I... I see the blue chair, the window, your desk, the plant in the corner, and the clock on the wall.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Now, when you're ready, let's continue. What happens after the guard unlocks the door?",
    "Client: He... he comes in. His face is... it's twisted in this horrible smile. I can smell the alcohol on his breath. He grabs my arm and... and...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it, Maria. You're safe here.",
    "Client: He's pulling me up. I'm trying to resist, but I'm so weak. He's dragging me out of the cell. The hallway is so long and dark. I... I know where he's taking me.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My legs feel like jelly. My stomach is churning. I feel so helpless, so... small.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Keep going.",
    "Client: We're... we're in the room now. It's... it's where he always takes me. There's a dirty mattress on the floor. I'm shaking. I want to fight, but I'm so scared.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's 90. I feel like I'm there again. It's so real.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Maria. Remember, this is a memory. You've survived this.",
    "Client: He's... he's pushing me down onto the mattress. I can feel his weight on me. I'm trying to scream, but no sound comes out. His hands are... they're everywhere. I feel so dirty, so ashamed.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I... I close my eyes. I'm trying to go somewhere else in my mind. But I can still feel everything. The pain... the smell of him... I want it to stop.",
    "Therapist: You're so brave, Maria. Keep going.",
    "Client: It feels like it lasts forever. When he's... when he's done, he just leaves me there. I'm curled up on the mattress, feeling broken. I can hear him laughing as he walks away.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking at this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm wondering why this happened to me. What did I do to deserve this? I feel so alone, so... worthless.",
    "Therapist: Those are difficult feelings. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still around 90. I feel like I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: Let's take a moment. Focus on your breathing. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... okay...",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: I... I slowly get up. Everything hurts. I'm walking back to my cell, feeling numb. The guard is gone. I'm alone in the hallway. It's so quiet now.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling as you walk back?",
    "Client: I feel... empty. Like a part of me has been taken away. I'm angry, but I'm too exhausted to show it. I just want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Maria. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm back in my cell now. I curl up in the corner, hugging my knees to my chest. I can hear other prisoners crying in the distance. I want to cry too, but no tears come.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about my family. Wondering if I'll ever see them again. If they'd even want to see me after... after this. I feel so ashamed.",
    "Therapist: Remember, Maria, what happened wasn't your fault.",
    "Client: I know that now, but back then... I felt like I must have done something to deserve this. The night feels so long. I can't sleep. Every sound makes me jump.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 75. I still feel shaky, but... but I'm here with you, not there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Let's continue.",
    "Client: As the night goes on, I start to feel anger rising. Not just at the guard, but at the whole system that allows this to happen. I promise myself that if I ever get out, I'll speak up. I'll fight for justice.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful thought. How does it make you feel?",
    "Client: It... it gives me a tiny spark of hope. Like maybe I'm not completely powerless.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent, Maria. You're showing great strength.",
    "Client: The morning finally comes. I can see a sliver of sunlight through the tiny window. I'm exhausted, but I'm still here. I survived another night.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking as you see that sunlight?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... I'm thinking that maybe I can get through this. That maybe one day, I'll be free again. It's a small thought, but it feels important.",
    "Therapist: That's a very powerful realization. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. So tired. But there's this tiny part of me that feels... I don't know... maybe a little stronger?",
    "Therapist: That's fantastic, Maria. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 60. I still feel shaky, but not as overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: You've done an incredible job today. How are you feeling about the session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm surprised. It was hard, really hard. But I got through it. I didn't think I could.",
    "Therapist: You showed immense courage. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we end?",
    "Client: I just... I want to thank you. For listening, for not judging. It means more than I can say.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Maria. You've made significant progress today. Let's take a few deep breaths together to close the session.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... I think I'm ready to end now.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. We'll continue working through this in our next session. Remember to use the coping strategies we've discussed if you feel overwhelmed between now and then.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Maria. Take care, and I'll see you next time."
