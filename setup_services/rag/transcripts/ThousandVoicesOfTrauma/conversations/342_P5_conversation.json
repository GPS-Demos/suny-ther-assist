    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I suppose. My back's been acting up again, which always puts me on edge. And knowing we're going to talk about the... incident... it's making me a bit nervous.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's discuss today's plan.",
    "Client: Alright. I've been dreading this, to be honest. Every time I think about that day, it's like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. We'll take it slow. Ready to learn about imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I guess so. It sounds intimidating, though. What exactly does it involve?",
    "Therapist: It's revisiting the memory in a safe space. We'll go through it step-by-step.",
    "Client: Revisit it? I'm not sure I can do that. I've spent so long trying to forget.",
    "Therapist: Your hesitation is valid. How about we discuss your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried it'll make things worse. What if I can't handle it? And honestly, I'm embarrassed about how I reacted during the attack.",
    "Therapist: Those are common concerns. Remember, you're in control here.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. But what if I panic? Or get too overwhelmed?",
    "Therapist: We'll pause if needed. I'm here to support you throughout.",
    "Client: Okay... that helps. So, what should I expect to feel during this?",
    "Therapist: You might experience strong emotions or physical sensations. It's all normal.",
    "Client: That sounds intense. Will this really help my PTSD symptoms?",
    "Therapist: Yes. It's proven effective in processing trauma memories.",
    "Client: I see. It's just... hard to believe reliving it could be helpful.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Your bravery in facing this is commendable.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm trying to be brave, but it's not easy. How long will this process take?",
    "Therapist: It varies. We'll go at your pace, session by session.",
    "Client: Alright. I appreciate your patience with me. I know I ask a lot of questions.",
    "Therapist: Questions are good. They show engagement. Any other concerns?",
    "Client: I guess... will this affect my chronic pain? Sometimes stress makes it flare up.",
    "Therapist: We'll monitor that closely. Let me know if you need breaks.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm feeling a bit more prepared now, but still nervous.",
    "Therapist: That's perfectly normal. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. Yes, let's do this. I want to get better, for myself and my family."
