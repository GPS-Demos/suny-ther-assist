    "Therapist: Mr. Ahmadi, today we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. I've been dreading this part. The idea of reliving that day with the police... it makes my heart race just thinking about it. Is this really necessary?",
    "Therapist: Your hesitation is understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I've spent years trying to forget that incident. The humiliation, the fear... I worry that bringing it all up again will set me back. And at my age, I don't know if I have the strength to face it all over again.",
    "Therapist: I hear your concerns. How do you think avoiding these memories has affected you?",
    "Client: (sighs deeply) I suppose it hasn't really helped. I still have nightmares, and I get anxious whenever I see police officers. It's affected my relationship with my wife too. She doesn't understand why I get so upset sometimes. Maybe... maybe it is time to face this.",
    "Therapist: That's very insightful. What do you hope to gain from this exercise?",
    "Client: I... I want peace. I want to be able to walk down the street without constantly looking over my shoulder. And I want my wife to have her husband back - the man I was before all this happened.",
    "Therapist: Those are important goals. Shall we discuss what to expect during the exposure?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I need to know what I'm getting into.",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit the memory gradually. I'll be here to support you throughout. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It sounds challenging, but I appreciate your support. Can you tell me more about how this will help? I'm still struggling to understand how reliving such a painful experience can be beneficial.",
    "Therapist: By confronting the memory, we can process it differently. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: I have so many. Will this make the nightmares worse? How long will this process take? And what if I can't handle it and break down completely?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace and can stop anytime. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Alright, I think I'm ready. But please, if you see that it's becoming too much for me, can you help me step back? I trust you, but I'm still scared.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Your safety is my priority. Are you comfortable starting now?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm nervous, but I'm also feeling a glimmer of hope. Maybe this will finally help me move past that terrible day. I'm ready to try, for myself and for my family.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Let's begin by closing your eyes and taking a deep breath..."
