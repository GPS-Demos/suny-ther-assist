    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Maria?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a mix of emotions, really. I feel drained, but also... maybe a bit relieved? It's strange to say that, considering what we just went through.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you?",
    "Client: The vivid details, I guess. I didn't realize I remembered so much about that night when my ex... when he... (pauses, takes a deep breath) When he hit me. The sound of his voice, the smell of alcohol on his breath. It's like I was right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: How did reliving that memory feel today?",
    "Client: It was intense. My heart was racing, and I felt that familiar tightness in my chest. But... it's different now. I'm here, safe, talking about it. It's not happening to me anymore.",
    "Therapist: You're noticing the difference. That's progress.",
    "Client: Yeah, I suppose it is. It's still hard, though. I keep thinking about how this experience relates to what's happening now with the cyber bullying at work. It's not physical, but the fear, the feeling of being powerless... it's eerily similar.",
    "Therapist: How so?",
    "Client: Well, with my ex, I never knew when he'd lash out. And now, with these anonymous online attacks, I never know when the next nasty comment or threat will pop up. It's like I'm constantly on edge, waiting for the next blow.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does this connect to your recovery goals?",
    "Client: I... I want to feel safe again. Both in the real world and online. I want to stop jumping at every notification on my phone, thinking it might be another attack. I want to be able to trust people again, to not assume everyone's out to hurt me.",
    "Therapist: Those are important goals. What insights did you gain today?",
    "Client: I realized that even though the memory is painful, I can face it. I survived that night, and I'm surviving this now. Maybe... maybe I'm stronger than I give myself credit for.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization, Maria.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to believe sometimes, but I'm trying. I also noticed that while reliving the memory was difficult, it didn't completely overwhelm me like it used to. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's often part of the process. What else?",
    "Client: I think I'm starting to see how my past experiences are affecting my reactions to the cyber bullying. It's like... the old wounds are being poked, you know? But maybe understanding that connection can help me handle it better.",
    "Therapist: How might you apply this understanding?",
    "Client: Well, maybe when I get a threatening message online, I can remind myself that it's not the same as my ex's physical threats. I'm safe in my home. I have support now. I'm not that helpless person anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent strategy. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: It's tough, but... I think it's helping. Each time we do this, it gets a little easier to talk about. And I'm starting to see how facing these memories might help me deal with my current situation better. I'm... I'm ready to keep going.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is commendable, Maria. Next steps?",
    "Client: I think I need to work on grounding techniques for when I feel overwhelmed, both by memories and current stressors. And maybe... maybe it's time I consider reaching out to HR about the cyber bullying. I've been too scared to do that, but I'm starting to feel like I deserve better treatment.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like positive steps forward.",
    "Client: Yeah, they do. It's scary, but I'm starting to feel a glimmer of hope. Like maybe I can actually get through this and come out stronger on the other side. Is that... is that naive of me to think?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a sign of progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your support through all of this. It means a lot to have someone listen and understand. I know we have more work to do, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I might actually be okay someday.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful feeling. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I feel emotionally exhausted, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've done some hard but necessary work. Thank you again for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You've done well, Maria. Take care, and we'll continue next week."
