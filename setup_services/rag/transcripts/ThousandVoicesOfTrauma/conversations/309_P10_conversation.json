    "Therapist: Welcome, Amira. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to do this, but another part is screaming to run away. It's like my body knows what's coming and is trying to protect me.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Okay. Yes, let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see the sky first. It's so dark, almost green. The wind is picking up, and I can hear things rattling outside. I'm in my apartment, alone. The TV is on, blaring tornado warnings.",
    "Therapist: Good. What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. My palms are sweaty. I... I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: The sirens start. God, that sound... it's like it's drilling into my skull. I'm frozen for a moment, then I snap into action. I grab my phone, my keys, a bottle of water. I'm shaking so much I can barely hold onto them.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling?",
    "Client: About... about 70.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I run down the stairs. The building is creaking, and I can hear other people shouting, crying. As I reach the ground floor, the lights go out. It's so dark, and I'm fumbling, trying to find the exit.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you smell? What do you hear?",
    "Client: I smell... rain. And something metallic, like electricity in the air. I hear glass breaking somewhere, and the wind... it's so loud, like a freight train.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I make it outside, but it's chaos. Debris is flying everywhere. I see a car flip over like it's made of paper. I'm screaming, but I can barely hear myself over the roar of the tornado.",
    "Therapist: What's happening in your body now?",
    "Client: I'm shaking uncontrollably. My chest feels so tight, like I can't get enough air. I... I think I'm going to be sick.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe with me. In... and out. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Breathing deeply) Okay... okay. I'm... I'm running towards the community shelter. The wind is so strong, it's pushing me back. I see others running too, but some people are just standing there, frozen in shock.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: \"I'm going to die.\" \"This is it.\" \"I should have left earlier.\" And... and memories of... of the abuse. It's like my brain is throwing every terrifying thing at me at once.",
    "Therapist: Stay with the present moment. What happens as you reach the shelter?",
    "Client: The door is so heavy. Someone helps me pull it open. Inside, it's packed with people. Children crying, adults praying. The noise from outside is deafening. I squeeze into a corner and curl up into a ball.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 85.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Remember, you survived this. You're here now, safe.",
    "Client: (Nods, tears streaming) The ground is shaking. I can feel the vibrations through the floor. Someone next to me is having a panic attack. I want to help, but I can't move. I'm paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your surroundings in the shelter?",
    "Client: It's dim. Emergency lights are flickering. The air is thick and musty. I can smell sweat and fear. People are huddled together, strangers holding onto each other for dear life.",
    "Therapist: Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: We wait. It feels like hours, but it's probably only minutes. The roaring outside slowly dies down. There's an eerie silence. No one moves at first. Then, someone cautiously opens the door.",
    "Therapist: What do you see when the door opens?",
    "Client: Destruction. Just... total destruction. Buildings are leveled. Cars are tossed around like toys. Trees are uprooted. It's like a war zone. I step out, my legs shaking.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Numb. Shocked. I can't believe I survived. But there's also this intense guilt. Why me? Why did I survive when others didn't?",
    "Therapist: Those are common feelings after such an event. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I start walking, trying to get back to my apartment. The streets are unrecognizable. I see people crying, searching through rubble. I want to help, but I don't know how. I just keep walking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 60 now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Take a deep breath. What happens as you reach your apartment building?",
    "Client: It's... it's still standing, but barely. Windows are blown out. Part of the roof is gone. I climb the stairs, stepping over debris. My door is off its hinges.",
    "Therapist: What do you see inside your apartment?",
    "Client: It's a mess. Glass everywhere. My belongings scattered. But in the middle of it all, I see a photo of my family. It's untouched. I pick it up and just... break down crying.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Relief. Grief. Anger. Gratitude. It's all mixed up. I'm alive, but everything's changed. I don't feel safe anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to process. How are you feeling now, in this moment?",
    "Client: Drained. But... also a bit lighter? Like I've released something I've been holding onto.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today, Amira. Let's start to bring you back to the present.",
    "Client: (Opens eyes, looks around) I... I made it through. I didn't think I could.",
    "Therapist: You did, and you showed immense strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted. But also... proud, I guess? It's still scary, but it feels less overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Remember, you have the strength to face these memories.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I understand now why we're doing this. It's hard, but... it helps.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll end here for today. Take some time to care for yourself.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again."
