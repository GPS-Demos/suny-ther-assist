    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Can you describe the car accident scene?",
    "Client: Okay... I was driving home from work, it was late evening. The roads were quiet. I remember the streetlights casting an orange glow. Suddenly, I saw headlights coming towards me in my lane. They were swerving... I felt my heart racing...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The car was getting closer, and I realized it wasn't going to correct its path. I panicked, gripping the steering wheel tightly. I tried to swerve, but it all happened so fast. There was a deafening crash, the sound of metal crunching. My body jerked forward, then slammed back against the seat. The airbag deployed, hitting my face. I... I can't...",
    "Therapist: It's okay. You're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) The smell of burning rubber filled the air. My ears were ringing. I was disoriented, trying to make sense of what just happened. I could feel a sharp pain in my chest and my head was throbbing. I looked around and saw that my windshield was shattered. Through the cracks, I could see the other car. It was smoking...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: I was scared to move. I didn't know if I was seriously injured. I could hear people shouting outside, probably other drivers who had stopped. Someone was calling for an ambulance. I wanted to check on the other driver, but I was frozen in place. The pain was getting worse, and I started to feel dizzy. I was so afraid...",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel afraid. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I closed my eyes, trying to steady my breathing. When I opened them again, there were flashing lights everywhere. Police, ambulance... A paramedic was at my window, asking if I could hear him. I nodded, but I couldn't speak. They carefully got me out of the car and onto a stretcher. As they wheeled me to the ambulance, I caught a glimpse of the other driver. He looked unconscious... there was blood...",
    "Therapist: Stay with the memory. You're doing well.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) In the ambulance, they were asking me questions, shining lights in my eyes. But all I could think about was the other driver. Was he alive? Was it my fault somehow? I felt so guilty, even though I knew I hadn't done anything wrong. The pain and the fear were overwhelming. I wanted it all to stop, to wake up and realize it was just a nightmare...",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel shaky. My heart is racing, just like it did that night. I can still smell the burning rubber and hear the crash. It's so vivid... I haven't allowed myself to think about it in such detail before. It's overwhelming, but... also somewhat relieving to finally talk about it.",
    "Therapist: That's completely understandable. Take a moment to ground yourself.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm here. In your office. I'm safe. It's just... it's hard to shake off those feelings, you know? The guilt, the fear, the helplessness. I keep wondering if I could have done something differently, even though logically I know it wasn't my fault.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those thoughts. You're processing the experience.",
    "Client: I guess so. It's just... ever since that night, I've been so anxious about driving. Every time I get behind the wheel, I'm hyper-aware of every car around me. I'm constantly anticipating another accident. It's exhausting. And it's not just driving - I feel on edge all the time, like something terrible could happen at any moment.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I really want to get past this. I hate feeling so scared and vulnerable all the time. It's affecting my work, my relationships... I used to be so independent, and now I find myself relying on others for simple things like giving me rides. I want my life back, you know?",
    "Therapist: Your determination is admirable. Let's continue working on this.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm ready. It's hard, but I know I need to face this. I want to be able to drive again without panic. I want to feel safe in the world again. I know it won't happen overnight, but I'm willing to put in the work. It's just... sometimes it feels like I'll never get there. Like I'll always be haunted by that night.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. Trust the process.",
    "Client: I'm trying. It's just... sometimes the memories come flooding back when I least expect it. Like when I hear screeching tires or see flashing lights. It's like I'm right back there in that moment. But I suppose talking about it like this, really facing it head-on... it's helping. It's terrifying, but also... I don't know, empowering in a way? Like I'm taking control of the memory instead of letting it control me.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent insight. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also a bit lighter? Like I've released some of the weight I've been carrying. My heart rate is starting to slow down now. I'm feeling more present in the room. It's still hard, and I know we have more work to do, but I think I'm starting to see a glimmer of hope. Maybe I can get through this after all.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great strength. We'll end here for today."
