    "Therapist: Alright, John. Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's begin. Close your eyes and describe the hostage situation.",
    "Client: Okay... We were on a routine patrol when we got ambushed. The rebels came out of nowhere, guns blazing. We tried to fight back, but they outnumbered us. Before I knew it, they had us surrounded. I remember the fear in my squad mates' eyes as we were forced to surrender. They took our weapons and blindfolded us. The rough fabric scratched against my face, and I could smell my own sweat mixed with dust and gunpowder.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 5 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: They marched us for what felt like hours. My legs were aching, and I was disoriented from the blindfold. We finally stopped, and they shoved us into some kind of building. It smelled musty and damp. They tied us to chairs, and that's when the real fear set in. I could hear my teammates breathing heavily, some were whimpering. I felt so helpless, like I had failed them all.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Maybe a 7.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The rebels started interrogating us, one by one. I could hear screams from the other room. My heart was pounding so hard I thought it might burst out of my chest. When they came for me, I... I...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, John. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Sorry, it's just... it's so vivid. They pulled off my blindfold, and the light was blinding. This guy with a scar across his face was staring at me, holding a knife. He asked me questions about our mission, our base. I tried to resist, but he... he started cutting my arm. The pain was excruciating, and I could feel the warm blood trickling down.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. God, it feels like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. Remember, you're safe now.",
    "Client: [Voice shaking] I... I can't do this. It's too much.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You can handle this. What happened next?",
    "Client: I... I broke. I told them what they wanted to know. I betrayed my team, my country. The shame... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Still a 9. I feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. Keep going.",
    "Client: After that, they left us alone for a while. The waiting was almost worse than the torture. We didn't know if they'd kill us or what would happen next. I kept replaying my failure in my head, over and over. Then, suddenly, there was gunfire outside. It was our rescue team. When they burst in, I felt relief but also this crushing guilt. I didn't deserve to be saved.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually down to about a 6. Talking about the rescue... it helps a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's good. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Drained. But also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. That's a common experience. Well done today, John."
