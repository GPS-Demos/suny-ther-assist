    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is buzzing, you know? My hands are a bit shaky, and there's this tightness in my chest. The memory feels so vivid now, like I'm right back there in the hospital room, seeing my mom hooked up to all those machines. I can almost smell the antiseptic...",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. I was supposed to be there for her, you know? But I couldn't do anything. I just stood there, watching her struggle to breathe. And then there's this voice in my head saying, \"You should have done more. You should have noticed something was wrong sooner.\" It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you share this?",
    "Client: My stomach's in knots. I feel nauseous, actually. And my shoulders are so tense, like I'm bracing for something. It's weird, but I also feel this heaviness in my legs, like they're made of lead. I guess... I guess that's how I felt back then too, like I couldn't move or do anything useful.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are you experiencing?",
    "Client: It's a mix, really. There's guilt, definitely. A lot of guilt. But also fear... fear that something like this could happen again. And anger, I think. I'm angry at myself for not being stronger, for not knowing what to do. But I'm also angry at the situation, at how unfair it all was. And underneath it all, there's this deep sadness. It's like... like a void in my chest.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when it first happened?",
    "Client: They're... they're not as intense now, I suppose. Back then, it was like being hit by a tsunami. Everything was chaotic, and I felt like I was drowning in all these emotions. Now, it's more like... like waves. They come and go, but I can breathe between them. Sometimes, though, a big one hits and it feels just as overwhelming as it did then.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your thoughts now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm starting to see that maybe I'm being too hard on myself. Like, rationally, I know I was just a kid and there wasn't much I could have done. But emotionally, it's still hard to accept that. There's this constant battle between what I know logically and what I feel. And I'm noticing how much this experience has shaped me. I'm always trying to be prepared now, always worried about the health of my loved ones.",
    "Therapist: How does sharing this make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a bit relieving. Like, I've been carrying this weight for so long, and talking about it makes it feel a little lighter. But it's also scary, you know? Opening up like this makes me feel vulnerable. And there's a part of me that's worried about burdening others with my problems. I mean, everyone has their own issues to deal with, right?",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you reflect on that?",
    "Client: I'm realizing that maybe... maybe it's okay to need support. It's just, growing up in my family, we didn't really talk about our feelings much. Especially as a guy, you know? You're supposed to be strong, to handle things on your own. But going through this... it's made me question a lot of those beliefs. I'm starting to think that maybe true strength is being able to be vulnerable, to ask for help when you need it.",
    "Therapist: How does this realization sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... it's both comforting and unsettling. Comforting because it feels like I'm giving myself permission to be human, to not have all the answers. But unsettling because it challenges so much of what I've believed about myself and how I should cope with difficult situations. It's like... like I'm rebuilding my understanding of myself from the ground up. And that's scary, but also kind of exciting? Like maybe there's a chance for me to relate to myself and others in a healthier way.",
    "Therapist: What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I think... I think I just need to sit with these feelings for a bit. To let myself really feel them without trying to push them away or rationalize them. And maybe... maybe I need to practice being a little kinder to myself. To remind myself that it's okay to struggle with this, that healing isn't linear. And I think I need to keep talking about it, even when it's hard. Because keeping it all bottled up inside, that hasn't really been working for me.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm nervous, but I think I'm ready. It's not going to be easy, I know that. There are probably going to be days when I feel like I'm right back where I started. But I also feel... hopeful? Like maybe by facing this head-on, I can start to heal in a way I haven't been able to before. And I'm grateful, you know? Grateful to have this space to work through everything. It's tough, but I think it's worth it.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. How would you like to close our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to take a few deep breaths. To ground myself a bit before heading back out into the world. And maybe... maybe I could set an intention for the week? Something like... being gentle with myself when these memories and feelings come up. Yeah, that feels right. Just... taking it one day at a time and remembering that it's okay to not be okay sometimes.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a wonderful way to end. Shall we take those breaths together?"
