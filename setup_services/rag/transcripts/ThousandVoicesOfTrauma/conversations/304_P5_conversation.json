    "Therapist: Welcome back, Raj. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been thinking a lot about our last session and the idea of this imaginal exposure thing you mentioned.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... I've spent so long trying not to think about losing my brother. The idea of purposely reliving it feels... scary. And with everything going on in the world, the racial tensions... it's all getting mixed up in my head.",
    "Therapist: I hear you. It's a challenging step. How about we discuss the process?",
    "Client: Yeah, that would help. I mean, I trust you, but I'm still anxious about what to expect. Will it be like opening floodgates? I'm worried I might fall apart.",
    "Therapist: It's gradual. We'll go at your pace. What other concerns do you have?",
    "Client: I guess I'm worried about how I'll react. What if I can't handle it? Or what if it makes things worse instead of better? And... I don't know, maybe this sounds silly, but I'm also concerned about how you'll see me. Falling apart in front of someone isn't easy.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. Remember, you're in control throughout.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. But how does this actually help? I mean, I understand the concept of facing fears, but this feels different. It's not just fear, it's grief and anger and confusion all mixed together.",
    "Therapist: It helps by processing the memory fully, reducing its power over you.",
    "Client: I see. So it's like... defusing a bomb? Taking it apart piece by piece so it can't hurt me anymore? That makes sense, but it still sounds daunting. How long does this usually take?",
    "Therapist: It varies for each person. We'll go at your pace, session by session.",
    "Client: Okay. I appreciate your patience with all my questions. I think I'm starting to understand better now. But can we talk about the racial aspect too? Sometimes I feel like my grief gets tangled up with anger about discrimination I've faced.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll address all aspects of your experience, including racial trauma.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot. It's not always easy to find therapists who understand that part of my life. So, what exactly will we do in this imaginal exposure? Do I just... start talking about what happened?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the memory in detail. I'll guide you through it.",
    "Client: Okay. And you'll be there the whole time? I mean, I know you'll be physically present, but will you... interrupt if I'm struggling? Or do I just keep going no matter what?",
    "Therapist: I'll be here, supporting you. We can pause if needed. Your safety is priority.",
    "Client: That's good to know. I think I'm feeling a bit more prepared now. Still nervous, but also... maybe a little hopeful? Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Hope is a positive sign. You're showing great courage.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot coming from you. I guess... I'm as ready as I'll ever be. When do we start? And is there anything I should do to prepare myself?",
    "Therapist: We can start next session. Just come as you are, ready to engage.",
    "Client: Alright. I'll do my best. Thank you for explaining everything so patiently. It really helps to know what to expect and that you'll be there guiding me through it. I'm still scared, but I think I can do this.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is admirable. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm grateful to have your support in this. See you next session, then?",
    "Therapist: Yes, see you then. Take care, Raj."
