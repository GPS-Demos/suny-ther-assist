    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing but also blank at the same time. I can still hear the explosions, you know? The way they echoed across the desert. It's so vivid, like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you noticing?",
    "Client: My heart's pounding. I can feel it in my chest, and my hands are clammy. There's this tightness in my shoulders, like I'm bracing for impact. And my stomach... it's in knots. It's how I felt every time we went on patrol, never knowing if this was the day we'd hit an IED.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how unfair it all was. We were just kids, really. Barely out of high school, and there we were, in the middle of a war zone. I remember looking at my squad mates, seeing the fear in their eyes, and knowing I probably looked the same. It's like... how did we end up here? What did we do to deserve this?",
    "Therapist: How does recalling those memories make you feel emotionally?",
    "Client: Angry. So angry. At the politicians who sent us there, at the enemy we couldn't see, at myself for not being able to protect everyone. But there's guilt too. Survivor's guilt, I guess. Why did I make it back when others didn't? And beneath all that, there's this... emptiness. Like a part of me is still there, in the desert, and I don't know how to get it back.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about how these feelings compare to when you first returned home?",
    "Client: It's... different now. Back then, it was all raw, you know? Like an open wound. I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat. Every loud noise sent me into a panic. Now, it's more... I don't know, contained? The feelings are still there, but they're not consuming me like they used to. It's like... I can acknowledge them without being overwhelmed. Most of the time, anyway.",
    "Therapist: How does that shift feel to you?",
    "Client: It's a relief, honestly. But it's also scary in a way. Like, does this mean I'm forgetting? Am I dishonoring my friends who didn't make it by not feeling as intensely? And then there's this guilt about feeling better. It's confusing. Sometimes I think I don't deserve to heal, you know?",
    "Therapist: What would you say to a fellow veteran who expressed similar thoughts?",
    "Client: I... I'd probably tell them it's okay to heal. That moving forward doesn't mean forgetting. It's just... harder to apply that to myself, I guess. I'd tell them they're honoring their fallen comrades by living well, by making something of the life they were given. But when it comes to me, I struggle to believe it.",
    "Therapist: How does imagining that conversation make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... eye-opening, actually. I can see the double standard I'm holding myself to. It's easier to be compassionate to others than to myself. I guess... maybe I need to work on extending that same kindness to my own experiences. It's just... it's hard, you know? To let go of that guilt, that feeling of responsibility.",
    "Therapist: What small step could you take towards self-compassion?",
    "Client: I... I could try to acknowledge my progress without immediately dismissing it. Like, when I notice I've had a good day or handled a trigger well, instead of brushing it off, I could take a moment to recognize it. Maybe even say it out loud, like \"You did well today.\" It feels a bit silly saying it, but... maybe it could help?",
    "Therapist: How does the idea of doing that make you feel?",
    "Client: It's a mix of emotions, really. There's a part of me that feels hopeful, like maybe this could be a way to start being kinder to myself. But there's also this resistance, this voice saying I don't deserve it. And underneath it all, there's a tiny bit of excitement. Like, what if this actually works? What if I could learn to treat myself with the same compassion I'd show a fellow vet?",
    "Therapist: What support might you need to try this?",
    "Client: I think... maybe having someone to check in with? Like, if I could text a friend or my partner when I manage to acknowledge something positive. Just to have that external validation, at least at first. And maybe setting a daily reminder on my phone to pause and reflect on any small victories. I know it sounds simple, but having that structure might help me follow through.",
    "Therapist: How does having a plan make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... reassuring, actually. Like I'm taking some control back. For so long, I've felt at the mercy of my memories and emotions. Having a concrete step, something I can actually do... it gives me a sense of hope. It's small, but it feels like a start. Like maybe, bit by bit, I can reclaim parts of myself that I thought were lost in the desert.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, I think. Talking through this, making a plan... it's like I've set down a bit of the weight I've been carrying. I know it's not gone, and I know there's still a long road ahead, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can walk that road. It's scary, but also... exciting? Like I'm finally moving forward instead of being stuck in the past.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. We'll continue next session.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I appreciate your guidance through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm making progress. Even just being able to talk about it without completely falling apart feels like a huge step. I'm nervous about trying this self-compassion thing, but I'm also kind of looking forward to it. It's a strange feeling, but a good one, I think. See you next week."
