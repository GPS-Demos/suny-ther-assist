    "Client: Okay... I'm back in Afghanistan. It's hot, dusty. The air feels thick. We're on patrol, walking through a small village. The streets are narrow, buildings close together. It's eerily quiet...",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS right now?",
    "Client: Um, about a 4, I'd say.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue.",
    "Client: We turn a corner, and suddenly there's shouting. I can't understand the words, but the tone is angry, threatening. My heart starts racing. I grip my weapon tighter...",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up. Maybe a 6?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Keep going.",
    "Client: There's a group of men arguing. One of them pulls out a knife. It all happens so fast. Before we can react, he's stabbed another man. There's blood... so much blood. The victim falls to the ground, clutching his stomach. I... I freeze. I can't move...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. My hands are shaking. I can feel sweat on my forehead.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with it.",
    "Client: My squadmate pushes past me, tries to help the victim. But it's too late. The attacker is running away. We're supposed to pursue, but I'm just... standing there. I can smell the blood, the dust... I feel useless, scared...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's still an 8. My chest feels tight. I'm having trouble breathing...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) Okay... The village is in chaos now. People are screaming, running. My squadmate is yelling at me to help, but I can't move. I'm paralyzed. I've never felt so ashamed...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 9. I feel like I'm right back there. My heart is pounding so hard...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here with me.",
    "Client: (nods) The victim... he's not moving anymore. There's so much blood on the ground. I finally snap out of it, try to help, but it's too late. We failed. I failed. I should have done something...",
    "Therapist: How about your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's still at 9. I feel so guilty, so ashamed. I can't stop shaking...",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're processing it. Keep going.",

    "Client: We have to wait for the local authorities. It feels like hours. The sun is beating down, the smell of blood is overwhelming. I keep replaying those moments in my head, thinking about what I should have done differently...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 7. I'm feeling drained, exhausted...",
    "Therapist: That's normal. We're almost done.",
    "Client: Finally, we're cleared to leave. As we walk away, I can't help but look back. The blood stain on the ground... it's like it's burned into my memory. I know I'll never forget this day, never forget my failure...",
    "Therapist: And your final SUDS?",
    "Client: It's a 6 now. I feel... hollow. Drained. But also relieved it's over.",
    "Therapist: You did incredibly well. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves."
