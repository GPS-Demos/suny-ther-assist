    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. I keep seeing flashes of that night, the violence... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out most?",
    "Client: The sounds. The screaming, the breaking glass. I can still hear it so clearly. It's like I'm right back there, you know? My heart's racing just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Those sensory memories can be intense. How did it feel to revisit that today?",
    "Client: Terrifying, honestly. I felt so helpless, like I couldn't do anything to stop what was happening. But... I also felt a bit stronger this time. Like I could handle it better than before.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. How does this connect to your daily life?",
    "Client: Well, I've been jumpy lately, especially around loud noises. Now I see why. It's like my body's always on alert, waiting for something bad to happen again.",
    "Therapist: Good insight. What else have you noticed?",
    "Client: I've been avoiding going out at night, especially to busy areas. I guess I'm afraid of witnessing something like that again. It's affecting my social life, my studies... everything, really.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. How do you feel about addressing this?",
    "Client: It's scary, but... I want my life back. I'm tired of feeling trapped by this fear. I want to be able to go out with friends again, to feel normal.",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. What helped you get through today's session?",
    "Client: Um, focusing on my breathing helped a bit. And reminding myself that I'm safe now, that it's just a memory. It's hard, but it seems to get a little easier each time.",
    "Therapist: Excellent strategies. How can we build on this?",
    "Client: Maybe... practice more relaxation techniques? And I think I need to talk more about my feelings of guilt. I keep thinking I should have done something to help.",
    "Therapist: That's very insightful. We'll definitely address that. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, but... also a bit relieved? Like I've let out something I've been holding in for so long. It's exhausting but... maybe healing too?",
    "Therapist: That's often part of the process. What's your takeaway today?",
    "Client: I think... I'm stronger than I realized. And that maybe, with time, I can learn to manage these memories and feelings better. It's hard work, but I'm starting to see why it's important.",
    "Therapist: Excellent reflection. How will you care for yourself today?",
    "Client: I think I'll call my boyfriend, maybe go for a walk. Just try to do something normal, you know? To remind myself that life goes on, despite everything.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a good plan. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's tough, but I feel like I'm finally moving forward instead of being stuck in that moment.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work. See you next session."
