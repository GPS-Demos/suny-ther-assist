    "Therapist: Welcome, Priya. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I... I think so. It's always a bit daunting, isn't it? But I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's start with your SUDS level.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 6 out of 10. My stomach's a bit jittery.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Remember, we're here together. Begin when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... *deep breath* I'm boarding the plane. It's a sunny day, and I can feel the heat on my skin as I walk across the tarmac. The smell of jet fuel is strong, and it's making me a bit queasy. I'm... I'm thinking about my husband. He would've loved this trip...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see other passengers, some looking excited, others tired. The flight attendant is smiling as she checks our boarding passes. I'm... I'm gripping my carry-on tightly. My palms are sweaty.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: I find my seat, 14C. It's by the window. I usually love window seats, but today... today it feels claustrophobic. I'm stowing my bag, and my hands are shaking a little. The man next to me notices and asks if I'm okay. I lie and say I'm fine, just a bit tired.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My heart's racing. I... I can feel that familiar panic starting to build. It's like a weight on my chest.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Maybe an 8 now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Let's ground ourselves for a moment. Can you name three things you see in this room?",
    "Client: Um, your glasses, the plant in the corner, and... and the clock on the wall.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, when you're ready, let's continue with the memory.",
    "Client: *exhales slowly* Alright. The plane is taxiing now. I can feel every bump, every turn. The engines are getting louder, and I'm gripping the armrests. My mouth is dry. I... I keep thinking about my kids at home. What if something happens?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: We're... we're taking off. The plane is tilting up, and my stomach drops. I close my eyes tightly. I can hear a baby crying somewhere behind me. I'm trying to focus on my breathing, but it's shallow and quick. I feel like I can't get enough air.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: We're in the air now. The seatbelt sign is still on. I... I can feel the plane shaking. Is this normal turbulence? Or is something wrong? My mind is racing, imagining all the worst scenarios. I want to ask the flight attendant if everything's okay, but I'm frozen in my seat.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm right there again.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Take a moment to feel your feet on the ground.",
    "Client: *takes a shaky breath* Okay... okay. The plane... it suddenly drops. People are gasping. Oxygen masks fall from the ceiling. I'm... I'm fumbling with mine, my hands are shaking so badly. The man next to me is praying out loud. I can hear the panic in his voice.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Priya. Stay with it.",
    "Client: The plane is shaking violently now. I can hear metal creaking. The engines... they sound wrong. Too loud, then too quiet. A flight attendant falls in the aisle. I want to help her, but I can't move. I'm paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I'm thinking about my family. My children. How I'll never see them again. I'm regretting this trip, wishing I'd stayed home. I feel so helpless, so out of control.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: There's a loud bang. The plane lurches to the side. People are screaming now. I can see... I can see the wing out my window. It's... it's on fire. Oh God, it's on fire. I'm crying, praying, begging for it to be over.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Priya. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *sobbing* It's so real. I can smell the smoke. Feel the heat. The plane is nosediving now. I'm pressed back in my seat. The world outside the window is a blur of green and blue. I'm... I'm saying goodbye to my kids in my head. Telling them I love them.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 10. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Let's take a moment. Feel your feet on the floor. Look around the room.",
    "Client: *takes several deep breaths* Okay... okay. I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: The impact... it's deafening. Metal tearing, glass shattering. My body is thrown forward, then back. Everything goes black for a moment. When I come to, I'm upside down. The plane... it's broken in half. I can see trees, water. I'm still strapped in my seat, hanging upside down.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I unbuckle my seatbelt. I fall onto what used to be the ceiling of the plane. My legs are shaky, but I stand. There's smoke everywhere. I can hear people moaning, crying. I start helping others out of their seats. We need to get out before...",
    "Therapist: Before what?",
    "Client: Before the plane explodes. I'm terrified, but somehow, I'm moving. Helping people. We're climbing out through a tear in the fuselage. The grass is wet under my feet. We're running, stumbling away from the wreckage. And then... then there's an explosion. The heat hits my back. I fall to the ground, covering my head.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. But I survived. I actually survived.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down. Maybe a 7?",
    "Therapist: That's good. Let's stay with the memory a bit longer. What happens after the explosion?",
    "Client: We're... we're huddled together. Survivors. Some are injured badly. I'm checking on people, tearing strips from my shirt to make bandages. It feels surreal. Like a nightmare, but I'm awake. I can hear sirens in the distance. Help is coming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing very well. Continue.",
    "Client: Time seems to stretch. I'm in a daze. Paramedics arrive. They're treating the injured, asking questions. Someone puts a blanket around my shoulders. I'm answering questions on autopilot. Name, address, who to contact. I keep thinking about my family, wondering if they know yet.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: Relief... guilt... shock. I'm alive, but others... others didn't make it. I can see body bags. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: We're being taken to the hospital. I'm in an ambulance. The paramedic is kind, keeps telling me I'm safe now. But I don't feel safe. I feel... broken. Like the world will never be the same again. At the hospital, it's a blur of tests, questions, phone calls. I finally get to talk to my kids. I'm crying, they're crying. I've never been so grateful to hear their voices.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, Priya?",
    "Client: Drained. Emotionally exhausted. But... but also a bit lighter? Like I've let some of it out.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's take a few deep breaths together.",
    "Client: *breathes deeply* Thank you. This... this was hard, but I think it helped.",
    "Therapist: You did very well today, Priya. How are you feeling about the session?",
    "Client: It was intense. Reliving it... it's never easy. But I feel like I processed some of it. Like I faced it head-on instead of running from it.",
    "Therapist: That's exactly the point of these exercises. You showed great courage today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I understand now why we do this. It's still scary, but it feels... manageable.",
    "Therapist: That's a great insight. Remember, healing is a process. We'll continue to work through this together.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I'm... I'm actually looking forward to our next session. Is that strange?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It shows you're committed to your healing journey.",
    "Client: Thank you for guiding me through this. I feel... stronger.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself, Priya. Let's end here for today. Remember to practice your relaxation techniques.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
