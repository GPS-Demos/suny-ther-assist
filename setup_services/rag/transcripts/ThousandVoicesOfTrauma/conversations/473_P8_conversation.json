    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. My heart's still pounding a bit. That memory of witnessing the violence in the school hallway, it just... it brought everything back so vividly.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: It's this overwhelming sense of helplessness. I can still see the look on that kid's face as he was being beaten. The sound of fists hitting flesh, the jeers from the crowd... God, why didn't I do anything? I just stood there, frozen. I feel... I feel ashamed.",
    "Therapist: You're processing a lot. How does that shame feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like a heavy weight in my stomach. My shoulders feel tense, and there's this tightness in my chest. I keep replaying the scene in my head, thinking of all the things I could've done differently. Maybe if I'd stepped in, or called for help... but I was so scared.",
    "Therapist: What were you afraid might happen?",
    "Client: I... I guess I was afraid they'd turn on me. I'd been bullied before, and the thought of becoming their next target terrified me. But now, looking back, I feel like such a coward. I should've been braver.",
    "Therapist: How does that belief impact you now?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a constant reminder that I'm not good enough. That when it really matters, I'll always fall short. It affects my confidence at work, in my relationships. I'm always second-guessing myself, wondering if I'm doing enough, if I'm being a good enough husband, father, colleague...",
    "Therapist: I see. What emotions are coming up as you share this?",
    "Client: Frustration, mostly. And sadness. It's been over 25 years, but it still feels so raw. I'm angry at myself for not doing more, and angry at the world for being so cruel. And there's this deep sadness for that kid who got hurt, and for my younger self who had to witness it.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when it first happened?",
    "Client: They're... they're less intense now, I think. Back then, I was overwhelmed with fear and guilt. I couldn't sleep for weeks after. Now, it's more like a dull ache. But sometimes, like during this exercise, it all comes rushing back and feels just as fresh as it did then.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about that change?",
    "Client: I guess... I guess it shows that I've processed some of it over time. It's not consuming me every moment like it used to. But it's still there, influencing me. I wonder if I'll ever truly get past it.",
    "Therapist: How does that uncertainty sit with you?",
    "Client: It's frustrating, but also... maybe a little hopeful? I mean, if I've made progress over the years without really addressing it, maybe now that I'm actively working on it, I can make even more progress. But it's scary too. What if I can't change? What if this is just who I am now?",
    "Therapist: What would it mean if you could change?",
    "Client: It would be... liberating. To not carry this weight around anymore. To be able to face challenges without immediately doubting myself. To feel like I can protect my family if they ever needed me. To just... be at peace with who I am.",
    "Therapist: How does imagining that feel?",
    "Client: It feels good. Really good. Like taking a deep breath after holding it for too long. But it also feels a bit out of reach. Like, can I really get there? Do I deserve to feel that way after what I did... or didn't do?",
    "Therapist: What part of you questions if you deserve it?",
    "Client: I guess... it's the part that still sees myself as that scared kid in the hallway. The part that equates inaction with being a bad person. It's hard to reconcile that with who I want to be, who I try to be every day.",
    "Therapist: How might you respond to that part of yourself?",
    "Client: I... I'd want to tell him it's okay. That he was just a kid, and he was scared. That not acting doesn't make him a bad person. That he's grown and learned since then. But it's hard. It's really hard to believe that sometimes.",
    "Therapist: What makes it difficult to believe?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's because I've held onto this guilt for so long. It's become a part of my identity in a way. Letting go of it feels like I'm saying what happened was okay, which it wasn't. And maybe... maybe I'm afraid of who I'd be without it.",
    "Therapist: How does that fear feel?",
    "Client: It's... unsettling. Like standing on the edge of a cliff. I can see the possibility of something better on the other side, but the jump feels so risky. What if I lose part of myself in the process? What if I forget the lesson I learned that day?",
    "Therapist: What lesson do you think you learned?",
    "Client: I learned that the world can be a cruel place. That people can hurt each other for no reason. But also... I learned the importance of standing up for what's right, even if it's scary. I've tried to teach my kids that. Maybe... maybe that's my way of making amends?",
    "Therapist: How does that perspective shift things for you?",
    "Client: It... it makes me feel a bit better, actually. Like maybe I've been trying to make up for it all along, in my own way. It doesn't erase what happened, but it feels like I've been trying to learn from it, to be better. Maybe I'm not as stuck as I thought.",
    "Therapist: What's that realization like for you?",
    "Client: It's... it's kind of amazing, actually. Like a weight lifting a little. I've been so focused on what I didn't do that day, I haven't really acknowledged how it's shaped my actions since then. Maybe... maybe I can start to forgive that scared kid a little bit.",
    "Therapist: How does that potential for self-forgiveness feel?",
    "Client: It feels... tender. Like a bruise that's finally starting to heal. There's still pain there, but also the promise of recovery. It's scary to let go of the guilt, but also... freeing. Like maybe I can start to see myself in a different light.",
    "Therapist: What might that new perspective look like?",
    "Client: I think... I think it might look like seeing myself as someone who's been shaped by his experiences, both good and bad. Someone who's tried to learn and grow. Someone who's not perfect, but who's trying. Maybe... maybe someone who deserves compassion, even from himself.",
    "Therapist: How does that sit with you right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a lot to take in. Part of me wants to embrace it, and part of me is still hesitant. But overall, it feels... hopeful. Like maybe there's a path forward that I couldn't see before. It's overwhelming, but in a good way, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How are you feeling physically now?",
    "Client: I notice my breathing has slowed down. The tightness in my chest has eased a bit. I feel... lighter somehow. Tired, but in a good way, like after a long workout. There's still some tension in my shoulders, but it's not as intense as before.",
    "Therapist: What do you want to remember from this session?",
    "Client: I want to remember this feeling of possibility. That maybe I'm not defined by that one moment of inaction, but by all the actions I've taken since then. That forgiveness might be possible. And that... that maybe I'm stronger than I give myself credit for.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot of insight. How would you like to close our session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to take a moment to just sit with this new perspective. To let it sink in a bit. And maybe... maybe to thank that scared kid for surviving, for getting through it, and for trying to be better ever since. Yeah, I think that feels right.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a meaningful way to end. Let's take that moment now."
