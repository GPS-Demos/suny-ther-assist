    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. But also... maybe a little relieved? It's hard to put into words.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you about revisiting that memory?",
    "Client: God, where do I even start? I guess... the intensity of it all. The sounds, the smells, the fear. It was like I was right back there in that moment. I could hear the explosions, smell the smoke, and feel the panic rising in my chest. But this time, I didn't feel as... trapped, I guess? Like, I knew I was here in the office with you, even while I was reliving it.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was tough, really tough. But... different from how I usually feel when these memories pop up. Usually, I try to push them away or numb them with alcohol. This time, I let myself feel it all. It was scary, but also... I don't know, maybe empowering? Like I was facing it head-on for once.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. How do you think this relates to your PTSD symptoms?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm starting to see how avoiding these memories has been making things worse. Like, the more I try not to think about it, the more it sneaks up on me. And then I drink to cope, which just creates more problems. But today, even though it was hard, I feel like I'm... I don't know, maybe taking back some control?",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. What else did you notice?",
    "Client: I realized how much I've been isolating myself. In the memory, I was surrounded by my unit, but now... I'm alone most of the time. I push people away because I feel like they can't understand. But going through this today, I... I kind of wish I had someone to talk to about it. Someone who gets it, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How might this impact your recovery goals?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I need to start reaching out more. To other vets, or support groups. And... God, this is hard to say, but maybe I need to look at my drinking. It's not really helping, is it? It's just keeping me stuck.",
    "Therapist: You're showing a lot of courage in facing these issues. What's your takeaway from today's session?",
    "Client: I guess... that I'm stronger than I thought. That facing these memories is hard, but not impossible. And that maybe, just maybe, I don't have to do this all alone. It's scary, but... I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress, Sarah. How do you feel about continuing with this process?",
    "Client: It's terrifying, to be honest. But also... I feel a glimmer of hope? Like maybe there's a way through this mess. I... I want to keep going. It's not easy, but I think it's worth it.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is admirable. What support do you need moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I need to find some sober activities to replace the drinking. And maybe... could you help me find a veterans' support group? I'm not ready to share everything, but it might be good to be around people who understand.",
