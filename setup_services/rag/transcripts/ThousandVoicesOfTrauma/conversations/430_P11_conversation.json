    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Lee?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Revisiting those memories of being trafficked as a child... it's like I'm right back there in that cramped, dark room. The fear, the helplessness... it's so vivid.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most?",
    "Client: The smell. I hadn't remembered that before, but it hit me during the exposure. It was this mix of sweat, mold, and something else... chemical maybe? It made me feel sick then, and it's making me feel sick now.",
    "Therapist: How are you coping with that feeling?",
    "Client: I'm trying to remind myself I'm safe now, like we practiced. But it's hard. My heart's still racing, and I feel... I don't know, ashamed? Like I should have done something to stop it, even though I was just a kid.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to have those feelings. What else?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about the others. The other kids. We didn't talk much, but there was this... understanding between us. A shared pain. I wonder what happened to them. Did they make it out? Are they okay now? It's... it's hard not knowing.",
    "Therapist: How does thinking about them affect you?",
    "Client: It makes me angry. At the traffickers, at the world that let this happen. But it also makes me feel... I don't know, maybe determined? Like I survived for a reason, and I owe it to those who didn't make it to do something with my life.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How might you act on it?",
    "Client: I've been thinking about volunteering, maybe at a shelter for trafficking survivors. But then I worry... what if it's too much? What if it brings everything back?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. What might help you feel ready?",
    "Client: I guess... continuing this therapy, for one. It's hard, but I can feel it helping. And maybe talking to my wife about it more. She's been so supportive, but I've kept a lot from her. I'm starting to think that opening up might actually make me stronger.",
    "Therapist: That takes courage. How else has the exposure affected you?",
    "Client: It's strange, but I feel... lighter? Like I've been carrying this secret for so long, and now that I'm facing it, it's losing some of its power over me. Don't get me wrong, it's still awful, but... I don't feel as trapped by it.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I want to keep going with the exposures. It's tough, but I can see how it's helping. And... I think I'm ready to start addressing my substance use. I've been using it to numb these memories for so long, but maybe I don't need to anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a big step. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: Scared, honestly. But also... hopeful? For the first time in a long time, I feel like maybe I can actually heal. Not just cope, but really heal.",
    "Therapist: That's powerful. What will you focus on this week?",
    "Client: I want to practice the breathing exercises more. They really helped during the exposure. And... I think I'll talk to my wife about volunteering. Maybe she'd even want to do it with me.",
    "Therapist: Excellent plan. Anything else you want to discuss?",
    "Client: No, I think... I think I'm good for now. This was hard, but... thank you. For helping me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, definitely. I'll be here."
