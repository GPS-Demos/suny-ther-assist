    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Farah?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. It's strange, even though it happened years ago, reliving that hostage situation felt so real. My heart is still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The fear. The overwhelming fear. I remember the moment when the men burst into the bank, waving their guns. I can still hear the screams of the other customers. It's like... like I was right back there, you know?",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. Terrifying, really. But also... I don't know, maybe a little different this time? I felt scared, but I also felt... stronger, somehow. Like I knew I'd survived it once, so I could face it again. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Can you tell me more about that strength?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... I've spent so long trying to avoid thinking about it, you know? But going through it step by step, I realized that I actually did some things right. I stayed calm, I didn't provoke the robbers, I even managed to comfort the young woman next to me. I guess I'm... kind of proud of how I handled it?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How does this relate to your day-to-day life now?",
    "Client: I... I hadn't thought about it that way before. But maybe... maybe I'm stronger than I give myself credit for? I've been so focused on how scared I am all the time, how I jump at every little noise. But if I could be strong then, maybe I can be strong now too?",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent connection. How might you apply this?",
    "Client: I suppose... I could try to remember that strength when I'm feeling anxious? Like, when I'm avoiding going to the bank or other public places. I could remind myself that I've faced worse and come through it.",
    "Therapist: That's a great strategy. What else came up for you during the exposure?",
    "Client: I... I noticed how much anger I felt. Not just fear, but real anger at those men for putting us through that. And... and at myself, for still letting it affect me so much after all these years.",
    "Therapist: It's important to acknowledge those feelings. How do you feel about that anger now?",
    "Client: It's... it's complicated. Part of me feels like the anger is justified, but another part feels guilty for being angry. Like I should be over it by now, you know?",
    "Therapist: Many people struggle with similar feelings. How might we work with this?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe I need to learn to accept the anger? To understand that it's okay to still feel this way, even after all this time?",
    "Therapist: That's a thoughtful approach. How do you think this might help your recovery?",
    "Client: I think... if I can accept these feelings instead of fighting them or feeling guilty about them, maybe they won't have such a hold on me? Maybe I can start to move past them?",
    "Therapist: Excellent insight. How are you feeling about continuing with the exposures?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm nervous, definitely. But I also feel like I'm making progress. It's hard, but... I think it's worth it. I want to keep going.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is commendable. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... maybe we could work on my fear of going to the bank? I know it's not the same as the hostage situation, but it still triggers a lot of anxiety for me.",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss today?",
    "Client: I... I just wanted to say thank you. This isn't easy, but I feel like I'm finally starting to understand myself better. And... and I appreciate your support through all of this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Mrs. Farah. Your hard work is truly paying off."
