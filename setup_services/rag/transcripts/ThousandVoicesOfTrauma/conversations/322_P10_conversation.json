    "Therapist: Welcome back. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm feeling a bit jittery, to be honest. But I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 5 or 6 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath, and when you're ready, describe the animal attack, starting from the beginning.",
    "Client: Alright... I was on a hiking trail near the base. It was supposed to be a quick afternoon hike to clear my head after a tough training exercise. The air was crisp, and I remember the scent of pine needles. I had my hands in my pockets, lost in thought, when I heard a low growl...",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue in the present tense.",
    "Client: Right, sorry. I... I freeze. My heart starts racing. I slowly turn my head and see this massive brown bear about 20 feet away. It's standing on its hind legs, easily 7 or 8 feet tall. I can see its teeth, and its eyes... they're fixed right on me.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My mouth goes dry. I can feel my pulse pounding in my ears. My hands are shaking, and I'm breaking out in a cold sweat. I... I want to run, but I know that's the worst thing I could do.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: The bear drops to all fours and starts lumbering towards me. I'm trying to remember my training - make yourself big, speak calmly, back away slowly. But my voice comes out as a pathetic squeak. \"Hey bear, it's okay...\" My legs feel like jelly.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe a 7 or 8.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... The bear keeps coming. I'm fumbling for my bear spray, but my hands are shaking so badly. I trip over a root and fall backwards. The bear is right there now, looming over me. I can smell its hot, rancid breath. Its claws... they're like daggers. I curl into a ball, trying to protect my vitals. Then I feel this searing pain across my back as it swipes at me...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're doing great.",
    "Client: The pain... it's blinding. I can feel warm blood soaking through my shirt. I'm screaming, but it sounds distant, like it's not even me. The bear roars, and I'm certain this is it. I'm going to die here, alone in the woods. All my training, all my combat experience, and I'm helpless against this animal.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I think about my spouse. How they'll react when they get the news. I feel guilty for going on this hike alone. I'm angry at myself for not being more aware. And I'm terrified. So utterly terrified.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. Maybe even a 10.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here in the office.",
    "Client: Right... okay. The bear swipes at me again, catching my arm this time. I feel bones snap. The pain is excruciating. I'm sobbing now, a mix of pain and fear and desperation. I manage to reach my bear spray and aim it vaguely in the direction of the bear's face. I press down hard on the trigger...",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens then?",
    "Client: There's a hissing sound as the spray releases. The bear rears back, roaring in pain or anger, I'm not sure which. It's shaking its head violently. I take the chance to scramble away, half-crawling, half-running. My vision is blurry from tears and pain. I can hear the bear thrashing around behind me.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My heart is pounding so hard it hurts. I can almost smell the bear spray in the air.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm stumbling down the trail, one arm hanging uselessly at my side. Every step sends waves of pain through my back. I'm dizzy from blood loss, I think. I keep looking over my shoulder, terrified the bear is following me. I can hear my ragged breathing, punctuated by sobs.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: I... I finally see the trailhead. There's a couple getting out of their car. When they spot me, their eyes go wide with horror. The woman screams. The man rushes towards me, catching me just as my legs give out. I'm babbling incoherently about the bear, trying to warn them. The last thing I remember is the man calling for an ambulance before everything goes black.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Shaky. But also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved? Like a weight has been lifted.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's come down some. Maybe a 6 or 7 now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you name five things you see in the room?",
    "Client: Um, okay. I see... your desk, the bookshelf, the plant in the corner, the clock on the wall, and the painting behind you.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Now, four things you can touch?",
    "Client: The armrest of the chair, my jeans, my wedding ring, and... the texture of my shirt.",
    "Therapist: Good. Three things you hear?",
    "Client: The hum of the air conditioner, a car passing outside, and my own breathing.",
    "Therapist: Two things you smell?",
    "Client: Coffee... and maybe a hint of lavender?",
    "Therapist: And one thing you taste?",
    "Client: Just... the dryness in my mouth, I guess.",
    "Therapist: Well done. How do you feel now?",
