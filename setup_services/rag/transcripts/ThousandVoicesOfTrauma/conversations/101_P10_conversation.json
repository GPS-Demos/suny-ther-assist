    "Therapist: Welcome, James. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit jittery, to be honest. I know we're going to be talking about the cyclone, and that's making me feel a bit on edge.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Just give me a second to... to get centered.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. When you're ready, start describing the day of the cyclone.",
    "Client: Okay... It was a Tuesday. I remember because I had just finished a morning lecture. The sky was this weird, greenish-gray color. The air felt... heavy, you know? Like you could cut it with a knife. I was walking back to my car when my phone started blaring with emergency alerts.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happened next?",
    "Client: I... I froze for a second. My heart started racing. People around me were panicking, running. I could hear the wind picking up, trees starting to creak and groan. I knew I needed to get home, but I was scared to drive.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Uh... maybe a 40? My palms are getting sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Right... So, I got in my car. The rain was coming down in sheets by then. I could barely see the road. I was gripping the steering wheel so tight my knuckles were white. Every gust of wind felt like it was going to flip my car over.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: I... I can hear the wind howling. It sounds like a freight train. There's debris flying everywhere - branches, trash cans, even a roof tile smashed into the car next to me at a stoplight. I'm terrified, but I know I have to keep going.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's higher. Maybe 60? My heart's pounding just like it was that day.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here. What happened as you got closer to home?",
    "Client: The roads were starting to flood. I saw a car stalled out, water up to its windows. I... I wanted to stop and help, but I was too scared. God, I feel awful about that. There was a family inside, I think.",
    "Therapist: It's okay, James. You were in survival mode. Keep going.",
    "Client: Right... I finally made it to my street. Trees were down everywhere. I had to swerve around them. When I got home, Dad was trying to board up the windows. Mum was inside, crying. I've never seen her like that before.",
    "Therapist: How does seeing your mother cry make you feel?",
    "Client: Terrified. Helpless. If Mum's scared, then it must be really bad, right? I... I remember thinking we were all going to die.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's pretty high now. Maybe 75? My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. Remember, you survived this.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. We huddled in the bathroom - me, Mum, Dad, and our dog. The noise was unbelievable. It sounded like the house was being torn apart. I could hear glass shattering, things crashing. The dog was whimpering, and Mum was praying under her breath.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, James. Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: I... I can feel the walls shaking. The power's out, and it's pitch black. I'm holding onto Mum's hand so tight. There's water starting to seep under the door. I'm thinking about all the people I saw on the road, wondering if they're okay. If they made it home.",
    "Therapist: What were you feeling in that moment?",
    "Client: Absolute terror. Guilt about not helping that family. Anger that this was happening to us. And... and a weird sort of calm? Like, if this is how it ends, at least we're together.",
    "Therapist: That's a complex mix of emotions. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's pretty high. Maybe 85? I feel like I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Focus on your breathing. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm... I'm trying.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: The worst part... the worst part was the waiting. We were in that bathroom for hours. The storm just kept going and going. Every crash, every bang... I thought it was going to be the last thing I ever heard. I kept imagining the roof coming off, or the walls collapsing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: I... I can still smell it. The damp, the mold, the fear. It's like... it's like it's burned into my brain. And then, suddenly, it was quiet. So quiet it was almost worse than the noise. We were afraid to open the door, afraid of what we'd find.",
    "Therapist: What did you find when you opened the door?",
    "Client: Destruction. Just... utter destruction. Half the roof was gone. There was water everywhere. Our living room... it was just gone. Open to the sky. I remember stepping on broken glass, seeing our family photos scattered and ruined. And outside... God, outside was even worse.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, James?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My distress is probably around 90. It's like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, James. This is just a memory. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm trying. It's just... it's so vivid.",
    "Therapist: I know. You're doing great. Can you describe what you saw outside?",
    "Client: It was like a war zone. Trees uprooted, power lines down. Cars overturned. Our neighbor's house... half of it was just gone. And there were people... people wandering around in shock. Some were crying, some were just staring. I saw Mr. Johnson from next door sitting on what was left of his porch, bleeding from a cut on his head.",
    "Therapist: What did you do?",
    "Client: I... I went to help him. Got him a towel for his head. But I felt so useless. There was so much damage, so many people hurt. And all I could do was hand out towels and water bottles. It didn't feel like enough.",
    "Therapist: But you did help. How does that make you feel now?",
    "Client: I... I guess I feel a little better about it. But also guilty that I couldn't do more. And scared... scared that it could happen again. That next time, we might not be so lucky.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings, James. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe 75? I'm still shaky, but talking about it... it helps, I think.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well today. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: Okay... yeah, that sounds good. I feel... I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've let some of it out.",
    "Therapist: That's a good sign. Let's focus on your breathing for a moment.",
    "Client: Right... in through the nose, out through the mouth. I can do that.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Now, can you name five things you can see in this room?",
    "Client: Um... the blue chair, the plant in the corner, your desk lamp, the clock on the wall, and the painting of the ocean.",
    "Therapist: Good. How about four things you can touch?",
    "Client: The armrest of my chair, my jeans, my watch, and... the carpet under my feet.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Three things you can hear?",
    "Client: The ticking of the clock, traffic outside, and... the hum of the air conditioner.",
    "Therapist: Two things you can smell?",
    "Client: Coffee... and maybe some kind of air freshener? Like lavender or something?",
    "Therapist: And finally, one thing you can taste?",
    "Client: Just... the lingering taste of the mint gum I was chewing earlier.",
    "Therapist: Excellent job, James. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Better... definitely better. My heart's not racing anymore. I feel more... here, I guess? Less caught up in the memory.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Remember, you can use this grounding technique anytime you feel overwhelmed.",
    "Client: Yeah, I will. It really helps. I... I didn't think I could talk about the cyclone like that. It's always felt too big, too scary.",
    "Therapist: You showed incredible strength today. How do you feel about what we've accomplished?",
    "Client: I feel... proud, I guess? And a little surprised. It was hard, really hard, but... I did it. And I feel like maybe... maybe I can face this. Maybe I can get better.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent outlook, James. You should be proud. We'll continue to work through this in our future sessions.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I'm actually looking forward to it. Well, maybe not looking forward to it, but... I feel like I can do it now. Like there's hope.",
    "Therapist: There absolutely is hope. You've taken a big step today. How about we end our session here?",
    "Client: Yeah, that sounds good. I'm pretty wiped out, to be honest. But in a good way, if that makes sense?",
    "Therapist: It makes perfect sense. Take care of yourself for the rest of the day, James. You've done some hard work.",
    "Client: I will. Thanks... thanks for everything. See you next week?",
    "Therapist: See you next week. Take care, James."
