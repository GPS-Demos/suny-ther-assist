    "Therapist: Alright, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Can you give me your initial SUDS rating before we start?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but not overwhelmed yet.",
    "Therapist: Okay, thank you. Let's begin. Close your eyes and recall the memory.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) I'm back there... in the commune. It's dark, and I can smell incense burning. The leader is speaking, his voice echoing off the walls. I feel... small. Insignificant.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My heart's starting to race a bit. The room feels stuffy, just like it did back then. I can almost taste the fear in my mouth.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. I'm feeling more anxious, remembering how trapped I felt.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Keep going.",
    "Client: The leader is saying we need to cut ties with our families. That they're holding us back from true enlightenment. I remember feeling so conflicted. Part of me wanted to believe him, to belong somewhere. But another part was screaming inside, telling me this was wrong.",
    "Therapist: How are your anxiety levels?",
    "Client: They're climbing. Maybe a 7 now. My palms are sweaty, and I feel a tightness in my chest.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: I see myself nodding along with the others, even though inside I'm terrified. I don't want to lose my family, but I'm too scared to speak up. The leader's eyes seem to bore into me, like he can read my doubts.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. I feel like I can't breathe. Just like I did then. It's like the walls are closing in on me.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Inhales shakily) I'm trying. But I can hear his voice so clearly. He's telling us that doubt is the enemy, that we need to purge ourselves of it. I remember feeling so ashamed of my doubts, like there was something wrong with me.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: My muscles are tense. I feel like I need to run, but I'm frozen in place. Just like I was back then.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's still an 8. Maybe edging towards a 9. I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I see myself after the meeting, lying in my bunk. I'm curled up, trying to make myself as small as possible. I'm silently crying, missing my family, feeling so alone. But I don't dare let anyone see. I'm terrified they'll report me to the leader.",
    "Therapist: And now?",
    "Client: I... I think it's starting to come down a bit. Maybe a 7. I'm remembering that I eventually got out. That I'm not there anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You're safe now.",
    "Client: Yeah. (Exhales slowly) I made it out. It was hard, but I did it. I'm not that scared, helpless person anymore.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Better. My heart's slowing down. I'd say I'm back to about a 5 now. Still anxious, but not overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: Well done. You've made great progress today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to talk about, but it feels... I don't know, less powerful somehow. Like facing it makes it lose some of its hold on me.",
    "Therapist: That's often how it works. Shall we end here?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that's enough for today. I feel drained, but also... lighter, if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: It does. We'll pick this up next session."
