    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Carlos?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling pretty shaken up, to be honest. It's like I was right back there in that moment, you know? The screeching tires, the impact, the smell of gasoline... it all felt so real. My heart's still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. I keep replaying the moment when I saw the other car coming towards us, and I just... couldn't do anything. I was frozen. And then the sound of my daughter crying in the backseat... God, that still haunts me.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was tough, really tough. But... I don't know, maybe a little different this time? Like, I could feel my body tensing up, but I was also aware that I was here, in this room. It's weird, but I felt a little more in control, even while reliving it.",
    "Therapist: That's an important observation. How does this compare to previous times?",
    "Client: Well, before, it was like I was completely lost in the memory. This time, there was a part of me that knew it was just a memory. Don't get me wrong, it was still scary as hell, but... I guess I felt a bit stronger? Like I could handle it better.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress, Carlos. What do you make of that change?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe it's because we've been working on this for a while now? Or maybe it's because I'm starting to believe that I can face this without completely falling apart. It's still hard, but... I don't know, maybe I'm getting stronger?",
    "Therapist: How might this relate to your daily life?",
    "Client: Hm... I guess it could mean that I might be able to handle my reactions better when something triggers me? Like, maybe I won't panic as much when I hear a car horn or have to drive past the accident site. That would be... that would be huge, actually.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing about your reactions?",
    "Client: I noticed that my pain flared up during the memory, especially in my back where I was injured. But it didn't last as long this time. And I was able to use that breathing technique you taught me, which helped a bit. It's like... I'm more aware of my body's responses now.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. How does this awareness affect you?",
    "Client: It makes me feel more... I don't know, empowered? Like I'm not just a victim of my memories and pain anymore. I mean, don't get me wrong, it's still hard. But I feel like I'm starting to have some tools to deal with it. It's... it's a good feeling.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on next?",
    "Client: I think... I want to work on being able to talk about the accident with my family. Especially with my daughter. She doesn't remember much, she was so young, but she knows it affected me. I want to be able to discuss it without breaking down. Do you think that's possible?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How do you feel about that goal?",
    "Client: Nervous, but also... hopeful? I mean, a few weeks ago, I couldn't even think about the accident without having a panic attack. Now we're talking about me discussing it with my family. That's... that's pretty big, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: It certainly is. What does this progress mean to you?",
    "Client: It means... it means I might actually get my life back. I might be able to drive my daughter to school again, or go on a family road trip without being terrified. It means I might stop letting this accident control my life. I... I really want that. I want to be the husband and father my family deserves.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful motivation. How can we build on today's session?",
    "Client: I think I want to keep doing these exposures. They're tough, but I can see they're helping. And maybe... maybe we could start working on how to have that conversation with my family? Like, what to say, how to manage my emotions if they get overwhelming. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll work on that. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. Tired, but okay. Maybe even a little proud of myself? I never thought I'd say that after talking about the accident. Thank you, doc. I know we still have a long way to go, but... I think I'm starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. We'll continue next week?",
    "Client: Definitely. I'll be here. Thanks again, doc. See you next week."
