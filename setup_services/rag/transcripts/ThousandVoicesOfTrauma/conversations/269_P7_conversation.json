    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the cult experience you mentioned?",
    "Client: Okay... It was about three years ago. I was going through a tough time after my divorce and was feeling lost. A friend invited me to this group meeting, saying it would help me find purpose. At first, it seemed harmless - just people talking about self-improvement and spirituality. But gradually, things started to change...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: The leader, a charismatic man in his 50s, began to exert more control over our lives. He told us to cut ties with family and friends who weren't part of the group. He said they were \"negative influences.\" I was hesitant, but I felt so connected to the group that I started distancing myself from my loved ones. It's hard to admit, but I even reduced contact with my kids...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel uncomfortable. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) The guilt is overwhelming sometimes. Anyway, the leader insisted we all live together in this compound outside the city. He said it was for our \"spiritual growth.\" That's when things got really intense. We had to work long hours in the fields, barely slept, and were constantly told that the outside world was evil and only he could protect us.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that memory. You're doing great.",
    "Client: (taking a deep breath) One day, I overheard the leader talking about a \"purification ritual\" involving underage members. That was my breaking point. I couldn't be part of something like that. I managed to sneak out one night and called my sister to pick me up. I was terrified they'd find me, but I knew I had to leave.",
    "Therapist: You showed incredible strength. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm shaking a bit. It's hard to talk about this. I feel ashamed for falling for their manipulation, angry at the leader, and scared that they might still be out there hurting people.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are natural. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: Thanks. After I left, I struggled with depression and trust issues. I couldn't believe how easily I'd been manipulated. It took me a long time to reconnect with my family and rebuild my life. The hardest part was forgiving myself and accepting that I wasn't weak for falling for their tactics.",
    "Therapist: You've come a long way. Keep going.",
    "Client: Now, three years later, I'm in a much better place. I've repaired my relationships with my kids and family. I'm even in a new relationship, which felt impossible for a long time. But sometimes, I still have nightmares about being trapped in that compound. And I worry about the people I left behind...",
    "Therapist: It's normal to have those concerns. You're safe now.",
    "Client: Yeah, I know. I've tried to report the group to authorities, but without concrete evidence of illegal activities, there's not much they can do. It's frustrating. I want to help others who might be in the same situation, but I'm also scared of drawing attention to myself. What if they try to retaliate?",
    "Therapist: Your safety is important. We can discuss ways to help safely.",
    "Client: You're right. I've been thinking about anonymously sharing my story online or volunteering with cult survivor support groups. Maybe that could help someone else recognize the warning signs and get out before it's too late. It's just... talking about it brings back so many memories and emotions.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: (sighs) Sometimes I wonder how different my life would be if I hadn't joined that group. Would I still be struggling after my divorce? Or would I have found a healthier way to cope? It's hard not to dwell on the \"what ifs,\" you know?",
    "Therapist: Focus on the present. You've made significant progress.",
    "Client: You're right. I need to remind myself of how far I've come. It's just difficult sometimes, especially when something triggers those memories. Like last week, I saw a flyer for a \"spiritual retreat\" that sounded eerily similar to how my group started. It sent me into a panic attack. I had to call my partner to calm me down.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're doing well in managing it.",
    "Client: Thanks. I'm trying to use the coping strategies we've discussed. Deep breathing helps a lot. And reminding myself that I'm safe now, that I have people who care about me. It's just... the fear of being manipulated again is always there, lurking in the back of my mind. How do I fully trust people again?",
    "Therapist: Trust takes time. Be patient with yourself.",
    "Client: I guess you're right. It's a process. I'm grateful for the support system I have now. My partner has been incredibly understanding, even when I wake up in the middle of the night from nightmares. And my kids... they've forgiven me for the time I was distant. That means everything to me.",
    "Therapist: Your progress is commendable. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: A bit drained, to be honest. Talking about this always takes a lot out of me. But also... I feel a sense of relief? Like each time I talk about it, it loses a bit of its power over me. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: That's a positive sign. You're processing well.",
    "Client: I hope so. I want to get to a point where thinking about this doesn't affect me so much. Where I can use my experience to help others without feeling overwhelmed by fear or guilt. Do you think that's possible?",
    "Therapist: It's possible. You're making great strides already.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot to hear. I know I still have a long way to go, but I'm committed to this process. I want to reclaim my life fully, you know? To not let that experience define me or limit what I can do. It's just... sometimes it feels like such a huge mountain to climb.",
    "Therapist: Take it one step at a time. You're doing well.",
    "Client: You're right. One step at a time. I need to remember that. It's easy to get overwhelmed when I think about everything at once. But I've already come so far from where I was three years ago. I guess I just need to keep moving forward, keep working on myself, and trust that it will get easier with time.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. You're showing great resilience.",
    "Client: Thank you. I really appreciate your support through all of this. It's not easy to talk about, but I know it's necessary for my healing. I just hope that one day, I can look back on this experience without feeling this mix of fear, shame, and anger. That I can fully embrace the person I am now, shaped by my experiences but not defined by them.",
    "Therapist: That's a healthy perspective. We'll continue working towards that."
