    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Thompson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Oh, hello Dr. Roberts. I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. A bit anxious, I suppose. This whole therapy process is still new to me, even after a few sessions. I've never really talked about my experiences as a refugee before, let alone the bullying I endured. It's all quite overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you familiar with it?",
    "Client: Not really, no. I've heard you mention it before, but I'm not quite sure what it entails. Is it... is it going to be difficult? I'm already feeling a bit on edge just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: It can be challenging, but it's a crucial step in your healing. Shall I explain more?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I'd like to know what I'm getting into. You know, at my age, I thought I'd left all these painful memories behind. But they seem to be haunting me more than ever lately, especially with my depression. It's like they're all tangled up together.",
    "Therapist: Imaginal exposure involves revisiting your traumatic memories in a safe environment. It helps process them.",
    "Client: Revisit them? You mean... I have to relive those experiences? I'm not sure I can do that, Dr. Roberts. The thought alone makes me feel sick to my stomach. How is that supposed to help?",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel apprehensive. The goal is to reduce the power these memories hold over you.",
    "Client: I see. But what if it makes things worse? I've spent years trying to forget all of this. The bullying, the fear, the uncertainty of being a refugee... it's all so painful. And now, with my depression, I'm afraid it might push me over the edge.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace, and I'll support you throughout. How does that sound?",
    "Client: Well, I suppose if you're here with me, it might be okay. But what exactly will we be doing? And how long will it take? I'm not sure how much I can handle in one session.",
    "Therapist: We'll start with a specific memory. You'll describe it in detail, in the present tense, for about 30-45 minutes.",
    "Client: That long? Oh my. I'm not sure I can talk about it for that long. What if I get too upset or can't continue? And why the present tense? That seems... well, quite frightening, actually.",
    "Therapist: If it becomes too much, we can pause. The present tense helps fully process the memory. Your safety is my priority.",
    "Client: I appreciate that, Dr. Roberts. I'm still nervous, but knowing we can stop if needed helps. I suppose this is necessary for my recovery, isn't it? Even at my age, I guess it's never too late to face these things.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. Your courage is admirable. This process can significantly reduce your PTSD symptoms. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm scared, but I'm also tired of letting these memories control me. My children have been worried about me, you know. I want to get better for them, and for myself. So yes, let's do this. But please, be patient with me if I struggle.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Your resilience is inspiring. Let's start when you're comfortable. Remember, you're safe here."
