    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the severe illness you experienced?",
    "Client: Okay... I was 12 years old when I got really sick. It started with a fever and intense stomach pain. My parents... they didn't think it was serious at first. They told me to sleep it off, that I was probably just trying to get out of school. But the pain kept getting worse, and I felt so weak...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I remember lying in bed, crying from the pain. My mom finally came to check on me, and she looked scared when she saw how pale I was. They rushed me to the hospital, but by then, I was barely conscious. The doctors said it was appendicitis, and my appendix had ruptured. I needed emergency surgery.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that memory. How did you feel?",
    "Client: I felt... abandoned. Terrified. The pain was excruciating, but what hurt more was that my parents hadn't believed me. I thought I was going to die, and they had ignored me for so long. I remember the bright lights of the operating room, the mask being put over my face, and thinking, \"What if I never wake up?\"",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. It's okay to feel those emotions.",
    "Client: After the surgery, I was in the hospital for weeks. My parents were there, but I felt so angry and hurt. They kept apologizing, saying they should have listened, but I couldn't forgive them. I had nightmares about being left alone, about dying in pain while everyone ignored me. Even now, when I get sick, I feel that same panic...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The recovery was slow and painful. I missed so much school, and when I went back, I felt different from everyone else. I couldn't trust my parents the same way anymore. I became hyper-vigilant about my health, always worried that something was wrong and no one would believe me. It's like a part of me is still that scared, sick little girl, waiting for someone to finally listen.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Continue sharing your experience.",
    "Client: As I got older, I struggled with relationships. I had trouble trusting people, always worried they'd abandon me when I needed them most. I became a perfectionist, thinking if I was perfect, people would have to take me seriously. But it's exhausting, always being on guard, always trying to prove I'm worth caring about. Sometimes, when I'm sick now, I still feel that old fear creeping in, that no one will believe me, that I'll be left alone to suffer...",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job. How do you feel right now?",
    "Client: I feel... shaky. My heart is racing, and I can almost feel that old pain in my stomach. But I also feel... relieved, in a way. Like I'm finally acknowledging how much this affected me. It's scary to talk about, but also... freeing? I've carried this for so long, always pushing it down, trying to forget. But maybe... maybe it's time to face it.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're very brave.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to feel brave when I think about how much this still affects me. I wonder if I'll ever fully trust anyone, or if I'll always have this fear of being abandoned when I'm vulnerable. But talking about it... it makes it feel less overwhelming. Like maybe I can start to separate who I am now from that scared little girl in the hospital bed.",
    "Therapist: You're making great progress. Let's continue.",
    "Client: I think the hardest part is forgiving my parents. Logically, I know they didn't mean to hurt me, that they made a mistake. But emotionally, it's like there's this wall between us. Every time I get sick, or my kids get sick, I feel this surge of anger towards them. I'm hyper-vigilant with my own children, always worried I'll miss something important. It's exhausting, but I can't seem to let it go. I want to move past this, but it's like the fear and hurt are etched into my bones.",
    "Therapist: You're handling these emotions well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Sometimes I wonder who I'd be if this hadn't happened. Would I be more trusting? Less anxious? I've built my whole life around being self-reliant, never wanting to depend on anyone else for fear they'll let me down. But it's lonely, you know? Always being on guard, always waiting for the other shoe to drop. I want to be able to relax, to trust, to not panic every time I feel a twinge of pain. I want to forgive my parents, and myself, for what happened. I just... I don't know how to let go of this fear.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an incredible job. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also lighter somehow. Talking about it, really facing these memories and feelings, it's like I'm seeing them clearly for the first time. It hurts, but it's a different kind of pain. Not the sharp, overwhelming fear I usually feel, but something... softer? Like maybe there's hope that I can work through this. I'm scared, but I also feel a little stronger. Like maybe I can face this and come out the other side. Is that... is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Your feelings are valid.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think... I think I'm ready to start working on this. To try and let go of some of this fear and anger. It won't be easy, I know that. But for the first time in a long time, I feel like maybe I can do it. Maybe I can learn to trust again, to not always expect the worst. I want to be able to enjoy life without this constant shadow hanging over me. I want to be present for my family without always worrying about what might go wrong. It's scary, but... I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength today. Well done."
