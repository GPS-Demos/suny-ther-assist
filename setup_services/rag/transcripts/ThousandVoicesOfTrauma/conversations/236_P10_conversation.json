    "Therapist: Welcome, Aisha. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, honestly. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is scared. It's weird being here, talking about this stuff with someone so much older than me.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start slowly. Can you tell me about the cyber bullying incident?",
    "Client: Um, okay. It started a few months ago, after I got back from my deployment. I was trying to reconnect with old friends online, you know? But then...",
    "Therapist: Take your time. What happened next?",
    "Client: These messages started coming in. At first, I thought it was just trolls, but then they got really personal. They knew things about my time overseas, about... about what happened there.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, on a scale of 0 to 100?",
    "Client: Maybe... 60? My heart's racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. Can you describe one of the messages?",
    "Client: There was this one... it said, \"How does it feel to be a baby killer?\" And there was a photo... a photo of a bombed-out building. It looked just like... (voice breaks)",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Aisha. Stay with that moment. What are you seeing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm looking at my phone. The screen is so bright in the dark. I can see that building, all rubble and smoke. And I remember... oh god, I remember the sounds...",
    "Therapist: What sounds do you hear?",
    "Client: Screaming. Children screaming. And this high-pitched ringing in my ears from the explosion. It's like I'm right back there...",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Aisha. Take another deep breath. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 80. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing great. Can you ground yourself? What do you feel beneath you?",
    "Client: The... the chair. It's soft. And cool. I can feel the armrests under my hands.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, can you continue? What happened after you saw that message?",
    "Client: I felt sick. Like, physically ill. I ran to the bathroom and threw up. And then I just... I couldn't stop crying. It was like everything I'd been holding in just came pouring out.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, describing this?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. But I'm here. Maybe 75?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What thoughts were going through your mind?",
    "Client: I kept thinking, \"They're right. I am a monster.\" And then I'd remember the faces of those kids we couldn't save, and it was like... like I was drowning in guilt.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. It's hard to breathe. And I keep wanting to check my phone, even though I know those messages aren't there anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. Can you tell me more about the urge to check your phone?",
    "Client: It's like... I'm scared of what I might see, but I can't stop looking. Every notification makes me jump. I'm always on edge, waiting for the next attack.",
    "Therapist: How does that affect your daily life?",
    "Client: I can barely sleep. I'm always exhausted. And I've stopped talking to most of my friends because... because what if they find out? What if they think I'm a monster too?",
    "Therapist: You're not a monster, Aisha. How does it feel to hear that?",
    "Client: I... I want to believe you. But it's hard. Those messages, they got into my head. It's like they confirmed everything I was already afraid of.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: Maybe 70? It's... it's actually a little better, talking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Can you tell me about a specific moment when you felt overwhelmed by these messages?",
    "Client: There was this one night... I'd been drinking, which I know I shouldn't do, but... Anyway, I got a new message. It had pictures of me from before the deployment, side by side with... with pictures of injured civilians. The caption said, \"Look what you've become.\"",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you see, hear, feel?",
    "Client: I see... I see my old self. Smiling, innocent. And then... blood. So much blood. I hear myself sobbing, and... and I can smell the alcohol on my breath. My whole body feels heavy, like I can't move.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Aisha. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I smashed my phone. Just threw it against the wall. And then I curled up on the floor and... and I couldn't stop shaking. I felt so alone, so... so worthless.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. How are you feeling now, remembering this?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. My heart's pounding. But... but I'm here. I'm safe. It's... it's just a memory.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. You're safe now. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: Maybe... 65? It's going down, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Can you tell me about the aftermath of that night?",
    "Client: I... I didn't leave my apartment for days. I was too scared to get a new phone. I felt so isolated, but... but also relieved, in a way? Like, at least they couldn't reach me anymore.",
    "Therapist: How did that isolation affect you?",
    "Client: It was... it was awful. I missed my friends, my family. But I was so afraid of facing them, of them finding out what had happened. I felt like I was disappearing.",
    "Therapist: That sounds very challenging. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's strange. Talking about it is hard, but... but I feel like I'm starting to see it from the outside, you know? Like, I can see how much those messages messed with my head.",
    "Therapist: That's a great observation. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: Maybe... 55? It's definitely lower.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Aisha. Can you tell me about the moment you decided to seek help?",
    "Client: It was... it was after I'd been isolated for about a week. My mom came to check on me. She was so worried. And seeing her face, how much she cared... it broke something in me. I just... I broke down and told her everything.",
    "Therapist: That must have been a powerful moment. How did it feel?",
    "Client: It was... it was like this huge weight lifted off me. I mean, I was still scared and messed up, but... but I wasn't alone anymore. And that... that made all the difference.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant realization. How does it feel to share this now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually kind of empowering? Like, I can talk about this stuff without falling apart. I mean, it still hurts, but... but I'm stronger than I thought.",
    "Therapist: You absolutely are. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: I'd say... maybe 45? It's the lowest it's been this whole time.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress, Aisha. How do you feel about what we've covered today?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel drained, but in a good way? Like, I've let out some of the poison. And... and I feel like maybe I can start to move forward now.",
    "Therapist: That's a great perspective. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for not judging. It means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Aisha. You've done incredible work today. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. Tired, but... but hopeful, I guess? Like maybe things can get better.",
    "Therapist: That's a wonderful note to end on. We'll continue this work in our next session."
