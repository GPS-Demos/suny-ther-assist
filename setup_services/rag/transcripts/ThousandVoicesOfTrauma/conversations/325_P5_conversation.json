    "Therapist: Welcome, Priya. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been thinking about our last session a lot, and I'm not sure I'm ready for this.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... the idea of reliving that moment when I saw my parents fighting so violently, it's terrifying. I've spent years trying to forget it, and now you want me to remember it in detail? I'm worried it'll set me back, especially with everything else going on with my own marriage.",
    "Therapist: I hear your fears. How about we discuss the purpose of this exercise?",
    "Client: Okay, that might help. I mean, I trust you, but I'm still scared. It's not just about remembering, you know? It's like... I can still hear the shouting, the sound of things breaking. I'm afraid I'll be right back there, feeling as helpless as I did when I was a child.",
    "Therapist: That's a valid concern. The goal is to process those memories, not re-traumatize you.",
    "Client: Process them? How? It feels like opening Pandora's box. And with my own marriage on shaky ground, I'm worried this will just make everything worse. I've been having more nightmares lately, and I'm not sure if it's because of our therapy or because of the tension at home.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Imaginal exposure helps by allowing you to confront memories in a safe environment.",
    "Client: A safe environment... that's hard to imagine when we're talking about something so scary. But I want to get better, for myself and for my kids. I don't want them to grow up with a mom who's always on edge, always waiting for the other shoe to drop. Can you tell me more about what exactly we'll be doing?",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll guide you through recalling the memory, focusing on details and emotions.",
    "Client: Okay... that sounds intense. Will you be there the whole time? I'm worried I might... I don't know, lose control or something. Sometimes when I think about that night, I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'll be here throughout, ensuring your safety and comfort.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I guess I'm just scared of what might come up. What if I remember things I've forgotten? Or what if I can't handle it and have a breakdown? I've been trying so hard to keep it together, especially at work and with my kids.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel apprehensive. We'll go at your pace and can stop anytime.",
    "Client: Okay, that helps. I appreciate that you're not rushing me. Can I ask... have you done this with other clients before? How did they cope?",
    "Therapist: Yes, many times. Most find it challenging but ultimately beneficial in reducing PTSD symptoms.",
    "Client: That's encouraging to hear. I guess I'm ready to try, even though I'm scared. What should I expect to feel during and after the session?",
    "Therapist: You may experience strong emotions, but they'll subside. We'll work through them together.",
    "Client: Alright. I'm still nervous, but I think I understand better now why we're doing this. It's not just about remembering, it's about processing and moving forward, right? I want that. I want to be able to think about my childhood without feeling paralyzed by fear.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. Your courage is commendable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do it. I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Thank you for being patient with me and explaining everything. It really helps to know you'll be here with me through this.",
