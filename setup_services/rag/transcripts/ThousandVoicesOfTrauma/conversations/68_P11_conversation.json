    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Patel?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's not easy revisiting that home invasion. Even though it happened years ago, it still feels so vivid in my mind. I can still hear the sound of the glass breaking downstairs, and my heart racing as I realized someone was in the house.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you most about the experience today?",
    "Client: Well, I think... it was the feeling of helplessness. I remember hiding in the closet, trying to make myself as small as possible. I was so afraid they would find me. I kept thinking about my grandchildren's photos on the nightstand and how I couldn't protect them if the intruders took them. It's silly, I know, but in that moment, it felt so real and important.",
    "Therapist: Not silly at all. How did it feel to go through that memory again?",
    "Client: It was... challenging. My hands are still a bit shaky, see? But, um, I noticed something different this time. I felt scared, yes, but I also felt... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I could observe the memory without being completely overwhelmed by it. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. That's progress. What do you think has changed?",
    "Client: I suppose... well, I've been practicing those breathing exercises you taught me. And I tried to remind myself that I'm safe now, that it's just a memory. It's still difficult, but I feel like I have a bit more control over my reactions. It's not controlling me as much as it used to.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent insight. How might this relate to your day-to-day life?",
    "Client: Hmm... I guess it means I might be able to handle stress better? Like when I hear unexpected noises at night, maybe I can use these techniques to stay calmer. Oh! And perhaps I won't need to triple-check the locks so often. That would be nice, wouldn't it?",
    "Therapist: Indeed. How do you feel about continuing with the exposures?",
    "Client: I'm... nervous, but also a bit hopeful. It's hard work, and sometimes I wonder if I'm too old to be dealing with this. But then I think about how nice it would be to feel safe in my own home again, to not jump at every little sound. I want that for myself, you know? And for my family. They worry about me so much.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is admirable. What's one thing you'd like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I'd like to work on feeling more in control during the memory. Like, reminding myself that I survived, that I'm strong. And perhaps... well, this might sound odd, but I'd like to imagine what I would say to comfort my younger self in that moment. Is that something we could try?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. That's a great idea. Anything else you'd like to share?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For your patience. I know I'm not the easiest patient, with all my worries and questions. But I feel like I'm finally making some progress, even if it's small steps. It means a lot to have someone listen and understand, especially at my age when people often dismiss our problems.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your courage is inspiring. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. I'm feeling a bit drained, but also... lighter, if that makes sense. Like I've put down a heavy bag I've been carrying for a while. I'm looking forward to our next session, even if it's a bit scary. Thank you again, doctor.",
    "Therapist: Take care, Mrs. Patel. I'll see you next week."
