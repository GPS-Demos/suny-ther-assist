    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important. Let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day of the car accident. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm driving down Main Street. It's a sunny afternoon, and I'm on my way to pick up my daughter from soccer practice. The radio is playing softly in the background. I'm feeling relaxed, just thinking about my day...",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: Suddenly, I hear screeching tires. My heart starts racing. I look to my left and see this huge truck barreling towards the intersection. It's not slowing down. I realize it's going to run the red light. I grip the steering wheel tightly, my knuckles turning white. I try to swerve, but there's no time...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 6. My palms are getting sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: The truck slams into the passenger side of my car. There's this deafening crash, and I feel my body jerk violently. Glass is shattering everywhere. I can smell burning rubber and something metallic - probably blood. My ears are ringing, and for a moment, everything goes black...",
    "Therapist: And now?",
    "Client: It's... it's like I'm right back there. My heart is pounding so hard. I feel dizzy, like I can't catch my breath. The fear is overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's an 8 now. Maybe even a 9. God, this is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it. What happens after the impact?",
    "Client: I... I come to, and everything's eerily quiet. The airbag has deployed, and there's dust everywhere. I can taste blood in my mouth. I'm terrified to move. What if I'm seriously hurt? What if I can't get out? Then I hear people shouting outside. Someone's calling for an ambulance...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, like there's a weight pressing down on it. I'm shaking a little. But... I also feel a tiny bit of relief, knowing help is coming in the memory.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 7 now.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're managing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: The paramedics arrive. They're asking me questions, shining lights in my eyes. I keep thinking about my daughter - who's going to pick her up? Is she going to be scared when I don't show up? They're cutting me out of the car now. I feel so helpless...",
    "Therapist: And now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a mix of emotions. There's still fear, but also frustration and sadness. It's like I'm reliving the loss of control I felt that day.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's hovering around 6. The intensity has lessened a bit.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: They load me into the ambulance. The sirens are wailing, and I can feel every bump and turn. I'm strapped down, can't move. The paramedic is talking to me, trying to keep me calm, but I can see the worry in his eyes. I start to panic, thinking about all the worst-case scenarios...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. My throat feels tight, like I can't swallow. But I also feel a strange sense of... I don't know, maybe acceptance? Like I'm starting to process what happened.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's about a 5 now. Still uncomfortable, but not as overwhelming as before.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's continue for a few more minutes.",
    "Client: Okay. We arrive at the hospital. There's a flurry of activity - doctors, nurses, machines beeping. They're cutting off my clothes, attaching monitors. I hear them talking about possible internal injuries. I'm scared, but also feeling oddly detached, like I'm watching it happen to someone else...",
    "Therapist: And how do you feel now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. My breathing has steadied. I feel a little shaky, but also... stronger? Like I've faced this memory and come out the other side.",
    "Therapist: Final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to a 3 now. I feel drained, but also relieved.",
