    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart's still racing, and I feel this tightness in my chest. The memory of that earthquake... it's so vivid now. I can still hear the rumbling, feel the ground shaking beneath my feet. It's like I'm right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: What's the most prominent emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... guilt? I remember feeling so helpless, watching buildings crumble and people running in panic. I froze. I couldn't move, couldn't help anyone. I just stood there, paralyzed.",
    "Therapist: It's common to feel that way in such intense situations. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... what if I had done something? What if I had helped someone? Maybe I could have made a difference. But then I remind myself that I was just a kid, you know? I was only 15 when it happened. But still, that guilt... it's eating away at me.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your broader experience with trauma?",
    "Client: I guess... it's similar to how I felt during the emotional abuse at home. That same sense of helplessness, of being frozen and unable to act. It's like I'm always stuck, always failing to protect myself or others. And then I beat myself up about it afterwards, replaying every moment and thinking about what I should have done differently.",
    "Therapist: I hear you're being quite hard on yourself. How does your body feel right now?",
    "Client: My muscles are so tense. My jaw is clenched, and I can feel this knot in my stomach. It's like my body is preparing for another disaster, even though I know I'm safe here. And there's this... heaviness on my chest. Like I can't take a full breath.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to breathe deeply. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: As I breathe... I'm realizing how exhausted I feel. It's like reliving that memory drained all my energy. But there's also a small part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe relieved? Like I've finally let out something I've been holding onto for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's an important observation. Can you elaborate on that feeling of relief?",
    "Client: It's weird, but yeah... there's this tiny sense of relief. Like, I've carried this memory around for so long, never really talking about it. Always pushing it down, you know? But now that I've said it out loud, it's like... it's still awful, but it's not this big, dark secret anymore. It's out there, and I'm still here. I survived it then, and I'm surviving it now.",
    "Therapist: How does this realization sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... comforting, in a way. But also scary. It's like I'm seeing myself differently. I'm not just this helpless person who froze. I'm someone who went through something terrifying and made it out the other side. But it also makes me wonder... what else am I capable of facing?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What do you want to do with this new perspective?",
    "Client: I think... I want to be kinder to myself. Maybe I can start looking at that 15-year-old me with more compassion. And maybe... maybe I can use this strength to face other fears in my life. Like, if I could survive an earthquake, maybe I can handle standing up for myself more in my relationships or at school.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea make you feel?",
    "Client: It's scary, but also... exciting? Like, for the first time in a while, I feel like I have some control. I'm not just a victim of my past or my circumstances. I have choices. I can decide how I want to move forward.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant shift. What's your next step?",
    "Client: I think... I want to write about this. Get all these thoughts and feelings down on paper. Maybe it'll help me process everything better. And... I want to talk to my partner about it. I've always kept this part of me hidden, but I think sharing it might help me feel less alone.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful plan. How are you feeling now compared to when we started?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but in a good way? Like after a really intense workout. My body feels more relaxed now, and my mind feels clearer. There's still fear and sadness, but they don't feel as overwhelming. It's like I've created some space around them.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to explore more about how this experience connects to my current relationships. Especially with my family. I'm starting to see some patterns, and I want to understand them better.",
    "Therapist: That's a good direction. We'll pick up there next time. How do you plan to take care of yourself for the rest of the day?",

    "Therapist: That sounds like a balanced approach. Remember to be gentle with yourself. You've done important work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. This was tough, but... I feel like I've taken a step forward. It's a good feeling.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
