    "Therapist: Mrs. Patel, today we'll be starting imaginal exposure. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I'm not sure, Dr. Singh. I've been quite anxious about this. The idea of reliving that terrible flood... it's frightening. And with all the pain I'm in from my arthritis, I wonder if I can handle it. Plus, I'm still upset about that awful cyberbullying incident with my grandchildren last week. It's all so overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: I understand your concerns. How about we start slowly?",
    "Client: That would be helpful. But could you explain more about this exposure thing? I'm still confused about how reliving my trauma could possibly help me. It seems counterintuitive, especially at my age. I've spent years trying to forget that day.",
    "Therapist: Certainly. Imaginal exposure helps process traumatic memories. Shall I elaborate?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I'm particularly worried about how this might affect my chronic pain. Sometimes when I get stressed or upset, the pain gets much worse. And honestly, I'm a bit embarrassed about crying in front of you. In my culture, we don't usually show such emotions openly.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace and manage pain together.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I appreciate your understanding, Dr. Singh. It's comforting to have a therapist who shares my cultural background. Can you tell me what I might experience during this exposure? I'm feeling quite nervous about what to expect.",
    "Therapist: You may experience strong emotions and physical sensations. We'll work through them together.",
    "Client: I see. That sounds challenging, but I trust you. I've been having such terrible nightmares about the flood lately, and I'm hoping this might help with those too. Is that possible? And how long will this process take? I'm living in shared accommodation now, and I worry about how this might affect my housemates if I become too distressed.",
    "Therapist: Nightmares may improve with treatment. We'll work at your own pace. How do you feel about starting?",
    "Client: I'm nervous, but I think I'm ready to try. Your calm demeanor helps a lot, Dr. Singh. I just hope I can get through this without breaking down completely. The flood took everything from me - my home, my possessions, even some of my dear friends. It's been so hard to rebuild my life at this age. But I want to be strong for my grandchildren, especially now with all this cyberbullying nonsense they're dealing with.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable, Mrs. Patel. Shall we begin with a relaxation exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, that sounds good. I could use some relaxation right now. My heart is racing just thinking about all of this. But I'm determined to give it a try. After all, I've survived so much already. If this can help me sleep better and feel more at peace, then it's worth the effort. I'm ready when you are, Dr. Singh.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's start with deep breathing. Close your eyes and follow my lead..."
