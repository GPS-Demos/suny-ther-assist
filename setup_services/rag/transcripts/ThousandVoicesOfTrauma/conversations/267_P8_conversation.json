    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. My heart is still racing, and I feel a bit shaky. That memory of the dog attack... it's like I was right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: It's strange, you know? I can still hear the growling, feel the fear in my chest. I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. And then... then I remember all the times I was bullied at school. It's like one bad memory triggers another.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How do those connections feel?",
    "Client: Awful, really. It's like... both experiences left me feeling so vulnerable. With the dog, it was this sudden, intense fear. But the bullying... that was a slow, constant dread. I never knew when they'd strike next, you know?",
    "Therapist: I see. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: My hands are clammy, and there's this knot in my stomach. I keep thinking, \"Why me? Why did these things have to happen to me?\" And then I feel guilty for even asking that. There are people who've been through so much worse.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt affect you?",
    "Client: It... it makes me feel small. Like I shouldn't be bothered by these things. But they do bother me, and that makes me feel weak. I've always prided myself on being strong, you know? Running my own business, taking care of my family. But these memories... they make me feel like that scared little girl again.",
    "Therapist: What do you think that little girl needs?",
    "Client: (long pause) Comfort, I suppose. Understanding. Someone to tell her it's not her fault. That she didn't deserve any of it. (voice breaking) God, I've never really thought about it like that before.",
    "Therapist: It sounds like a powerful realization.",
    "Client: It is. It's... it's making me cry, but it's not entirely bad. It's like... like I'm finally acknowledging her pain. My pain. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How does that acknowledgment feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a relief, actually. Like a weight I didn't even know I was carrying is starting to lift. But it's also scary. I've spent so long trying to be strong, to push these feelings away. Now that I'm letting them in... I'm worried they might overwhelm me.",
    "Therapist: What helps you feel grounded right now?",
    "Client: (deep breath) Focusing on my breathing helps. And... and talking about it, actually. It's like... the more I put it into words, the less power it has over me. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Many find that helpful. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much these experiences have shaped me. The constant vigilance, always watching for threats. It's exhausting. But there's also a part of me that feels... I don't know... proud? Proud that I've survived, that I've built a life despite all this.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like an important insight.",
    "Client: It is. I've never really given myself credit for that before. I've always focused on what went wrong, not on how I've coped. Maybe... maybe I'm stronger than I thought. (pause) You know, talking about this... it's hard, but it's also... freeing? Like I'm finally facing these demons instead of running from them.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about continuing this process?",
    "Client: Scared, but... determined. I want to understand myself better, to not let these experiences control me anymore. It's not going to be easy, is it?",
    "Therapist: It can be challenging. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: Mixed emotions, really. Part of me is terrified of digging deeper. But another part... it's like I can see a glimmer of hope. Like maybe, just maybe, I can find some peace with all this. It's a long road ahead, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: It's a journey. What supports do you have?",
    "Client: My husband, for one. He's been so patient through all this. And my work... it's been a source of strength. Oh, and my dog. (small laugh) Ironic, isn't it? After everything, I ended up with a dog who's become my best friend.",
    "Therapist: That's quite a transformation. How does that feel?",
    "Client: It feels... hopeful. Like if I could overcome my fear of dogs, maybe I can overcome these other fears too. It's not going to be easy, but... I think I'm ready to try. Is that... is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. How would you like to proceed?",
    "Client: I... I think I'd like to keep exploring this. Maybe we could do more of these exercises? They're tough, but I can see how they might help. And... and maybe we could talk more about the bullying too? I'm starting to see how connected everything is.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Anything else?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. I know we've only just started, but I already feel like I'm understanding myself better. It's scary, but... it's also kind of exciting. Like I'm finally starting to put the pieces together.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I feel... drained, but in a good way? Like I've done something important. Thank you again. I'll see you next week?",
    "Therapist: Yes, next week. Take care."
