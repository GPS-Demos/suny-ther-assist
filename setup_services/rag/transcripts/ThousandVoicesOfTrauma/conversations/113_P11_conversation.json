    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving those moments of being trafficked, it brings back so many emotions. The fear, the helplessness, it's all so vivid. I can still hear the voices of those men, feel the cold metal of the handcuffs... (pauses, takes a deep breath) It's like I'm right back there again.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The smell. I never thought a smell could be so... haunting. It was this mix of sweat, cigarettes, and something metallic. Maybe blood? I don't know. But it's like it's stuck in my nose even now. And the way they looked at me, like I wasn't even human. Just a... a thing to be used. It makes me feel so... dirty. Worthless.",
    "Therapist: How does that feeling compare to your day-to-day life now?",
    "Client: It's... it's similar, I guess. I mean, I know I'm safe now, but I still feel that worthlessness sometimes. Like when I'm at the grocery store, and I catch someone looking at me. My mind immediately goes to the worst place. Are they judging me? Do they know what happened to me? It's exhausting, always being on guard like that.",
    "Therapist: I see. How did you manage those feelings during the exposure?",
    "Client: I tried to remind myself that I'm here now, in this room with you. Safe. I focused on my breathing like we practiced. But it was hard. There were moments when I wanted to just... disappear. To escape again, like I did back then with the drugs. But I didn't. I stayed present. That's progress, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What else did you notice about your response?",
    "Client: I realized that... that I'm stronger than I thought. Even though it was painful to relive, I got through it. And maybe... maybe what happened doesn't define me. I'm not just a victim. I'm a survivor. I've never really thought about it that way before.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How might this new perspective impact you?",
    "Client: I think... I think it might help me face things I've been avoiding. Like, maybe I could try going to that support group you mentioned. Before, I always thought, \"What's the point? I'm too broken.\" But now, I'm starting to see that maybe I have something to offer. Maybe my story could help someone else.",
    "Therapist: That's a big step. What's giving you the courage to consider this?",
    "Client: I guess... seeing that I can face these memories without falling apart. And... and knowing that you're here, supporting me. It makes me feel less alone. Like maybe I can trust people again, bit by bit.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad you feel supported. What's next for you in this process?",
    "Client: I want to keep pushing forward. Maybe... maybe we could work on some of the places I've been avoiding? Like the park where I used to... you know. I think I'm ready to try facing that. It's scary, but I want my life back. All of it.",
    "Therapist: That's a brave decision. How are you feeling about our session today?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... good, I think. Like I've climbed a mountain. There's pain, yeah, but also this sense of... I don't know, accomplishment? Is that weird? To feel accomplished about remembering something so horrible?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a sign of your progress. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For helping me see that there's more to me than my trauma. I've spent so long defining myself by what happened to me. But maybe... maybe I can start writing a new story now. One where I'm not just a victim, but a whole person. Someone who's been through hell but is still standing. That's... that's pretty amazing, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: It certainly is. We'll continue this journey together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm... I'm actually looking forward to our next session. That's new for me. Usually, I dread it. But now, I feel like I'm moving towards something, not just running away. It's scary, but... good scary, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Take care until next time.",
    "Client: I will. And... and thank you again. For everything."
