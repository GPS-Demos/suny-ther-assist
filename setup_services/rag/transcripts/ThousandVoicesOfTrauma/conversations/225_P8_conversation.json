    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart's still racing, and I feel this tightness in my chest. The memory of those awful messages, it's like they're flashing before my eyes again.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's like I'm back there, you know? I can feel the panic rising, just like when I first saw those messages. My palms are sweaty, and I feel so small, so vulnerable. It's as if I'm that scared teenager again, huddled in front of my computer screen, watching my whole world crumble.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Can you tell me more about those feelings?",
    "Client: It's this overwhelming sense of shame and fear. I remember thinking, \"What if everyone sees this? What if they all believe it?\" The cyber bullying, it wasn't just words on a screen. It felt like a physical attack, like someone was reaching through the computer and crushing my spirit. I can still hear the ping of new messages arriving, each one feeling like a knife to my heart.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. How do those feelings connect to your experiences now?",
    "Client: I... I guess I still carry that fear with me. Even now, at 37, I find myself hesitating before I post anything online. There's always this voice in the back of my head asking, \"What if they attack you again?\" It's like I'm constantly on guard, waiting for the next blow. And in relationships, I struggle to trust. I'm always wondering if people are genuine or if they're just waiting to humiliate me.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really challenging. What thoughts are you having about yourself right now?",
    "Client: I... I feel weak. Like I should be over this by now. It happened so long ago, but here I am, still affected by it. Part of me feels angry too - at myself for not standing up to them, at the bullies for being so cruel, at the world for allowing this to happen. But mostly, I just feel... broken. Like those messages permanently damaged something inside me that I can't fix.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to have those feelings. How does your body feel as you share this?",
    "Client: My shoulders are so tense, they're almost up to my ears. There's this knot in my stomach that won't go away. And I notice I'm clenching my fists - I guess that's the anger. But there's also this heaviness, like a weight on my chest. It's hard to take a full breath. It's like my body is still in fight-or-flight mode, even after all these years.",
    "Therapist: You're very in tune with your body. What do you make of these physical reactions?",
    "Client: I... I think it shows how deeply this trauma affected me. It's not just in my head; it's in every fiber of my being. Maybe that's why it's been so hard to move past it. It's like my body is stuck in that moment, always ready to defend against the next attack. But at the same time, I feel a glimmer of hope. Being able to talk about it, to really feel these sensations... it's hard, but it also feels like maybe I'm finally starting to process it.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How does recognizing this make you feel?",
    "Client: It's a mix of emotions, really. There's sadness for the young me who went through this, and for all the years I've carried this burden. But there's also a strange sense of relief. Like, by acknowledging how deeply this affected me, I'm validating my own experience. I've spent so long trying to brush it off, telling myself it wasn't a big deal. But it was. And maybe accepting that is the first step towards healing.",
    "Therapist: That's a very courageous perspective. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to be gentle with myself. To allow myself to feel these emotions without judgment. And maybe... maybe I need to start challenging that voice in my head that still echoes the bullies' words. I've let their voices dictate so much of my life. It's time I start listening to my own voice instead.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive direction. How can we support that process?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to keep talking about this. To bring these memories and feelings out into the light instead of letting them fester in the dark. And maybe... maybe I need to start taking small steps to reclaim my voice online. Not in a confrontational way, but just... being present. Showing myself that I have a right to exist in those spaces too.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like thoughtful goals. How do you feel about our session today?",
    "Client: It's been intense, but... good. Scary, but good. I feel drained, but also like something has shifted. Like I've taken a step towards understanding myself better. I know there's still a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like healing might actually be possible.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant realization. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I just... I want to say thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone bear witness to this pain I've carried for so long. I'm nervous about what comes next, but I'm also... cautiously hopeful.",
    "Therapist: You've done important work today. How would you like to care for yourself after our session?",
    "Client: I think I need some quiet time. Maybe a long bath, or a walk in nature. Something to help me process all of this. And I think I'll write in my journal. There's so much swirling in my head right now, I want to capture it while it's fresh.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a nurturing plan. Remember, you're not alone in this journey.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I'm starting to believe that. It's a new feeling, but a good one. I'm looking forward to our next session, even though I know it'll be challenging. But I think I'm ready to face it.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great courage today. We'll continue this work next time. Take care."
