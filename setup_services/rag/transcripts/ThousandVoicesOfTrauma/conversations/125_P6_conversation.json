    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Take a deep breath and begin when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm on the airplane. We've just taken off, and everything seems fine. The seatbelt sign is still on, and I can feel the slight vibration of the engines. It's a clear day outside, and I can see the city getting smaller below us.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably about a 3. I'm a little tense, but not too bad.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue.",
    "Client: We're climbing higher, and suddenly there's a loud bang. The plane shudders violently, and I can hear people gasping and screaming. My heart starts racing, and I grip the armrests tightly. The oxygen masks drop down, and I fumble to put mine on. I'm struggling to breathe, and my hands are shaking so much...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 7. I can feel my heart pounding just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: The plane is tilting to one side, and I can see smoke coming from the wing. People are crying and praying around me. I'm frozen in my seat, unable to move. The flight attendants are trying to calm everyone down, but their voices are shaking. I can't stop thinking that this is it, this is how I'm going to die...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: (voice trembling) It's a 9. I feel like I can't breathe. My chest is so tight.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're here with me, safe on the ground.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Right. Okay. The plane is losing altitude quickly now. We're told to brace for impact. I can see the ground coming up fast through the window. I close my eyes and grip the seat in front of me. The impact is brutal. I'm thrown forward, my seatbelt digging into my hips. There's a deafening crunch of metal, and I feel a sharp pain in my arm. When I open my eyes, everything is chaos. Smoke is filling the cabin, and people are screaming and trying to get out...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating at this point?",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) It's... it's still a 9. Maybe even a 10. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it.",
    "Client: I manage to unbuckle my seatbelt and stumble to my feet. The aisle is full of debris and injured people. I can smell fuel and smoke. I'm coughing and my eyes are burning. Someone pushes past me, knocking me into a seat. I can hear the crackling of flames. I finally make it to an emergency exit and practically fall out onto the wing. The fresh air hits me, but I can barely breathe. I slide down to the ground and stumble away from the wreckage, collapsing on the grass...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: (sighing) It's... it's starting to come down. Maybe an 8? I still feel shaky, but the worst of it has passed.",
    "Therapist: That's good. How are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: My heart is still racing, and I feel a bit lightheaded. My hands are clammy, and I have this knot in my stomach.",
    "Therapist: Those are normal reactions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (nodding) I know. It's just... it feels so real when I think about it. I can still smell the smoke sometimes.",
    "Therapist: That's common with traumatic memories. What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 6. I'm starting to feel more grounded.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's continue focusing on your breath for a few moments.",
    "Client: (takes several deep breaths) Okay. That helps. I'm remembering now that I survived. I made it out. It was terrifying, but I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. You're safe now. How's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 4 now. I'm feeling calmer, though still a bit shaky.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How do you feel about the exercise overall?",
    "Client: It was intense, but... I think it helped. It's like... facing it head-on made it less overwhelming, if that makes sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. You did very well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm exhausted, but I feel... I don't know, maybe a little stronger?",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. We'll end here for today. Remember to practice your breathing exercises.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
