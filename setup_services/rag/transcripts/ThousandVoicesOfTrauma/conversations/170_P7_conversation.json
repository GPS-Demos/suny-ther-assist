    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Singh. Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Are you ready to revisit the car accident memory?",
    "Client: I think so, Dr. Johnson. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I understand it's part of the process.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm driving home from work. It's late, around 9 PM. The roads are quiet, and I'm tired after a long day. I'm thinking about the dinner my wife promised to keep warm for me. Suddenly, I see headlights in my rearview mirror. They're coming up fast, too fast. My heart starts racing. I grip the steering wheel tighter, knuckles turning white. The car behind me is getting closer, and I can hear the roar of its engine.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that memory.",
    "Client: The other car is right on my bumper now. I'm scared, angry. Why are they driving so recklessly? I try to move to the side to let them pass, but they swerve with me. My palms are sweaty on the wheel. I'm breathing fast, shallow. Then, without warning, they ram into the back of my car. The impact is tremendous. My body jerks forward, then slams back into the seat. The sound of metal crunching is deafening.",
    "Therapist: That sounds terrifying. Keep going.",
    "Client: My car spins out of control. Everything's a blur. I'm trying to steer, to brake, but nothing's responding. I see trees, then road, then sky. It's like a horrible carnival ride I can't get off. Then there's another impact. My car hits something - a tree, I think. The airbag deploys, hitting me in the face. It's like being punched by a boxer. I can taste blood in my mouth. The world goes quiet for a moment, just the sound of my ragged breathing and the ticking of the cooling engine.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I... I'm shaking. Even now, remembering it, I feel like I can't breathe properly. My chest is tight. I can smell the burnt rubber and airbag powder. It's so vivid.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I remember trying to move, to get out of the car. But my leg is trapped, and pain shoots through me when I try to shift. I'm panicking, thinking the car might catch fire. I'm alone, in pain, scared. I can hear distant sirens, but they seem so far away. What if they don't find me in time? What if the other driver comes back to finish the job? I'm crying now, feeling helpless and vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: It feels like hours before help arrives, though it was probably only minutes. I hear voices, see flashlights. Someone's asking if I'm okay, telling me to stay still. They're using equipment to cut me out of the car. The sound of metal being torn apart is horrifying. It reminds me of the crash. When they finally get me out, the cool night air hits me. I'm on a stretcher, being loaded into an ambulance. The paramedics are talking, but I can't focus on what they're saying. I'm in shock, I think. All I can think about is my wife at home, probably worried sick. And how close I came to never seeing her again.",
    "Therapist: You've done an incredible job. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Drained. But... also a bit relieved, I think. Talking about it, reliving it... it's hard, but it feels like I'm facing it instead of running away.",
    "Therapist: That's exactly right. You're making progress.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Johnson. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It's still difficult, but I feel like I'm starting to process it better.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself. Shall we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. This session has given me a lot to think about. I appreciate your guidance and support through this process.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue next week. Take care, Mr. Singh."
