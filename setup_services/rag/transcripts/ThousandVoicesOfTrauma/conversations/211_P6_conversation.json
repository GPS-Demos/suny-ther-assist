    "Therapist: Alright, let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that moment of imprisonment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see the cold, gray walls of the cell. It's so small, barely enough room to move. The air feels thick and stale. I can hear the distant sound of metal doors clanging shut.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The loneliness is overwhelming. I feel so isolated, cut off from the world. My chest feels tight, like I can't breathe properly. I keep thinking about how I ended up here, how unfair it all is. The neglect I've faced my whole life... it's like it's all led to this moment.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking. I can feel sweat forming on my forehead. The walls seem to be closing in on me. I... I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's gone up. Maybe a 6 or 7.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I can't stop thinking about my family, wondering if they even care that I'm here. The silence is deafening. I feel like I'm going to scream just to hear something other than my own thoughts. My stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling physically right now?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I feel dizzy, like the room is spinning. My mouth is dry, and I'm having trouble swallowing. It's hard to catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. This is really intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. It's normal to feel distressed. Stay with it.",
    "Client: I don't know if I can. It feels too real. I'm back there, and I can't escape. The feeling of hopelessness is crushing me. I want to curl up in a ball and disappear.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. What else are you experiencing?",
    "Client: I can smell the musty odor of the cell. My muscles are tense, especially in my shoulders and jaw. I feel so angry at everyone who's ever let me down, who's pushed me to this point. But mostly, I just feel... empty.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: Still an 8. Maybe even a 9 now.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm trying to focus on something, anything else, but all I can think about is how I've ended up here. The neglect, the constant feeling of being unwanted... it's all led to this moment. I feel like I'm drowning in my own thoughts.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your surroundings?",
    "Client: The bed is hard, just a thin mattress on a metal frame. There's a small window, but it's too high to see out of. It just lets in a sliver of light. The fluorescent lights overhead are harsh and unforgiving. Everything feels... sterile and impersonal.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down a bit. Maybe a 7.",
    "Therapist: That's good. What's changed?",
    "Client: I... I'm starting to remember that this is just a memory. I'm not actually there anymore. My breathing is slowing down a little.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Keep focusing on that.",
    "Client: The cell is still there in my mind, but it feels less immediate. I can feel the chair I'm sitting on now, hear the traffic outside. It's like... like I'm watching the memory on a screen instead of living it.",
    "Therapist: How does that feel?",
    "Client: It's... relieving. I still feel shaky and a bit nauseous, but the panic is subsiding. My chest doesn't feel as tight anymore.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5 now. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger?",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted, honestly. But also... maybe a little proud? I didn't think I could face that memory head-on like that. It was intense, but... I got through it.",
    "Therapist: You did incredibly well. Let's take a moment to breathe."
