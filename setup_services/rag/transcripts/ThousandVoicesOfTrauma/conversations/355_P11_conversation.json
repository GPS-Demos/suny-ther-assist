    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: (sighs deeply) It's... it's always hard, you know? Reliving that moment when I saw my father hit my mother. I can still hear the sound of his hand connecting with her face. It's like it's etched into my memory. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel this tightness in my chest.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you this time?",
    "Client: I noticed... I noticed my younger sister's reaction more clearly this time. She was cowering in the corner, her eyes wide with fear. I'd always focused on my parents before, but seeing her like that... it hit me hard. I felt so helpless, both then and now.",
    "Therapist: How does that feeling of helplessness connect to your life now?",
    "Client: (pauses, thinking) I... I think it's why I have such a hard time with confrontation at work. Whenever there's tension or disagreement, I freeze up. It's like I'm that scared kid again, unable to do anything. And my chronic pain... sometimes I wonder if it's my body's way of expressing that helplessness I've carried all these years.",
    "Therapist: I see. How did it feel to notice that connection?",
    "Client: It's... enlightening, I suppose. And a bit overwhelming. It's like pieces of a puzzle falling into place. But it also makes me sad, you know? To think about how much that moment has shaped my life without me even realizing it.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What do you think this means for your recovery?",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) I think... I think it means I need to work on feeling more empowered. Both in my memories and in my day-to-day life. Maybe if I can start seeing myself as capable in those past moments, it'll help me feel more capable now. Especially with my pain management and at work.",
    "Therapist: Excellent observation. How might you start doing that?",
    "Client: Well, um... maybe I could practice visualizing myself comforting my sister in that memory? And at work, I could start by speaking up in smaller, less stressful situations to build my confidence. As for the pain, perhaps I need to be more proactive in my treatment instead of just feeling victimized by it.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like great strategies. How do you feel about trying them?",
    "Client: I'm... nervous, to be honest. But also a bit excited. It feels like I'm finally taking some control back. It's scary, but I think it's necessary if I want to move forward and not let this trauma keep defining me.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. What's your next step?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'll start with the work situation. There's a team meeting coming up, and I usually just sit quietly. But this time, I'm going to prepare a point to contribute. It's small, but it's a start, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How can you support yourself in this?",
    "Client: Hmm... I could practice what I want to say beforehand. And maybe... maybe I could use some of the breathing techniques we've worked on if I start feeling anxious. Oh, and I should probably tell my wife about this plan. She's always been supportive, and I think sharing this with her will help me feel more accountable.",
    "Therapist: Excellent plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... better, actually. Still a bit shaken from the exposure, but also more... I don't know, grounded? Like I have a direction now. It's not just about reliving the trauma anymore, but about using it to make positive changes. That feels good.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I'd like to discuss how the meeting went, if that's okay. And maybe we could delve more into how I can apply this new perspective to managing my chronic pain. I feel like there's a connection there that I haven't fully explored yet.",
    "Therapist: Sounds good. Any final thoughts for today?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. This isn't easy, but I feel like I'm finally starting to see a way forward. It's like... for the first time in a long while, I have hope that things can actually get better.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work. See you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you, doctor. See you then."
