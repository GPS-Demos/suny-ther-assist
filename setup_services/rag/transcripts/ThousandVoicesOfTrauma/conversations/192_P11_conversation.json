    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, John?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. Reliving that moment when I found out my brother had died in the refugee camp... it's still so raw, you know? I can feel my heart racing, and my hands are a bit shaky. It's like I'm right back there, standing in that dusty tent, the smell of unwashed bodies and despair all around me.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The silence. It's weird, but in my memory, everything just... stopped. The constant noise of the camp, the children crying, the aid workers shouting - it all faded away when I saw my mother's face. She didn't have to say anything. I just knew.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that moment today?",
    "Client: It was... hard. Really hard. But also, different somehow. I felt more in control this time, if that makes sense? Like, I could observe the memory without being completely overwhelmed by it. Don't get me wrong, it still hurts like hell, but... I don't know. Maybe I'm starting to see it from a different perspective?",
    "Therapist: That's a significant observation. How does this connect to your day-to-day experiences?",
    "Client: Well, I've noticed that I'm not as jumpy lately when I hear sudden noises. Before, any loud sound would send me right back to the camp, you know? But now, it's like... I can remind myself that I'm here, in the present. It's still uncomfortable, but I'm not completely lost in the flashback anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress, John. How do you feel about these changes?",
    "Client: It's... a relief, honestly. But also a bit scary. I've been holding onto this pain for so long, it's almost become a part of me. Letting go of it feels like I'm letting go of my brother in a way. And then there's the guilt. Why should I get to feel better when he's gone?",
    "Therapist: Those are complex feelings. How might your brother feel about your progress?",
    "Client: (long pause) He... he'd want me to be okay, I think. He was always looking out for me, even in the camp. He'd probably kick my ass if he knew I was holding myself back because of him. (chuckles softly, then sighs) It's just hard, you know?",
    "Therapist: It is hard. What helps you keep going?",
    "Client: Honestly? Moments like this. When I can talk about him without feeling like I'm drowning. And... my partner. She's been so patient through all of this. I want to be present for her, to build a life together without this constant shadow hanging over us.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful motivator. What's your next step?",
    "Client: I think... I want to try talking to my mom about him. We've both avoided the subject for so long, but maybe it's time. Maybe sharing our memories could help us both heal a little.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a meaningful goal. How do you feel about our session today?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... good. Like I've taken another step forward. Thank you for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I think it's worth it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work, John. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I need some time to process all of this. But I'm looking forward to our next session. It's... it's helping. More than I thought it would.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. Take care, John.",
    "Client: Thanks, doc. See you next week."
