    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart is still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. Going through that memory of the hostage situation in the hospital... it's like I was right back there again.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The fear. The overwhelming fear. I remember the smell of antiseptic and the sound of people crying. I was there for a routine check-up, and suddenly everything changed. The man with the gun... his eyes were so wild. I thought I was going to die.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. But different from when I usually think about it. I felt more in control, even though I was scared. I could see details I hadn't remembered before, like the color of the nurse's scrubs or the way the sunlight was coming through the window.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant observation. What do you make of that?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe I'm starting to process it better? It's still terrifying, but it feels less overwhelming. Like, I can look at it without being completely consumed by it.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. How does this connect to your day-to-day experiences?",
    "Client: Well, I've been avoiding hospitals since it happened. Even doctor's appointments make me panic. But going through this memory... it's hard, but I feel like maybe I could face those fears eventually. It's not as impossible as it seemed before.",
    "Therapist: That's insightful. How else has this impacted your life?",
    "Client: It's affected everything. My studies, my relationships... I've been so isolated. The depression makes it worse. I feel like I've lost so much time, you know? But today, revisiting the memory, I felt a glimmer of hope. Like maybe I can reclaim some of what I've lost.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What do you think contributed to that feeling of hope?",
    "Client: I think... it's the fact that I could face the memory without falling apart. And having you here, guiding me through it. It makes me feel less alone in this.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad you feel supported. What's your biggest takeaway from today's session?",
    "Client: That I'm stronger than I thought. And that maybe, just maybe, I can learn to live with this without letting it control me. It's still scary, but... I feel like I can breathe a little easier.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant insight. How will you carry this forward?",
    "Client: I think I'll try to be a bit braver in facing some of my fears. Maybe start with small steps, like driving past the hospital without panicking. And I want to keep working on processing these memories. It's hard, but I can see how it might help in the long run.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a solid plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... okay. Better than I expected, actually. There's this weird mix of exhaustion and relief. Like I've run a marathon, but also like I've put down a heavy weight I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I think I just need some time to process all of this. Maybe do something calming when I get home. I've been trying to get back into reading... maybe I'll do that.",
    "Therapist: That's a good idea. Any final thoughts before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm finally moving forward instead of being stuck. It gives me hope that maybe one day, I can feel normal again.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your courage is commendable. Shall we schedule our next session?"
