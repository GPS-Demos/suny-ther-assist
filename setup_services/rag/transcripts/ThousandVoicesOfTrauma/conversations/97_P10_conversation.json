    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Thompson. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Oh, hello Dr. Richards. I... I'm feeling a bit uneasy, to be honest. We're going to talk about that incident with my ex-husband, aren't we?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's right. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. It's just... well, I haven't really talked about this much before. It's been so long, you know?",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's start slowly. Can you close your eyes and describe where you are in that memory?",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Alright... I'm... I'm in our old kitchen. It's evening, and I'm washing dishes. The water's running, and I can smell the leftover lasagna from dinner. John \u2013 that's my ex \u2013 he's just come home from work. I can hear his heavy footsteps...",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he comes into the kitchen. I can smell alcohol on his breath. He's angry about something... oh, God. (voice trembles)",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're safe here. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 6, I think.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. Can you continue?",
    "Client: Yes... He starts yelling at me. Something about dinner being late. I try to explain that I got held up at the grocery store, but he's not listening. He's getting closer, and I can see his fists clenching...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. My heart's racing, and I feel like I can't breathe. I want to run, but I'm frozen in place. (voice breaks) I... I can't do this...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Mrs. Thompson. Remember, this is just a memory. You're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Inhales shakily) Okay... okay. I'm trying.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he grabs my arm. It hurts so much. I can feel his fingers digging into my skin. I'm pleading with him to let go, but he's not listening. He's screaming in my face now, calling me useless, worthless...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe higher. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're here in my office. Can you feel the chair beneath you?",
    "Client: Yes... yes, I can. (Takes another deep breath) I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Good. Can you continue?",
    "Client: I... I think so. John's still gripping my arm. I'm crying now, begging him to stop. Suddenly, he lets go and pushes me. I stumble back and hit my hip on the counter. The pain is sharp, and I gasp...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I... I'm thinking that I need to get out. That I can't take this anymore. But I'm also scared of what he'll do if I try to leave. I feel so trapped, so helpless...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: He's coming towards me again. I'm cowering, trying to make myself smaller. I can see the rage in his eyes, and I'm certain he's going to hit me this time. I close my eyes and brace myself...",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I hear a crash. I open my eyes, and John's punched the wall next to my head. There's a hole in the drywall, and his knuckles are bleeding. He's breathing heavily, staring at me with such hatred...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My SUDS is probably a 9. It feels so real, Dr. Richards. I can almost smell his aftershave mixed with the alcohol...",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Mrs. Thompson. Take a moment to ground yourself.",
    "Client: (Takes several deep breaths) Okay... okay. I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Good. Can you continue?",
    "Client: Yes... After punching the wall, John storms out of the kitchen. I hear the front door slam, and then his car starting up. As soon as I'm sure he's gone, I collapse onto the floor. I'm sobbing, my whole body shaking...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I... I'm thinking that I can't live like this anymore. That I'm afraid he'll kill me one day. But I'm also terrified of leaving. Where would I go? What would I do? I feel so alone, so trapped...",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8. My heart's racing, and I feel nauseous.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're here, in the present.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Right. I'm here. I'm safe now.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next in the memory?",
    "Client: I... I eventually pick myself up off the floor. My hip is throbbing where I hit the counter. I look at the hole in the wall and feel a surge of anger. This isn't the first time, and I know it won't be the last if I stay...",
    "Therapist: What do you do with that anger?",
    "Client: I... I start packing a bag. My hands are shaking so badly I can barely zip it up. I'm crying the whole time, terrified he'll come back before I can leave. But I'm also feeling a tiny spark of hope...",
    "Therapist: That's important. Hold onto that feeling.",
    "Client: I... I grab my purse and the bag and head for the door. As I'm leaving, I catch a glimpse of myself in the hallway mirror. My eyes are red and puffy, and there's a bruise forming on my arm where John grabbed me...",
    "Therapist: How does seeing yourself like that make you feel?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel angry. And sad. But also... determined. I realize I don't recognize the woman in the mirror anymore, and I want to find her again...",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe a 6 or 7.",
    "Therapist: Good. Can you describe what happens as you leave?",
    "Client: I... I step out onto the porch. It's dark now, and there's a chill in the air. I can hear crickets chirping. For a moment, I hesitate. This house has been my home for so long. But then I think about what just happened, and I know I can't stay...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I walk to my car, constantly looking over my shoulder, afraid John might come back. My hands are shaking so badly I can barely get the key in the ignition. As I start the car, I feel a mix of terror and relief...",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking as you drive away?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm wondering where I'll go. If I'm making the right decision. Part of me wants to turn back, to pretend it never happened. But a stronger part knows I have to keep going. I'm scared, but I also feel... free.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant moment. How does it feel to recall that now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still painful. But I also feel proud of myself for leaving. I didn't go back that time.",
    "Therapist: You showed incredible strength. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 5, I think. I'm feeling calmer.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Let's take a moment to breathe and ground ourselves.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay. I'm feeling more present now.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today, Mrs. Thompson. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, honestly. But I also feel like a weight has been lifted. Talking about it... it's hard, but I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: That's often the case. You've shown tremendous courage today.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Richards. I... I never thought I'd be able to talk about this.",
    "Therapist: You've made significant progress. We'll end here for today. Remember to use the coping strategies we've discussed if you feel overwhelmed later.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Mrs. Thompson. I'll see you next week."
