    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Chen. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about the dog attack, and just thinking about it makes my heart race a little.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. When you're ready, close your eyes and describe the day of the attack.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Alright... It was a sunny Saturday afternoon. I was walking in the park near our house, the one I've been going to for years. The trees were in full bloom, and I remember thinking how beautiful everything looked...",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue in the present tense.",
    "Client: Right, sorry. I'm walking along the path, enjoying the warm sun on my face. I can hear children playing in the distance and smell freshly cut grass. Everything seems so peaceful...",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I hear barking. At first, I don't think much of it. There are always dogs in the park. But then the barking gets louder, more aggressive. I turn around and... *voice trembles* I see this massive Rottweiler charging towards me. Its eyes are wild, teeth bared...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. My heart is pounding so hard I can hear it in my ears. I can't move. I want to run, but my legs won't work. The dog is getting closer, and I... I...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's probably a 7 or 8.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... *exhales* The dog is almost on me now. I can hear its heavy breathing, see the saliva dripping from its mouth. In a split second, I decide to try and protect myself. I raise my arm just as it lunges...",
    "Therapist: What happens to your arm?",
    "Client: The pain... it's excruciating. The dog's teeth sink into my forearm. I can feel them tearing through my skin, my muscles. I'm screaming, but it sounds distant, like it's not even me. The weight of the dog knocks me to the ground, and I hit my head on the path...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you see, hear, feel?",
    "Client: I... I see flashes of sky and trees as I fall. The impact of hitting the ground knocks the wind out of me. My vision is blurry, but I can still see the dog. It's growling, shaking its head, tearing at my arm. The pain is... it's overwhelming. I can smell the dog's breath, feel its hot saliva mixing with my blood...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: I know it's difficult, but you're safe here. Take a moment to ground yourself.",
    "Client: *takes several deep breaths* Okay... I'm still in the park. People are shouting now. I hear running footsteps. Someone's yelling for help. The dog is still on me, but its grip on my arm loosens slightly. I'm... I'm trying to push it off with my other hand, but I'm so weak...",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's more shouting. A man appears \u2013 I think it's the owner. He's yelling at the dog, trying to pull it off me. The dog finally lets go, but it's still barking and lunging. I'm lying there, unable to move. The pain in my arm is... it's unlike anything I've ever felt before. I look down and... *voice breaks* there's so much blood...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still at 9. I can almost feel the pain in my arm right now.",
    "Therapist: Remember, this is a memory. You're here, in this room, and you're safe.",
    "Client: Right... *exhales slowly* Okay. People are gathering around me now. Someone's calling an ambulance. A woman takes off her scarf and wraps it around my arm, trying to stop the bleeding. I'm in shock, I think. Everything seems distant and hazy. I can hear people talking, but I can't make out the words. The owner of the dog is apologizing over and over...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. In pain. But also... angry. So angry at the owner, at the dog. I keep thinking, \"Why me? Why did this happen to me?\" I've always been careful around dogs, always respectful. And now... now I might lose my arm. My career as a surgeon could be over...",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I can hear sirens in the distance. Getting closer. People are still hovering over me, trying to comfort me. Someone's holding my good hand, telling me to hang on. The pain is... it's starting to dull a bit. Maybe I'm going into shock. But I'm scared. I'm so scared about what this means for my future...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about a 7, I think.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue describing what happens.",
    "Client: The ambulance arrives. Paramedics rush over. They're asking me questions, but I'm having trouble focusing. They carefully lift me onto a stretcher. As they're loading me into the ambulance, I catch a glimpse of the dog. It's being restrained now, but it still looks aggressive. I feel a wave of nausea...",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking at this point?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm worried about my wife. She doesn't know what's happened. I try to tell the paramedics to call her, but my words come out slurred. They're putting an IV in, giving me something for the pain. As the ambulance starts moving, I... I start to cry. The reality of what's happened is sinking in...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 6. Talking about it... it's helping, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Let's continue. What happens at the hospital?",
    "Client: Everything at the hospital is a blur. I'm rushed into the emergency room. Doctors and nurses are swarming around me. They're cutting off my shirt, cleaning the wound. The pain comes in waves now. Someone's telling me they need to take me to surgery...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling during all of this?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm scared. But also, there's a strange sense of detachment. Like I'm watching it happen to someone else. I keep thinking about my hands, my fingers. Will I still be able to perform surgeries? Will I ever feel safe in a park again?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. What happens next?",
    "Client: They're preparing me for surgery. A nurse is explaining what they're going to do, but I'm having trouble concentrating. I see my wife arrive \u2013 she looks terrified. She's crying, holding my good hand. I want to comfort her, but I can't find the words...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... helpless. Guilty for putting her through this. Angry at the situation. And still so, so scared about what this means for our future. As they're wheeling me into surgery, I... I wonder if life will ever be the same again.",
    "Therapist: You've done very well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about a 5. Talking through it... it's hard, but it does help.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: Okay... *takes deep breaths* I'm here. I'm safe. My arm has healed. I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: Very good. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained, to be honest. But also... a little lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after these sessions. You've done great work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to talk about, but... it's getting easier. I don't feel as overwhelmed by the memory as I used to.",
    "Therapist: That's the goal of these exercises. You're making excellent progress.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I know we still have more work to do, but I feel like I'm starting to regain control.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we end?",
    "Client: I don't think so. I'm just... I'm grateful for your help. And I'm proud of myself for getting through this.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. We'll continue working on this in our next session.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'll see you next week.",
    "Therapist: Take care, Mr. Chen. Remember to practice your relaxation techniques."
