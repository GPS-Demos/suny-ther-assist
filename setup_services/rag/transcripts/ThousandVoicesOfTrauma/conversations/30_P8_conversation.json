    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like my whole body is trembling on the inside. The memory of being in that cell, it's so vivid now. I can almost smell the damp concrete and feel the cold seeping into my bones. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. How utterly alone. There was no one to turn to, no one who cared. It's bringing back all these feelings of abandonment from my childhood. I never thought I'd experience that level of neglect again, but there I was, a grown man, feeling like that scared little boy all over again.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does your body feel as you're describing this?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, like there's a weight pressing down on it. My hands are clammy, and I notice I'm clenching my jaw. It's like my body is trying to brace itself against the memory. I'm also feeling a knot in my stomach, the same kind I used to get as a child when I knew I'd be left alone for hours.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But it's mixed with this deep sadness. I'm mourning for that man in the cell, for the child I was, for all the times I've felt abandoned and forgotten. It's like a tidal wave of grief washing over me.",
    "Therapist: How do you make sense of these feelings?",
    "Client: I... I guess they're all connected, aren't they? The neglect I experienced as a child, it made me vulnerable. When I was imprisoned, it triggered all those old wounds. I felt so small, so insignificant. Like I didn't matter to anyone in the world. It's hard to admit, but I think part of me still feels that way sometimes.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I need... I need to feel safe. To know that I'm not alone anymore. That what happened to me wasn't my fault. I'm struggling with this guilt, you know? Like somehow, I deserved what happened to me. Both as a child and as an adult. It's irrational, I know, but it's there.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to acknowledge that need for safety?",
    "Client: It's... it's both frightening and liberating. Frightening because it makes me feel vulnerable, like I'm opening myself up to being hurt again. But liberating because... well, because I'm finally allowing myself to have needs. To admit that I deserve care and safety. It's a strange mix of emotions.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your breathing now?",
    "Client: Oh, I... I hadn't even realized, but it's quite shallow. I'm taking quick, short breaths. Now that I'm paying attention to it, I can feel a tightness in my throat too. It's like my body is still in that cell, still in survival mode.",
    "Therapist: Try taking a deep breath. How does that feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually quite difficult. Like my body is resisting. But as I force myself to take a deeper breath, I can feel some of the tension starting to release. It's as if I'm reminding my body that I'm here, in the present, not back there.",
    "Therapist: What's different about this moment compared to the memory?",
    "Client: Well, I'm... I'm not alone now. I'm here with you, in a safe place. I can see sunlight through the window, hear the traffic outside. These are all reminders that I'm free now. I'm not that helpless man in the cell anymore. It's still hard to fully believe it sometimes, but I know it's true.",
    "Therapist: How does recognizing these differences impact you?",
    "Client: It's grounding. It helps me separate the past from the present. I'm starting to feel a bit calmer now. The fear is still there, but it's not as overwhelming. I'm realizing that while the memory is painful, it can't hurt me now. I survived it. I'm here, talking about it. That's... that's actually quite powerful when I think about it.",
    "Therapist: What does this realization mean for your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I think... I think it means I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. That despite everything I've been through, I'm still here, still fighting. It doesn't erase the pain or the trauma, but it gives me hope. Hope that I can learn to live with these memories without being controlled by them. That maybe, just maybe, I can find a way to feel safe and whole again.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's scary, I won't lie. Facing these memories, these feelings, it's one of the hardest things I've ever done. But I also feel... determined. I want to reclaim my life. I want to break free from the prison of my past. It won't be easy, but I think... I think I'm ready to keep going. To see where this journey takes me.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. We'll continue next session.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I appreciate your guidance through this. It means a lot to have someone truly listening, truly caring. I know we have a long way to go, but for the first time in a long time, I feel like there might be light at the end of this very dark tunnel. I'm grateful for that."
