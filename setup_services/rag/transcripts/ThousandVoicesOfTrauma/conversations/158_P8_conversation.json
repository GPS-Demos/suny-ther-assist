    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling shaky. My hands are trembling a bit. It's like I'm right back there, you know? The memory of that day, when I heard about the plane crash... it's so vivid. I can still hear the news anchor's voice, see the horrified expressions on my family's faces. My chest feels tight, like I can't get enough air.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Grief. Overwhelming grief. It's like a wave crashing over me. I keep thinking about my son, his smile, his laughter. He was supposed to come home for Diwali. We were planning such a big celebration. Now, it's just... empty. The house feels so quiet without him. I find myself waiting to hear his footsteps, his voice calling out to me. But then I remember, and it's like losing him all over again.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly painful. How does your body feel as you're experiencing this grief?",
    "Client: My shoulders are so tense, like they're carrying this immense weight. There's this hollowness in my stomach, almost like I'm physically missing a part of myself. And my throat... it feels constricted, like I'm choking back tears that never seem to end. Sometimes, I get these shooting pains in my back, and I wonder if it's related to all this emotional stress.",
    "Therapist: You're very in tune with your physical sensations. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep replaying our last conversation. Did I tell him I loved him? Did he know how proud I was of him? And then I think about the crash itself. Was he scared? Did he suffer? These thoughts just circle in my mind, over and over. I feel so helpless, like I failed to protect him somehow. And then there's this guilt... guilt that I'm still here, living, when he's gone. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel joy again without feeling like I'm betraying his memory.",
    "Therapist: It's clear how deeply you loved your son. How do these thoughts and feelings compare to when you first learned about the crash?",
    "Client: In some ways, it's less raw now. At first, it was like I couldn't breathe, couldn't think. I was in shock, I suppose. Now, the pain is... different. It's deeper, more ingrained. I can function day-to-day, but it's like there's this undercurrent of sadness always there. I find myself looking at old photos, remembering happy times, and it's bittersweet. There are moments when I can smile at a memory, but then the reality hits me again, and it's like falling into a dark pit.",
    "Therapist: You've described a complex mix of emotions. What's been most challenging for you recently?",
    "Client: The hardest part is... moving forward. Everyone says time heals, but it feels like I'm stuck. My husband, he's trying to be strong, but I can see the pain in his eyes too. We're grieving differently, and sometimes that creates this... distance between us. And then there are the cultural expectations. In our community, there's this pressure to 'be strong,' to not show weakness. But how can I be strong when I feel so broken inside? I worry that I'm not honoring my son's memory properly, that I'm failing him somehow by struggling so much.",
    "Therapist: It sounds like you're dealing with multiple layers of grief. How have you been coping?",
    "Client: I... I try to keep busy. I've been volunteering at the local temple, helping with meal preparations. It gives me a sense of purpose, and the routine is... comforting, I suppose. I've also been writing letters to my son. I know he'll never read them, but it helps me feel connected to him somehow. And the pain in my back, it flares up when I'm particularly stressed, so I've been trying some gentle yoga. It helps a little, both with the physical pain and... and calming my mind, even if just for a few moments.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like positive steps. What do you find most helpful when the grief feels overwhelming?",
    "Client: Honestly? Sometimes I just let myself cry. I used to try to hold it in, but now... now I just let it out. There's this spot in our garden where my son used to love sitting. I go there, and I talk to him. I tell him about my day, my fears, how much I miss him. It's... it's bittersweet, but it brings me a strange kind of comfort. And sometimes, I look at the sky, especially at sunset, and I feel this... connection. Like he's still with me somehow. It doesn't take away the pain, but it makes it a little more bearable.",
    "Therapist: That's a beautiful way to stay connected. How do you feel after our session today?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also a bit lighter. Talking about it, really delving into these feelings... it's exhausting, but there's also a sense of release. Like I've been carrying this heavy burden, and for a little while, I could set it down and examine it. I'm still sad, still grieving, but I feel... I don't know, maybe a tiny bit stronger? Like maybe, just maybe, I can face another day. It's not much, but it's something.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I... I just want to say thank you. For listening, for not judging. It's hard to talk about this with people who haven't experienced such loss. They mean well, but they don't really understand. Here, I feel... heard. And that means more than I can express. I know the road ahead is long, and there will be more difficult days, but... but I feel a glimmer of hope. That maybe, someday, I'll be able to think of my son and smile more than I cry. Is that... is that okay? To hope for that?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Hope is an important part of healing. We'll end here for today."
