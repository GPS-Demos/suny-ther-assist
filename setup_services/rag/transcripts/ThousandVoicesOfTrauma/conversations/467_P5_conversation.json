    "Therapist: Hello, Carlos. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares lately, and I'm not sure if I'm ready for this.",
    "Therapist: I understand. What concerns you most?",
    "Client: It's just... the idea of reliving those moments. I've spent so long trying to forget, you know? The violence I witnessed, it's not something I want to revisit. Plus, with my anxiety, I'm worried I might have a panic attack or something.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How about we discuss the process?",
    "Client: Yeah, that would help. I mean, I trust you, but I'm still scared. Can you explain why we need to do this? And what exactly is going to happen?",
    "Therapist: Certainly. Imaginal exposure helps process traumatic memories. Ready to hear more?",
    "Client: I think so. Go ahead.",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit the memory gradually. I'll guide you throughout. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It sounds... intense. But I guess that's the point, right? I'm just worried about losing control. With my anxiety, sometimes I feel like I'm on the edge of falling apart. And thinking about what happened... it brings me right back to that edge.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are normal. We'll go at your pace. Any questions?",
    "Client: Yeah, actually. What if I can't handle it? What if I start panicking? I mean, I've managed to keep it together at work and in my shared house, but this feels like I'm deliberately opening Pandora's box.",
    "Therapist: We have strategies to help you stay grounded. Your safety is priority.",
    "Client: Okay, that's good to know. I appreciate that. It's just... this is a big step. I've been carrying this weight for so long, you know? The memories of the violence, the physical abuse... it's affected everything. My relationships, my work, even just feeling safe in my own home. I want to get better, but it's scary.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. This process can reduce PTSD symptoms significantly.",
    "Client: Really? That would be... amazing. I'm tired of feeling like this, always on edge, always waiting for the next bad thing to happen. If this can help, I want to try. But can you tell me more about what to expect during the session?",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll revisit the memory slowly. You might feel strong emotions.",
    "Client: Strong emotions... yeah, I can imagine. It's been a rollercoaster just thinking about it. But you'll be there the whole time, right? You won't leave me alone with these memories?",
    "Therapist: I'll be here throughout. We can pause anytime you need.",
    "Client: Okay. Okay, I think I can do this. It's not going to be easy, but if it can help me move past this, I'm willing to try. I just hope... I hope it works. I want to be able to trust people again, to feel safe.",
    "Therapist: Your willingness to engage is a big step. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do it. I'm nervous, but I'm ready. Just... please be patient with me if I struggle. This isn't easy, but I know it's important. I want to reclaim my life from these memories.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Your well-being is my priority. Let's start slowly."
