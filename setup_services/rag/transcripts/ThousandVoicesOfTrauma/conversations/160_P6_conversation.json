    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",

    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your baseline SUDS.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and describe the memory.",
    "Client: I'm back in Vietnam, 1968. The air is thick with humidity and the smell of jungle. I can hear the distant sound of choppers. We're on patrol, moving through dense foliage. My uniform is sticking to my skin. I'm on high alert, scanning for any movement...",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 6. My heart is beating faster.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Continue.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud crack. Gunfire erupts all around us. I dive for cover behind a fallen tree. The sound is deafening. I can smell gunpowder and see muzzle flashes in the trees. My hands are shaking as I grip my rifle...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. I can feel my palms sweating and my chest tightening.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I see my buddy, Tom, get hit. He falls next to me, blood spreading across his chest. I'm frozen for a moment, can't believe what I'm seeing. Then training kicks in. I'm yelling for a medic, trying to apply pressure to his wound. But there's so much blood... I can feel it, warm and sticky on my hands...",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I can't breathe. My chest is so tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) The firefight seems to last forever. I can hear screaming, both English and Vietnamese. The air is filled with smoke and the smell of blood. I'm terrified, but I keep firing, trying to protect Tom. But I know... I know he's not going to make it...",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: Still... still a 9. My hands are shaking. I can almost smell the blood...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The shooting finally stops. It's eerily quiet except for some moaning. I look down at Tom, but his eyes are empty. I've failed him. I feel numb, disconnected. The medic arrives, but it's too late. I can't stop staring at my blood-covered hands...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down to an 8. I feel exhausted, drained.",
