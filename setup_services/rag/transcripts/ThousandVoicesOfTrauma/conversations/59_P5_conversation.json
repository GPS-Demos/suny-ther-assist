    "Therapist: Hello, Raj. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do. I've been having more nightmares lately about... you know, the incident. It's making me anxious just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Ready?",
    "Client: Imaginal exposure? That sounds... intimidating. What exactly does that mean? I'm not sure I'm ready to face everything head-on.",
    "Therapist: It's revisiting the trauma memory in a safe space. Thoughts?",
    "Client: Revisiting the memory? I... I don't know if I can do that. Every time I think about it, I feel like I'm right back there, helpless and scared. It's overwhelming. How is this supposed to help me?",
    "Therapist: It helps process the memory, reducing its power over time.",
    "Client: Reduce its power? That sounds... well, I guess that could be helpful. But what if it makes things worse? I'm already struggling with anxiety, and my studies are suffering because of it. I can't afford to fall apart right now.",
    "Therapist: Understandable concern. We'll go at your pace. Support throughout.",
    "Client: Okay... I appreciate that. It's just... being a student is already stressful, and then dealing with this trauma on top of it... sometimes it feels like too much. But I want to get better. I'm tired of feeling this way. How exactly will this process work?",
    "Therapist: You'll describe the event. I'll guide you. Breaks as needed.",
    "Client: Describe the event? Out loud? That's... that's going to be really hard. I've never told anyone all the details before. What if I can't get through it? Or what if I get too emotional?",
    "Therapist: Normal reactions. We'll manage together. Your courage is admirable.",
    "Client: Thank you... I guess I am pretty brave for trying this. It's just... as a man, and especially coming from my cultural background, it's not easy to talk about being a victim of sexual abuse. And then with the police brutality... it's like a double whammy of shame and fear.",
    "Therapist: Your experiences are valid. This is a safe space.",
    "Client: That means a lot to hear. It's been isolating dealing with this alone. Living by myself, I don't really have anyone to talk to about it. And dating? Forget it. I can't even imagine being vulnerable with someone right now.",
    "Therapist: Isolation is common. This work can help reconnect.",
    "Client: I hope so. I miss feeling connected to people. Okay, so... what should I expect to feel during this imaginal exposure? I'm worried about getting overwhelmed or having a panic attack.",
    "Therapist: Anxiety may rise, then decrease. We'll use coping strategies.",
    "Client: Coping strategies... right. Like the breathing exercises we've practiced? Those have been helping a bit with my everyday anxiety. I just hope they're enough for this. It's a big step.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. We'll use those and more. You're well-prepared.",
    "Client: Okay... I think I'm ready to try. Or as ready as I'll ever be. Can we start slowly? And if it gets too much, can we stop?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're in control. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes... let's do this. I'm nervous, but I'm also hopeful. Maybe this will finally help me move forward and feel more like myself again.",
    "Therapist: Your strength is inspiring. Let's start gently..."
