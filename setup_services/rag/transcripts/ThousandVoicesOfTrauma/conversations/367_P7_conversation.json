    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit anxious, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about my divorce today, and it's bringing up a lot of emotions.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's just... thinking about the day my ex-husband told me he wanted a divorce brings back so many painful memories. I can still see his face, hear his voice...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Can you describe that moment?",
    "Client: We were in our kitchen. It was a Sunday morning, and I was making coffee. He came in, looking serious, and said, \"Sarah, we need to talk.\" My heart just sank. I knew something was wrong. He sat down at the table and told me he wasn't happy anymore and wanted a divorce. I felt like the floor was falling out from under me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I remember dropping the mug I was holding. It shattered on the floor, and I just stared at the pieces. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. We'd been married for 25 years. How could he just throw that away? I started shaking and crying, asking him why, what I had done wrong.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: He tried to explain, saying it wasn't my fault, that we'd grown apart. But all I could think about was how I'd failed. I'd failed as a wife, as a partner. I thought about our children, our grandchildren. How could I face them? How could I tell them that their father didn't want me anymore?",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I remember feeling so alone at that moment. Like everything I'd built my life around was crumbling. I asked him if there was someone else, and he hesitated before saying no. But that hesitation... it killed me. It made me question every moment of our marriage. Was I not enough? Had I been blind to his unhappiness all these years?",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. Continue.",
    "Client: I sat down at the table, feeling numb. He kept talking, something about logistics and lawyers, but I couldn't really hear him. All I could think about was how I was going to survive this. I'd been with him since I was 19. I didn't know how to be alone. The thought of going to bed alone, waking up alone... it terrified me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How did your body feel?",
    "Client: My chest felt tight, like I couldn't breathe. My hands were shaking so badly I had to clasp them together. I felt cold all over, even though it was a warm day. And there was this hollow feeling in my stomach, like I was falling into a bottomless pit.",
    "Therapist: That's a vivid description. Keep going.",
    "Client: I remember looking at him, really looking at him, and realizing I didn't recognize the man sitting across from me anymore. This person who could calmly sit there and tear apart our life together... it wasn't the man I married. And that realization hurt almost as much as the divorce itself.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. What happened next?",
    "Client: I asked him to leave. I couldn't bear to look at him anymore. He tried to touch my hand, but I pulled away. I couldn't stand the thought of him touching me. As he walked out, I had this overwhelming urge to beg him to stay, to promise I'd be better, do better. But I didn't. I just sat there, staring at the broken mug on the floor, feeling like it was a perfect representation of my life at that moment.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great strength. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Remembering it... it still hurts. But not as intensely as before. I think I've started to accept that it wasn't entirely my fault. We both changed over the years, and maybe we just weren't meant to last forever. It's still hard, but I'm learning to be okay on my own.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Well done today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's not easy to talk about, but I think it helps. Each time I share it, it loses a little bit of its power over me. I'm starting to see that while that day was the end of something, it was also the beginning of a new chapter in my life. It's scary, but also... maybe a little exciting?",
    "Therapist: That's a positive perspective. We'll end here for today."
