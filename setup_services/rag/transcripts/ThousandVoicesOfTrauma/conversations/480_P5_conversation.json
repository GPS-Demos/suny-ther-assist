    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares about the dog attack lately, and it's really affecting my sleep.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Ready to learn more?",
    "Client: Imaginal exposure? That sounds... intense. Can you explain what that means exactly? I'm not sure I'm ready to relive that horrible day.",
    "Therapist: It's a technique to process trauma memories. We'll go through it step-by-step. How does that sound?",
    "Client: I appreciate you explaining, but I'm still feeling apprehensive. Will it make the nightmares worse? I'm already struggling with my depression, and I'm worried this might make everything feel even heavier.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. It may be challenging, but it often reduces nightmares. How can I support you?",
    "Client: I guess I need to know that you'll be here with me through it all. And maybe... could you tell me more about how this is supposed to help? I want to believe it will, but right now, I'm just scared.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'll guide you throughout. This helps process memories, reducing their impact. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Okay, that makes sense. I'm wondering, though... how detailed do I need to be? There are parts of the attack that are really vivid, and others that are fuzzy. And honestly, there are some parts I'd rather not remember at all.",
    "Therapist: Share what you're comfortable with. We'll work at your pace. Your safety is priority. How does that feel?",
    "Client: That's a relief to hear. I appreciate your patience with me. I think I'm starting to feel a little calmer about this. But I'm curious, what should I expect to feel during and after this exercise? I'm worried about how it might affect my mood or my ability to focus on my studies.",
    "Therapist: You might experience strong emotions. We'll manage them together. Temporary distress is normal. Shall we discuss coping strategies?",
    "Client: Yes, please. That would be really helpful. I've been trying to use some breathing exercises when I get anxious, but sometimes they don't seem like enough. And with my studies already being affected by my depression, I want to make sure I have a good plan in place.",
    "Therapist: Great. Let's review grounding techniques and self-care. What works for you currently?",
    "Client: Well, besides the breathing exercises, I've found that taking short walks helps clear my head. And sometimes, when things get really tough, I call my sister. She's always been supportive. But I'm open to learning more techniques if you have suggestions.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent strategies. We can add mindfulness and progressive muscle relaxation. Ready to try?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm ready. I appreciate you taking the time to address my concerns and help me prepare. It means a lot to have this kind of support. I'm still nervous, but I'm also feeling a bit hopeful that this might actually help me move forward.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable, Carlos. This is a big step. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Thank you. Yes, let's do this. I know it won't be easy, but I'm willing to try. Can you just remind me one more time what I should do if I start feeling overwhelmed during the exercise?",

    "Client: Okay, got it. I'll signal if it becomes too much. I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Let's start this imaginal exposure and see where it takes us. I'm putting my trust in you and this process.",
    "Therapist: I'm here with you. Let's begin. Close your eyes and take a deep breath..."
