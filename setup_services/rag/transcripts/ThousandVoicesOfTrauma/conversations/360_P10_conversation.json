    "Therapist: Welcome, James. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to dive into the car accident today, and part of me wants to just get it over with, but another part is screaming to run out that door.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Yeah, I think so. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What's the first thing you notice?",
    "Client: It's... it's early morning. The sun's barely up. I'm driving to work, like any other day. The roads are pretty empty. I remember thinking about a project I needed to finish...",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: I see... the familiar route. Trees lining the road. My coffee in the cupholder. The radio's on low, just background noise really.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... calm. Unsuspecting. God, if I had known...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: I approach the intersection. The light's green, so I don't slow down. Then... then I see it. This truck, it's coming from the right, and it's not stopping. It's going so fast, and I just... I freeze.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um... probably a 6. My heart's starting to race.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What do you see next?",
    "Client: The truck... it's getting closer. I try to swerve, but there's no time. The sound... oh God, the sound of metal crushing. It's so loud. My body jerks forward, and I feel this intense pain in my chest.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: Everything's spinning. There's glass everywhere. I... I can't breathe properly. And the smell... burning rubber and something metallic. Blood, I think.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, James. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's higher. Maybe an 8.",
    "Therapist: Okay, let's take a moment. Feel your feet on the ground. You're here, in my office, safe.",
    "Client: (Breathing heavily) Okay... okay. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: When you're ready, tell me what happens next.",
    "Client: I... I'm trying to move, but I can't. My leg is pinned. There's blood on my hands. I hear sirens in the distance. Someone's shouting, asking if I'm okay, but their voice sounds far away.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in that moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm scared. I keep thinking, \"This can't be happening.\" And then... oh God, I remember Sarah. My wife. What if I never see her again?",
    "Therapist: That must have been terrifying. How does your body feel?",
    "Client: It hurts. Everything hurts. My chest feels like it's on fire every time I breathe. And I'm so cold. Why am I so cold?",
    "Therapist: You're shaking a bit. Are you cold now?",
    "Client: No, I... I guess I'm just really in it. Sorry.",
    "Therapist: No need to apologize. You're doing great. What happens next?",
    "Client: The paramedics arrive. They're talking to me, but I can barely focus. They're cutting me out of the car. The movement... it hurts so much. I think I pass out.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. My SUDS is probably a 9.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, James. Remember, this is a memory. You survived this.",
    "Client: Right... right. I'm here. I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: I wake up in the hospital. Everything's bright and noisy. There are doctors and nurses everywhere. I'm trying to ask about the other driver, but no one's answering me.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in that moment?",
    "Client: Confused. Scared. And... guilty. I keep thinking, what if I killed someone?",
    "Therapist: That's a heavy burden. How does your body feel?",
    "Client: Numb. I think they've given me painkillers. But my mind is racing. I keep replaying the accident, wondering if I could have done something differently.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: Sarah arrives. She's crying, holding my hand. I've never seen her so scared. I want to comfort her, but I can barely move.",
    "Therapist: How does seeing Sarah affect you?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of relief and shame. I'm so glad to see her, but I also feel like I've let her down somehow.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's come down a bit. Maybe a 7.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're doing well. What do you remember next?",
    "Client: The doctor comes in. He's explaining my injuries - broken ribs, punctured lung, fractured leg. But then... then he tells me about the other driver.",
    "Therapist: How do you react to this news?",
    "Client: I... I feel sick. The other driver didn't make it. He died at the scene. I... I killed someone. Oh God, I killed someone.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, James. Remember, you're here, safe in my office.",
    "Client: (Breathing heavily) I... I can't. This is too much.",
    "Therapist: It's okay. Let's pause for a moment. Focus on your breathing.",
    "Client: (After a few moments) Okay... okay. I'm... I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, tell me what you're thinking.",
    "Client: I can't stop thinking about the other driver. Did he have a family? Kids? I took someone's life. How do I live with that?",
    "Therapist: Those are heavy thoughts. How does your body feel as you think about this?",
    "Client: Heavy. Like there's this weight crushing me. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's back up to a 9.",
    "Therapist: Okay, let's ground ourselves again. Feel the chair supporting you. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Inhales deeply) Alright. I'm... I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens in the days following?",
    "Client: It's a blur. Doctors, police interviews, lawyers. Everyone keeps telling me it wasn't my fault, that the other driver ran the red light. But I can't shake this guilt.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with these feelings?",
    "Client: I... I don't. Not really. I start having nightmares. I can't sleep. I don't want to leave the house. Sarah tries to help, but I push her away.",
    "Therapist: What are you afraid of?",
    "Client: Everything. Driving. Leaving the house. Letting people down. I keep thinking, what if it happens again?",
    "Therapist: How does this fear affect your daily life?",
    "Client: I... I stop working. I can't focus. I snap at Sarah for no reason. I feel like I'm drowning, and I don't know how to stop it.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, James. Let's take another moment to breathe.",
    "Client: (Takes a few deep breaths) Okay. I'm... I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, I want you to think about where you are now, months after the accident. How have things changed?",
    "Client: I... I'm still struggling. But I'm here, in therapy. I'm trying to work through it. Sarah and I... we're in couples counseling. I'm slowly getting back to work.",
    "Therapist: What's different about how you feel now compared to right after the accident?",
    "Client: I... I still feel guilty. But I'm starting to understand that it truly wasn't my fault. I'm learning to forgive myself, even though it's hard.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress, James. How does it feel to recognize that?",
    "Client: It's... it's a relief, honestly. But also scary. Like, what if I'm letting myself off too easy?",
    "Therapist: Those are normal thoughts. How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's come down. Maybe a 6?",
    "Therapist: That's good. As we wrap up this session, I want you to focus on where you are right now. You're safe. You've survived. You're working on healing.",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, I am. It's hard, but I'm trying.",
    "Therapist: That's all we can ask. You've done excellent work today, James. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Exhausted. But... maybe a little lighter? Like I've let something go.",
    "Therapist: That's often how it feels after these sessions. Remember to be kind to yourself today. We'll pick this up next time.",
    "Client: Thank you. This... this helps. Even when it's hard.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, James. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
