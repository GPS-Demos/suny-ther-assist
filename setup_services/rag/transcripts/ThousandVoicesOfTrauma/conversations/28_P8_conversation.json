    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart is still racing a bit, and I feel this tightness in my chest. The memory of Sarah telling me she wanted a divorce... it's like I'm right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: Shame, mostly. And a deep sense of failure. I keep replaying all the times I should have seen it coming, you know? The late nights at work, the emotional distance... I feel so stupid for not realizing sooner. And then there's this anger, bubbling up underneath. Not just at Sarah, but at myself too.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a hot knot in my stomach. My fists are clenched, and I notice I'm grinding my teeth a bit. It reminds me of how I felt when I was bullied as a kid. That same sense of powerlessness, of wanting to lash out but feeling trapped.",
    "Therapist: I see. Can you tell me more about that connection?",
    "Client: Well, um... I guess in both situations, I felt blindsided and betrayed. With the bullying, it was kids I thought were my friends. With Sarah, it was the person I trusted most in the world. In both cases, I felt like I should have seen it coming, should have been smarter or stronger somehow.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep hearing Sarah's voice saying, \"I don't love you anymore.\" And then it morphs into those kids from school, laughing and calling me names. It's like... it's like I'm that scared, lonely kid again, but also this broken, middle-aged man. I feel... I feel worthless. Like maybe I deserve to be alone.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. How are you feeling as you express these thoughts?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a bit of a relief. I've never really connected these experiences before. It's painful, but there's also this sense of... I don't know, maybe understanding? Like I'm starting to see a pattern in how I react to rejection. It's overwhelming, but also... maybe helpful?",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much I've isolated myself since the divorce. It's like I'm trying to protect myself from ever being hurt like that again. But... but maybe I'm just recreating that loneliness from my childhood. I'm pushing people away before they can reject me. God, it's exhausting living like this.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to recognize that pattern?",
    "Client: It's... it's scary, honestly. Because if I can see the pattern, then maybe I can change it. But change is terrifying. What if I open myself up again and just get hurt? But at the same time, there's this tiny spark of hope. Like maybe I don't have to feel this way forever.",
    "Therapist: Can you tell me more about that spark of hope?",
    "Client: It's small, but it's there. It's the idea that maybe I'm not doomed to repeat this cycle forever. That maybe I can learn to trust again, to let people in. It's scary, but also... exciting? Like maybe there's a version of me that isn't defined by these painful experiences.",
    "Therapist: What do you think that version of you might look like?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Someone who can look at themselves in the mirror without flinching, I guess. Someone who can form meaningful relationships without constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop. Someone who sees their worth beyond their relationships or career achievements. It feels impossible right now, but... but I want to be that person.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted, honestly. Emotionally drained. But there's also this weird sense of... lightness? Like I've put down a heavy burden I didn't even know I was carrying. I'm still scared and hurt, but I feel like maybe I understand myself a little better now.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant insight. What's one thing you'd like to take away from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's the realization that my past doesn't have to dictate my future. That even though I've been hurt, badly, multiple times, I still have the capacity to heal and grow. It's not going to be easy, but... but maybe it's possible. And that's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up?",
    "Client: No, I... I think I need some time to process all of this. It's a lot to take in. But thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. I know we have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe there's a path forward.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. How about we end here and pick up next session?",
    "Client: Yes, that sounds good. Thank you again. I'll see you next week."
