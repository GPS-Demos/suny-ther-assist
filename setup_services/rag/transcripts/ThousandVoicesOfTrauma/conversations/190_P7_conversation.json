    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure exercise. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the cult experience you mentioned?",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. It was about two years ago when I first got involved with the group. They seemed so welcoming at first, you know? I was feeling lost and alone, and they offered a sense of community. But things started to change gradually. They began controlling what I ate, when I slept, even who I talked to. It was subtle at first, but then it became more intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue sharing what happened.",
    "Client: There was this one night... it's hard to talk about. They had this \"cleansing\" ritual. We were all gathered in this dimly lit room, and the leader started shouting about purging our sins. Suddenly, two of the senior members grabbed me. They... they started hitting me, saying it was to drive out the evil. I was so scared and confused. I couldn't understand why they were hurting me when they were supposed to care about me.",
    "Therapist: That sounds terrifying. You're brave for sharing this. Keep going.",
    "Client: I remember the pain, the sound of their hands striking me. The worst part was feeling so helpless, like I couldn't escape. I wanted to scream, but I was afraid they'd hurt me more if I did. The leader kept chanting something, and others were watching. I felt so ashamed and exposed. I can still smell the incense they always burned, it makes me nauseous now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with the memory. What happened next?",
    "Client: After what felt like hours, they finally stopped. I was bruised and shaking. The leader told me I was \"cleansed\" now and should be grateful. I remember stumbling back to my room, feeling so broken and alone. I cried all night, trying to muffle the sound so no one would hear. I wanted to leave, but I was scared they'd come after me. It took me weeks to finally gather the courage to run away.",
    "Therapist: You showed incredible strength. How are you feeling now, recalling this?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. My heart is racing, and I feel nauseous. Part of me still feels ashamed, like maybe I deserved it or should have been stronger. But I'm also angry. How could they do that to me? I trusted them, and they hurt me so badly.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I know I'm safe, but sometimes I still have nightmares about it. I'll wake up feeling like I'm back there, trapped and helpless. It's hard to trust people now. I'm always worried that someone might try to control or hurt me again. I feel so stupid for falling for their manipulation in the first place.",
    "Therapist: You're not stupid. You were vulnerable, and they took advantage.",
    "Client: I guess you're right. It's just hard to shake off those feelings. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever fully recover from this. Will I always be haunted by what happened? I want to move on, but it feels like this experience has changed me fundamentally. I'm not the same person I was before, and I don't know how to get back to who I used to be.",
    "Therapist: Change is natural after trauma. You're growing stronger.",
    "Client: I hope so. It's just... there are days when I feel like I'm making progress, and then something will trigger a memory, and I'm right back there. Like last week, I saw a group of people in matching t-shirts handing out flyers, and I had a panic attack right there on the street. It's frustrating to feel so out of control sometimes.",
    "Therapist: Those reactions are normal. You're processing the trauma.",
    "Client: I suppose. It's just exhausting, you know? Always being on guard, always worried about when the next flashback might hit. I want to be able to trust again, to feel safe in the world. But right now, it feels like such a long way off. I'm trying to stay hopeful, but some days it's really hard.",
    "Therapist: Your resilience is admirable. How do you cope on difficult days?",
    "Client: Well, I've been trying to develop some coping strategies. Deep breathing helps sometimes, and I've started keeping a journal. Writing about my feelings seems to help get them out of my head. I've also been trying to reconnect with old friends, people from before the cult. It's scary, but it feels good to have some connections that aren't tainted by that experience.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent strategies. You're taking positive steps.",
    "Client: Thank you. It means a lot to hear that. Sometimes I worry that I'm not doing enough or that I should be recovering faster. But I'm trying to be patient with myself. This session... talking about it in detail like this... it's hard, but I think it's helping. It feels like I'm taking some of the power back from those memories.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible courage. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but also a bit lighter. Like I've set down a heavy weight I've been carrying. There's still a lot to work through, but I feel like I've made progress today. Thank you for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone listen without judgment.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Let's end here.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you again. I know we still have a long way to go, but I'm feeling more hopeful than I have in a while. I'm looking forward to our next session, even though I know it won't be easy. But I feel like I'm finally starting to reclaim my life, bit by bit.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself. We'll continue next time."
