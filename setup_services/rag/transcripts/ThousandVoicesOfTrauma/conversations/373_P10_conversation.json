    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. We're going to talk about the earthquake, right? I've been trying not to think about it, but now that I'm here, my stomach's in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess so. Where do I start?",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes if you're comfortable. Take us to the moment the earthquake began.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in my office. It's a regular Tuesday afternoon. I'm working on a report when suddenly... the ground starts to shake. At first, it's just a little tremor, and I think, \"No big deal.\" But then... oh God, it gets stronger. The whole building is swaying.",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: Papers are flying off my desk. My coffee mug tips over, spilling everywhere. I can hear people shouting in the hallway. The blinds on my window are rattling like crazy. I... I freeze for a second, not sure what to do.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm thinking, \"This is it. This is how I die.\" My heart is racing. I can't breathe properly. I remember those earthquake drills from school, but my mind's blank. I'm just... paralyzed.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Uh... probably around 70. It's... it's intense.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: Right, okay... The shaking gets even worse. I can hear glass breaking somewhere. I finally snap out of it and dive under my desk. I'm holding onto the legs, and they're vibrating in my hands. The noise is deafening - it's like a freight train is running through the building.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you experiencing?",
    "Client: My... my hands are sweating. I can feel my heart pounding in my chest. My mouth is dry. I'm shaking, but I don't know if it's me or the earthquake. I feel nauseous, like I might throw up any second.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I can smell dust. There's this weird, acrid smell in the air. I hear a loud crash - I think it's the bookshelf falling over. I'm curled up in a ball under the desk, and I... I start crying. I'm so scared. I'm thinking about my mom, wondering if she's okay.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 85. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. Remember, you survived this. You're safe now.",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, okay. Um, the shaking starts to slow down. It feels like it's been going on forever, but I know it was probably only a minute or two. I'm still under the desk, afraid to move. I can hear car alarms going off outside, and people are shouting.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I stay under the desk for a while. My legs are shaking so much, I'm not sure I can stand. Eventually, I hear someone in the hallway shouting that we need to evacuate. I crawl out from under the desk. The office is a mess - everything's on the floor, there's broken glass everywhere.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling as you see this?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in shock, I think. It doesn't feel real. I'm looking around, and it's like I'm watching a movie. I stumble to the door, and that's when I see Sarah from accounting. She's crying, and there's a cut on her forehead. That's when it really hits me - this is real, this actually happened.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I feel guilty. I should help Sarah, but I'm frozen again. I can't move. I'm thinking, \"What if there's an aftershock? What if the building collapses?\" I'm... I'm ashamed that I'm so scared.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel scared in that situation. What happens next?",
    "Client: Someone - I think it's Dave from HR - he comes and helps Sarah. He's telling everyone to stay calm and head to the stairs. I follow the crowd. The stairwell is packed, and it's moving so slowly. I can hear people crying, praying. Someone behind me is having a panic attack.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still pretty high. Maybe 80? My hands are sweating just talking about it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. Thanks. So, we're slowly making our way down the stairs. It feels like it takes forever. Every little tremor makes people gasp. I'm holding onto the railing so tight my knuckles are white. I keep thinking about aftershocks, about the building collapsing while we're still inside.",
    "Therapist: What do you see when you finally get outside?",
    "Client: It's... it's chaos. There are people everywhere, some crying, some just standing there looking shell-shocked. I can hear sirens in the distance. The street is a mess - there are cracks in the pavement, a fire hydrant is spewing water, and a car has been crushed by a fallen tree.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel seeing all of this?",
    "Client: I feel... overwhelmed. Scared. But also... relieved? I made it out. I'm alive. But then I start thinking about my apartment, about my cat. Is she okay? What if my building collapsed? And my mom - I need to call her, but cell service is down.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I just stand there for a while. I don't know what to do. People around me are trying to call loved ones, but nobody can get through. I see a woman sobbing, and I think she's having a breakdown. I want to help, but I don't know how. I feel... useless.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe 70? Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also kind of helping?",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing the experience. What happens as time passes?",
    "Client: We're all just... waiting. Nobody knows what to do. After about an hour, some officials show up. They're telling us it's not safe to go back inside, that we need to go to an emergency shelter. I don't want to - I want to go home, check on my cat. But I know I can't.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: Frustrated. Angry, even. But mostly... I feel lost. Like the world has turned upside down and I don't know how to right it. I follow the crowd to the shelter, but it feels like I'm sleepwalking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. Can you describe the shelter?",
    "Client: It's... it's a high school gym. There are cots set up, and volunteers handing out water and blankets. It's crowded, noisy. I can smell sweat and fear. I find a corner and sit down. That's when it really hits me - I have no idea what's going to happen next. My home might be gone, my job... everything could be different now.",
    "Therapist: That uncertainty must have been terrifying. How did you cope?",
    "Client: I... I didn't, really. I just sat there, numb. I think I was in shock. People around me were crying, comforting each other. But I just... couldn't connect. I felt so alone, even in this crowded room.",
    "Therapist: It's common to feel disconnected after trauma. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's lower. Maybe 60? Talking about it... it's helping me make sense of it all.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's take a moment to breathe. You've been very brave revisiting this experience.",
    "Client: Thanks... it's... it's hard, but I think it's good to talk about it. I've been avoiding thinking about that day for so long.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. Drained. But also... maybe a little lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying around.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after processing trauma. We'll end here for today. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later.",
    "Client: Okay, I will. Thanks... this was tough, but... I think it helped.",
    "Therapist: You've made great progress. We'll continue next session. Take care, John."
