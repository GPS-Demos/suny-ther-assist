    "Therapist: Okay, Carlos, let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to the day of the airplane crash.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Alright. I'm... I'm on the plane. It's a military transport. We're flying over unfamiliar terrain. The engines... they're making this strange noise. It's getting louder.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, about a 4. I'm tense, but okay.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue.",
    "Client: The plane starts shaking. People are looking around, nervous. I can smell something burning. My heart is racing. The pilot's voice comes over the intercom, but I can barely hear him over the noise. Suddenly, we're dropping. Fast. Oh God, we're going down.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: 7... maybe 8. My palms are sweating. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Carlos. Stay with it.",
    "Client: There's chaos. People screaming. I'm gripping the seat so hard my knuckles are white. The ground is coming up so fast. I think, \"This is it. I'm going to die.\" The impact... it's deafening. Metal tearing. My body slams forward. Pain. So much pain. (voice shaking) I can taste blood in my mouth.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) 9. It's... it's really intense.",
    "Therapist: I hear you. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: Smoke everywhere. I can't see. I'm trying to unbuckle my seatbelt, but my hands are shaking so much. Someone's crying nearby. I smell fuel. Oh God, what if there's a fire? I finally get free and stumble out of my seat. There's debris everywhere. I'm calling out, trying to find my squad mates.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: Still at 9. My heart's pounding. I feel dizzy, like I might pass out.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: I make it to an opening in the wreckage. The sunlight is blinding. I'm coughing, choking on smoke and dust. I see bodies... (voice breaks) Some of them aren't moving. I start pulling people out. My arm is killing me, but I can't stop. I have to help them.",
    "Therapist: And now?",
    "Client: (exhales slowly) 8. It's... it's easing a bit. But I still feel shaky.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're processing a lot.",
    "Client: I keep working, helping the injured. Time seems to stand still. Eventually, I hear helicopters. Rescue teams arrive. It's only then that I realize how badly I'm hurt. The adrenaline starts to wear off, and the pain hits me full force. But we survived. Some of us, at least.",
