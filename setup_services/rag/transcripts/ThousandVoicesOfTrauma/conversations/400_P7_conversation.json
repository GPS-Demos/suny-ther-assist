    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Johnson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit anxious, to be honest. Talking about my experiences as a refugee always brings up a lot of emotions.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We're here to support you.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate that. It's been years, but sometimes it feels like yesterday when we had to flee our home. The sound of gunfire, the chaos... it's all still so vivid.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Can you describe that moment?",
    "Client: It was early morning. We heard explosions in the distance. My wife and I grabbed our children and a few belongings. The streets were filled with people running, screaming. I remember the weight of my youngest daughter in my arms, her tears soaking my shirt.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that memory. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) The fear was overwhelming. I kept thinking, \"We might not make it.\" Cars were honking, people were pushing. I lost sight of my oldest son for a moment, and my heart nearly stopped.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. Keep going.",
    "Client: We managed to get to the border, but the crossing was chaotic. So many people, all desperate. I remember the heat, the dust, the cries of children. My wife was holding onto our documents so tightly, her knuckles were white.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How were you feeling?",
    "Client: I felt... helpless. Angry. Scared. Here I was, a grown man, a professional, reduced to begging for safe passage. The uncertainty was crushing. Would we be turned away? What would happen to us?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid feelings. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) We waited for hours. My legs ached, but I didn't dare sit down. I was afraid if I did, we'd lose our place. The children were hungry, tired. I felt like I was failing them.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Continue.",
    "Client: When we finally crossed, there was a moment of relief, quickly followed by dread. We were safe from immediate danger, but we had nothing. No home, no jobs, no idea what would happen next. I remember looking at my family's tired faces and feeling a mix of love and guilt.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have felt that way. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (voice cracking) Sometimes I still wake up in a cold sweat, thinking we're back there. The chronic pain in my back from that journey is a constant reminder. I wonder if I could have done more, protected them better.",
    "Therapist: You did your best in an impossible situation.",
    "Client: I know that logically, but emotionally... it's hard. Building a new life here has been challenging. The language, the culture, the looks we sometimes get. But when I see my children thriving now, I think maybe it was worth it.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful reflection. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Drained, but... lighter, I suppose. Talking about it is never easy, but it does help to process these memories.",

    "Therapist: That's common. We'll end here for today.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you for your guidance. I know it's your job, but it really does make a difference.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad it helps. Take care, Mr. Johnson."
