    "Therapist: Good morning, John. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Morning, Dr. Evans. I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been thinking about it a lot since our last session.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... the idea of reliving those experiences with the cult. I've spent so long trying to forget, you know? I'm worried about what might come up, how I'll react. What if I can't handle it? What if it makes everything worse?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. Let's discuss the process briefly.",
    "Client: Okay, I appreciate that. I mean, I trust you, but this feels like a big step. Can you explain again why we're doing this? I know you've mentioned it before, but I think I need to hear it again to really understand.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Imaginal exposure helps process trauma memories. It can reduce PTSD symptoms over time.",
    "Client: Right, I remember you saying something like that. But how exactly does reliving it help? Won't it just bring back all those painful feelings?",
    "Therapist: It may be difficult initially, but it allows you to confront and process emotions safely.",
    "Client: I see. So it's like facing my fears head-on? I guess that makes sense, even if it sounds scary. What should I expect during the session?",
    "Therapist: You'll describe the traumatic event in detail. I'll guide you through it supportively.",
    "Client: Okay, that sounds intense. Will I have to go through the whole experience in one go? And what if I start panicking or feeling overwhelmed?",
    "Therapist: We'll take it step by step. You can pause anytime. I'll be here to support you throughout.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I appreciate your support, Dr. Evans. I'm still nervous, but knowing I can stop if needed helps. How long will this process take? Will we do this every session from now on?",
    "Therapist: We'll do multiple sessions, adjusting as needed. Your comfort and progress guide our pace.",
    "Client: I understand. It's a bit daunting to think about doing this multiple times, but I guess that's part of the process, right? Building up tolerance or something like that?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. It's about gradual exposure and processing. Your courage is admirable, John.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot. I'm trying to remind myself that this is for my own good, even if it's difficult. Is there anything I should do to prepare for these sessions?",
    "Therapist: Just come as you are. Honesty and openness are key. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: Okay, I can do that. I'm grateful for your guidance, Dr. Evans. Even though I'm anxious, I feel a bit more ready now. Is there anything else I should know before we start?",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're in control. Your feelings are valid. This is a safe space.",
    "Client: Thank you. That's comforting to hear. I think... I think I'm ready to give this a try. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's begin when you're comfortable. Take a deep breath."
