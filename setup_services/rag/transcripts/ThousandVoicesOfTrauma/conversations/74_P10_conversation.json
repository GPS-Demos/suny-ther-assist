    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Patel. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit apprehensive, to be honest. My pain has been acting up, and thinking about revisiting those memories... it's not easy.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to support you. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Yes, let's... let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in the base camp. It's hot, so hot. The air feels thick with dust and... and tension. I can hear the distant rumble of vehicles, probably Humvees.",
    "Therapist: Good. What time of day is it?",
    "Client: It's early morning. The sun is just starting to rise, casting long shadows across the compound. I'm... I'm getting ready for a patrol.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Um... about a 40, I'd say.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: I'm checking my gear. The weight of the body armor feels... feels suffocating in this heat. My hands are sweating inside my gloves. I... I remember feeling so alert, yet so tired at the same time.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about home. About my husband and kids. I wonder if I'll see them again. God, why am I even here? I... I shouldn't be thinking like this before a mission.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have those thoughts. Keep going.",
    "Client: We're... we're moving out now. The crunch of gravel under our boots, the clinking of equipment. Everything feels so heavy. My heart is racing. I can feel it pounding in my chest.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe 60?",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: We're... we're in the village now. It's quiet. Too quiet. The locals who are usually out and about are... they're nowhere to be seen. Something feels off.",
    "Therapist: What do you do?",
    "Client: I signal to the team to be on high alert. My grip on my weapon tightens. I'm scanning every window, every doorway. The tension is... it's unbearable.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What are you experiencing in your body?",
    "Client: My muscles are so tense. My jaw is clenched. I... I can taste metal in my mouth. Is that... is that fear?",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. Keep going.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a flash. A deafening explosion. I'm... I'm thrown to the ground. The world is spinning. My ears are ringing. I can't... I can't hear anything.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I'm trying to get up. There's dust everywhere. I can't see. I'm calling out to my team, but I can't hear my own voice. Oh God, where are they?",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. 80, maybe higher.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here with me. You're safe. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I manage to stand. My vision is clearing. I see... I see bodies. Oh God, there's so much blood. I'm moving towards them, but my legs feel like lead.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it.",
    "Client: I reach the nearest soldier. It's... it's Johnson. He's not moving. There's a... a piece of shrapnel in his chest. I'm trying to help him, but... but I know it's too late.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel helpless. Angry. Scared. It's all mixing together. My hands are shaking as I try to check for a pulse.",
    "Therapist: Those are all normal reactions. What happens next?",
    "Client: More explosions. Gunfire. It's coming from everywhere. I'm dragging Johnson behind a wall. I'm returning fire, but... but I don't even know where I'm shooting.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you experiencing?",
    "Client: Adrenaline. Pure adrenaline. My heart feels like it's going to burst out of my chest. I can smell the gunpowder, the blood. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's maxed out. 100. I can't... I can't do this.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here with me. You're safe.",
    "Client: I'm... I'm trying. It just feels so real.",

    "Therapist: Good. Now, continue with what happened next, but remember you're here, safe.",
    "Client: Okay... The firefight continues. I'm low on ammo. I can hear screaming - both our guys and the enemy. I see... I see Williams. He's hit, but he's moving.",
    "Therapist: What do you do?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm calling out to him. Trying to get him to move to my position. He's crawling, leaving a trail of blood. I want to go to him, but... but I can't leave my cover.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: Torn. Guilty. Scared. I... I should be out there helping him.",
    "Therapist: Those are difficult feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: Williams... he makes it to me. I'm checking his wound. It's bad, but... but I think he'll make it if we can get him out. I'm radioing for support, for evac.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 85? But I feel... I feel more focused now.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Continue.",
    "Client: The firefight is dying down. Our reinforcements are arriving. I can hear the choppers coming in. We're... we're going to make it out.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling as you realize this?",
    "Client: Relief, but... but also dread. We lost people. Good people. And for what? This... this senseless violence.",
    "Therapist: Those are heavy emotions. How does your body feel?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Every muscle aches. My ears are still ringing. I feel... I feel hollow inside.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens as you're evacuated?",
    "Client: We're loaded onto the chopper. The sound of the rotors is deafening, but... but it's almost comforting. As we lift off, I... I look down at the village. It's in ruins.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking as you see this?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm wondering about the civilians. Did we help them or... or just make things worse? I feel... I feel so conflicted.",
    "Therapist: That's a complex emotion. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. Just... just completely drained. My adrenaline is crashing. I... I want to cry, but I can't. Not here, not now.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. What happens when you return to base?",
    "Client: We land. There's a flurry of activity. Medics rushing to help the wounded. I'm... I'm just standing there, frozen. Someone's talking to me, but I can't... I can't process what they're saying.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: Numb. I feel... I feel disconnected from everything. Like I'm watching it all happen from outside my body.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response to trauma. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I stumble to my quarters. I sit on my bunk and... and just stare at the wall. I should be writing my report, but... but I can't bring myself to do it.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking about?",
    "Client: The faces. Johnson's lifeless eyes. Williams' blood on my hands. The... the destroyed village. It's all... it's all replaying in my head.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's lower. Maybe 70? But it feels... it feels different. Heavier.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You've been through a lot. How do you feel about sharing this memory?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. But also... also a bit relieving? Like I'm not carrying it alone anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. You've done very well today. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves again. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Okay... I'm... I'm here. In your office. It's... it's over.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. You're safe here. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired. Really tired. But also... also a bit lighter? Is that... is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's a common experience. You've done excellent work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I didn't think I could do this.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself. We'll end here for today. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you... thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
