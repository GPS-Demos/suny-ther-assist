    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm not really sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. I can still hear the shouting in my head, you know? My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I was right back there, watching it all happen again.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: Um, probably the sound of glass shattering. It was when my dad threw that vase at the wall near my mom. I remember feeling so helpless, like I should do something but I was frozen. I keep thinking, what if I had stepped in? Maybe things would've been different.",
    "Therapist: How did reliving that memory feel today?",
    "Client: It was... harder than I expected. I thought I'd gotten past this, you know? But going through it again, I realized how much anger I still have. Not just at my dad, but at myself for not doing more. And there's this overwhelming sadness too, for my mom, for my younger self. It's like a heavy weight on my chest.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid feelings. How do you think this connects to your current struggles?",
    "Client: I... I guess I never realized how much it affected me. Like, the way I flinch at loud noises or how I'm always on edge in my relationship. I'm constantly worried something bad will happen, that I'll end up like my mom. It's exhausting, always being on guard like that.",
    "Therapist: You've shown a lot of courage today. What do you think you've learned?",
    "Client: I think... I'm starting to see that it wasn't my fault. I was just a kid, you know? And maybe that's why I'm so anxious now, always trying to control everything. It's like I'm still trying to prevent something bad from happening, even though I'm not in that situation anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. How might this awareness help you moving forward?",
    "Client: Well, maybe I can start being a bit easier on myself. And... I don't know, maybe I can try to let my guard down a little with my boyfriend. It's hard, but I want to trust that not every relationship will end up like my parents'. I'm just... I'm tired of living in fear all the time.",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. How are you feeling about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's scary, but... I think it's helping. Even though it's painful to go through these memories, I feel like I'm starting to understand myself better. And that gives me hope, you know? Like maybe I can actually get past this and have a normal life. I want to keep going, even if it's tough.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is admirable. What support do you need?",
    "Client: I think... just knowing that it's okay to struggle with this. Sometimes I feel like I should be over it by now, but then sessions like this remind me how deep it goes. Maybe some techniques for grounding myself when the memories get overwhelming? And... I don't know, just reassurance that I'm making progress, even when it doesn't feel like it.",
    "Therapist: Those are all things we can work on. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I guess. For listening and helping me through this. It's not easy to talk about, but I feel a little lighter after each session. Like maybe there's a chance I can heal from this and move on with my life. I'm scared, but I'm also... hopeful? Yeah, hopeful. That's new for me.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful, Sarah. We'll continue this journey together."
