    "Therapist: Hello, Marcus. Today we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Thompson. To be honest, I'm feeling pretty nervous. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. I'm not sure I'm ready to face those memories head-on. Just thinking about it makes my heart race a bit.",
    "Therapist: I understand. It's normal to feel anxious. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about reliving those painful experiences from my relationship breakup. It was such a dark time, and I've tried so hard to push those memories away. What if I can't handle it? What if it makes my depression worse? I'm already struggling to keep up with my studies, and I don't want this to set me back even further.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How about we discuss the purpose of this exercise?",
    "Client: Okay, that might help. I mean, I trust you, Dr. Thompson, but I just don't see how revisiting those awful memories could possibly be good for me. It feels counterintuitive, you know? Like, shouldn't I be trying to move forward instead of looking back?",
    "Therapist: The goal is to process those memories safely, reducing their power over you. Shall I explain how it works?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I'd really like to understand the process better. Maybe if I know what to expect, it won't seem so daunting. And if you could tell me how this ties into dealing with my PTSD symptoms, that would be great too.",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit the memory gradually, in a safe environment. You're in control throughout. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's somewhat reassuring. I appreciate that I'll be in control. But I'm still worried about how intense it might get. What if I start panicking or get overwhelmed with emotions? I've been trying so hard to keep it together, especially living alone and dealing with my studies. I don't want to fall apart.",
    "Therapist: I'll be here to support you. We can pause anytime. Remember, this helps reduce PTSD symptoms over time.",
    "Client: Okay, that's good to know. I guess I'm just scared of facing those feelings again. The breakup was bad enough, but it also brought up a lot of insecurities from when I was bullied in school. It's like everything just piled up, you know? But if you really think this will help with my PTSD and depression in the long run, I'm willing to give it a try. Can you tell me more about what I might experience during the exposure?",
    "Therapist: You may feel strong emotions or physical reactions. This is normal and will subside. Your bravery is commendable.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Thompson. I appreciate your support. I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be. It helps to know that what I might feel is normal. Can we start slowly? And if it gets too much, can I signal you somehow? I want to push myself, but I also want to make sure I don't completely lose it.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll start slow. Use a hand signal if you need a break. Your well-being is the priority.",
    "Client: Okay, that makes me feel a bit better. I'm still nervous, but I'm also hopeful that this might help me move forward. It's been so hard trying to juggle my studies with all these emotions and memories. If this can help me process things and reduce my symptoms, then it's worth trying. I'm ready to take this step, Dr. Thompson. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable, Marcus. Shall we begin with a breathing exercise first?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be helpful. My heart is still racing a bit, and I can feel myself tensing up. A breathing exercise sounds like a good way to calm down and center myself before we start. I've been trying to use some of the techniques you taught me when I feel overwhelmed with my studies or when memories of the breakup surface unexpectedly. It would be good to ground myself before we dive into this.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's take a few deep breaths together. Ready?"
