    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the cult experience you mentioned?",
    "Client: Okay... I remember the day I first attended a meeting. It was in an old warehouse on the outskirts of town. The air was thick with incense, and there were about 30 people seated in a circle. I felt nervous but also curious.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you saw.",
    "Client: The leader, a tall man with piercing blue eyes, stood in the center. He started speaking about how we were all chosen, special. His words were mesmerizing, and I felt myself being drawn in. But there was also this underlying sense of unease that I couldn't shake off.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happened next?",
    "Client: As the meeting progressed, things started to get... intense. The leader began singling out individuals, making them stand up and confess their \"sins\" to the group. I remember feeling horrified when a young woman next to me was chosen. She started sobbing, talking about things she'd done... it was so personal, so invasive.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. How did you feel in that moment?",
    "Client: I felt... trapped. My heart was racing, and I wanted to leave, but I was afraid of drawing attention to myself. The woman's sobs echoed in my ears, and I could feel the tension in the room. It was like everyone was holding their breath, waiting to see who would be next.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Suddenly, the leader's eyes locked onto mine. I felt a chill run down my spine. He pointed at me and said, \"You. Stand up.\" My legs felt like lead, but somehow I managed to stand. My mind was blank with panic.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I... I can't. It's too much. I don't want to remember what happened next.",
    "Therapist: That's alright. We can pause here.",
    "Client: No, I... I want to try. Just give me a moment. [Deep breath] Okay. As I stood there, the leader approached me. He put his hand on my shoulder, and I could smell his breath - it was sickly sweet, like overripe fruit. He asked me what secrets I was hiding, what darkness was in my soul.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I couldn't speak. My mouth was dry, and my mind was racing. I felt like everyone's eyes were boring into me, judging me. The leader's grip on my shoulder tightened, and he started talking about how he could see my pain, my fears. He said he could save me, but only if I gave myself completely to the group.",
    "Therapist: How did that make you feel?",
    "Client: Terrified. Violated. But also... a small part of me felt relieved. Like maybe there was a way to fix everything that was wrong with me. It's confusing and shameful to admit that.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have conflicting feelings. You're processing a complex experience.",
    "Client: As he spoke, I started to cry. I couldn't help it. The tears just came, and I felt so exposed, so vulnerable. The leader embraced me, and the group started chanting something. I couldn't make out the words, but the sound was overwhelming. I felt like I was drowning in it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: I wanted to run, to scream, but I couldn't move. It was like I was frozen in place. The chanting got louder and louder, and the leader was whispering in my ear about how I was now part of something greater, how I would never be alone again. I felt dizzy, disoriented. The room seemed to spin around me.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Remember, you're here now, safe.",
    "Client: I... I think I need to stop. This is bringing up a lot of emotions I wasn't prepared for.",
    "Therapist: That's absolutely fine. You've done excellent work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I didn't realize how vivid these memories still were. It's like I was right back there in that warehouse.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Shaken, but... also a bit relieved. Like I've let out something that's been bottled up for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. Let's end here and discuss some grounding techniques."
