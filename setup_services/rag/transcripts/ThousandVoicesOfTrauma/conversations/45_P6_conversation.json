    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your current SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10. My heart's beating a bit faster than usual.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and begin describing the memory.",
    "Client: I'm in the holding cell. It's cold and the fluorescent lights are harsh. I can hear the echoing of footsteps down the hallway. The metal bench I'm sitting on is uncomfortable. I keep thinking about my family, wondering if they know where I am. My stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. I'm feeling more anxious as I recall the details.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Continue with the memory.",
    "Client: I... I can smell the disinfectant they use to clean the cells. It's making me feel nauseous. An officer walks by, barely glancing at me. I feel so small, so insignificant. My hands are shaking, and I'm trying to hold back tears. I keep replaying the moment they arrested me, wondering how this could have happened.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's an 8. I'm feeling really overwhelmed. My chest feels tight, and I'm having trouble breathing normally.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure I can. This feels too real.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's happening next in the memory?",
    "Client: I hear keys jingling. An officer is coming to my cell. My heart is racing. I'm terrified they're going to tell me I can't go home. I'm thinking about my kids, wondering if I'll ever see them again. The officer opens the door, and I feel like I might pass out from fear.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm right back there. My palms are sweating, and I'm feeling dizzy.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep breathing. What happens next?",
    "Client: The officer tells me I'm being released. I feel a rush of relief, but I'm still shaking. As I'm walking out, I see other people in cells, and I feel guilty for leaving them behind. The sunlight when I step outside is blinding. I'm free, but I feel... changed. Like a part of me is still in that cell.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 7. I'm still anxious, but the worst has passed.",
    "Therapist: Well done. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm trying to focus on the present. My breathing is starting to slow down.",
    "Therapist: Good. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... also a bit proud that I made it through. My SUDS is probably around a 5 now.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You did excellent work today."
