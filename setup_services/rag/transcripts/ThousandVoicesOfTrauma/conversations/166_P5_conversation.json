    "Therapist: Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. To be honest, I'm feeling quite anxious. The idea of revisiting those war experiences, especially considering the racial trauma I faced... it's daunting. As a Southeast Asian woman in combat, I faced unique challenges. I've spent years trying to forget those memories.",
    "Therapist: Your anxiety is understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I worry about losing control of my emotions. What if I can't handle it? And... I'm concerned about how you'll perceive me, as a male therapist who hasn't experienced what I have. Will you really understand?",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your honesty. Let's address those concerns together.",
    "Client: Okay. I suppose that would help. It's just... these memories are so intertwined with my identity, my experiences as a minority in the military. It's not just about the combat, but also the discrimination and isolation I felt. How can reliving that possibly be helpful?",
    "Therapist: Exposure helps process traumatic memories. It can reduce their power over you.",
    "Client: I see. But won't it make my depression worse? I've struggled with it for so long, and it seems like opening this can of worms might exacerbate those feelings of hopelessness and sadness.",
    "Therapist: It's a valid concern. We'll monitor your mood closely and adjust as needed.",
    "Client: Alright. I trust your expertise. Can you walk me through what exactly we'll be doing? How does this imaginal exposure work in practice?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the traumatic event in detail. I'll guide you through it supportively.",
    "Client: That sounds intense. Will I have to do this multiple times? And what if I start to panic or feel overwhelmed during the process?",
    "Therapist: We'll do multiple sessions. If overwhelmed, we'll use grounding techniques. Your safety is priority.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's reassuring to know you'll be there to support me. I suppose I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Is there anything I should do to prepare myself for our next session when we actually start the exposure?",
    "Therapist: Practice self-care. Rest well. Remember, you're in control throughout the process.",
    "Client: Thank you. That helps. I'll try to take care of myself this week. It's not always easy living alone, especially when dealing with these issues. But I'm committed to this process. I want to heal and move forward with my life.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is admirable. Any other questions before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just one. How will we measure progress? How will I know if this is actually helping me deal with my PTSD and depression?",
    "Therapist: We'll track your symptoms regularly and discuss your experiences after each session.",
    "Client: Okay, that makes sense. I appreciate your patience with all my questions. I'm nervous, but also feeling a glimmer of hope. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. We'll take this journey together, step by step."
