    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Take a deep breath and begin when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in that alley. It's dark, and I can hear muffled voices. My heart is racing already. I... I see two men arguing. One of them pulls out a knife. Oh God, this is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: It's about a 6. I feel tense all over.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: The man with the knife lunges forward. There's a scuffle, and I hear a cry of pain. I'm frozen in place, unable to move or look away. My mouth is dry, and I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I see blood. So much blood. The victim falls to the ground, clutching his stomach. The attacker runs away, and I'm just standing there, useless. I want to help, but I'm paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's an 8. My hands are shaking, and I feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I finally manage to move. I run to the man on the ground. He's gasping for air, looking at me with desperate eyes. I press my hands against his wound, trying to stop the bleeding. It's warm and sticky. I'm panicking, looking around for help, but the street is deserted.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Overwhelmed. Guilty. I should have done something sooner. My SUDS is still at 8.",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. You're processing a difficult memory.",
    "Client: I hear sirens in the distance. The man's breathing is getting weaker. I'm talking to him, telling him to hold on, but I don't know if he can hear me. His eyes are unfocused. I'm covered in his blood, and I can smell it. It's metallic and sickening.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a deep breath. You're doing well.",
    "Client: The paramedics arrive. They take over, and I stumble back. I'm in shock. I can't stop staring at my bloodied hands. Someone's asking me questions, but I can barely hear them. Everything feels surreal, like I'm watching a movie.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My SUDS is still at 9. I'm shaking all over. I feel helpless and scared.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're processing the memory well.",
    "Client: They're loading the man into the ambulance. I want to go with him, but I can't move. A police officer is guiding me away, asking for my statement. I can't form words. All I can think about is the man's eyes, pleading for help.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating at this point?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down a bit. Maybe an 8 now. I feel drained.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're working through it. Continue.",
    "Client: I'm sitting in the back of a police car, wrapped in a blanket. They're taking me to the station. I can't stop replaying the scene in my head. The knife, the blood, the man's eyes. I feel numb, but my mind won't stop racing.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My SUDS is down to a 7. I'm exhausted, but the images are still vivid.",
    "Therapist: You've done an excellent job. Let's start wrapping up the exercise.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm at the police station now. They're asking me questions, but I feel disconnected. I keep looking at my hands, even though they've been cleaned. I can still feel the man's blood on them.",
    "Therapist: What's your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's a 6 now. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved to have talked through it.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've done great work today. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves."
