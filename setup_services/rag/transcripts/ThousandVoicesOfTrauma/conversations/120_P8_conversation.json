    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. I can still feel my heart pounding. That memory... it's so vivid, you know? I can almost smell the musty air in that room where it happened.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... anger? It's like this hot, churning feeling in my stomach. I'm angry at him for what he did, but I'm also angry at myself for not being able to stop it. And then there's this overwhelming sense of shame that just washes over me.",
    "Therapist: I see. Can you tell me more about that shame?",
    "Client: It's... it's suffocating. Like a heavy blanket that's smothering me. I feel so small, so worthless. Even though I know logically that it wasn't my fault, there's this voice in my head that keeps saying I should have done something, anything to prevent it. And now, with this cyber bullying... it's like history repeating itself. I feel powerless all over again.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you're talking about this?",
    "Client: Tense. Really tense. My shoulders are up to my ears, and my jaw feels like it's locked. There's this tightness in my chest, like I can't get a full breath. And my hands... they're trembling. I didn't even notice until now.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why me?\" Why did this have to happen to me? And then I feel guilty for even asking that because I know others have gone through worse. But I can't shake this feeling that I'm somehow... broken. Damaged goods. Like everyone can see it written all over me.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts relate to your experience with cyber bullying?",
    "Client: It's... it's like they're feeding into each other. The cyber bullying brings up all these old feelings of helplessness and shame from the physical abuse. And because I'm feeling so vulnerable from the bullying, it's making the memories of the abuse even more intense. It's this vicious cycle that I can't seem to break out of.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to curl up and hide from the world. But another part... I guess I need to feel safe. To know that what happened doesn't define me. That I'm not that powerless little girl anymore. But it's so hard to believe that when I'm feeling like this.",
    "Therapist: I hear you. How might we work towards that feeling of safety?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe by reminding myself that I'm here now, in this room, and that I'm okay. That what I'm remembering is in the past. And maybe... maybe by focusing on the strengths I've developed since then? Like, I've built a successful career, I've lived on my own. That has to count for something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What else?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to work on setting boundaries. Both in my personal life and online. The cyber bullying... it's bringing up all these old feelings, but it's also a new challenge. I need to learn how to protect myself in this digital age without completely shutting myself off from the world.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful approach. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: A little calmer, I think. My heart isn't racing as much. There's still this undercurrent of anxiety, but it's not as overwhelming. Talking about it... it helps. It's like shining a light on these dark corners of my mind. It's still scary, but at least I can see what I'm dealing with now.",
    "Therapist: What's one thing you can do to take care of yourself for the rest of the day?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'll go for a walk in the park near my apartment. Being in nature always helps ground me. And maybe I'll call my sister. She doesn't know all the details, but she's always been supportive. Just hearing her voice might help me feel more connected, less alone.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I... I just want to say thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's not easy, reliving these memories, but I think... I think it's helping. Slowly, but it's helping. I feel a little stronger each time, even if it doesn't always feel like it in the moment.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue this work next session. Take care."
