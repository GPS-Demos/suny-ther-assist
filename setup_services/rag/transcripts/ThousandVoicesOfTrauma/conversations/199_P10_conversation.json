    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Johnson. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: G'day, Dr. Smith. To be honest, I'm feeling a bit... unsettled. Been tossing and turning all night, thinking about this.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to work through this together. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, alright. Let's give it a go.",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: (deep breath) I'm... I'm at the community center. It's our weekly elders' meeting. The air's thick with tension. Someone's just shared news about... about the land rights decision.",
    "Therapist: Good. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The room feels small, stuffy. I can hear murmurs, see furrowed brows. My mate, Tom, he's clenching his fists on the table. I feel... I feel a knot in my gut.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Oh, I'd say about a 40. It's not pleasant, but I can manage.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: The community leader stands up. He's trying to keep calm, but his voice is shaking. He says, \"They've denied our claim. Again.\" The room erupts. I... I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I stand up. I'm shouting, \"This is our land! Our ancestors' land!\" My heart's racing. I feel... powerless, angry.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe 60?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Someone suggests a protest. I see hope in some eyes, fear in others. I remember thinking of my late wife, how she'd always been the peacemaker. I... I miss her guidance.",
    "Therapist: How does that feeling of missing her affect you in this moment?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. I feel lost, like I'm drowning in emotions. Grief for her, anger at the decision, fear for our future... it's all mixed up.",
    "Therapist: Remember to stay in the present moment. What's happening around you?",
    "Client: Right, sorry. Um... people are arguing about what to do next. Some want to fight, others want to negotiate. I'm... I'm torn. I want justice, but I'm tired of fighting.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you experiencing?",
    "Client: My shoulders are tense. I've got a headache coming on. My stomach's in knots.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay. I'm... I'm still in the meeting. The anger in the room is palpable. Someone throws a chair. I flinch.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 75. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I decide to speak up. My voice is shaky, but I say, \"We need to stay united. Violence won't solve this.\" Some nod, others glare at me. I feel... exposed.",
    "Therapist: How does that exposure feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like... like I'm naked in front of everyone. Vulnerable. My hands are sweating. I can feel my heart pounding in my ears.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: The meeting ends with no clear plan. People are leaving, muttering, some crying. I stay behind, feeling... defeated. Lost.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... \"Have we lost everything? What would the elders of old say? What would my wife say?\" I feel... I feel like I've failed my people, my ancestors.",
    "Therapist: Remember, these are thoughts, not facts. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's pretty high. About 85 now.",
    "Therapist: Take a few deep breaths. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (breathes deeply) Okay... I'm... I'm walking home now. The streets feel different. Like the very land is mourning with us.",
    "Therapist: What do you see around you?",
    "Client: I see our sacred sites, our traditional lands. They look... they look wounded somehow. I pass by the old gum tree where I proposed to my wife. It feels like a lifetime ago.",
    "Therapist: How does seeing that tree make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's bittersweet. I feel a wave of grief, but also... a spark of strength. She would've wanted me to keep fighting, but with love, not anger.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually down a bit. Maybe 70?",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue with what happens next.",
    "Client: I get home. My daughter's there. She sees my face and knows. We hug, and I... I break down. I'm sobbing, telling her I'm sorry, that I couldn't protect our land.",
    "Therapist: What does she do?",
    "Client: She... she holds me. Tells me it's not over, that we'll keep fighting. I feel... I feel a mix of shame and pride. Shame that I'm falling apart, pride in her strength.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted. My muscles ache. But there's also... a warmth in my chest. From her love, I suppose.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that warmth. What happens next?",
    "Client: We sit down. Make some tea. Start talking about what to do next. I remember feeling... not okay, but... not alone. Like maybe there's still hope.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant shift. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down quite a bit. Maybe 50?",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Let's continue.",
    "Client: We decide to call a family meeting. To discuss our next steps. As I'm making the calls, I feel... I feel a sense of purpose returning. It's small, but it's there.",
    "Therapist: How does that sense of purpose manifest in your body?",
    "Client: My shoulders feel less heavy. There's a... a tingle in my fingertips. Like I'm ready to do something, to act.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens during the family meeting?",
    "Client: We gather in the living room. There's anger, tears, but also... determination. My nephew suggests reaching out to other communities, forming a coalition. I feel... I feel a spark of hope.",
    "Therapist: How strong is that spark?",
    "Client: It's... it's small, but it's growing. Like a little flame we're all nurturing.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 40. Still there, but manageable.",
    "Therapist: You're making great progress. Let's continue.",
    "Client: We start making plans. I share what I learned from past struggles. The younger ones bring new ideas, technology. I feel... I feel like we're bridging something. Past and future.",
    "Therapist: How does that bridging feel?",
    "Client: It feels... right. Like we're honoring our ancestors while forging ahead. There's still pain, still anger, but also... purpose.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you experiencing now?",
    "Client: My breathing's easier. There's a warmth in my chest, spreading. My hands are steady as I write down our plans.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. What's your final distress level?",
    "Client: I'd say... about 30. Still there, but... I feel like I can handle it now.",
    "Therapist: You've done remarkably well. How do you feel about the session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm surprised. It was hard, but... I feel lighter somehow. Like I've shed some of the weight I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end.",
    "Client: (breathes deeply) Thank you, doc. This... this helps more than I thought it would.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Remember, healing is a journey. We'll continue working together.",
    "Client: Yeah, I'm... I'm actually looking forward to our next session now.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful to hear. Take care, and I'll see you next time."
