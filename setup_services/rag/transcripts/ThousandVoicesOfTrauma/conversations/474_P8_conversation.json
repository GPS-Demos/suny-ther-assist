    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. That memory of the dog attack... it's so vivid. I can still hear the growling, you know? My heart is pounding, and I feel this tightness in my chest. It's like I'm right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... anger? I'm angry that this happened to me, that I still can't shake it off. I was just trying to help that stray dog, and it turned on me so suddenly. I keep replaying it in my head, wondering if I could have done something differently. Maybe if I had approached it more slowly, or... I don't know. It's frustrating.",
    "Therapist: How does that frustration manifest for you?",
    "Client: It's like this knot in my stomach. I clench my fists without realizing it. I feel so helpless, you know? Like, I can't change what happened, but I also can't move past it. It's affecting everything - my sleep, my relationships. I'm constantly on edge, especially around dogs. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are coming up for you about that feeling of helplessness?",
    "Client: I think... I think it reminds me of other times I've felt powerless. Like when I witnessed that fight in the street last year. I couldn't do anything then either. It's making me question my ability to handle difficult situations. What if something like this happens again? Will I freeze up? Will I be able to protect myself or others? It's scary to think about.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your overall experience of trauma?",
    "Client: I guess... it's all tied together. The dog attack, the street fight - they both make me feel vulnerable and exposed. I used to think I was strong and capable, but now I doubt myself constantly. It's like these experiences have shaken my foundation. I'm always waiting for the next bad thing to happen.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice in your body as you share this?",
    "Client: My shoulders are really tense. I just realized I've been holding my breath a bit. There's this heaviness in my chest, like a weight pressing down. And my hands are clammy. It's strange how talking about it brings all these physical sensations back.",
    "Therapist: What meaning do you make of these physical reactions?",
    "Client: I suppose... it's my body's way of trying to protect me? Like it's preparing for danger, even though I'm safe here. It's frustrating because logically, I know I'm okay, but my body doesn't seem to get the message. It's like I'm constantly in survival mode, and I don't know how to turn it off.",
    "Therapist: How does this impact your daily life?",
    "Client: It's... it's exhausting. I'm always on high alert. I avoid parks now, which is sad because I used to love nature. I flinch at sudden noises. My girlfriend... she's trying to be understanding, but I can tell she's frustrated. I'm not the same person I was before. I miss feeling carefree and confident. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel that way again.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to you to regain that confidence?",
    "Client: It would mean everything. To be able to walk down the street without constantly looking over my shoulder. To enjoy a day at the park without panicking. To feel like I'm living my life, not just surviving it. I want to feel strong again, to trust myself and my decisions. I want to stop letting these experiences define me.",
    "Therapist: How do you see your progress in therapy so far?",
    "Client: It's... it's been challenging, but I think I'm making progress. These exercises, as difficult as they are, help me face the memories instead of avoiding them. I'm starting to understand my reactions better. Some days are harder than others, but overall, I feel like I'm moving forward. It's slow, but it's something. I just hope I can keep this momentum going.",
    "Therapist: What gives you hope in your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I think... the fact that I'm here, doing this work. That's hopeful, right? A few months ago, I couldn't even talk about the attack without having a panic attack. Now, I can describe it, feel those emotions, and still stay present. That's progress. And my girlfriend, she's been so supportive. Seeing her believe in me... it helps me believe in myself a little more each day.",
    "Therapist: How can you build on this progress?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I need to be kinder to myself. Celebrate the small victories, you know? Like today, being able to go through this exercise without completely shutting down. Maybe I could try some small exposures outside of our sessions. Like, watching videos of friendly dogs or something. And I should probably open up more to my girlfriend about what I'm going through. She wants to help, and I've been pushing her away.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you consider these steps?",
    "Client: It's a mix of emotions, honestly. There's some anxiety, definitely. The idea of deliberately exposing myself to things that scare me... it's daunting. But there's also a glimmer of excitement? Like, maybe this is the path to getting my life back. And guilt, too. I feel like I've been so focused on my own struggles that I've neglected my relationships. It's a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: How might addressing these feelings impact your recovery?",
    "Client: I think... I think it could be really positive. If I can work through the anxiety and guilt, maybe I'll be more open to trying new things, to pushing my boundaries a bit. And strengthening my relationships could give me a better support system. It's scary, but also kind of liberating to think about taking these steps. Like I'm finally taking some control back.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you can take this week?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I could try watching a short video of a calm dog. Just for a minute or two. And I could have a honest conversation with my girlfriend about how I'm feeling and what I need from her. Both of those feel challenging, but not impossible. It's a start, right?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful plan. How do you feel about our session today?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but in a good way? Like I've done some hard work. It was tough to go through that memory again, but I feel like I understood some new things about myself. I'm nervous about the steps ahead, but also a little excited. Thank you for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone listen and understand.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great courage today. We'll end here, but remember to be gentle with yourself.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'll try to remember that. See you next week."
