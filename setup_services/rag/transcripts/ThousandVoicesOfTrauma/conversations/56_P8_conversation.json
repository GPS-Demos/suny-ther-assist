    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. I can still see those faces, you know? The women we encountered during that raid. Their eyes were so... empty. It's haunting.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you right now as you think about those faces?",
    "Client: Fear, I think. And guilt. So much guilt. I keep wondering if we could have done more, if we could have saved more of them. My heart is pounding, and I feel this tightness in my chest. It's like I'm back there, smelling the musty air of that basement.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. Can you tell me more about that guilt?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. We were supposed to be the heroes, you know? But I feel like we failed them. Some of those women had been there for years, and we... we just weren't fast enough. I keep thinking about their families, wondering if they're still searching for them. And then I think about my own family, and I... I just feel so incredibly lucky and guilty at the same time.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt manifest in your daily life?",
    "Client: It's always there, like a weight on my shoulders. Sometimes I'll be doing something completely mundane, like grocery shopping, and suddenly I'll remember a detail from that day. The sound of a door creaking open, or the smell of fear. And then I'm right back there, feeling helpless and angry. I find myself avoiding certain places or situations that might trigger these memories. It's exhausting, really.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice in your body when these memories surface?",
    "Client: My muscles tense up, especially in my shoulders and jaw. Sometimes I get a headache, or feel nauseous. There's this... this restlessness, like I need to do something, anything, to make it right. But I can't, and that's the worst part. I'm stuck with these memories and this guilt, and there's nothing I can do to change what happened.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with these intense feelings?",
    "Client: I... I try to stay busy. Work helps, sometimes. But other times, I find myself withdrawing. I don't want to burden my family with this, you know? They don't understand, how could they? So I end up isolating myself, which I know isn't healthy, but it feels safer somehow. Like if I keep it all inside, maybe it won't touch them.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to share some of this with your family?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Part of me wants to, desperately. To have someone understand, to not feel so alone in this. But another part of me is terrified. What if they look at me differently? What if they can't handle it? Or worse, what if they think less of me for not being able to save everyone? It's easier to just... keep it locked away.",
    "Therapist: How does keeping it locked away affect you?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a poison, slowly eating away at me. I feel disconnected from everyone, even when I'm with them. There's always this barrier, this secret I'm keeping. And it's not just the memories of that day, it's... it's everything I've seen and experienced since. The world feels darker now, more dangerous. I want to protect my family from that darkness, but in doing so, I'm pushing them away.",
    "Therapist: What might be a small step towards opening up?",
    "Client: I... I suppose I could try talking to my husband. Not everything at once, but maybe... maybe just telling him when I'm having a bad day. Or explaining why certain things might trigger me. It's scary to think about, but... maybe it would help. Maybe it would make me feel less alone.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... it's terrifying, honestly. But also... there's a tiny bit of hope there. Like maybe, just maybe, sharing this burden could make it a little lighter. I'm not sure I'm ready yet, but... I think I want to work towards that. Is that... is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What's your next step?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to practice what I might say. Maybe we could work on that in our next session? Figure out how to explain things in a way that won't overwhelm him or me. And maybe... maybe come up with some strategies for when things get tough. Is that something we can do?",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll work on that together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I know this isn't easy, and there's still so much to work through. But for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe there's a way forward. Like maybe I don't have to carry this alone forever. It's scary, but... it's also kind of liberating, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a big realization. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, honestly. But there's also this strange sense of... I don't know, possibility? Like maybe things can get better. It's not a feeling I'm used to, but... I think I like it. It's like a tiny spark of hope in all this darkness. Is that... is that normal?",
    "Therapist: It's a positive step. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to work more on managing these flashbacks. And maybe... maybe start planning how to talk to my husband. Baby steps, right? But steps forward, at least. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll continue at your pace.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I know I have a long way to go, but... for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe I can do this. Like maybe I'm not broken beyond repair. That's... that's something, right?",
    "Therapist: It certainly is. How would you like to end today?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to take a few deep breaths. Maybe... maybe remind myself that I'm safe here, now. That what happened is in the past. Is that... is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's do that together.",
    "Client: Okay. [Takes a deep breath] I'm here. I'm safe. What happened was terrible, but it's over. I survived. And maybe... maybe I can do more than just survive. Maybe I can learn to live again. Thank you for... for helping me see that.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'll... I'll see you then. And... thank you for listening. For not judging. It means more than I can say."
