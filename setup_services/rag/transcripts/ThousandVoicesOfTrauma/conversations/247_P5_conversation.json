    "Therapist: Mrs. Patel, today we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: Oh, dear. I'm quite nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this part of our sessions. The idea of reliving that awful experience in the hospital... it makes my heart race just thinking about it. And with all this cyberbullying business my granddaughter is dealing with, I'm already feeling rather overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: I understand. It's normal to feel anxious. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I worry that going back to that moment will be too much for my old heart to handle. What if I panic? And honestly, I'm embarrassed about how emotional I might get. At my age, I should be able to handle these things better. Plus, I'm not sure how this will help with the nightmares I've been having about the hospital.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How do you think revisiting the memory could be helpful?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe it could help me process what happened? But I'm not entirely sure. It seems counterintuitive to deliberately think about something I've been trying so hard to forget. Could you explain how this is meant to work?",
    "Therapist: Certainly. Imaginal exposure helps by...",
    "Client: (Interrupting) I'm sorry, but before you continue, could you remind me how long this will take? My arthritis has been acting up, and I'm not sure I can sit comfortably for too long.",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll start with about 30 minutes today. How does that sound?",
    "Client: Oh, that's a relief. I thought it might be hours! Alright, I think I can manage that. Please, go on with what you were saying about how this exposure thing works.",
    "Therapist: It helps reduce the power of traumatic memories over time. What are your thoughts on that?",
    "Client: I see. Well, that does make some sense. The memory of that day in the hospital has been like a dark cloud hanging over me. If this could help lift that cloud, even a little, I suppose it's worth trying. But I'm still scared, doctor. What if I can't handle it?",
    "Therapist: Your bravery is admirable. We'll go at your pace. How can I support you?",
    "Client: That's kind of you to say. I appreciate your patience with an old woman like me. Perhaps... could you hold my hand if it gets too overwhelming? My husband usually does that when I'm upset, but he's not here. And maybe we could have a cup of chai nearby? The smell always calms me down.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Anything else you need to feel safe?",
    "Client: Yes, actually. Could we make sure the room is warm enough? My joints ache terribly when it's cold, and that might distract me. Oh, and if it's not too much trouble, could you speak a bit louder? My hearing isn't what it used to be, and I want to make sure I don't miss anything important you say.",
    "Therapist: Of course. I'll adjust the thermostat and speak up. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm still nervous, but I trust you, doctor. You've been so kind and patient with me these past few weeks. It's not easy talking about these things, especially at my age. We didn't discuss mental health much when I was younger. But I want to get better, for my family's sake as well as my own. So yes, let's give it a try. Just... please be gentle with me, alright?",
    "Therapist: You're very courageous, Mrs. Patel. Shall we start with a deep breath?",
    "Client: Yes, that sounds good. (Takes a deep breath) Alright, I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Let's face this old memory and see if we can't make it less frightening. After all, I've faced many challenges in my life. This is just one more hurdle to overcome, isn't it?"
