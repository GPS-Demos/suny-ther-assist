    "Therapist: Alright, Sarah, let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's begin when you're comfortable.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in the hospital room. The beeping of the machines is so loud. I can smell the antiseptic... it's making me feel nauseous. The doctor just walked in, and he's not making eye contact. I know something's wrong. My heart is racing...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um... I'd say about a 6. I'm definitely anxious, but it's manageable.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The doctor's talking, but I can barely hear him over the pounding in my ears. He's saying something about complications... and then I hear the word \"cancer.\" It's like the room is spinning. I'm gripping the edges of the bed so tightly my knuckles are turning white.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to an 8. I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant jump. Remember, you're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Inhales shakily) I'm trying... The doctor's still talking, but all I can focus on is the word \"cancer\" echoing in my head. I feel so alone and scared. My body feels cold, and I'm shaking. I want to run away, but I'm frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now? What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel overwhelmed. My chest is so tight.",
    "Therapist: I hear how distressing this is. You're doing well staying with the memory.",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) Thanks... The doctor's finished talking, and now he's just standing there, waiting for me to respond. But I can't speak. I feel like I'm watching myself from outside my body. The room seems too bright, too stark. I can hear a nurse in the hallway laughing, and it feels so wrong... how can anyone be happy right now?",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: Still a 9. I don't know how much more I can take.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this incredibly well. Remember, you survived this moment.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) You're right. I did... The doctor's leaving now. I'm alone in the room, and the silence is deafening. I can feel tears running down my face, but I'm not actively crying. It's like my body is reacting, but my mind is numb. I'm staring at the ceiling, counting the tiles, trying to make sense of what just happened.",
    "Therapist: How about your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually down to a 7. I think I'm starting to feel a bit numb.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. How are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: My breathing is slowing down, but my hands are still shaking. I feel drained, like all my energy has been sucked out. The nausea is still there, but it's not as intense. I'm starting to become aware of the sounds in the hospital again - people walking by, phones ringing. It's like I'm coming back to reality.",
    "Therapist: And your current SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6 now. I'm feeling... I don't know, resigned maybe?",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're doing great processing this memory.",
    "Client: Thanks... I'm watching a nurse come in to check my vitals. She's being gentle, but I flinch when she touches me. I feel so vulnerable. But there's also a tiny part of me that's starting to think about what comes next. Like, what do I tell my family? How do I fight this?",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's holding steady at a 6. I'm still anxious, but it feels more... manageable?",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're showing resilience. Shall we continue?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think I can keep going..."
