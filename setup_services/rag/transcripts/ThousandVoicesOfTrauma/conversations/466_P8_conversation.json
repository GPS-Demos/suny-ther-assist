    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling pretty shaken up, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel this tightness in my chest. It's like I'm right back there, you know? The sound of the engines, the sudden drop... God, it's so vivid.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, definitely fear. But also... guilt? Yeah, there's this overwhelming sense of guilt. I keep thinking about the other passengers, especially the kids. I mean, I survived, but so many others didn't. Why me? It doesn't seem fair.",
    "Therapist: I see. Can you tell me more about that guilt?",
    "Client: It's... it's like this heavy weight pressing down on me. I remember the screams, the chaos, and I just... I froze. I didn't help anyone. I was so focused on my own survival that I didn't even try to assist others. What kind of person does that make me?",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts affect you in your daily life?",
    "Client: They're... they're always there, lurking in the background. I have trouble flying now, obviously. But it's more than that. I find myself constantly on edge, waiting for something bad to happen. And when I meet new people, I wonder if they'd judge me if they knew. It's exhausting, really.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you noticing as you talk about this?",
    "Client: My palms are sweaty, and my mouth feels dry. There's this knot in my stomach that won't go away. And I notice I'm clenching my jaw... probably been doing that for a while without realizing it.",
    "Therapist: How do these sensations compare to what you felt during the actual event?",
    "Client: They're... they're similar, but not as intense. During the crash, it was like my whole body was on fire with adrenaline. Now, it's more like... like echoes of that feeling. Still uncomfortable, but manageable. I guess that's progress, right?",
    "Therapist: Indeed. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... maybe I'm not as bad as I thought. I mean, I still feel guilty, but I'm starting to realize that my reaction was... normal? Everyone was panicking. It wasn't just me. And maybe... maybe by sharing my story, I can help others who've been through similar experiences.",
    "Therapist: How does that perspective feel?",
    "Client: It feels... lighter, I guess? Like maybe I don't have to carry all this guilt forever. Don't get me wrong, it's still there, but it's not crushing me like it used to. I'm starting to see that I was a victim too, not just a survivor.",
    "Therapist: What do you think has contributed to this shift?",
    "Client: I think... well, these sessions for sure. Talking about it, facing the memories... it's hard, but it's helping. And I've been trying to be kinder to myself lately, you know? Reminding myself that I didn't cause the crash, that I was just trying to survive like everyone else.",
    "Therapist: How might this new perspective impact your daily life?",
    "Client: I think... I might be able to start living again, not just surviving. Maybe I'll be able to fly without having a panic attack. Or tell my story without feeling ashamed. It's a long road, but for the first time in a while, I feel like there's hope.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant realization. How are you feeling now compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but in a good way? Like I've released some of the tension I've been carrying. My chest feels less tight, and my thoughts are clearer. It's like I can breathe a little easier. I'm still anxious, but it's not overwhelming anymore.",
    "Therapist: What do you think you need right now?",
    "Client: I think I need some time to process all of this. Maybe go for a walk, get some fresh air. And... I think I want to write some of these thoughts down. It might help to see them on paper, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I... I just want to say thank you. I know I was resistant to this therapy at first, but it's really helping. I feel like I'm starting to understand myself better, and that's... that's huge for me.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your progress is a result of your hard work. How would you like to end our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to take a few deep breaths together. It helps ground me, you know? And maybe we could set an intention for the week ahead. Something positive to focus on.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent idea. Let's do that."
