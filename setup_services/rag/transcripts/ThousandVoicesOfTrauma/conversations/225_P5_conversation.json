    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do. I've been having more anxiety lately, especially after that incident with the online harassment last week. It brought back a lot of memories from my childhood.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll focus on imaginal exposure. Are you familiar with this?",
    "Client: Not really. It sounds a bit intimidating. Can you explain what it involves?",
    "Therapist: Of course. It's a technique where you'll revisit a traumatic memory in a safe environment. How does that sound?",
    "Client: Honestly? It sounds terrifying. I've spent so long trying to avoid thinking about those memories. Why would we want to bring them up?",
    "Therapist: I hear your concern. The goal is to process these memories safely. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Well, what if I can't handle it? What if I completely fall apart? I'm already struggling with my anxiety and being unemployed... I'm not sure I can take on anything else right now.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. We'll go at your pace and I'll support you throughout. How does that reassure you?",
    "Client: It helps a little. But I'm still scared. What exactly will happen during this... exposure thing?",
    "Therapist: You'll describe the memory aloud while I guide you. We'll pause if it becomes overwhelming. How does that sound?",
    "Client: I guess that doesn't sound as bad as I imagined. But what if I start panicking? I sometimes get panic attacks when I think about my past.",
    "Therapist: We'll practice grounding techniques beforehand. If you panic, we'll use these to help you calm down. Okay?",
    "Client: Alright, that makes me feel a bit safer. I appreciate you explaining all this. It's just... it's hard, you know? Especially with everything going on in my life right now. Being alone, unemployed, and then this cyberbullying thing... it's like the universe is conspiring against me.",
    "Therapist: Your resilience is admirable. This work takes courage. How do you feel about proceeding?",
    "Client: I'm still nervous, but I think I'm ready to try. Can you tell me more about what I might experience during this?",
    "Therapist: You may feel strong emotions or physical sensations. This is normal and will pass. How does that sit with you?",
    "Client: It's a bit scary, but I understand. I've been feeling so stuck lately, especially after the online harassment. It's like I'm that helpless child again. I want to move past this, to feel strong again. Do you think this will help with that?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it can help you process and integrate these experiences. Shall we begin with a grounding exercise?",
    "Client: Okay, let's do it. I'm nervous, but I trust you. And honestly, I'm tired of letting my past control me. I want to be able to use the internet without constantly looking over my shoulder, you know? I want to feel safe in my own skin again.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is inspiring. Let's start with deep breathing. Ready?",
    "Client: Ready. Thank you for being here with me through this. It means a lot to have someone I can trust guiding me through these difficult memories and emotions."
