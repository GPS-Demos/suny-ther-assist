    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, John?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of drained. Going through that memory of losing my buddy in combat... it's never easy, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you this time?",
    "Client: (deep breath) The sounds. I could hear the explosions so clearly, and his voice... God, his voice calling out for help. It was like I was right back there in that moment. I haven't heard it that vividly in years.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to experience those sounds again?",
    "Client: Terrifying, honestly. But also... I don't know, maybe a little cathartic? It's like I've been trying to push those memories away for so long, and now they're just... there. It's overwhelming, but there's a small part of me that feels relieved to finally face it.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant observation, John.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess it is. I've spent so much time trying to avoid anything that reminds me of that day. But going through it here, with you... it's different. It still hurts like hell, but I don't feel like I'm drowning in it anymore.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your everyday life?",
    "Client: Well, I've been isolating myself a lot. Living with my parents, avoiding social situations. I think it's because I've been so scared of these memories sneaking up on me. But now, I'm starting to see that maybe I can handle them better than I thought.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization.",
    "Client: It is, isn't it? (pauses) You know, I've been having these nightmares about the incident. They've been so vivid, so real. But after today's session, I'm wondering if facing these memories head-on might actually help reduce their power over me.",
    "Therapist: How so?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... by confronting the memory here, in a safe space, I'm learning that I can survive it. The memory itself can't hurt me. It's painful, yeah, but I'm still here, still breathing. Maybe if I keep doing this, those nightmares won't have such a grip on me.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful connection, John.",
    "Client: Thanks. (sighs) It's not easy, though. Part of me still wants to run away from all of this. The anxiety... it's always there, telling me to hide, to avoid. But I'm starting to see that avoidance isn't the answer. It's just been keeping me stuck.",
    "Therapist: What do you think might help you continue this process?",
    "Client: I think... I need to remind myself why I'm doing this. For my buddy, for myself, for the life I want to have. Maybe I could start a journal, write down my thoughts after each session. And... (hesitates) maybe it's time I reached out to some of my old military friends. I've been avoiding them, but talking to people who understand might help.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like great ideas, John.",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so too. It's scary, but I'm starting to feel a bit hopeful. Like maybe I can actually get through this and come out the other side. (chuckles nervously) Is that crazy?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a sign of progress.",
    "Client: Progress... yeah, I guess it is. (takes a deep breath) Okay, so what's next? I know this is just the beginning, but I think I'm ready to keep going. It's not going to be easy, but... I want my life back. I want to be able to remember my friend without feeling like the world is ending. I want to be able to live without this constant fear and anxiety. So, whatever comes next, I'm in.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful commitment, John.",
    "Client: Thanks. I mean it, too. For the first time in a long time, I feel like I'm actually moving forward instead of just treading water. It's terrifying, but... it's also kind of exciting. Like I'm finally taking control of my life again, you know?",
    "Therapist: How does that feel?",
    "Client: It feels... good. Really good. Like I'm finally doing something for myself, something that matters. (pauses) I know we've got a long way to go, and I'm sure there will be setbacks. But right now, in this moment, I feel stronger than I have in years. Like maybe I can actually do this.",
    "Therapist: That's a great note to end on. Well done today, John."
