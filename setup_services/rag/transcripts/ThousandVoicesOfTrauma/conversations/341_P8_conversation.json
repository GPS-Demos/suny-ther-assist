    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is foggy, but also racing at the same time. The memory of my grandfather in the hospital, it's so vivid now. I can still smell the antiseptic, hear the beeping machines. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Guilt. Overwhelming guilt. I keep thinking about how I wasn't there when he passed. I was at uni, studying for an exam. I should've been there, holding his hand. He was always there for me, and I failed him when it mattered most.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like a heavy weight on my chest. I can barely breathe. My stomach is in knots, and I feel nauseous. It's like my body is punishing me for not being there.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are accompanying these physical sensations?",
    "Client: I keep hearing his voice, you know? He always used to say, \"Beta, family comes first.\" And I... I put my studies before him. What kind of grandson does that? I'm wondering if he was disappointed in me in his final moments. If he was waiting for me to show up.",
    "Therapist: How does imagining his disappointment affect you?",
    "Client: It's crushing. I feel like I've let down not just him, but my entire family. In our culture, respecting elders is so important. I feel like I've failed as a South Asian, as a grandson, as a person. It's making me question everything about myself.",
    "Therapist: What else comes up for you?",
    "Client: I... I'm angry too. At myself, obviously. But also at the doctors. They said he was stable, that I had time. Why didn't they see this coming? And I'm angry at my parents for not insisting I come home sooner. It's irrational, I know, but I can't help it.",
    "Therapist: How does expressing that anger feel?",
    "Client: It's... liberating, actually. I've been holding it in for so long. But now I feel guilty for being angry. It's like a vicious cycle. I'm tired of feeling this way, but I also feel like I deserve to suffer for what I did... or didn't do.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about these thoughts?",
    "Client: I... I guess they're pretty harsh. It's like there's no room for forgiveness. But that's how I've been feeling since it happened. It's affecting everything - my studies, my relationships. I can't enjoy anything without feeling guilty.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your broader experience?",
    "Client: It's like this event has colored everything. I used to be optimistic, you know? Now I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop. I'm scared to get close to people because I might let them down too. It's... it's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Part of me wants forgiveness, but I don't think I deserve it. I want to remember my grandfather without this pain, to honor his memory without feeling like I failed him. I want to feel okay again, but I'm not sure if that's possible.",
    "Therapist: How might your grandfather view this situation?",
    "Client: He... he was always so understanding. He'd probably tell me not to be so hard on myself. That he knows I loved him. But it's hard to believe that when I wasn't there when it mattered most.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to honor his understanding nature?",
    "Client: I... I never thought about it that way. I guess... maybe it would mean trying to forgive myself? To remember the good times we had, instead of fixating on the end? It's scary to even consider that, though. Like I'd be betraying him somehow.",
    "Therapist: How does the idea of self-forgiveness sit with you right now?",
    "Client: It's uncomfortable. Really uncomfortable. But... maybe necessary? I don't know how to do it, though. Every time I try to be kind to myself, that guilt comes rushing back. It's like I'm punishing myself on his behalf, even though he'd probably hate that.",
    "Therapist: What small step could you take towards self-compassion?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I could look at some old photos of us together? Remember the good times? It feels selfish, but... it might be a start. I just... I miss him so much. I want to remember him without this pain overshadowing everything.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... lighter. There's still that heaviness in my chest, but it's not as suffocating. My breathing feels a bit easier. It's like... like maybe there's a tiny bit of hope. Is that okay? To feel hope?",
    "Therapist: What does that hope mean to you?",
    "Client: It means... maybe I can find a way through this. That maybe I can honor my grandfather's memory without destroying myself in the process. It's scary, but... it feels important. Like maybe that's what he'd want for me.",
    "Therapist: How can you nurture that feeling?",
    "Client: I... I could start by talking about him more. Sharing stories with my family. Maybe even visit his favorite places. It's terrifying, but... maybe it's time. I've been avoiding everything that reminds me of him, but that's not really honoring his memory, is it?",
    "Therapist: What support do you need to take these steps?",
    "Client: I think... I need to talk to my parents. We've all been avoiding the topic, but maybe opening up could help. And... I might need help from you to navigate the guilt when it comes up. It's not going to be easy, but... I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about our session today?",
    "Client: It's been intense. Really intense. But also... kind of freeing? Like I've been carrying this massive weight, and for the first time, I can see a way to put it down. It's scary, but... I feel like I can breathe a little easier. Thank you.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great courage today. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?"
