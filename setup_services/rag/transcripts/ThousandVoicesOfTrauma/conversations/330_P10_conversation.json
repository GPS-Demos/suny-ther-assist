    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. My stomach's been in knots all morning. I know we've been working towards this, but now that we're here, it feels so real.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Yeah, I think so. Let's do this before I lose my nerve.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in my childhood home. The living room. It's early morning, and the sun is just starting to peek through the curtains. Everything looks normal, but there's this heavy feeling in the air. Like something's not right.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: The phone rings. It startles me. I'm only 12, but I know... I just know it's bad news. My mom answers it in the kitchen. I can hear her voice crack as she says, \"No, that can't be right.\" My heart starts racing.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably a 6? My palms are getting sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going. What do you hear or see next?",
    "Client: Mom comes into the living room. Her face is pale, and her eyes are red. She sits next to me on the couch and takes my hand. \"Sweetie,\" she says, \"There's been an accident. Uncle Jack... he didn't make it.\" And just like that, my world shatters.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I... I can't breathe. It's like someone punched me in the stomach. Uncle Jack was... he was everything to me. My mentor, my friend. I start shaking my head, saying \"No, no, no\" over and over. Tears are streaming down my face, and I can taste the salt on my lips.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Remember to breathe. What happens after that?",
    "Client: I run to my room. I slam the door and throw myself on the bed. I'm sobbing so hard I can barely catch my breath. I grab my teddy bear \u2013 the one Uncle Jack gave me for my 10th birthday \u2013 and I hold it tight to my chest. It still smells like his cologne from when he hugged me last week.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: (voice shaking) It's... it's an 8. God, it hurts so much. Even now, it feels so raw.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for facing this. Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: (takes a few deep breaths) Okay... okay. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: When you're ready, continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear my mom knocking on the door. She's calling my name, but I don't want to answer. I'm angry at her for telling me, even though I know it's not her fault. I just want to wake up and find out it's all a bad dream.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. My throat hurts from crying. I feel hot and cold at the same time. It's like my whole body is rebelling against this news.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I eventually let my mom in. She sits on the bed and holds me. We cry together. She's trying to be strong for me, but I can feel her shaking. We stay like that for what feels like hours.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Sarah. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's still high... maybe a 7? It's hard to relive this.",
    "Therapist: I understand. You're showing incredible strength. What happens as the day progresses?",
    "Client: The house starts filling up with people. Family members, friends. Everyone's speaking in hushed tones. I overhear bits and pieces \u2013 \"car accident,\" \"drunk driver,\" \"instant.\" Each word is like a knife. I hide in my room most of the time, looking at photos of Uncle Jack and me.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking as you look at those photos?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm remembering all the plans we had. He was supposed to teach me how to drive when I turned 16. We were going to go camping next month. Now it's all gone. I feel so lost, so angry that someone took him away from us.",
    "Therapist: Allow yourself to feel those emotions. They're valid.",
    "Client: (voice breaking) It's not fair. He was such a good person. Why him? Why not the drunk driver? I'm so angry I want to scream, but I'm also terrified. If this could happen to Uncle Jack, it could happen to anyone. Mom, Dad... I could lose them too.",
    "Therapist: That's a scary realization. How does that fear manifest?",
    "Client: I start feeling panicky. My heart's racing again. I want to run downstairs and make sure my parents are okay. I need to see them, to know they're still here.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's back up to an 8. I can feel that panic rising in my chest.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to breathe deeply. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: (takes several deep breaths) Okay... I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: When you're ready, continue with what happens next.",
    "Client: I go downstairs. The living room is full of people, but it feels empty without Uncle Jack's laughter. Mom sees me and comes over. She hugs me tight and whispers, \"We'll get through this together.\" I want to believe her, but I'm not sure how.",
    "Therapist: How does your mom's presence make you feel?",
    "Client: Safer, I guess. But also... guilty? Because I still have her, and Uncle Jack's kids don't have their dad anymore. It's all so complicated and messy.",
    "Therapist: Those are complex emotions. It's okay to feel them all.",
    "Client: The rest of the day is a blur. People bringing food, making phone calls. I overhear talk about funeral arrangements, and it makes me feel sick. I can't eat. The thought of never seeing Uncle Jack again, of him being buried... it's too much.",
    "Therapist: What do you do to cope with these overwhelming feelings?",
    "Client: I go back to my room. I put on the sweatshirt Uncle Jack gave me last Christmas. It's way too big, but it feels like a hug from him. I curl up in bed, wrapped in his sweatshirt, clutching my teddy bear. I cry until I have no tears left.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well, Sarah. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 6, I think. I'm exhausted, emotionally drained.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. How does the day end?",
    "Client: Mom comes to check on me before bed. She sits on the edge of my bed and strokes my hair. She tells me it's okay to be sad, that we'll remember Uncle Jack together. I ask her to stay until I fall asleep, like when I was little. She does, and for a moment, I feel safe again.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful memory. How do you feel now, thinking back on that day?",
    "Client: It still hurts. There's still anger and sadness. But... there's also gratitude? For the time I had with Uncle Jack, for my mom's comfort. It's all mixed up together.",
    "Therapist: That's a very insightful observation. What's your final SUDS level?",
    "Client: I'd say it's at a 5 now. It's not as intense as it was earlier.",
    "Therapist: You've done an incredible job today, Sarah. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Drained, but... maybe a little lighter? Like I've released some of the weight I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after these sessions. Remember to be kind to yourself for the rest of the day. We'll process this more next time.",
    "Client: Thank you. This was hard, but... I think it was important.",
    "Therapist: It absolutely was. You showed great courage today. Our time is up, but I want you to practice some self-care this evening. Can you do that?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think I can. Maybe a long bath and some calming music.",
    "Therapist: That sounds perfect. Take care, Sarah. I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. See you then."
