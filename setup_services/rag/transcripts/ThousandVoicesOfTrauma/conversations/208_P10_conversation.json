    "Therapist: Welcome, Aisha. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. A bit anxious, I guess. We're going to talk about the cyberbullying, right?",
    "Therapist: Yes. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. It's just... it's hard to go back there, you know?",
    "Therapist: I understand. Remember, you're safe here. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, maybe a 6? My heart's already racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. Now, close your eyes and describe the first incident.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm in my dorm room. It's late, maybe 11 PM. I'm scrolling through Instagram, and suddenly I see it. A photo of me from a party last weekend, but... it's been edited. They've... they've made me look... fat. Grotesque. The caption says, \"This is what happens when you let a cow loose at a party.\"",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I... I feel sick. My stomach's in knots. I can't believe someone would do this. I thought these people were my friends. I'm... I'm shaking.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I start reading the comments. They're all laughing. Calling me names. \"Fatty,\" \"Elephant,\" \"Go back to your country, you don't belong here.\" I... I can't breathe. It feels like the walls are closing in.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Take a slow, deep breath.",
    "Client: (Inhales shakily) I... I want to defend myself, but I'm scared. If I say anything, they might make it worse. I feel so alone.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe even a 9. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with it. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I shut off my phone. I can't look anymore. But I can't stop thinking about it. What if everyone sees it? What if my parents find out? I... I start crying. I can't stop. I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: Focus on those feelings. Describe them.",
    "Client: It's like... like there's this heavy weight on my chest. I can't breathe properly. My face is hot with shame. I feel... I feel worthless. Like maybe they're right. Maybe I don't belong here.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What's happening in your body?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking. I... I feel nauseous. I want to throw up. I curl up on my bed, hugging my knees to my chest. I can't stop crying.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're doing great. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take another deep breath. What happens the next day?",
    "Client: I... I don't want to go to class. I'm terrified of facing everyone. But I force myself to go. As soon as I walk into the lecture hall, I hear whispers. People are looking at me, laughing behind their hands. I... I feel so exposed. Like everyone knows.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Humiliated. Angry. I want to disappear. I sit in the back, trying to make myself as small as possible. I can't focus on the lecture. All I can think about is that photo, those comments.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those emotions. What else?",
    "Client: I... I start to doubt myself. Maybe I am too fat. Maybe I don't fit in. I... I skip lunch. I can't bear the thought of eating in front of others. What if they're watching me, judging me?",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe now. How's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7 now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I go back to my room after classes. I check my phone. There are more comments. Someone's created a meme with my photo. It's... it's everywhere now. I feel like I can't escape it.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with that?",
    "Client: I... I don't know how to cope. I feel so overwhelmed. I... I think about hurting myself. Just to make the pain stop. But I'm scared to do that. Instead, I... I call my mom.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. What happens when you call her?",
    "Client: I... I break down as soon as I hear her voice. I tell her everything. She's worried, angry on my behalf. She wants to call the school, but I beg her not to. I'm afraid it'll make things worse.",
    "Therapist: How does talking to your mom make you feel?",
    "Client: It... it helps a little. I don't feel so alone. But I'm still scared. I don't know how to face everyone tomorrow.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 6, I think.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're doing well. What happens in the following days?",
    "Client: It... it gets a little better. Some friends reach out, tell me they've reported the post. It gets taken down eventually. But... but the damage is done. I still feel anxious every time I go online. I'm always waiting for the next attack.",
    "Therapist: How do you handle that anxiety?",
    "Client: I... I start avoiding social media. I change my privacy settings. I'm careful about what I post. But it's hard. I feel like I've lost a part of my life. I miss feeling carefree online.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's not as raw anymore. But I still feel vulnerable. Like it could happen again at any moment.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe a 5 now.",
    "Therapist: You've done very well. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: Okay... (takes a deep breath) I... I didn't realize how much it still affected me.",
    "Therapist: It's normal. You've shown great strength today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I feel drained, but also... maybe a little stronger?",
    "Therapist: That's good. We'll end here for today. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Tired, but... okay. I think I'm at a 4 now.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. We'll discuss coping strategies next time.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you, Dr. Thompson. This... this helped.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Aisha. Take care of yourself this week."
