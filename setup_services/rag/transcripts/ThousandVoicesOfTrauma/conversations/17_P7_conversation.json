    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the refugee experience you mentioned?",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. It was about two years ago. I was fleeing my home country due to political unrest. We were in a crowded boat, crossing the Mediterranean. It was dark, and the waves were so high. I remember feeling terrified.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The boat was overcrowded, and people were crying. I could smell the salt water and feel the spray on my face. Suddenly, there was a loud crack, and water started pouring in. Everyone started panicking, pushing and shoving. I thought we were going to die.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you remember?",
    "Client: I... I remember grabbing onto the side of the boat. My hands were so cold, and I could hear people screaming. Some were praying, others were calling for help. I saw a young child slip into the water, and I couldn't do anything. I felt so helpless.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I can still hear the sound of the waves crashing against the boat. It was deafening. I was shaking uncontrollably, partly from the cold and partly from fear. I kept thinking about my family back home, wondering if I'd ever see them again.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: As the boat started to sink lower, I saw lights in the distance. It was a rescue ship. But the wait felt like an eternity. People were fighting to stay above water. I was exhausted from holding on, my muscles aching. When they finally reached us, I was so weak I could barely grab the rope they threw.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. My heart is racing, and I can feel my hands shaking. It's like I'm back there again. I can almost taste the salt water.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: It's hard to talk about this. I've tried so hard to forget, but the memories keep coming back. Especially at night, I have these vivid nightmares where I'm drowning again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Keep going if you can.",
    "Client: After they pulled me onto the rescue ship, I remember feeling this overwhelming mix of relief and guilt. I was alive, but so many others weren't. I couldn't stop shivering, and someone wrapped me in a blanket. I just sat there, staring at nothing, trying to process what had happened.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: The worst part was the uncertainty. We had no idea where we were going or what would happen to us. I felt so alone, even though I was surrounded by other survivors. It was like a part of me was left behind in that water.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Talking about it brings everything back so vividly. But there's also a small sense of relief, like I'm finally acknowledging what happened instead of trying to push it away.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. We'll end here for today."
