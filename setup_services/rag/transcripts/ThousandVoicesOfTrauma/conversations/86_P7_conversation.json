    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Johnson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I suppose. A bit nervous about today's session.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We're here to support you.",
    "Client: Thank you. I've been thinking about what we discussed last time, about my experiences as a refugee. It's been weighing on me.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Are you ready to explore that memory?",
    "Client: I think so. It's about the day we had to flee our village. I can still hear the sounds...",
    "Therapist: Take your time. You're safe here.",
    "Client: It was early morning. The air was thick with smoke. I remember the panic in my mother's voice as she shook me awake. \"We have to go now,\" she said. I was so confused and scared.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: I... I can smell the smoke. It's making my heart race. We grabbed what we could carry, but I left behind my favorite doll. I keep seeing her sitting on my bed as we rushed out.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: The streets were chaos. People were running, screaming. I saw our neighbor... he was... he was on the ground, not moving. There was blood...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: I... I can't... It's too much...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here now, safe.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. We ran towards the outskirts of the village. My feet hurt from the rocks on the path. I remember my mother's hand gripping mine so tightly.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: We reached a truck. It was overcrowded, but people made space for us. As we drove away, I saw the smoke rising from our village. I felt so helpless, so angry.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. You're processing it well.",
    "Client: The journey was long and uncomfortable. People were crying, praying. I kept thinking about my father, who had stayed behind to help others. We didn't know if we'd ever see him again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job describing this. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard, but I feel like I'm finally facing it. There's a heaviness in my chest, but also... a sense of relief?",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. You're making progress.",
    "Client: We arrived at the refugee camp after dark. It was crowded, noisy, and unfamiliar. I remember feeling so lost and afraid. My mother tried to comfort me, but I could see the fear in her eyes too.",
    "Therapist: You're very perceptive. Keep going.",
    "Client: The first night was the hardest. We slept on the ground with strangers all around us. I couldn't stop crying, thinking about our home, my friends, my doll... everything we'd left behind.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to acknowledge that loss. You're doing well.",
    "Client: In the morning, I saw the vastness of the camp. Tents and people as far as I could see. That's when it hit me - this was our new reality. We were refugees now.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also like a weight has been lifted. Talking about it... it's hard, but it helps.",
    "Therapist: You've done remarkably well today. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great resilience. How would you like to conclude our session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to sit quietly for a moment, if that's okay. Just to process everything.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take all the time you need. You've made significant progress today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm grateful for your support through this difficult journey.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Remember, healing takes time. We'll continue at your pace."
