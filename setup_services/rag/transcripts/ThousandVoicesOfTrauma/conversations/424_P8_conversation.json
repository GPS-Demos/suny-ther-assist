    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's all a bit jumbled up in my head. The memories of the airplane crash are so vivid, yet somehow distant at the same time. I can still hear the screeching of metal, feel the violent shaking... (pauses, takes a deep breath) My heart's racing a bit, to be honest.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I think. No, wait... it's more like anxiety. Yes, a deep-seated anxiety. It's as if my body is bracing for impact all over again. My muscles are tense, especially in my shoulders and neck. I keep expecting to hear that awful noise again, you know?",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How does this anxiety compare to when you first arrived today?",
    "Client: Oh, it's definitely more intense now. Before, it was just a low hum in the background. Now it's... it's like a loud buzzing. I can't ignore it. It's making me feel restless, like I need to move or do something. But at the same time, I feel frozen. It's such a strange contradiction.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts are accompanying these feelings?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how fragile life is. One moment, I was on a routine flight, and the next... chaos. It makes me question everything. Why did I survive when others didn't? Am I living my life fully enough? And then there's this... this guilt. (voice breaks) I sometimes wish I hadn't survived. Is that terrible of me?",
    "Therapist: Those are heavy thoughts. How do you cope with them?",
    "Client: I... I try to distract myself, usually. Watch TV, help my daughter with household chores. But it doesn't always work. Sometimes, especially at night, they overwhelm me. That's when the depression hits hardest. I feel so... so isolated. Even though I'm living with my family, it's like there's this invisible barrier between us. They can't truly understand, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds really challenging. What do you need in those moments?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants comfort, wants someone to hold me and tell me it's going to be okay. But another part of me wants to be left alone, to process everything in solitude. It's confusing. I guess... I guess I need understanding without pressure. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How has this experience changed your view of the world?",
    "Client: Oh, profoundly. (sighs) I used to think I had some control over my life. Now, I realize how little control we actually have. It's made me more anxious in general, always waiting for the other shoe to drop. But... (pauses, reflecting) it's also made me more appreciative of small moments. A cup of chai with my granddaughter, the smell of rain... they mean more now, somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How does your body feel right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to relax a bit, actually. My breathing is slower. The tension in my shoulders is easing. But there's this heaviness in my chest, like a weight. It's not as suffocating as before, but it's there. And my hands... they're trembling slightly. It's as if my body is slowly coming down from high alert.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad you're feeling some relief. What's helping you feel calmer?",
    "Client: Talking about it, I think. Putting words to these feelings... it's like I'm taking some of their power away. And... and knowing that you're listening, that you're not judging me. It helps. It makes me feel less alone in this. And the fact that I can sit here and talk about it without completely falling apart... it gives me a glimmer of hope. Maybe I am stronger than I thought.",
    "Therapist: That's a wonderful realization. How might you use this strength moving forward?",
    "Client: I... I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I could try talking to my family more about what I'm going through. Or... or perhaps I could join a support group for trauma survivors. I've been hesitant because of my age and cultural background, but maybe there's value in connecting with others who understand. And... and maybe I need to be gentler with myself. Accept that healing isn't linear, that some days will be harder than others.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like positive steps. How do you feel about our session today?",
    "Client: It's been... intense. Draining, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've released some of the pressure that's been building up. I'm tired, but it's a different kind of tired. Not the heavy, depressive exhaustion I'm used to, but more... I don't know, cleansing? And I feel a bit proud, to be honest. Facing these memories isn't easy, but I did it. I'm doing it.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant achievement. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to explore more about how to manage the anxiety when it spikes. And maybe we could talk about ways to reconnect with my family, to bridge that gap I mentioned. Oh, and... (hesitates) maybe we could discuss the possibility of me flying again someday. The thought terrifies me, but I don't want fear to control my life forever.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent goals. How are you feeling about ending our session?",
    "Client: A bit nervous, to be honest. It's like... like I've opened up this box of emotions, and now I have to go back into the world. But I also feel... lighter? More grounded? It's a mix of emotions, really. I'm grateful for this space to process everything. And... and I'm looking forward to our next session, which surprises me a bit. I didn't think I'd ever look forward to talking about the crash.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive sign. Remember to use your coping strategies if things get overwhelming. I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you, doctor. I... I appreciate your help more than I can express. See you next week."
