    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Maria?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like, my heart's still racing a bit, you know? Going through that memory of the cyberbullying, it just... it brought everything back. The shame, the fear, the feeling of being so alone. It's like I was right back there, reading those horrible messages and comments.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: God, just... the relentlessness of it all. Like, it wasn't just one message or one person. It was this constant barrage. Every time I opened my phone, there was something new. Something cruel. Something that made me feel worthless. And the worst part was, I couldn't escape it. Even when I wasn't online, I was thinking about it, dreading the next notification.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. Really intense. I felt my chest tighten, you know? And there was this moment where I just wanted to run out of the room. But... I didn't. I stayed. And that feels... I don't know, important somehow?",
    "Therapist: It is. How do you make sense of that?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe it means I'm stronger now? Like, before, I couldn't even think about those messages without having a panic attack. But today, I sat through it. It was awful, but I did it. And now that it's over, I feel... I don't know, a little proud? Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much that experience has affected me. Like, even now, I'm so careful about what I post online. I'm always worried someone's going to attack me. And I think... I think that's held me back in a lot of ways. It's like I'm still letting those bullies control my life, you know?",
    "Therapist: How does that insight feel?",
    "Client: It's... frustrating. But also kind of empowering? Because if I can see it, maybe I can change it. I don't want to let that fear control me anymore. I want to be able to express myself without constantly looking over my shoulder.",
    "Therapist: What might that look like for you?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe starting small? Like, posting something on Instagram without overthinking it for hours. Or joining an online community for something I'm interested in. Just... putting myself out there a little bit.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great step. How else has this affected you?",
    "Client: I think... it's made me really wary of people in general. Like, I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop, you know? Even with friends, there's this part of me that's always on guard, always wondering if they're going to turn on me like those people online did.",
    "Therapist: How does that connect to your recovery goals?",
    "Client: I... I want to be able to trust people again. To have real, meaningful relationships. And I can see now how this experience has been holding me back from that. It's like, I've been so focused on protecting myself that I haven't allowed myself to really connect with anyone.",
    "Therapist: What feels possible now?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I can start being a little more open with people. Not everyone, but maybe with my closest friends. Maybe I can tell them about this, about what I've been going through. It's scary, but... I think it might help.",
    "Therapist: That's very insightful, Maria. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... tired. Really tired. But also kind of... I don't know, lighter? Like I've put down something heavy I've been carrying for a long time. And a little scared about what comes next, but... also kind of excited? Is that crazy?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... maybe we could talk more about how to start opening up to people? And maybe... maybe we could do another imaginal exposure? It was hard, but I think it helped. I want to keep working on this.",
    "Therapist: Sounds good. You did great today, Maria.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I really appreciate your help with all of this. It means a lot."
