    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is dreading it. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 6 right now. Just thinking about it is making me anxious.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we're here together. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I guess so. *deep breath* Where should I start?",
    "Therapist: Start with where you were just before the incident.",
    "Client: Alright. I was... I was walking home from work. It was a warm evening, and I remember feeling tired but kind of content. The sun was setting, and the sky had this beautiful orange glow. I could smell someone grilling nearby...",
    "Therapist: Good. What happened next?",
    "Client: As I turned the corner onto my street, I heard shouting. At first, I thought it was just kids playing, but then... *voice trembles* I saw two men arguing in front of a house. They were gesturing wildly, and one of them looked really angry.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... nervous. My heart is starting to race a bit. I remember wanting to cross the street to avoid them, but I couldn't move.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 7.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Okay. So, I'm standing there, frozen. The angry man suddenly pushes the other guy, hard. He stumbles back and... oh God, he pulls out a knife. *voice shaking* I can see the blade glinting in the sunlight.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What do you see, hear, feel?",
    "Client: I see the knife. I hear my own heartbeat pounding in my ears. I feel... I feel like I can't breathe. The air feels thick, like I'm trying to breathe through a straw.",
    "Therapist: Remember your grounding techniques. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: *takes a shaky breath* Right, okay. My feet are on the floor. The carpet is soft. I'm here, I'm safe. *pause* The man with the knife lunges forward. There's a scuffle, and then... then there's blood. So much blood. *starts crying*",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Maria. What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I can't... I can't do this.",
    "Therapist: You can. You're strong. Take a moment, breathe.",
    "Client: *breathing heavily* Okay. Okay. The man who was stabbed, he falls to the ground. He's clutching his stomach, and there's blood seeping through his fingers. The other man looks shocked, like he can't believe what he's done.",
    "Therapist: What are you doing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm fumbling for my phone. My hands are shaking so badly I can hardly dial 911. I'm trying to speak to the operator, but my voice keeps cracking. I'm telling them what happened, where we are...",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going.",
    "Client: The attacker looks at me. For a moment, our eyes meet, and I'm terrified he's going to come after me next. But he just... runs. He drops the knife and runs away. I can hear sirens in the distance.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Scared. Helpless. I want to help the man on the ground, but I'm afraid to get closer. What if the attacker comes back? What if the man dies right in front of me?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's still a 9. My heart is racing so fast.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: *takes a deep breath* The police arrive. Everything becomes a blur of flashing lights and voices. They're asking me questions, but I can barely focus. I keep looking at the man on the ground. There's so much blood...",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: The paramedics arrive. They're working on the injured man. I'm still talking to the police, giving them a description of the attacker. I feel like I'm watching everything from outside my body.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What do you notice?",
    "Client: The smell of blood. It's metallic and overwhelming. I feel nauseous. My legs are shaking, and I think I might faint. One of the officers notices and helps me sit down on the curb.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down a bit. Maybe an 8?",
    "Therapist: That's progress. Keep going.",
    "Client: They take the injured man away in the ambulance. I'm left sitting there, giving my statement. I can't stop shaking. I keep seeing the knife, the blood, over and over in my mind.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... why didn't I do more? Could I have stopped it somehow? What if I had crossed the street earlier? What if I had called out to them? *starts crying again*",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault, Maria. You did what you could.",
    "Client: I know, I know. But it doesn't feel that way. I feel so guilty, so helpless. I keep wondering what happened to that man, if he survived...",
    "Therapist: Those are normal thoughts. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. Exhausted. Like I've been running a marathon. My SUDS is probably down to a 7 now.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess. After I gave my statement, they let me go home. But I couldn't sleep that night. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the knife, the blood...",
    "Therapist: How did you cope?",
    "Client: I... I didn't, really. I called in sick to work the next day. I couldn't bear the thought of walking down that street again. I stayed in bed, alternating between crying and just staring at the wall.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6, I think. Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also kind of relieving?",
    "Therapist: That's often the case. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Thanks. I... I still have nightmares sometimes. I'll wake up in a cold sweat, hearing the shouting, seeing the knife. And during the day, loud noises make me jump. I'm always looking over my shoulder now.",
    "Therapist: How do you handle those moments?",
    "Client: I try to use the grounding techniques we've practiced. Sometimes they help, sometimes they don't. On bad days, I feel like I'll never be the same person I was before this happened.",
    "Therapist: Change is normal after trauma. You're working through it.",
    "Client: I know. It's just... hard. I feel like I lost my sense of safety that day. Like the world became this dangerous, unpredictable place overnight.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5. Talking about it... it's not easy, but it does help.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. How do you feel about the session?",
    "Client: Tired, but... okay. Like I've lifted a weight off my chest. It's still there, but it's a little lighter now.",
    "Therapist: That's great, Maria. You did really well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I'm ready to stop for now.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves before we end.",
    "Client: *takes a deep breath* Okay. I'm here. I'm safe. It's over.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. We'll continue working through this together."
