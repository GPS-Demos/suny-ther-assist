    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Carlos?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. The memory of that dog attack... it feels so vivid now. I can still hear the growling, you know? And my heart... it's still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The fear, definitely. But also... I felt so helpless. Like when I was bullied in school. It brought back those feelings of being powerless, of not being able to defend myself. I've always tried to be strong, you know? But in that moment, I was just... frozen.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to acknowledge that?",
    "Client: It's... hard. I mean, I'm 45, I should be over this stuff, right? But talking about it, I realize how much it still affects me. Like, I avoid parks now. I cross the street if I see a big dog. It's embarrassing.",
    "Therapist: There's no timeline for healing, Carlos.",
    "Client: I guess... It's just, I feel like I should be stronger. Especially as a Latino man, you know? We're supposed to be tough. But this experience... it's made me feel weak. And that feeling, it bleeds into other areas of my life. My studies, my relationship... I find myself pulling away sometimes.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your PTSD symptoms?",
    "Client: Well, I'm always on edge, especially in public spaces. I have nightmares about being attacked, not just by dogs but by people too. It's like my brain has merged all these threats together. And the depression... it's like this constant weight. Like I'm always fighting to stay afloat.",
    "Therapist: That sounds exhausting. What's helping you stay motivated?",
    "Client: Honestly? This therapy. It's hard, but... I want to feel normal again. I want to walk in a park without panicking. I want to be present in my relationship instead of always being on guard. And my studies... I want to focus on building my future instead of being trapped by my past.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful motivation. What progress have you noticed?",
    "Client: Well... I think I'm getting better at recognizing when I'm having a flashback. And... this is small, but last week I walked past a fenced yard with a dog in it. I was scared, but I didn't cross the street. I just... breathed through it.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress, Carlos.",
    "Client: Yeah... maybe it is. It's just... it's hard to feel proud when there's still so far to go, you know? But I'm trying. I really am.",
    "Therapist: What helps you keep going in tough moments?",
    "Client: I think... remembering why I'm doing this. For myself, for my partner, for my future. And... this might sound silly, but I've started keeping a journal. Writing down small victories. On bad days, I read it to remind myself that I'm making progress, even if it doesn't always feel like it.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent strategy. How else can we support your progress?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe... could we practice some more coping strategies for when I'm out in public? And... I think I need to work on opening up to my partner more. I've been pushing them away, and I don't want to lose them.",
