    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is buzzing, you know? My hands are a bit shaky, and my heart's still racing. I can feel this tightness in my chest, like I can't quite catch my breath. It's weird because I'm sitting here, safe in your office, but my body's reacting like I'm still there, in that hospital room.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: God, so many. I keep seeing flashes of that sterile hospital room, the beeping machines. I remember feeling so small and helpless. There's this voice in my head saying, \"You're weak. You should be able to handle this.\" But then another part of me is angry, like, why did this have to happen to me? It's not fair. And then I feel guilty for feeling angry because it's not like anyone chose for me to get sick. It's just... it's a lot.",
    "Therapist: How does sharing these thoughts make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... uncomfortable. Like I'm exposing a part of myself I usually keep hidden. But there's also a strange sense of relief? Like, maybe it's okay to feel all these conflicting emotions. I've spent so long trying to push them down, pretend they don't exist. Talking about it makes it feel more real, but also less overwhelming, if that makes sense?",
    "Therapist: Can you tell me more about that sense of relief?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... for so long, I've felt like I was going crazy. Having all these intense emotions and memories swirling around inside me, but never letting them out. It was exhausting, you know? Always being on guard, afraid that if I let my guard down for even a second, everything would come crashing down. But sitting here, talking about it... it's like I'm finally acknowledging that yes, this happened. Yes, it was awful. And yes, it's okay that I'm still affected by it.",
    "Therapist: How does this realization affect your view of your recovery?",
    "Client: I... I guess it makes me feel like maybe there's hope? Like, maybe I'm not broken beyond repair. For so long, I've felt like I should be \"over it\" by now. But hearing you say that it's normal to still have these reactions... it's like a weight has been lifted. Maybe I can actually heal from this, you know? Not just push it down and pretend it never happened, but actually process it and move forward.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you noticing as you share this?",
    "Client: Oh, wow. Now that you mention it, I notice my shoulders have relaxed a bit. The tightness in my chest is still there, but it's not as constricting. My hands have stopped shaking. It's like... it's like my body is starting to realize that it's okay to let go a little. That remembering doesn't mean reliving.",
    "Therapist: How does this shift feel emotionally?",
    "Client: It's... bittersweet, I think. There's a sadness there, for everything I've been through, for the time I've lost to this fear and anxiety. But there's also a glimmer of something else. Hope, maybe? Or determination? Like, for the first time in a long time, I feel like I might actually be able to get through this. It's scary, but also... exciting? Is that weird to say?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. Can you elaborate on that excitement?",
    "Client: I guess it's just... for so long, I've felt stuck. Like I was just going through the motions, existing but not really living, you know? Always waiting for the other shoe to drop, for something bad to happen. But now, it's like I can see a future where I'm not controlled by this fear. Where I can actually enjoy life again, make plans, have hope. It's terrifying, because what if I'm setting myself up for disappointment? But at the same time, it's like... what if I'm not? What if things really can get better?",
    "Therapist: How do you think this might impact your daily life?",
    "Client: God, in so many ways. I mean, just the idea of not constantly being on edge, of not jumping at every little noise or panicking every time I feel a twinge in my body... it would be life-changing. Maybe I could actually go out with friends without worrying about having a panic attack. Or pursue that promotion at work without thinking I'm not good enough. It's like... it's like I've been living in this tiny, dark room, and suddenly I've realized there's a whole world out there. It's overwhelming, but in a good way, you know?",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you could take towards that future?",
    "Client: Hmm... maybe... maybe I could try talking to my sister about what happened. She's always wanted to know more, to understand why I've been so distant, but I've never been able to open up. But now, after this session... I think I might be ready to try. It's scary, but also... it feels right. Like it's time to stop hiding and start healing.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a brave step. How do you feel about that decision?",
    "Client: Nervous, definitely. There's still a part of me that wants to run and hide. But there's also this... I don't know, determination? Like, I'm tired of letting this control my life. I want my sister back. I want my life back. And if talking about it is the first step, then... I think I'm ready to take that step. It's not going to be easy, but for the first time in a long time, I feel like it might actually be possible.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant realization. What do you need to feel supported in this?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. I guess just knowing that I have a safe space here, with you, to process everything. And maybe... maybe some strategies for when things get overwhelming? Because I know there will be times when it all feels like too much. But mostly, I think I just need to keep reminding myself that it's okay to take it one day at a time. That healing isn't linear, and that's okay.",
    "Therapist: How would you like to end our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to take a moment to just breathe. To sit with all these new feelings and realizations. It's a lot to process, but for once, I don't feel like I need to run from it. I want to remember this feeling, this sense of possibility. Because I have a feeling I'm going to need to hold onto it in the days to come.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a perfect way to close. Shall we take a few deep breaths together?",
    "Client: Yes, please. That would be really nice."
