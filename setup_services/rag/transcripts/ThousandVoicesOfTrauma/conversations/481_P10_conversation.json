    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit jittery, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about the dog attack again, and it's making me feel on edge.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm at the park near my house. It's a sunny afternoon, and I can feel the warmth on my skin. I'm sitting on a bench, scrolling through my phone. There aren't many people around, just a couple of joggers in the distance.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear... I hear barking. It's getting louder. I look up and see this huge dog running towards me. It's a Rottweiler, I think. Its teeth are bared, and it looks angry. My heart starts racing, and I can feel my palms getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Uh, maybe a 6? It's starting to feel real.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Keep going. You're doing well.",
    "Client: The dog is getting closer. I... I stand up, thinking maybe I should run, but my legs feel heavy. I'm frozen. The barking is so loud now, it's all I can hear. I can see the saliva dripping from its mouth. Oh God, it's happening again...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it, Carlos. You're safe here.",
    "Client: It lunges at me. I feel its weight slam into my chest, and I fall backward. The impact knocks the wind out of me. I can smell its hot breath, it's... it's overwhelming. Its paws are on my chest, pinning me down. I'm trying to push it off, but it's so strong. I'm screaming for help, but no one's around.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. This is intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The dog's snapping at my face. I turn my head to the side, and I feel its teeth graze my cheek. The pain is sharp, and I can feel warm blood trickling down. I'm panicking now, thinking it's going to tear my throat out. My arms are flailing, trying to protect my face and neck. I can hear myself sobbing, begging for someone to help me.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Carlos. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I can't breathe. The dog's weight is crushing me. Its growls are so loud, so angry. I manage to get my arm up, and it bites down hard. The pain is excruciating. I can feel its teeth tearing through my skin and muscle. I'm screaming, but it sounds distant, like it's not even me.",
    "Therapist: What's happening in your body right now?",
    "Client: My heart's pounding. I can feel myself shaking. It's like I'm back there.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here with me. You're safe. Continue.",
    "Client: Suddenly, I hear shouting. Someone's running towards us. The dog looks up, distracted. I use all my strength to push it off and roll away. I'm gasping for air, my whole body is trembling. The owner grabs the dog's collar, pulling it back. I can see the horror on his face when he realizes what happened.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Scared, relieved, angry... it's all mixed up. My SUDS is probably a 9.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm lying on the ground, clutching my bleeding arm. The pain is throbbing, and I feel dizzy. The owner is apologizing profusely, but his words sound muffled. I'm in shock, I think. People are gathering around now, someone's calling an ambulance. I can hear the sirens in the distance.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The paramedics arrive. They're talking to me, but I'm having trouble focusing. They clean and bandage my wounds. The sting of the antiseptic brings me back to reality a bit. They help me onto the stretcher. As they're loading me into the ambulance, I see the police talking to the dog owner. I feel a rush of anger. How could he let this happen?",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's still high, maybe an 8. My heart's racing.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: In the ambulance, the shock starts to wear off, and the pain intensifies. I'm scared about how bad the injuries are. Will I need surgery? Will there be permanent damage? The paramedic is trying to keep me calm, but I can see the concern in his eyes. I close my eyes, trying to block it all out, but all I can see is the dog's face, its teeth coming at me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that image. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Terrified. Helpless. I feel like a victim all over again, just like when... when the abuse happened. It's bringing up all those old feelings of powerlessness.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Remember, you survived both experiences. You're strong.",
    "Client: Yeah... I guess I am. At the hospital, everything's a blur of doctors, nurses, and tests. They're cleaning my wounds, giving me shots. Each touch makes me flinch. I keep replaying the attack in my mind, thinking about what I could've done differently. Maybe if I had run away sooner, or if I had fought back harder...",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault, Carlos. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My SUDS is down to a 7, I think. It's still intense, but I'm starting to feel a bit more grounded.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue with what happened at the hospital.",
    "Client: They tell me I need stitches on my arm and face. The local anesthetic dulls the physical pain, but I'm still shaking. As they're stitching me up, I catch a glimpse of myself in a mirror. My face is pale, streaked with dirt and blood. I barely recognize myself. It hits me then \u2013 how close I came to something much worse. I start crying, and I can't stop.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to cry. Let those emotions out.",
    "Client: I'm there for hours. They're worried about infection, so they're giving me strong antibiotics. My parents arrive, and seeing their faces \u2013 the worry, the anger \u2013 it makes everything feel more real. My mom's crying, my dad's demanding to speak to someone about the dog owner. I feel guilty for putting them through this.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're not responsible for their feelings. How are you doing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Emotionally drained. My SUDS is maybe a 6 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Carlos. Keep going.",
    "Client: They finally discharge me late that night. The car ride home is silent. I'm dreading going to sleep, afraid of the nightmares I know will come. At home, I can't bear to look in the mirror. I'm afraid of what I'll see, afraid it'll trigger the memories again. My mom helps me change the bandages, and I wince at every touch. That night, I lie awake for hours, jumping at every little sound, convinced I hear barking in the distance.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, in this moment?",
    "Client: Tired. Sad. A little angry. But... also a bit proud that I made it through talking about it.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You've shown incredible strength. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5, I think. It's still there, but not as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Carlos. Let's take a few deep breaths together to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: (Takes deep breaths) Okay, that helps a bit.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. How are you feeling about the session?",
    "Client: It was tough, but... I feel like I faced it head-on this time. It's still scary, but maybe a little less so?",
    "Therapist: That's the goal. You're making real progress. Let's end here for today.",
    "Client: Thanks, doc. It means a lot to have your support through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Carlos. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later. I'll see you next week."
