    "Therapist: Welcome, Raj. Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... not great, to be honest. My back's been acting up again, and I've been having more flashbacks lately. I'm nervous about this exposure thing. What exactly are we going to do?",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's discuss the process and address your concerns.",
    "Client: Okay... I mean, I trust you, but the idea of reliving that car accident... it's terrifying. I've been trying so hard to avoid thinking about it. And with everything else going on - being unemployed, the constant pain - I'm not sure I can handle this.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. Imaginal exposure helps process trauma memories. Shall I explain more?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I want to understand why we're doing this. It just seems... counterintuitive, I guess.",
    "Therapist: It allows us to safely confront and process the traumatic memory, reducing its power over time.",
    "Client: But won't that make things worse? I'm already struggling to sleep, and when I do, I have nightmares. Won't this just intensify everything?",
    "Therapist: Initially, you may feel increased distress. But over time, it typically decreases. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It sounds scary, but... I guess it makes sense. I can't keep living like this. The flashbacks, the anxiety... it's affecting everything. My relationship, my ability to find work... even just going out feels impossible sometimes.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. We'll go at your pace and I'll support you throughout.",
    "Client: Thank you. That helps a bit. Can you tell me more about what exactly we'll be doing? Like, step by step?",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit the car accident memory. You'll describe it in detail while I guide you. Ready to hear more?",
    "Client: I think so. Just... give me a moment. *deep breath* Okay, go on.",
    "Therapist: You'll share the memory as if it's happening now, including thoughts and feelings. We'll record it for review.",
    "Client: Record it? I... I don't know if I want that. What if someone else hears it? And... do I have to include everything? There are parts that are... really hard to talk about.",
    "Therapist: The recording is confidential and for your use only. Include what you're comfortable with initially.",
    "Client: Okay, that's... that's a relief. I appreciate your patience with all my questions. It's just... this is a big step.",
    "Therapist: Your questions are important. Is there anything else you'd like to know?",
    "Client: I guess... what should I expect to feel during and after? And how long does this usually take?",
    "Therapist: You may experience strong emotions. We'll practice coping strategies. Sessions typically last 45-60 minutes.",
    "Client: That's a long time to... to be in that memory. But I suppose that's the point, right? To face it head-on?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. It's challenging but effective. Your resilience is key to this process.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I'm ready to try. Or as ready as I'll ever be. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's begin with a relaxation exercise. Close your eyes and take a deep breath."
