    "Therapist: Welcome, Fatima. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to dive into my experience in the military, and it's bringing up a lot of mixed emotions. Part of me wants to just get it over with, but another part is terrified.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start slowly. Can you describe where you are in your memory?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in the medical tent. It's hot, so hot. The air feels thick, like you could cut it with a knife. I can smell antiseptic and... and blood. There's a constant hum of activity around me.",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see rows of cots. Some are empty, others have soldiers on them. Their uniforms are torn and bloody. I'm... I'm standing next to a cot with a young man. He can't be more than 20. His face is so pale...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that image. What are you doing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm trying to stop the bleeding. My hands are shaking as I apply pressure to his wound. God, there's so much blood. I can feel it seeping through my gloves, warm and sticky. I'm telling him, \"Stay with me, soldier. You're going to be okay.\" But I don't know if that's true.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 7. My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay. The young soldier, he's looking at me with such fear in his eyes. He's trying to speak, but he's struggling. I lean in closer to hear him. He's asking for his mom. I... I feel a lump in my throat. I want to comfort him, but I also need to focus on saving his life.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud explosion outside. The whole tent shakes. I instinctively duck, covering the soldier with my body. I can hear screaming and shouting outside. My mind is racing - are we under attack? Do I need to evacuate the patients? But I can't leave this soldier...",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're here, in a safe place.",
    "Client: Right, right. *deep breath* The chaos outside is getting louder. More wounded are being brought in. I'm torn between staying with this soldier and helping the new arrivals. I... I feel so helpless. There's not enough of me to go around.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My shoulders are tense. My stomach is in knots. I feel like I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: Focus on those sensations. They're just memories. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *nods* Okay. I... I make the decision to stay with the young soldier. I'm talking to him, trying to keep him conscious. \"Tell me about your mom,\" I say. \"What's her name?\" He struggles to speak, but he manages to whisper, \"Sarah.\" I feel tears welling up in my eyes, but I blink them back. I can't break down now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: I know it's difficult. You're very brave for facing this. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: *takes a shaky breath* Okay. I'm continuing to work on the soldier. My hands are moving almost automatically now, years of training taking over. But inside, I'm a mess. I'm praying, bargaining with God or whoever might be listening. \"Please, let me save this one. He's just a kid.\"",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: The next few minutes are a blur. I'm working frantically, but I can see him slipping away. His breathing becomes more labored. His grip on my hand weakens. And then... and then... *voice breaks* he's gone. Just like that. I... I failed him.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here now, you're safe.",
    "Client: *crying* I know, but it feels so real. I can still see his face. He was someone's son, someone's brother. And I couldn't save him.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. What do you do after he passes?",
    "Client: I... I close his eyes. My hands are shaking so badly. I want to break down and cry, but there's no time. There are more wounded coming in. I have to keep going. But for a moment, just a moment, I rest my hand on his forehead and whisper, \"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.\"",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... hollow. Drained. But also like there's this pressure building inside me. Like I might explode.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's a 9. I... I don't know if I can keep going.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well, Fatima. Remember, you're here in a safe place. The memory can't hurt you.",
    "Client: *nods, takes a deep breath* Okay. I... I force myself to move on to the next patient. But I feel like I'm on autopilot. My body is moving, but my mind is still with that young soldier. I keep seeing his face, hearing his voice asking for his mom. I wonder if I'll ever forget it.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I notice that my uniform is covered in blood. His blood. I can smell it, taste it in the air. It makes me feel sick. The noise in the tent seems to fade away, and all I can hear is my own heartbeat pounding in my ears.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I start treating the next patient, but I'm not really there. I'm going through the motions, but part of me is still with that young soldier. I keep thinking about his mother, how she'll receive the news. Will she know that in his last moments, he was thinking of her?",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you experiencing?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking. My chest feels tight, like I can't get enough air. I feel dizzy, like the room is spinning around me.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *takes a deep breath* Right. Safe. I... I continue working. Hours pass, or maybe it's just minutes. Time seems to lose all meaning. More wounded come in, some we save, some we lose. But that young soldier's face stays with me through it all.",
    "Therapist: How does the memory end?",
    "Client: Eventually, the flow of patients slows. I find myself standing in the middle of the tent, surrounded by the aftermath. There's blood everywhere, discarded bandages, the moans of the wounded. I feel... empty. Exhausted. Like I've aged years in just a few hours.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 7. I'm starting to feel a bit more grounded.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well, Fatima. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. Sad. But also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved? Like I've finally let some of this out.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. You've shown incredible strength today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I never thought I'd be able to talk about this.",
    "Therapist: You've made significant progress. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay. *takes a deep breath* I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's start by focusing on five things you can see in this room..."
