    "Therapist: Hello, Amira. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Johnson. I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares lately about the bullying, and I'm worried about bringing it all up again.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's talk about today's plan.",
    "Client: Okay... what exactly are we going to do? You mentioned something called imaginal exposure last time, but I'm not sure I fully understand what that means.",
    "Therapist: It's a technique to help process traumatic memories. Are you ready to learn more?",
    "Client: I think so. It sounds a bit scary, but I trust you. Can you explain it to me?",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit the bullying memory in a safe space. You'll describe it in detail while I guide you.",
    "Client: That does sound scary. I've been trying so hard to avoid thinking about it. Won't this make things worse? I'm worried I might have a panic attack or something.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel anxious. We'll go at your pace and I'll support you throughout.",
    "Client: Okay... I appreciate that. I guess I'm just worried about losing control of my emotions. Sometimes when I think about what happened, I feel like I can't breathe and my heart starts racing. Will you help me if that happens?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll practice coping strategies first. Your safety is my priority.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I'm still nervous, but I feel a bit better knowing you'll be there to help. Can you tell me more about how this is supposed to help with my PTSD symptoms?",
    "Therapist: It helps process the memory, reducing its power over time. Your symptoms should decrease.",
    "Client: I see. That makes sense, I guess. It's just hard to imagine feeling better about it. The memories feel so vivid and overwhelming sometimes. How long does this process usually take?",
    "Therapist: It varies for each person. We'll go at your pace and adjust as needed.",
    "Client: Okay. I appreciate your patience with me. I know I ask a lot of questions. It's just... this is all so new and a bit overwhelming. But I really want to get better. My boyfriend has been so supportive, but I can tell he's worried about me too.",
    "Therapist: Your questions are welcome. It's brave of you to face this. How else can I help?",
    "Client: Thank you, that means a lot. I guess... can you just walk me through what exactly we'll be doing? Like, step by step? I think having a clear picture in my mind might help me feel more prepared.",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll start with relaxation exercises, then you'll describe the memory while I guide you.",
    "Client: Okay, that doesn't sound too bad. And you'll be there the whole time, right? I'm worried about getting lost in the memory and not being able to pull myself out.",
    "Therapist: I'll be here throughout. We can pause anytime you need. You're in control.",
    "Client: That's really comforting to know. I think... I think I'm ready to try this. It's still scary, but I want to get better. I'm tired of feeling like this all the time, you know? Like I'm constantly on edge, waiting for something bad to happen.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Shall we begin with a breathing exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would help. My heart's beating pretty fast right now. Thank you for being so patient and understanding with me. I know I'm not the easiest patient, but I really appreciate everything you're doing to help me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Amira. Let's start. Take a deep breath in..."
