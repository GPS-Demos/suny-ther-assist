    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure exercise. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the day of the airplane crash?",
    "Client: It was a sunny day in July. We were supposed to go on a family vacation. My husband, our son, and I were at the airport, waiting for our flight. Everything seemed normal at first...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: We boarded the plane, found our seats. I remember feeling excited about the trip. The takeoff was smooth, but about 30 minutes into the flight, there was a loud bang. The plane started shaking violently...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What did you feel?",
    "Client: I felt... terrified. My heart was racing. I grabbed my husband's hand and looked at our son. He was pale, his eyes wide with fear. The oxygen masks dropped down, and there was chaos all around us.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: People were screaming. The flight attendants were trying to calm everyone down, but I could see the panic in their eyes too. I was fumbling with the oxygen mask, trying to put it on our son first, then myself...",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly frightening. What happened next?",
    "Client: The plane was losing altitude fast. I could feel my stomach dropping. I kept thinking, \"This can't be happening. This can't be real.\" I held onto my family tightly, praying for a miracle...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) Then came the impact. It was... it was like nothing I've ever experienced. The noise was deafening. Everything was shaking, breaking apart. I lost my grip on my husband and son...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel upset. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice breaking) When the plane finally stopped moving, I was upside down, still strapped to my seat. I could smell fuel and smoke. I called out for my family, but I couldn't hear their voices...",
    "Therapist: You're being so strong. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I managed to unbuckle myself and crawl out of the wreckage. There was debris everywhere. I was calling out for my husband and son, searching desperately. Other survivors were stumbling around, injured and dazed...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... overwhelmed. My chest feels tight, and I can almost smell the smoke again. It's like I'm back there...",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember, you're here now, safe.",
    "Client: (nods) I searched for hours. Rescue teams arrived, but... (starts crying) they couldn't find my husband or son. They were gone. Just like that, in an instant, my whole world shattered.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to cry. You're doing incredibly well.",
    "Client: I keep replaying that day in my mind. Wondering if there was something I could have done differently. If I had insisted on a different flight, or if I had held onto them tighter...",
    "Therapist: Those thoughts are common, but not your fault.",
