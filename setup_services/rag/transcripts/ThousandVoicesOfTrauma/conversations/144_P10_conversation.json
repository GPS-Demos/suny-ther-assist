    "Therapist: Welcome, Amir. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a part of me that wants to get this over with, but another part that's... hesitant, I guess. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to help you process these experiences. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day in the refugee camp. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see... I see the tents. Rows and rows of white tents stretching as far as I can see. The sun is beating down, and there's this haze in the air. It's so hot. I can feel sweat trickling down my back.",
    "Therapist: Good. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: There's... there's this constant buzz of noise. People talking, children crying. I hear a woman arguing with someone nearby. And the smell... it's overwhelming. A mix of sweat, dirt, and something rotten.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 40? It's uncomfortable, but I can handle it.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: I'm... I'm standing in line. It's the food distribution line. I've been here for hours, and my legs are aching. My stomach is growling so loud I think others can hear it. I haven't eaten in two days.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm angry. And scared. I keep thinking, \"This isn't fair. Why am I here? What did I do to deserve this?\" But then I feel guilty for even thinking that because I know others have it worse.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to acknowledge those feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: I finally get to the front of the line, and... and they're out of food. The volunteer looks at me with pity and says, \"Sorry, come back tomorrow.\" I... I can't believe it. I feel this rush of despair and... and rage.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's higher. Maybe 60?",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... I... I turn away from the distribution point, feeling defeated. As I'm walking back to my tent, I see a group of children playing with a makeshift ball. They look so carefree, despite everything. It makes me feel... I don't know, a mix of hope and sadness.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I go back to my tent. It's cramped and hot inside. I share it with three other men I barely know. They're all out, probably trying to find work or food. I sit on my thin mattress and just... stare at the canvas wall.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in that moment?",
    "Client: I feel... alone. So incredibly alone. And useless. I was somebody back home, you know? I had a job, a purpose. Here, I'm just... a number. Another mouth to feed. I... I start to cry. I can't help it.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to cry. Let those emotions out. How's your distress?",
    "Client: It's... it's pretty high now. Maybe 75?",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Take a few deep breaths. What do you notice around you right now?",
    "Client: I... I can feel the chair I'm sitting on. I hear the hum of the air conditioner. I'm here, in your office. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, return to the memory.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm still in the tent. I've stopped crying, but I feel... hollow. Empty. I hear someone outside calling my name. It's one of the camp volunteers.",
    "Therapist: What happens then?",
    "Client: I... I wipe my face and step outside. The volunteer tells me there's an opportunity to help with some construction work in the camp. It's not much, but it's something. I feel a tiny spark of hope.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Relieved, I guess? But also... scared. What if I'm not good enough? What if they send me away? But I know I have to try. I can't just sit in that tent anymore.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe 50?",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going.",
    "Client: I follow the volunteer to the construction site. It's just a small area where they're building some new shelters. I see other men from the camp there, all looking as desperate as I feel. We're given some basic tools and instructions.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking as you start working?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about how strange this all is. A few months ago, I was working in an office, and now I'm here, hammering nails into rough wood. But there's also this sense of... I don't know, purpose? For the first time in weeks, I feel like I'm doing something useful.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The work is hard. My hands aren't used to this, and they start to blister. But I don't care. I throw myself into it. As we work, some of us start to talk. Nothing deep, just... casual conversation. Where we're from, what we did before. It feels... normal. Almost.",
    "Therapist: How does that interaction affect you?",
    "Client: It's... it's comforting, in a way. To know I'm not alone in this. But it also makes me sad, hearing their stories. So many lives disrupted, so many dreams put on hold. I feel a mix of gratitude and guilt.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 40 now, I think.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: As the day goes on, I start to feel... I don't know, a bit more like myself. The work is exhausting, but it feels good to be doing something. By the end of the day, we've made progress on the shelters. It's not much, but it's something.",
    "Therapist: What happens when the work is done for the day?",
    "Client: The volunteer in charge thanks us all. He says we can come back tomorrow if we want. I... I feel a sense of accomplishment, but also this deep sadness. Because I know that tomorrow, I'll be right back here. This is my life now.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization impact you?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. I feel this wave of grief wash over me. For my old life, for my family back home, for the person I used to be. But there's also this tiny spark of... something. Not quite hope, but... resilience, maybe?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful mix of emotions. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. Emotionally drained. But also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I've faced this memory and survived.",
    "Therapist: You've done extremely well today, Amir. How would you rate your distress now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 30, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's take a few deep breaths together and slowly bring your awareness back to the present.",
    "Client: Okay... [deep breath] I'm here. In your office. It's... it's over.",
    "Therapist: Well done, Amir. How are you feeling now that we've completed this session?",
    "Client: I feel... exhausted, but also... lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time. It's still there, but it doesn't feel as heavy.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience after imaginal exposure. You've shown incredible strength today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I didn't think I could do it, but... I did.",
    "Therapist: Yes, you did. We'll end our session here. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you... for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Amir. I'll see you next week."
