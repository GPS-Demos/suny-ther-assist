    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. I can still see her face, you know? My sister's face, right before... before it happened. It's like I'm there again, in that moment, and I can't escape it.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Guilt. Overwhelming guilt. I keep thinking that if I had just been there, if I had known what was happening to her... Maybe I could have stopped it. Maybe she'd still be alive. It's eating me up inside.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a heavy weight on my chest. I can barely breathe. My stomach is in knots, and I feel nauseous. It's like my whole body is screaming at me that I failed her. I failed my little sister when she needed me most.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep hearing her voice, you know? The last time we spoke on the phone. She sounded... different. Scared, maybe. But I was so caught up in my own life, I didn't pay attention. I should have known something was wrong. I should have asked more questions. Maybe if I had, I could have figured out what was happening to her. Maybe I could have saved her from those... those monsters who took her.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts affect you?",
    "Client: They... they make me feel helpless. Angry. I want to go back in time and shake myself, tell myself to wake up and pay attention. But I can't. And now she's gone, and I can't do anything to change that. It's like I'm trapped in this cycle of \"what ifs\" and regrets, and I don't know how to break free.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I... I feel so alone. Like no one can possibly understand what I'm going through. My parents, they're grieving too, but it's different for them. They didn't grow up with her, sharing secrets and dreams. They didn't promise to always protect her like I did. And now, every time I close my eyes, I see her. I see what they might have done to her. It's... it's unbearable.",
    "Therapist: How does sharing this make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. Really hard. But also, I don't know, maybe a little relieving? Like, for the first time, I'm not carrying this all by myself. But then I feel guilty for feeling relieved, because how can I feel any sort of relief when she suffered so much? It's confusing and overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Part of me wants to run away from all of this, to forget it ever happened. But another part knows I can't do that. I need... I need to find a way to live with this, to honor her memory without letting it destroy me. I just don't know how.",
    "Therapist: How has this experience changed you?",
    "Client: It's... it's changed everything. I used to be carefree, you know? I took life for granted. Now, I'm always on edge, always looking over my shoulder. I see danger everywhere. And I'm angry. So angry at the world for letting this happen, at myself for not preventing it. But I'm also more aware now. Of human trafficking, of the signs. I want to do something, to help other families avoid this pain. But I don't know where to start.",
    "Therapist: What strength do you see in yourself?",
    "Client: Strength? I... I don't feel strong. I feel broken. But... I guess the fact that I'm here, talking about this, that's something, right? A few months ago, I couldn't even say her name without breaking down. Now, it still hurts, but I'm trying. I'm trying to face this, to understand it. Maybe that's strength. I don't know.",
    "Therapist: How does recognizing that feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's strange. Part of me wants to deny it, to say I'm weak for not being able to save her. But another part... another part feels a tiny glimmer of hope. Like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this. Maybe I can find a way to live that honors her memory, that makes a difference. It's scary to feel that hope, though. What if I'm wrong?",
    "Therapist: What would your sister want for you?",
    "Client: She... she would want me to be happy. To live. She was always the optimistic one, you know? Always pushing me to take chances, to embrace life. She'd probably be mad at me for beating myself up like this. She'd tell me to get out there and make a difference, to use what happened to her to help others. But it's so hard to think about moving forward when she can't.",
    "Therapist: How can you honor her wishes?",
    "Client: I... I guess I could start by learning more about human trafficking. Maybe volunteer with organizations that help survivors or work on prevention. It's terrifying to think about immersing myself in that world, but if it could help even one person avoid what happened to her... maybe it would be worth it. And maybe, in doing that, I could start to forgive myself. Find a way to live that doesn't feel like a betrayal of her memory.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you could take?",
    "Client: I... I could research local organizations that work on this issue. Maybe reach out to one, see if they need volunteers. It's a small thing, but it's something concrete I could do. Something that might help me feel less helpless. And maybe, in helping others, I could start to heal myself. It's scary, but... but I think it's what she would want me to do.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that idea?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming, to be honest. Part of me is terrified. What if I can't handle it? What if it brings back all the pain and guilt? But there's also a part of me that feels... I don't know, energized? Like maybe this could be a way to channel all these intense emotions into something positive. It's not going to be easy, but... but maybe it's a step in the right direction.",
    "Therapist: What support do you need?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need people around me who understand. Maybe a support group for families who've been through similar experiences? And I'll need to keep coming to therapy, to work through the emotions that come up. It's going to be a long journey, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: How does that realization sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... it's daunting. The idea that this is going to be a long-term process, that there's no quick fix. But at the same time, it feels... right? Like, what happened to my sister, it's not something that can be brushed aside or gotten over quickly. It's going to take time and work to heal, to find a way forward. And maybe that's okay. Maybe that's how it should be.",
    "Therapist: What have you learned about yourself today?",
    "Client: I've learned that... that maybe I'm stronger than I thought. That even though I'm hurting, even though I feel broken, there's still a part of me that wants to fight, to make something good come out of this tragedy. I've learned that it's okay to feel conflicted, to have moments of hope alongside the pain. And I've learned that maybe, just maybe, I can find a way to honor my sister's memory that doesn't involve drowning in guilt. It's a small step, but it feels like an important one.",
    "Therapist: How would you like to end our session?",
    "Client: I... I think I'd like to take a moment of silence for my sister. To remember her as she was - vibrant, loving, full of life. And then... then maybe we could talk about some concrete steps I can take this week. Some small actions to start moving forward. It's scary, but... but I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a beautiful way to close. Let's do that."
