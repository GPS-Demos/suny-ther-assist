    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to dive into some heavy stuff today, and part of me wants to just run out that door. But I'm here, right? That's gotta count for something.",
    "Therapist: It absolutely does. You're showing great courage. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I guess as ready as I'll ever be. Let's do this before I change my mind.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in the field hospital. The air is thick with dust and the smell of antiseptic. It's so hot, my uniform is sticking to my skin. I can hear helicopters in the distance, and there's a constant buzz of activity around me.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's happening right now?",
    "Client: I'm rushing between beds. There are so many injured soldiers. God, they're just kids, really. I'm trying to triage, but there's so much blood. My hands are shaking as I check vitals.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Overwhelmed. Terrified. I... I don't know if I can do this. There's a soldier, he can't be more than 20, and his leg... it's... it's barely attached. He's screaming in pain.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 70. My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm... I'm trying to stop the bleeding on this kid's leg. My hands are covered in his blood. I can hear him begging me to save him, to not let him die. I'm telling him he'll be okay, but I don't know if that's true.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: Another explosion, close by. The ground shakes, and for a second, I freeze. But then I'm moving again, because I have to. More wounded are coming in. I'm exhausted, but there's no time to rest.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm angry. Why are we here? Why are these kids dying? I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. Stay with those emotions.",
    "Client: I keep working, but it feels like for every person I help, two more come in worse off. The smell of blood is overwhelming. I can taste it in the air. And then... and then...",
    "Therapist: Take your time. What happens?",
    "Client: There's a young woman, a local. She's pregnant and in labor, but something's wrong. She's bleeding heavily, and I can see the fear in her eyes. I'm not an obstetrician, I don't... I don't know what to do.",
    "Therapist: How distressed are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 85. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Remember to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor. You're here, you're safe.",
    "Client: Right... okay. I'm... I'm trying to help her. I can hear her crying out in pain. I'm calling for help, but everyone's busy. I have to do this on my own. Her blood is soaking through the sheets, and I'm trying to remember my training, but it all feels like it's slipping away.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with it.",
    "Client: I deliver the baby, but it's not crying. It's not moving. I'm doing CPR on this tiny little body, willing it to breathe. The mother is screaming now, reaching for her child. I feel like I'm going to throw up, but I can't stop. I have to keep trying.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: After what feels like an eternity, the baby gasps. It's alive. But the mother... she's lost so much blood. I turn to help her, but her eyes are already glazing over. I'm shouting for blood, for help, but I know... I know it's too late.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: Devastated. Guilty. I saved the baby, but I couldn't save her. I failed.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you did everything you could. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's at 90. I can feel my hands shaking, just like they did that day.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Focus on the present. You're here, you're safe.",
    "Client: I... I can still see her face. The way she looked at her baby in those last moments. I don't think I'll ever forget that. And then... then I had to keep going. There were more patients, more emergencies. I didn't even have time to process what had just happened.",
    "Therapist: How did you manage to continue?",
    "Client: I don't know. I just... I shut down. I became mechanical. Treat the next patient, move on. Don't think, don't feel. But inside, I was screaming.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. But also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've finally let some of this out.",
    "Therapist: That's good. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's down to about 60 now. Still there, but not as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well today. How do you feel about what we've covered?",
    "Client: It was hard, really hard. But I think... I think I needed this. To finally talk about it, to let myself feel it instead of pushing it down.",
    "Therapist: That's an important step. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves before we end.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm... I'm focusing on my breathing. On the chair beneath me. The sound of your voice. I'm here, not there.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. You've shown incredible strength today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I'm starting to see that maybe I'm stronger than I thought.",
    "Therapist: You absolutely are. We'll end here for today. How are you feeling as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm tired, but... hopeful, I think. Like maybe I can actually get through this.",
