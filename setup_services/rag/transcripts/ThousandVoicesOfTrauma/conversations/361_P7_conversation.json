    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Can you describe the natural disaster you experienced?",
    "Client: Okay... It was a severe cyclone that hit our coastal town. I remember the wind howling and the rain pounding against the windows. The power went out, and everything was pitch black. I could hear things crashing outside, and I was terrified that our house would be torn apart.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you saw and felt.",
    "Client: The noise was deafening. I could barely hear myself think. Water started seeping in under the doors, and I realized we were going to flood. I tried to move some valuables to higher ground, but my hands were shaking so much I could barely grip anything. The water kept rising, and I felt so helpless...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) I... I remember feeling like I couldn't breathe. The water was up to my knees, and I was sure I was going to die. I kept thinking about my kids, who were with their mother that weekend. I was glad they weren't there, but also devastated that I might never see them again.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel emotional. You're doing great.",
    "Client: (taking a deep breath) The worst part was the waiting. For hours, we just sat there in the dark, listening to the storm rage outside. Every crash made me jump. I felt so small and insignificant against the power of nature. When morning finally came, and the storm passed, I looked outside and... (pauses)",
    "Therapist: Take your time. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Everything was destroyed. Houses were torn apart, trees uprooted, cars overturned. It looked like a war zone. I've never felt so lost and overwhelmed. The town I grew up in, the place I called home, was unrecognizable. I felt like I had lost a part of myself.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. My heart is racing, and I feel a bit nauseous. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I survived it once, and I can face the memory now.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Let's continue.",
    "Client: After the initial shock, I remember feeling angry. Angry at nature, at the government for not having better flood defenses, at myself for not being better prepared. I started helping with the cleanup, but every time I saw someone's destroyed belongings, I felt this deep sadness. It was like our entire community was grieving.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job describing your emotions.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's still difficult to talk about. The recovery process was so long and exhausting. For months, our lives revolved around rebuilding. I had nightmares about drowning, about watching helplessly as everything I cared about was swept away. Even now, years later, I get anxious when there's a storm warning.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those feelings. You're being very brave.",
    "Client: I guess I am. It's just... this experience changed me. I became more cautious, more aware of how fragile our lives can be. Sometimes I feel guilty for surviving when others didn't. And I worry about future disasters. Climate change makes me anxious - what if it happens again, but worse?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How do you cope with these thoughts?",
    "Client: I try to stay prepared. I have emergency kits, I keep up with weather reports. Sometimes it feels like I'm paranoid, but it gives me a sense of control. I've also gotten involved in local climate action groups. It helps me feel like I'm doing something proactive.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive way to channel your experience.",
    "Client: Yeah, I suppose it is. But there are still times when I feel overwhelmed by it all. Like when I see news about disasters in other parts of the world, I can almost feel what those people are going through. It brings it all back.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable resilience. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... maybe a little lighter? Talking about it is hard, but it also feels like I'm letting go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's often a sign of progress. We'll end here for today.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you for guiding me through this. It wasn't easy, but I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. We'll continue next session."
