    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Johnson. How are you feeling today as we begin our session?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. Talking about my experiences as a refugee... it's not easy.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We'll take it slow.",
    "Client: Thank you. I guess we should start with when I first left my village. It was chaos. The sound of gunfire in the distance, people screaming, running... I remember the smell of smoke in the air. My heart was pounding so hard I thought it might burst out of my chest.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I had to leave everything behind. My home, my friends, my whole life. I only had time to grab a small bag with a few clothes and some food. The journey was treacherous. We walked for days, always looking over our shoulders, afraid of being caught or killed.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that memory. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) There were times I thought I wouldn't make it. The heat was unbearable during the day, and at night, the cold seeped into my bones. We had to be quiet, always quiet. Any noise could attract attention. I remember one night, huddled under a tree, I could hear the distant howls of wild animals. I was terrified they would find us.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) The worst part was the uncertainty. Not knowing if we'd find safety, if we'd ever see our loved ones again. I kept thinking about my parents, who stayed behind. The guilt... it was overwhelming. I felt like I had abandoned them.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: (voice breaking) There was this little girl in our group. She couldn't have been more than five or six. One day, she just... couldn't go on. Her parents were carrying her, but we were all so weak. I... I offered to help. I carried her on my back for hours. Her little arms around my neck... I can still feel them sometimes.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (wiping tears) When we finally reached the refugee camp, I thought we'd be safe. But it was just a different kind of struggle. The overcrowding, the lack of food and clean water, the diseases... It felt like we had escaped one nightmare only to enter another. I tried to stay strong, to help others, but some days... some days I just wanted to give up.",
    "Therapist: You've come so far. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. Reliving these memories is painful. But somehow, talking about it... it feels like I'm lifting a weight off my chest. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're doing incredibly well.",
    "Client: Thank you. I've never really talked about this before. In the camp, we all had our stories, our traumas. But we rarely spoke about them. It was like an unspoken agreement - we were all trying to move forward, to survive. But now, years later, I realize how much I've been carrying with me.",
    "Therapist: It takes courage to face these memories. You're very brave.",
    "Client: (sighs) Sometimes I wonder what my life would have been like if I hadn't had to flee. Would I have a family? A different career? But then I think about the opportunities I've had here, the people I've met, the life I've built... It's complex, you know? I'm grateful, but there's still this sadness, this longing for what could have been.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are valid. You've been through so much.",
    "Client: I think what haunts me most is the uncertainty of those early days. The fear of the unknown, not knowing if I'd live to see another day. It's a feeling that's hard to shake, even now. Sometimes, when I hear a loud noise or see a crowded place, I'm right back there, heart racing, ready to run.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job describing your experiences.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's strange, but talking about it like this, I can almost see it all so clearly. The faces of the people I traveled with, the landscape we crossed, even the clothes I was wearing. It's like opening a door I've kept locked for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. You're processing well.",
    "Client: I remember this one night, we were crossing a river. The current was strong, and we had to form a human chain to get across. I was in the middle, and I could feel the hands gripping mine on either side. We were strangers, from different villages, different backgrounds, but in that moment, we were one. We were all fighting for survival together.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful memory. How do you feel sharing it?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. But also, in a way, liberating. For so long, I've tried to push these memories away, to focus on the present. But now, talking about it, I realize they're a part of me. They've shaped who I am.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. You're making great progress.",
    "Client: I think what I struggle with most now is the guilt. Guilt for surviving when others didn't. Guilt for building a new life here when so many are still suffering. It's like I'm constantly torn between two worlds - the one I left behind and the one I'm in now.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those feelings. You're processing them well.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I need a moment. This is a lot to take in.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take all the time you need. You've done incredibly well today.",
    "Client: (after a pause) I appreciate your patience. This isn't easy, but I think it's important. I've carried these memories for so long, it's time I faced them head-on.",
    "Therapist: That's a very courageous attitude. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted, honestly. But also... lighter, somehow. Like I've started to unpack a heavy burden I've been carrying for years. It's overwhelming, but I think it's necessary.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. You've made significant progress today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I'd like to continue this in our next session, if that's okay. There's still so much to process, but I feel like I've taken an important first step.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll continue at your pace. You've done excellent work today.",
    "Client: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your guidance and support through this. It means a lot to have someone listen without judgment, to help me navigate these difficult memories.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and we'll continue next time."
