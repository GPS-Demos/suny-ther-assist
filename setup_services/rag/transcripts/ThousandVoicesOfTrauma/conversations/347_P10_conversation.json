    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, describe the event as if it's happening now. Are you ready?",
    "Client: I... I think so. My hands are a bit clammy, to be honest. But I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Take a deep breath. When you're ready, start describing the disaster.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in my apartment. It's early morning, and I'm getting ready for work. Suddenly, the ground starts shaking. It's gentle at first, but then it gets stronger. I can hear things falling off shelves. The TV crashes to the floor. I'm... I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: Good. What are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I'm... I'm terrified. I don't know what to do. Should I run? Should I hide? The shaking is getting worse.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: The walls are creaking. I can hear people screaming outside. I try to move, but I stumble. The floor is moving so much. I manage to get to the doorway and hold on. The shaking is so violent now. I'm certain the building is going to collapse.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 80. My palms are sweating just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see... I see cracks forming in the walls. Plaster is falling. The lights go out. It's darker now, and dust is everywhere. I can barely breathe. I'm coughing, and my eyes are stinging. I'm so scared. I think I'm going to die.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: The shaking stops, but I'm too afraid to move. I can hear sirens in the distance. People are crying and shouting. I... I smell gas. Oh God, I smell gas. I need to get out, but I'm paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 90. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here in the room with me. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... I... I force myself to move. I'm shaking so badly. I grab my phone and stumble towards the door. The hallway is a mess. There's debris everywhere. I can hear my neighbors calling for help. I want to help them, but I'm too scared. I feel so selfish.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My legs feel weak. My stomach is in knots. I feel... I feel guilty. Ashamed. But also relieved that I'm alive.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Keep going. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I make my way down the stairs. They're cracked, and I'm terrified they'll collapse. I can smell smoke now. When I get outside, it's chaos. People are running, crying. Buildings have collapsed. There's dust everywhere. I can't believe what I'm seeing. It doesn't feel real.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with the memory. What happens then?",
    "Client: I... I wander around in a daze. I see injured people. Blood. I hear screams. I want to help, but I don't know how. I feel useless. Weak. I... I see a child crying, looking for their parents. I want to comfort them, but I'm frozen. I can't move.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's 95. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. Feel your feet on the floor. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm... I'm still there. The ground shakes again. Aftershock. People start screaming again. I fall to my knees. I'm praying, begging for it to stop. I've never felt so helpless in my life.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: I see... I see collapsed buildings. Dust everywhere. People covered in blood and dust. Some are trapped under rubble. I hear sirens getting closer. Emergency services are arriving. But it seems like too little, too late. There's so much destruction.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... numb. Shocked. Like this can't be real. But also... guilty. Why did I survive when others didn't? I should have helped more. I should have been braver.",
    "Therapist: Those are common feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I start walking. I don't know where I'm going. I just need to move. I pass by people helping each other, digging through rubble. I want to help, but I don't know how. I feel useless. Weak. I keep walking until I reach a park. There are people gathering there. Setting up tents. It's becoming a makeshift shelter.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind at this point?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about my family. Are they okay? I should call them. But my phone's not working. The networks must be down. I'm worried sick. I feel so alone, even though I'm surrounded by people.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 85. My heart is still racing, but I feel a bit calmer.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue with what happens next.",
    "Client: I... I sit down on the grass. I'm exhausted. My clothes are covered in dust. I can taste it in my mouth. People around me are crying, comforting each other. Someone hands me a bottle of water. I drink it greedily. I hadn't realized how thirsty I was.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My muscles ache. I feel drained, physically and emotionally. But there's also this surge of adrenaline. Like I need to do something, but I don't know what.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What happens as time passes?",
    "Client: As the day goes on, more people arrive at the park. Aid workers start setting up tents, distributing food and water. I help where I can, but I feel disconnected. Like I'm watching everything happen from outside my body. Night falls, and the city is dark. No electricity. I can see fires in the distance. The air smells of smoke and dust.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... lost. Scared about the future. What if there are more earthquakes? What if I've lost everything? But also... grateful to be alive. It's a confusing mix of emotions.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 75 now. I'm feeling drained.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's start to wrap up. How does the memory end?",
    "Client: I... I find a spot to sleep in one of the tents. It's crowded, uncomfortable. I can hear people crying softly. I lie there, staring at the tent ceiling. I'm exhausted, but I can't sleep. Every small sound makes me tense up, thinking it's another quake. I... I finally drift off as dawn breaks. When I wake up, it feels like a nightmare. But then I look around and realize it wasn't. This is my new reality.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. Emotionally and physically. But also... I feel a bit lighter. Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You did very well today. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves before we end the session."

Like I'm watching everything happen from outside my body. Night falls, and the city is dark. No electricity. I can see fires in the distance. The air smells of smoke and dust.",
