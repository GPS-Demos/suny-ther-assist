    "Therapist: Let's discuss the imaginal exposure we'll be doing today. How are you feeling about it?",
    "Client: I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been trying to avoid thinking about my childhood trauma for so long. The idea of deliberately revisiting it is... unsettling. Plus, with everything going on with my recent breakup, I'm not sure I can handle more emotional stress.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. Can you tell me more about your hesitations?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried that talking about my childhood trauma might trigger some of my substance use issues. I've been doing better lately, but I'm afraid this might push me over the edge. And honestly, I'm scared of how I'll feel afterward. Will I be able to function at work? Will I be able to sleep at night?",
    "Therapist: Those are understandable worries. How do you think facing these memories might help you?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe it could help me process things I've been avoiding. Maybe it could help me understand why I react the way I do in certain situations, especially in relationships. But it's still frightening to think about deliberately bringing up those painful memories.",
    "Therapist: Your insight is spot-on. Shall we discuss what to expect during the exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I'd like to know what I'm getting into. Will it be like reliving the trauma all over again? How long will it last? And what if I can't handle it and need to stop?",
    "Therapist: It won't be reliving, but recounting. We'll go at your pace, and you can pause anytime. What other questions do you have?",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I guess I'm wondering how this will help with my PTSD symptoms. I've been having nightmares and flashbacks, especially since my recent breakup. Will this make them worse before it gets better? And how will you support me during and after the session?",
    "Therapist: Great questions. This process can reduce symptoms over time. I'll guide and support you throughout. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's somewhat reassuring. I'm still nervous, but I think I understand the purpose better now. It's about facing the memories head-on instead of avoiding them, right? I just hope I'm strong enough to do this.",
    "Therapist: You're exactly right. And you are strong enough. Your courage in being here proves that. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. Yes, let's do this. I know it won't be easy, but if it can help me move forward and maybe even improve my relationships in the future, it's worth trying. I trust you to guide me through this. Just... please be patient with me if I struggle.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Your trust means a lot. Let's start slowly. Remember, you're in control here."
