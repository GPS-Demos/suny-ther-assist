    "Therapist: Welcome, Amira. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to do this, but another part is terrified. My hands are a bit shaky.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in our neighborhood in Damascus. The streets are dusty, and I can smell freshly baked bread from the bakery down the street. It's early morning, maybe around 7 AM. I'm walking to university with my friend Layla.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: We're chatting about our upcoming exams. Layla's laughing at a joke I made. Then... then we hear it. A loud boom in the distance. My heart starts racing.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 5? It's climbing.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're doing well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: We... we stop walking. People around us look confused. Some start running. I can see fear in Layla's eyes. Another explosion, closer this time. The ground shakes beneath our feet.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. My legs feel weak. I want to run, but I'm frozen. Oh God, I can smell smoke now.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... okay. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: People are screaming now. Running past us. I grab Layla's hand, and we start running too. I don't know where we're going, just away from the explosions. My lungs burn from the smoke and running.",
    "Therapist: What do you see around you?",
    "Client: Chaos. Pure chaos. People pushing, shoving. A man falls in front of us, and no one stops to help him. I... I see a building collapse in the distance. The sound is deafening.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're doing great. What happens next?",
    "Client: We... we keep running. My legs ache. I can taste blood in my mouth - I think I bit my cheek. We turn a corner, and... and... *starts crying*",
    "Therapist: It's okay, Amira. You're safe here. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: *sobbing* There's... there's a car on fire. People inside. They're screaming. I can smell burning... everything. I can't... I can't...",
    "Therapist: Breathe, Amira. Slow, deep breaths. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. Maybe higher. I feel like I'm there again.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here in this room. You're safe. Can you tell me three things you see in this room right now?",
    "Client: I... I see the blue chair. The window. Your glasses.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, when you're ready, let's continue. What happens after you see the burning car?",
    "Client: Layla pulls me away. We keep running. I hear more explosions, but they sound farther away now. We end up in an alley, both of us gasping for air. I throw up. Layla's crying.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking at this moment?",
    "Client: I... I think this is it. We're going to die here. I'll never see my family again. I'm angry, scared, confused. Why is this happening to us?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What do you do next?",
    "Client: We... we stay in the alley for what feels like hours. The sounds of explosions fade, but we can hear sirens, people shouting. When it seems quieter, we decide to try to get home.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel as you make that decision?",
    "Client: Terrified, but also determined. I need to get home, to make sure my family is okay. My legs are shaky as we start walking.",
    "Therapist: What do you see as you walk?",
    "Client: Destruction. Broken glass everywhere. Smoke rising from buildings. People wandering around, looking shell-shocked. Some are injured. I see a woman cradling a child, both covered in dust.",
    "Therapist: How does seeing this affect you?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. I feel numb, like I'm watching a movie. But the smells... the smoke, the dust, it's all so real. My heart is still pounding.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe a 7? It's a bit lower, but still intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Amira. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: We... we keep walking. The closer we get to our neighborhood, the more anxious I feel. What if... what if our homes are gone? What if... *voice breaks* What if our families...",
    "Therapist: It's okay. Take your time.",
    "Client: *deep breath* We turn onto our street. Some buildings are damaged, but ours is still standing. I start running. I can hear Layla calling out to her family next door.",
    "Therapist: What happens when you reach your building?",
    "Client: I... I burst through the door. I'm calling out for my parents, my little brother. My voice sounds strange, hoarse. For a moment, there's no answer, and I feel this... this crushing despair.",
    "Therapist: And then?",
    "Client: Then... then I hear my mother's voice. They're all in the basement. I run down the stairs, nearly falling. When I see them, I just... I collapse into my mother's arms. We're all crying, holding each other.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel in that moment?",
    "Client: Relief. So much relief. But also... also this terrible realization that our lives will never be the same. That this could happen again at any time.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 5, I think. I feel drained.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well, Amira. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you tell me what you're feeling physically right now?",
    "Client: My heart is still beating fast. My hands are clammy. I feel... I feel exhausted, like I've run a marathon.",
    "Therapist: That's normal after reliving such an intense experience. Let's do a quick breathing exercise. Breathe in for four counts, hold for four, then out for four.",
    "Client: *follows the breathing exercise*",
    "Therapist: Good. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: A bit calmer. My heart rate is slowing down.",
    "Therapist: That's great, Amira. You've shown incredible strength today. Is there anything else about that day you want to share?",
    "Client: I... I remember sitting with my family that night. We could hear distant explosions. No one slept. We just... we just held each other. That's when my parents started talking about leaving Syria.",
    "Therapist: How did you feel about that?",
    "Client: Scared. Relieved. Guilty for feeling relieved. It was... it was all mixed up.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings, Amira. You've done an amazing job today. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired. Really tired. But... but also like a weight has been lifted, somehow. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Many people feel that way after processing traumatic memories. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 3, I think. I feel... drained, but okay.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress, Amira. Let's take a few more deep breaths together before we end the session.",
    "Client: *breathes deeply* Thank you. I... I didn't think I could do this.",
    "Therapist: You did wonderfully. We'll end here for today. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later. You should be proud of yourself, Amira.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I am proud. It was hard, but... but I did it.",
    "Therapist: Yes, you did. We'll talk more next session about how you're feeling and plan our next steps. Take care of yourself, Amira.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again."
