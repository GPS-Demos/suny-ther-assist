    "Therapist: Mrs. Rodriguez, today we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: Oh, Dr. Thompson, I'm not sure. I've been dreading this part. The idea of reliving that awful day at work... it makes my stomach churn. Can you tell me more about what to expect?",
    "Therapist: Of course. It's natural to feel apprehensive. Can you share your main concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried it'll be too overwhelming. Since retiring, I've tried so hard to push those memories away. What if I can't handle bringing them back up?",
    "Therapist: I understand. How do you think revisiting might help?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe it could help me process what happened? But I'm scared it'll make my depression worse. Ever since losing my husband last year, I've struggled to cope with anything difficult.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How can I support you today?",
    "Client: Could you... maybe hold my hand if it gets too intense? And remind me that I'm safe here with you? I know you're much younger than me, but you remind me of my grandson. He always makes me feel secure.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'm here to support you. What else might help you feel safe?",
    "Client: Having a glass of water nearby would be good. And maybe if we could open a window? Sometimes I feel trapped when I think about that day.",
    "Therapist: Certainly. Shall we set those up now?",
    "Client: Yes, please. Dr. Thompson, how long will this take? I promised my daughter I'd watch her kids this evening. I don't want to let her down if I'm too shaken up after our session.",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. How about we start with 15 minutes today?",
    "Client: That sounds manageable. I appreciate your patience with me, Doctor. This isn't easy, but I want to get better. For my family's sake, and for mine.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Just... please remind me it's just a memory. Sometimes it feels so real, like I'm right back there in that moment. But I'm here now, aren't I? Safe in your office?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. You're safe here. Shall we start?",
    "Client: Okay. I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Let's do this."
