    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Hakim?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. It's strange, reliving that accident so vividly. I can still hear the screeching of tires and smell the burnt rubber. It's like I was right there again, you know?",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. In that moment when I realized the car was going to hit us, I felt so... powerless. It's the same feeling I get now when I see those awful comments online. I just freeze up, unable to defend myself.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does that connect to your daily life?",
    "Client: Well, it's... it's like I'm constantly on edge. Whether I'm driving or just checking my email, I'm always waiting for something bad to happen. I've become so hesitant to engage with people online, fearing they might attack me like those cyberbullies did. It's exhausting, really.",
    "Therapist: That sounds challenging. What thoughts came up during the exposure?",
    "Client: I kept thinking, \"Why me?\" Why did I have to go through that accident, and now this online harassment? It feels so unfair. And then I feel guilty for even thinking that, because I know others have it worse. It's a confusing mix of emotions.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts affect you?",
    "Client: They... they make me feel small, I suppose. Like I'm not strong enough to handle life's challenges. It's affecting my work, my relationships. I used to be so confident in my professional life, but now I second-guess every decision, every email I send. I'm afraid of making mistakes, of being criticized.",
    "Therapist: I hear your struggle. What's one thing you learned today?",
    "Client: I... I realized that maybe I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. I survived that accident, didn't I? And I'm here, facing these memories, trying to get better. That takes some courage, doesn't it?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How can you apply this moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I need to remind myself of this strength more often. When I feel overwhelmed by the cyberbullying, perhaps I can remember that I've overcome difficult things before. It doesn't make it easy, but... it gives me a bit of hope, I suppose.",
    "Therapist: That's a valuable insight. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: It's hard, really hard. But I want to get better, for myself and my family. They've been so supportive through all this. I just... I want to feel like myself again, you know? To not be afraid of my own inbox or of driving to the grocery store. So yes, I want to continue. It's uncomfortable, but I think it's necessary.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is commendable. What's your biggest takeaway today?",
    "Client: I think... I'm realizing that these experiences, as terrible as they were, don't define me. They're a part of my story, yes, but they're not all of who I am. I'm still that professional woman, that loving wife and mother. I've just been so focused on the trauma that I've lost sight of the other parts of myself. Maybe it's time to start reclaiming those parts.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it feel to acknowledge that?",
    "Client: It feels... liberating, in a way. Like I'm giving myself permission to be more than just a victim. Don't get me wrong, I still feel the weight of what happened, but... there's a glimmer of something else now. Hope, maybe? It's small, but it's there.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. What's your next step?",
    "Client: I think... I want to try engaging online again, in small steps. Maybe leave a positive comment on a friend's post, or share an article related to my work. It sounds small, but it feels like a mountain right now. But I want to try. I don't want to let fear control me anymore."
