    "Therapist: Welcome, Amir. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is dreading it. It's a strange mix of emotions.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start slowly. Can you close your eyes and bring yourself back to the day of the earthquake?",
    "Client: Okay... (takes a deep breath) I'm in my office. It's early morning, and I'm checking my emails. The sun is just starting to peek through the blinds.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: Suddenly, everything starts to shake. At first, I think it's just a truck passing by, but then... oh God, the shaking gets more intense. Papers are flying off my desk, and I can hear things crashing in the other room.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. My heart is racing, and I can't think straight. I'm frozen in my chair, gripping the armrests so tightly my knuckles are turning white.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 70. I can feel my palms getting sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (inhales deeply) Okay. The shaking is getting worse. I finally snap out of it and dive under my desk. I can hear people screaming outside. The windows are rattling so hard I think they might shatter.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking, \"This is it. I'm going to die here.\" I'm trying to call my daughter, but my hands are shaking so much I can't even unlock my phone.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The smell of dust... it's everywhere. And there's this awful creaking sound, like the building is about to collapse. I'm curled up in a ball, and I can feel tears streaming down my face.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Amir. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 85. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. Remember, you survived this. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) Right, right. I'm safe. Okay... the shaking starts to slow down. But I'm too scared to move. I can hear car alarms going off outside, and people crying.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I slowly crawl out from under the desk. My legs feel like jelly. I make my way to the window, and... oh my God. The street looks like a war zone. There are cracks in the pavement, cars smashed by fallen debris.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that image. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... helpless. Overwhelmed. There's so much destruction, and I don't know what to do. I'm worried about my daughter, my friends. Are they okay? Did their buildings collapse?",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. What happens after you look out the window?",
    "Client: I finally manage to call my daughter. My hands are shaking so much I can barely hold the phone. It rings and rings... God, those were the longest seconds of my life.",
    "Therapist: And then?",
    "Client: She answers. She's okay. I break down crying, right there in the middle of my wrecked office. I'm so relieved, but also still terrified.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 90. My heart is pounding just like it did that day.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're doing great, Amir. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I decide I need to get out of the building. I grab my phone and wallet and head for the stairs. The hallway is a mess, with pictures fallen off the walls and ceiling tiles on the floor.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice as you're leaving?",
    "Client: The smell of gas. It's faint, but it's there. I start moving faster, worried about a potential explosion. As I'm going down the stairs, there's an aftershock. I grip the railing, terrified I might fall.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: Tense. So tense. My muscles are aching from how tightly I'm holding myself. I'm sweating, and my mouth is dry. I feel like I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) Okay... I make it outside. The street is chaos. People are running, crying, hugging each other. I see a building down the street that's partially collapsed. There's dust everywhere, making it hard to breathe.",
    "Therapist: What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I start walking towards my daughter's apartment. It's about a mile away, but the streets are a mess. I have to climb over fallen trees, dodge around abandoned cars. I keep trying to call her again, but the cell networks are overloaded.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling as you make this journey?",
    "Client: Scared. So scared. But also determined. I need to get to her, to see with my own eyes that she's okay. Every aftershock makes me freeze in terror. I keep imagining buildings collapsing on me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Amir. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still at 90. My hands are shaking just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take another deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (breathes deeply) Right. Safe. Okay... I finally make it to her building. It's still standing, thank God. I rush up the stairs, calling her name. She meets me halfway, and we just... we just hold each other and cry.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Relief. Overwhelming relief. But also... guilt? I feel guilty for being so relieved when I know others weren't as lucky. And I'm still terrified. What if there's another big quake?",
    "Therapist: Those are all normal reactions. What happens next?",
    "Client: We... we decide to leave the city. We grab some clothes and water and start walking. The roads are too damaged for cars. It takes hours to get out of the city. We see so much destruction... collapsed buildings, fires, people injured...",
    "Therapist: How are you coping with these sights?",
    "Client: I... I'm trying to stay strong for my daughter. But inside, I'm a wreck. I keep thinking about how close we came to dying. How our whole lives could have been wiped out in seconds.",
    "Therapist: That's a heavy realization. How does it affect you now?",
    "Client: It's... it's changed everything. I have trouble sleeping. Loud noises make me jump. I'm always waiting for the ground to start shaking again. And now, with this cyberbullying situation... it feels like I can't escape disaster.",
    "Therapist: Can you elaborate on how the earthquake experience connects to the cyberbullying?",
    "Client: I... I guess it's the feeling of helplessness. During the quake, I couldn't control anything. Now, with these online attacks, I feel the same way. Like my world is crumbling around me, and I can't stop it.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful connection. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 75. Talking about it... it's hard, but it also helps, you know?",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Amir. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you tell me five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: Uh, okay. I see... the blue painting on the wall, your desk lamp, the bookshelf, the potted plant in the corner, and the clock on your desk.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, four things you can touch?",
    "Client: The armrest of this chair, my watch on my wrist, the fabric of my shirt, and... the coolness of the air from the AC.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Three things you can hear?",
    "Client: The ticking of the clock, a car passing outside, and... my own breathing.",
    "Therapist: Very good. Two things you can smell?",
    "Client: The faint scent of your air freshener and... coffee? Did you have coffee earlier?",
    "Therapist: Yes, I did. Lastly, one thing you can taste?",
    "Client: The mint from the gum I was chewing earlier.",
    "Therapist: Great job, Amir. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... more present. More grounded. My heart isn't racing as much.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's down to about 60 now. Still there, but... manageable.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today, Amir. How do you feel about the session?",
    "Client: It was tough. Really tough. But... I think it helped? I feel like I understand the connection between the earthquake and my current fears a bit better.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Remember, healing takes time. We'll continue to work through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I appreciate your help. It's not easy, but I'm glad I'm doing this.",
    "Therapist: You're very welcome, Amir. We'll end our session here for today. Remember to use the grounding techniques we practiced if you feel overwhelmed. I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you again. See you next week."
