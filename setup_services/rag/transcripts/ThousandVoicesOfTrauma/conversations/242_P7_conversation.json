    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the cyberbullying incident?",
    "Client: Okay... It started after I posted about my grandmother's passing on social media. I was really close to her, and her death hit me hard. I thought sharing would help me process it, but then these messages started coming in. At first, they were just insensitive comments, but then they got really cruel. People I didn't even know were saying horrible things about her, about me... It felt like I was losing her all over again, and I couldn't escape it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: The messages kept coming. Some people were sharing embarrassing photos of me from years ago, saying I didn't deserve to grieve. Others were making up stories about my grandmother, saying awful things about her life. I felt so exposed and vulnerable. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't focus on my studies. Every notification sound made my heart race. I wanted to defend myself and my grandmother's memory, but it felt like fighting against a tidal wave.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: It's hard to describe how helpless I felt. I tried blocking accounts, but new ones kept popping up. My friends tried to help, but it just seemed to make the bullies more aggressive. I started having nightmares about being chased by faceless people. During the day, I'd jump at every sound, thinking it was another notification. The worst part was feeling like I couldn't honor my grandmother's memory properly. Her death became tainted by all this negativity and hate.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I started to withdraw from everyone. I stopped going to classes, stopped answering calls from friends. I felt like I was drowning in this virtual world of hate, and I couldn't find my way out. The pain in my back, which I've had for years, got so much worse. It was like my body was carrying all this emotional weight. I felt so alone, so misunderstood. I kept thinking about my grandmother, wondering if she'd be disappointed in me for not being stronger.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: There were moments when I thought about... about ending it all. The cyberbullying felt never-ending, and I couldn't see a way out. I felt like I was letting my grandmother down, letting myself down. The chronic pain was a constant reminder of my stress. I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat. It was like the world had become this dark, hostile place, and I didn't belong anywhere in it.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (deep breath) It's still hard to talk about. Even now, I feel my heart racing, my palms getting sweaty. I keep expecting another cruel message to pop up. I know logically that it's over, but emotionally, I still feel trapped in that moment. I miss my grandmother so much, and I feel guilty for letting the cyberbullying overshadow her memory. Sometimes I still have nightmares about it, wake up in a cold sweat. It's like I can't fully escape it, even now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... shaky. My heart's racing, and I can feel that familiar ache in my back intensifying. Talking about it brings back all those feelings of helplessness and fear. But at the same time, there's a small part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I'm facing it head-on instead of running from it. It's still scary, but maybe not as overwhelming as it was before.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's strange, but talking about it like this, I can see how far I've come. I'm not that same terrified person anymore. I still have moments of fear and doubt, especially when I think about posting anything online. But I'm also angry - angry at those bullies for taking away what should have been a time of mourning and remembrance for my grandmother. I want to reclaim that, somehow. To honor her memory without fear. It's just... it's hard to know where to start.",
    "Therapist: You're making great progress. Let's continue.",
    "Client: I think... I think I want to start by sharing some positive memories of my grandmother online. Nothing big, just small things that made her special. Her favorite recipes, the silly jokes she used to tell, the way she always knew how to make me feel better. It scares me to think about putting myself out there again, but I also feel like it's important. Like it's a way of standing up to those bullies and saying, \"You don't get to take this from me.\" Is that... is that a good idea?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful approach. How does thinking about it make you feel?",
    "Client: It makes me feel nervous, definitely. There's still that fear that someone might say something cruel. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe hope? Like I'm taking back some control. And when I think about sharing those memories of my grandmother, I feel a warmth that I haven't felt in a long time. It's like I'm connecting with her again, in a way. I think she'd be proud of me for trying to move forward, for not letting the fear win. It's scary, but it also feels right.",
    "Therapist: You're showing real strength. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I really appreciate your support. It's been such a long journey, and there were times when I thought I'd never feel okay again. But being here, talking about it, facing it head-on - it's hard, but it's also empowering in a way. I'm starting to believe that maybe I can get through this, that I can find a way to honor my grandmother and reclaim my voice online. It won't be easy, and I know there will be setbacks, but for the first time in a long time, I feel like there's a path forward. And that... that feels really good.",
    "Therapist: You've made incredible progress today. How do you feel about ending our session?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've released something that's been weighing on me for so long. I'm nervous about what comes next, but I also feel more prepared to face it. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know we still have work to do, but I'm actually looking forward to our next session. Is it okay if I take a few minutes to just sit here and collect myself before I leave?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take all the time you need."
