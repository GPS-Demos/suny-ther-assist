    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's begin. Close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in my apartment. It's late afternoon, and I'm watching TV when suddenly everything starts shaking. The pictures on the wall are rattling, and I can hear things falling off shelves. I realize it's an earthquake, and I'm frozen in place, unsure what to do.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4. I can feel my heart rate picking up a bit.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: The shaking is getting stronger. I can hear car alarms going off outside, and there's a loud creaking noise coming from the walls. I'm starting to panic, thinking the building might collapse. I try to move, but my legs feel weak, and I'm shaking.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 6. My palms are sweaty, and I feel a tightness in my chest.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Keep going, you're doing well.",
    "Client: I finally manage to get up and stumble towards the doorway. I'm holding onto the frame, and I can see dust falling from the ceiling. There's a crash from the kitchen - I think it's the dishes falling. I'm terrified, thinking about all the stories I've heard about buildings pancaking in earthquakes. I... I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: How would you rate your SUDS at this point?",
    "Client: It's an 8 now. My heart is racing, and I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *takes a shaky breath* The shaking starts to subside, but I'm still frozen in place. I can hear sirens in the distance, and people shouting outside. I'm trembling all over, and I feel sick to my stomach. I want to call someone, anyone, but I can't make myself move. I'm just... overwhelmed with fear.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's still at an 8. I can feel tears in my eyes, just like that day.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I finally manage to move and look out the window. There's dust everywhere, and I can see some buildings have partially collapsed. People are running in the streets, and there's so much chaos. I feel a wave of guilt wash over me - I should be out there helping, but I'm paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's dropped to a 7. I think describing it is helping a little.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Continue with what happened next.",
    "Client: I finally manage to grab my phone and call my parents. My hands are shaking so much I can barely dial. When I hear my mom's voice, I break down crying. She's telling me to get out of the building, but I can't bring myself to move. I'm so scared there might be aftershocks.",
    "Therapist: How would you rate your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's back up to an 8. Remembering how helpless I felt... it's really intense.",
    "Therapist: I understand. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I eventually force myself to grab a bag and some essentials. Every little noise makes me jump. As I'm leaving the building, I see my neighbors. Some are crying, others look shell-shocked. We gather outside, and I can see smoke rising from downtown. It's like a scene from a disaster movie, but it's real, and I'm living it.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level at this point?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually gone down to a 6. Talking about it... it's helping me process it, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. My heart's still racing a bit, but I feel more in control. Describing it... it's like I'm facing it head-on instead of trying to avoid the memory.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Let's start winding down."
