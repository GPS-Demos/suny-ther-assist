    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to dive in, but there's this knot in my stomach. It's like I'm standing at the edge of a cliff, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. From 0 to 100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 40. It's there, but not overwhelming yet.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we're here together. Are you ready to begin the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in my apartment. It's early morning, and I can hear the rain pounding against the windows. The weather forecast had been talking about this storm for days, but I didn't think it would be this bad. The wind is howling, and I can hear things hitting the side of the building. I'm trying to stay calm, but my heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: The lights flicker, and then suddenly, everything goes dark. I fumble for my phone, and the emergency alert is blaring. Flash flood warning. Mandatory evacuation. I... I don't know what to do. I'm paralyzed.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. It's hard to breathe. I can feel my hands shaking.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's check your SUDS. Where are you now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 60 now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. You're doing great. Keep going. What happens after you see the alert?",
    "Client: I start throwing things into a bag. Clothes, my laptop, some photos. The wind is getting louder, and I can hear glass breaking somewhere in the building. I'm trying to call my girlfriend, but the cell service is spotty. I finally get through, and she's panicking too. She lives closer to the river, and the water is already rising.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you saying to her?",
    "Client: I'm telling her to get out, to go to higher ground. But she's crying, saying she can't leave her cat. I'm yelling at her to forget the cat, to just go. God, I feel so helpless. I should be there with her.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember to breathe. How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 75. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: I know it is. You're very brave. What happens next?",
    "Client: I grab my bag and run down the stairs. The hallway is dark, and I can hear other people panicking. When I get outside, it's chaos. The rain is so heavy I can barely see. Cars are honking, people are shouting. I start running towards her place, but the streets are already flooding. I'm wading through knee-deep water, and it's rising fast.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that image. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: There's debris everywhere. Tree branches, trash cans, even a mailbox floating by. The current is getting stronger, and I'm struggling to keep my balance. I can hear sirens in the distance, but they sound so far away. I'm terrified, but I keep pushing forward.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My heart feels like it's going to burst out of my chest.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a moment. Breathe with me. In... and out. Where's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 85. This is intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Do you want to continue?",
    "Client: Yeah, I need to get through this.",
    "Therapist: Okay. What happens as you're moving through the water?",
    "Client: I finally make it to her street, but it's... it's like a river now. I can see her building, but the first floor is already underwater. I'm screaming her name, but the wind is so loud. Then I see her. She's on the roof of a car, clutching her cat carrier. She looks terrified.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that image. What do you do?",
    "Client: I'm trying to get to her, but the current is too strong. I'm yelling at her to stay put, that help is coming. But then I see this huge wave of water coming down the street. It's... it's like a wall. I scream at her to hold on, but the wave hits and... and... (starts sobbing)",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, John. You're safe here. What are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel so guilty. So helpless. I couldn't save her. I couldn't do anything.",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault, John. You did everything you could. Let's check your SUDS. Where are you now?",
    "Client: It's... it's at 95. I can't... I can't do this.",
    "Therapist: You can, John. You're incredibly strong. Let's ground ourselves for a moment. Feel your feet on the floor. Take a deep breath. What do you smell in this room?",
    "Client: I... I smell coffee. And maybe some kind of air freshener?",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, can you continue? What happens after the wave hits?",
    "Client: Everything is a blur. I'm being swept away by the current. I manage to grab onto a lamppost, but I can't see her anymore. I'm screaming her name, but there's no answer. Just the roar of the water and the wind. I don't know how long I'm there, holding on for dear life. Eventually, a rescue boat finds me. They pull me in, but I'm hysterical, trying to make them go back for her.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, John. Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: They take me to a shelter. It's crowded, noisy, and I'm in shock. I keep trying to call her, but there's no service. Days pass, and I'm searching every shelter, every hospital. But... but I never find her. They eventually find her body, washed up miles downstream. Her cat, too. I... I couldn't save them. I failed her.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, John. You're here, you're safe. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... empty. Drained. Like I've lived through it all over again.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've done incredibly well. What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 70. I'm exhausted, but... I feel like I've let some of it out.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress, John. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves. Can you tell me three things you see in this room?",
    "Client: I see... your desk lamp. The painting on the wall. And the plant in the corner.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, two things you can hear?",
    "Client: I hear the clock ticking. And traffic outside.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Lastly, one thing you can feel?",
    "Client: I can feel the softness of this chair.",
    "Therapist: Well done, John. You've shown incredible strength today. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. But there's a part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've shared some of the weight.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive sign. Remember, healing is a process. We'll continue to work through this together. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we end today's session?",
    "Client: I just... I want to thank you. For being here with me through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm finally facing it instead of running away.",
    "Therapist: You're very welcome, John. Your courage is admirable. We'll pick this up in our next session. For now, be kind to yourself. You've done important work today."
