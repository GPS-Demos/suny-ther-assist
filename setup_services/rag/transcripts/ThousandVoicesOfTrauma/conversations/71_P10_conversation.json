    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. Knowing we're going to dive into this topic has my stomach in knots. But I'm here, and I want to face this.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0-100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 60. My palms are sweaty, and my heart's racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we can pause anytime. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that moment. Describe what you see, hear, and feel.",
    "Client: I... I'm in the school hallway. It's loud, kids everywhere. I can smell the musty scent of old lockers and feel the cool metal against my back as I try to make myself invisible. There's a group of girls approaching, led by Melissa. My heart's pounding in my ears.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: Melissa spots me. Her lips curl into this cruel smirk. She whispers something to her friends, and they all laugh. I want to disappear. They're getting closer, and I can't breathe. My chest feels so tight.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 75. God, this feels so real.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here. What do they do when they reach you?",
    "Client: Melissa slams her hand against the locker next to my head. I flinch. She leans in close, her breath hot on my face. \"Hey, little mouse,\" she sneers. \"Heard you've been talking to Jake. Think you're good enough for him?\" The others giggle. I can't look at them. I'm staring at the floor, willing it to swallow me whole.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My legs are shaking. I feel so small, so powerless. There's this knot in my throat, and I'm fighting back tears. I don't want to cry in front of them. That'll only make it worse.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. What happens next?",
    "Client: Melissa grabs my chin, forces me to look at her. Her nails dig into my skin. \"Answer me when I'm talking to you,\" she hisses. I try to speak, but nothing comes out. One of her friends laughs, \"Cat got your tongue, mouse?\" They all find this hilarious. I'm drowning in shame and fear.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. You're safe here. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's 85 now. This is intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... Melissa lets go of my chin, but then she grabs my backpack. She unzips it and starts pulling out my books, my papers. They scatter across the floor. \"Oops,\" she says with fake innocence. \"Clumsy me.\" The bell rings, but they don't move. Everyone else is rushing to class, stepping on my things. I'm frozen, I can't move.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in that moment?",
    "Client: I... I'm thinking, \"Why me? What did I do to deserve this?\" I feel so helpless, so alone. I want to fight back, to scream, but I'm paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: Melissa leans in close again. She whispers, \"Stay away from Jake, or things will get much worse.\" Then she turns and walks away, her friends following like obedient puppies. I'm left there, surrounded by my scattered belongings, fighting back tears. People are staring, but no one helps. I feel so exposed, so humiliated.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My chest feels tight. But I'm also angry. Why didn't anyone help me? Why couldn't I stand up for myself?",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel angry. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's still around 85. This memory... it's so vivid.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. What do you do after they leave?",
    "Client: I... I slowly start gathering my things. My hands are trembling so much I can barely hold onto anything. I'm trying so hard not to cry, but tears are blurring my vision. I'm late for class now, which only adds to my anxiety. I feel like everyone's eyes are on me, judging me, pitying me. I want to run away, to hide, but I force myself to keep picking up my stuff.",
    "Therapist: You're showing strength. How does your body feel?",
    "Client: My shoulders are hunched, like I'm trying to make myself as small as possible. My stomach is in knots. I feel nauseous, like I might throw up. My face is burning with humiliation.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What happens as you finish gathering your things?",
    "Client: I... I stuff everything haphazardly into my backpack. I don't care if it's organized anymore. I just want to get out of there. As I stand up, I catch a glimpse of my reflection in a nearby window. My face is red, eyes puffy. I look pathetic, and I hate myself for it. I take a deep breath, trying to compose myself, but it comes out shaky. I head to class, knowing I'll be marked late, dreading the attention it'll bring.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's going through your mind as you walk to class?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm replaying what Melissa said. About Jake. Part of me wants to defy her, to talk to him anyway. But the fear... it's overwhelming. I'm imagining all the ways they could make my life worse. I feel trapped, cornered. And I'm angry at myself for letting them have this power over me. But I don't know how to stop it.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid feelings. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 75. Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also releasing something.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Let's continue. What happens when you reach the classroom?",
    "Client: I... I hesitate outside the door. My hand's on the handle, but I can't bring myself to turn it. I can hear the teacher's voice inside, the scratch of pencils. My heart's racing again. I know all eyes will turn to me when I walk in. I consider skipping class, hiding in the bathroom. But then I think about how disappointed my parents would be if they knew I skipped. So I take a deep breath and open the door.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel as you enter?",
    "Client: Exposed. Vulnerable. Like I'm on a stage and everyone can see right through me. The teacher stops mid-sentence. \"Nice of you to join us, Sarah,\" she says. There's a hint of annoyance in her voice. I mumble an apology and hurry to my seat, keeping my eyes on the floor. I can feel people staring, hear a few snickers. My face is burning again.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I sit down, trying to make myself as small as possible. I fumble with my backpack, pulling out my textbook and notebook. My hands are still shaking. I can hear Melissa and her friends whispering and giggling a few rows behind me. I know they're talking about me. I try to focus on what the teacher's saying, but the words just wash over me. All I can think about is how I'll get through the rest of the day, how I'll face this again tomorrow.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. How are you feeling right now, in this room with me?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. My heart's still racing a bit, but I feel... lighter somehow. Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 65. It's still there, but it's not as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well, Sarah. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end the exposure.",
    "Client: Okay. *takes several deep breaths* Thank you. This was hard, but... I think it helped.",
    "Therapist: You showed a lot of courage today. How are you feeling about what we've accomplished?",
    "Client: I feel... proud, I guess. And a little surprised at how vivid it all still is. But talking about it, facing it head-on... it's like I'm taking back some control. It still hurts, but it doesn't feel as suffocating as it did before.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent insight, Sarah. You've made significant progress today. Let's end here and discuss how you can use these experiences to continue healing."
