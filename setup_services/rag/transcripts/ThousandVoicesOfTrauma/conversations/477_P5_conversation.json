    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this session all week. The idea of revisiting that car accident makes my stomach churn. I know we've talked about doing this, but now that it's here, I'm not sure I can go through with it.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel anxious. Remember, you're in control.",
    "Client: Am I really, though? I feel like once we start, I'll be swept away by the memories. What if I can't handle it? What if I completely fall apart?",
    "Therapist: You're stronger than you think. We'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: I appreciate that, but... I'm worried about how I'll react. Last time I even thought about the accident, I had nightmares for days. I'm afraid this will make things worse instead of better.",
    "Therapist: Facing fears often leads to relief. What concerns you most?",
    "Client: I guess... I'm scared of feeling that helplessness again. Of reliving the moment of impact, the sound of metal crunching, the pain... And then there's the guilt. I survived when others didn't. It's overwhelming to think about.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. This process helps reduce their power.",
    "Client: I understand that logically, but emotionally, it's terrifying. How exactly will this help? And what if I freeze up or can't continue?",
    "Therapist: We'll pause if needed. The goal is processing, not re-traumatizing.",
    "Client: Okay... I think I can try. But can you tell me more about what to expect? How long will we do this for? And what should I do if it becomes too much?",
    "Therapist: We'll start with 15-20 minutes. Use our agreed signal if overwhelmed.",
    "Client: Alright, I can probably manage that. It's not too long. I'll try to remember our signal if things get intense. I just hope this really does help in the long run. I'm tired of feeling haunted by this accident.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. I'm still nervous, but I trust you. And I want to get better. Just... please stay with me through this, okay? I don't want to feel alone with these memories.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'm here with you every step. Ready?",
    "Client: As ready as I'll ever be, I guess. Let's do this before I lose my nerve. Just remember, if I start to panic or seem too distressed, please help me ground myself. I'm counting on you to keep me safe through this.",
    "Therapist: You can trust me. Let's start gently..."
