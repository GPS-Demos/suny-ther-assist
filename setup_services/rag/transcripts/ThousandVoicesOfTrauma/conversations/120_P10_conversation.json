    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling about our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. This whole cyber bullying situation has really been getting to me lately. It's bringing up a lot of old feelings from... you know, the physical abuse I experienced years ago. I'm not sure I'm ready for this, but I know we need to do it.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's start slowly. Can you close your eyes and describe where you are when the cyber bullying begins?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm, um, in my apartment. It's late evening, and I'm sitting on my couch with my laptop. I've just finished a long day at work, and I thought I'd check my social media before bed. That's when I see it...",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you see?",
    "Client: There's a message... no, several messages. They're from an anonymous account. The words are so hateful, calling me ugly, worthless... saying I should kill myself. My heart starts racing, and I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 70. God, it feels so real.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I can't look away from the screen. My hands are shaking, and I feel this overwhelming sense of shame. It's like I'm back in that house, with him towering over me, calling me worthless... I want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Can you ground yourself?",
    "Client: Right, um... I can feel the couch beneath me. My feet are on the carpet. I'm here, not there.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue with what's happening.",
    "Client: I scroll through more messages. They're getting worse, more threatening. Someone's posted an old photo of me, from before... before I left him. I look so scared in it. The comments are brutal. I feel exposed, vulnerable. My chest tightens, and I'm struggling to breathe again.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 85. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Maria. Stay with it. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... I'm thinking maybe they're right. Maybe I am worthless. I survived the abuse, but for what? To be humiliated like this? I feel so alone, so trapped. I want to respond, to defend myself, but I'm paralyzed.",
    "Therapist: Remember, these are just thoughts. You've overcome so much.",
    "Client: You're right... I... I close the laptop. But I can't stop shaking. I curl up on the couch, hugging my knees to my chest. I feel like that scared little girl again, hiding from him. The room feels so dark, so oppressive.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I reach for my phone. I want to call someone, anyone. But who would understand? Who would believe me? I feel so isolated. Tears are streaming down my face now. I can't stop them.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to cry. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still at 85. I feel like I can't escape this feeling.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I start having flashbacks. Not just of the cyber bullying, but of him. The times he'd hit me, tell me I was nothing without him. The messages online blur with his voice in my head. I feel so small, so powerless.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. Can you remind yourself of that?",
    "Client: I'm trying... I'm safe. I'm in my apartment. He can't hurt me anymore. But these messages... they make me feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Keep describing what's happening.",
    "Client: I... I can't sleep. I toss and turn all night, checking my phone compulsively. Every notification makes me jump. By morning, I'm exhausted, but I have to go to work. I feel like a zombie, going through the motions.",
    "Therapist: How does this affect your day?",
    "Client: I can't concentrate at work. I keep thinking everyone knows, that they're judging me. I flinch when my coworker touches my shoulder. I feel like I'm falling apart, but I have to keep it together.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 75. Talking about work... it helps ground me a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Continue with your day.",
    "Client: I... I make it through somehow. But when I get home, I'm terrified to check my messages. I know there will be more. Part of me wants to delete all my accounts, to disappear. But another part feels like I need to know what they're saying.",
    "Therapist: What do you decide to do?",
    "Client: I... I check. And it's worse. Someone's threatening to share more photos, to contact my work. I feel like I'm drowning. I can't breathe. I start to have a panic attack.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe with me. In... and out.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... okay. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I finally break down and call a friend. I'm sobbing, I can barely get the words out. But she listens. She tells me it's not my fault, that I don't deserve this. For a moment, I feel less alone.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a relief. But I'm also embarrassed. I feel like I should be stronger, like I should be able to handle this on my own.",
    "Therapist: It takes strength to reach out. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 65. Talking to my friend... it helped.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What do you do after the call?",
    "Client: I... I decide to report the messages. It's scary, but I know I need to do something. I document everything, take screenshots. It feels like I'm taking back some control.",
    "Therapist: How does that feel?",
    "Client: It's empowering, but also terrifying. What if they retaliate? What if it gets worse? I'm shaking as I submit the reports, but I also feel a tiny bit proud of myself.",
    "Therapist: That's a big step. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Emotionally drained. But also... maybe a little hopeful? Like maybe I can get through this.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 50 now. Still anxious, but... better.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well, Maria. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves before we end.",
    "Client: Okay... I can feel my feet on the floor. My hands on the armrests. I'm here, in your office. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Very good. How are you feeling about this session?",
    "Client: It was really hard, but... I feel like I've faced something important. Like maybe I'm stronger than I thought.",
    "Therapist: You absolutely are. We'll end here for today. You've shown remarkable courage."
