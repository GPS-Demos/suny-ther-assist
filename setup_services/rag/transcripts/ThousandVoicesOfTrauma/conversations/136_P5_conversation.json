    "Therapist: Welcome, Leilani. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been thinking a lot about our last session and the racial trauma we discussed. It's been bringing up a lot of memories from my time in school.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you familiar with this?",
    "Client: Not really. I mean, I've heard the term, but I'm not sure what it involves. Is it going to be intense?",
    "Therapist: It can be challenging, but I'll guide you through it. Shall I explain more?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I'd like to know what I'm getting into.",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit your bullying experiences in detail. This helps process the trauma. How does that sound?",
    "Client: Honestly, it sounds scary. I've spent so long trying to avoid thinking about those times. The idea of purposely bringing them up... it makes my stomach churn. But I trust you, and if you think this will help, I'm willing to try.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. What concerns you most about this?",
    "Client: I'm worried about falling apart, I guess. What if I can't handle it? What if I start crying and can't stop? Or what if I get so angry I lose control? Being a mature student is already challenging enough without adding this emotional turmoil.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. We'll go at your pace, and you can pause anytime. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's reassuring. It helps to know I have some control over the process. Can you tell me more about what exactly we'll be doing?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount a specific bullying incident in detail, including thoughts and feelings. I'll guide you through it.",
    "Client: Okay, that makes sense. Will we be doing this every session from now on?",
    "Therapist: We'll do it regularly, but not every session. It's part of a broader treatment plan.",
    "Client: I see. I appreciate you taking the time to explain this to me. It's still nerve-wracking, but I feel more prepared now. I just hope I can get through it without completely breaking down.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel overwhelmed. Remember, you're safe here. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do this. I know it won't be easy, but if it helps me move past these experiences and cope better with my depression, it'll be worth it. Where do we start?",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes, take a deep breath, and think back to a specific bullying incident. Describe what you see.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in the school cafeteria. I can smell the food, hear the chatter. I'm sitting alone, trying to eat my lunch quietly. A group of girls approaches...",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue describing what happens. Remember, you're safe here."
