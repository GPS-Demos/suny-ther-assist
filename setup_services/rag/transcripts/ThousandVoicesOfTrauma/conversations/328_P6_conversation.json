    "Therapist: Welcome back, Mr. Patel. Are you ready to continue our imaginal exposure exercise focusing on the animal attack?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with your SUDS rating. How distressed do you feel right now, on a scale of 0 to 100?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 40. My heart's beating a bit faster just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day. Describe what you see.",
    "Client: I'm at the park near my house. It's a sunny afternoon, and I can hear children playing in the distance. I'm walking on the path, enjoying the fresh air, when suddenly I hear growling...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: A large dog, I think it's a Rottweiler, comes charging at me from behind some bushes. Its teeth are bared, and it's snarling. I freeze, unable to move...",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to about 60. My palms are sweating, and I feel tightness in my chest.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The dog lunges at me, and I instinctively raise my arm to protect myself. I feel a sharp pain as its teeth sink into my forearm. I'm screaming, but it feels like no sound is coming out...",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My arm is tingling, almost burning. My throat feels tight, and I'm starting to feel dizzy.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 75 now. This feels so real.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm on the ground now, trying to protect my face. The dog is still attacking, biting at my legs. I can smell its hot breath, hear its growls... Then I hear someone shouting, running towards us...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Terrified. Helpless. I... I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Remember your breathing exercises. Slow, deep breaths. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm trying. The person, I think it's the dog's owner, is pulling it away. But I'm just lying there, shaking, in so much pain...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's at 85. This is... it's really intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Stay with it if you can.",
    "Client: I'm being helped up. My clothes are torn, there's blood... I can see people gathering around, someone's calling an ambulance. I feel so embarrassed, so vulnerable...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, in this moment?",
    "Client: Shaky. My heart's racing. But... but I also feel a bit of relief. Like I've faced it.",
    "Therapist: That's great. What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's coming down a bit. Maybe 70?",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Open your eyes when you're ready.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay, I'm back.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel?",
    "Client: Drained, but... okay. Like I've accomplished something.",
    "Therapist: You have. You did wonderfully. Let's talk about what you experienced."
