    "Therapist: Alright, let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Can you describe the accident and give me your initial SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm sitting in my car at a red light. It's a sunny afternoon. I see the truck coming in my rearview mirror, but it's not slowing down. My heart starts racing. I grip the steering wheel tightly. The impact is sudden and violent. My head snaps back, then forward. There's a loud crash, the sound of metal crumpling. I feel dizzy, disoriented. People are shouting outside. I'm... I'm trapped in the car. I can't move my legs. The pain is excruciating. I'm... I'm terrified. SUDS is probably an 8 right now.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. Remember, you're safe here. Take a deep breath. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The airbag has deployed. There's a chemical smell. I hear sirens in the distance. Someone's at my window, asking if I'm okay. I try to speak, but I can only manage a groan. The pain is overwhelming. I'm worried about permanent damage. What if I can't walk again? What about work? My family? The fear is... it's consuming me. I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How would you rate your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe a 9. My hands are shaking just thinking about it. I can almost feel the pain again.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're safe here. Keep going if you can.",
    "Client: The firefighters are using the jaws of life to get me out. The sound of metal being cut is deafening. I'm trying to stay calm, but I'm in so much pain. They're talking to me, telling me to stay still. I'm scared they might hurt me more while getting me out. Finally, they extract me. The sunlight is blinding. I'm placed on a stretcher. The movement causes a sharp pain in my back. I cry out. The paramedics are working quickly, asking me questions. I can barely focus to answer. The ambulance ride is a blur of sirens and fear.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7. My heart is still racing, but I feel a little more in control.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're doing great. Let's continue.",
    "Client: At the hospital, everything is chaotic. Doctors and nurses are everywhere. They're cutting off my clothes, attaching monitors. The pain is constant. I hear them talking about possible spinal injuries. I'm terrified. They're preparing me for scans. I'm alone, scared, in pain. I keep thinking about my family, wondering if anyone has told them. The not knowing is almost as bad as the pain. Hours pass in a haze of tests and questions. Finally, a doctor comes to tell me the results. I have multiple fractures, but no spinal cord damage. The relief is overwhelming, but so is the realization of the long recovery ahead.",
    "Therapist: You've been very brave. How would you rate your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about a 5. Talking about it... it's helping. It's still hard, but I feel... I don't know, maybe a bit stronger?",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How are you feeling physically right now?",
    "Client: My muscles are tense, especially in my shoulders and jaw. I notice I'm clenching my fists. But my breathing is steadier now. I feel... drained, but also a bit lighter.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're processing the memory. Would you like to continue?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. The days in the hospital blur together. Pain, medication, physical therapy. Visitors come and go. I'm frustrated by my lack of mobility, angry at the driver who hit me. But there's also gratitude - for surviving, for the support of my family and friends. As I start to recover, I realize how close I came to losing everything. It's... it's overwhelming sometimes.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: I'd say it's down to a 3. Talking about it... it's still difficult, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming as before.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. How do you feel about what we've done today?",
    "Client: I feel... tired, but also somewhat relieved. It's like... like I've been carrying this weight for so long, and now it's a little lighter. I didn't think I could talk about it like this without falling apart.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great strength. We'll end here for today. Well done."
