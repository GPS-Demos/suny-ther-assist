    "Therapist: Welcome back, James. Today we'll continue with our imaginal exposure exercise. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so, yes. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control. Let's start with your baseline SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10. My stomach feels a bit tight.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that memory. Describe what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in my childhood home. The air feels heavy, and I can smell alcohol. My uncle is there, and he's... he's coming towards me. My heart is starting to race.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's happening now?",
    "Client: He's... touching me. I feel frozen, like I can't move. My skin is crawling, and I want to scream, but no sound comes out. It's like I'm trapped in my own body.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 7. Maybe even an 8. I feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I can hear my aunt in the other room. She's watching TV, oblivious to what's happening. I want to call out to her, but I'm terrified. My uncle is whispering that this is our secret. I feel so ashamed and dirty.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking. I can feel sweat on my forehead. It's like I'm right back there, and I hate it. But... but I also feel a strange sense of relief. Like I'm finally acknowledging what happened.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's still high... maybe a 9. I feel overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I remember the sound of a car pulling up outside. My uncle quickly moves away, straightening his clothes. I'm left there, feeling confused and violated. I want to run, but my legs won't move.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I can smell his aftershave. It makes me nauseous even now. I hear footsteps, and suddenly my aunt walks in. She looks at me strangely, like she knows something's wrong, but she doesn't say anything. I feel so alone and betrayed.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually dropping a bit. Maybe a 7 now. I feel angry at my aunt for not noticing, for not helping me.",
    "Therapist: That anger is valid. Keep going.",
    "Client: I remember running to my room and locking the door. I curl up on my bed, hugging my knees to my chest. I can hear muffled voices downstairs, but I can't make out what they're saying. I feel so small and powerless.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm starting to feel a bit calmer. Like I'm observing the memory rather than reliving it. My breathing is slowing down.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 5 now. I still feel shaky, but not as overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's continue.",
    "Client: I remember lying in bed that night, unable to sleep. Every sound made me jump. I kept replaying what happened, wondering if it was my fault somehow. I felt so confused and scared.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: It's... it's strange. As I talk about it, I can feel my younger self's pain, but I also feel a sense of compassion for him. I want to tell him it wasn't his fault.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 3, I think. I feel... I feel sad, but also a bit stronger.",
    "Therapist: You've done well. Let's start to bring you back to the present.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm... I'm opening my eyes now. The room feels brighter somehow. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a bit lighter?",
    "Therapist: That's common. How do you feel overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... okay. Like I've faced something I've been running from for a long time.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible courage today, James."
