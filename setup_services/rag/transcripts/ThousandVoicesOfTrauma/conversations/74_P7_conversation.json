    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the combat experience you mentioned last time?",
    "Client: (Taking a deep breath) Okay... It was a hot day in Afghanistan. We were on patrol in a small village. The air was thick with dust, and there was an eerie silence. I remember feeling tense, my fingers wrapped tightly around my rifle. Suddenly, there was a loud explosion. I felt the ground shake beneath my feet, and then... chaos erupted.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: People were screaming. I saw one of my squad mates go down. There was blood... so much blood. I froze for a moment, my heart pounding in my chest. Then training kicked in, and I started moving towards cover, trying to locate the source of the attack.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The smell... it was overwhelming. Burning metal, gunpowder, and something else... something sickly sweet. I realized it was the smell of burning flesh. I felt bile rise in my throat, but I had to push it down. We were under heavy fire now.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Voice shaking) I... I saw civilians caught in the crossfire. There was a woman, holding a child. They were both... they didn't make it. I couldn't help them. I had to keep moving, had to focus on the mission, but their faces... I can't forget their faces.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel emotional. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Breathing heavily) I remember the sound of bullets whizzing past my head. My ears were ringing from the explosion. I was shouting orders, trying to regroup our squad. We needed to get out of there, but we couldn't leave our wounded behind.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take your time.",
    "Client: I ran to my fallen squad mate. He was barely conscious, blood pooling around him. I grabbed him, started dragging him to safety. My arms burned with the effort, and I could feel warm blood soaking through my uniform. I wasn't sure if it was his or mine.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) I... I feel like I'm back there. My heart is racing, and I can almost smell the gunpowder. But... I also feel a little safer, knowing I'm actually here with you. It's... it's hard to describe.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're doing well.",
    "Client: As we were retreating, I heard more explosions. The village was being destroyed. I couldn't help but think about the lives being lost, the homes being shattered. We made it to the extraction point, but the guilt... the guilt of surviving when others didn't... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. You're processing it now.",
    "Client: (Wiping tears) The ride back to base was silent. Everyone was in shock. I kept replaying the events in my mind, wondering if I could have done something differently, saved more people. When we landed, the reality of what happened hit me hard. I broke down, right there on the tarmac.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. But also, somehow lighter? Like sharing this burden has lifted some of the weight. It's still painful, but it feels a little less overwhelming now.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. We'll end here for today.",
    "Client: Thank you. This isn't easy, but I think it's helping. I appreciate your support through this process.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. We'll continue next session."
