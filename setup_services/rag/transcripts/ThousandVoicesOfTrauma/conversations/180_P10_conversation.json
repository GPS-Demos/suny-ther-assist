    "Therapist: Good morning, Mr. Singh. How are you feeling today as we begin our imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: Ah, good morning, Dr. Roberts. I'm... well, I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. My hands are a bit clammy, and there's this tightness in my chest. I know we've talked about this, but actually facing these memories... it's daunting.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here together. Can you rate your distress on the SUDS scale?",
    "Client: I'd say... maybe a 6 out of 10? It's not overwhelming, but definitely noticeable.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Let's start with some deep breaths. When you're ready, begin describing the day you lost your father.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Alright... It was a Tuesday morning. I remember because I always visited Dad on Tuesdays. The care home called just as I was about to leave. They said... they said he'd taken a turn for the worse overnight. I... I felt my stomach drop. (Pauses)",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that moment. What happened next?",
    "Client: I... I grabbed my keys and rushed out. The drive there was a blur. I kept thinking, \"Please, let him be okay.\" But deep down, I knew... (voice wavers) I knew this might be it.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My heart's racing. It's like I'm back in that car, gripping the steering wheel so tight my knuckles turned white.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Inhales deeply) Okay... I arrived at the care home. The receptionist's face said it all. She just pointed to Dad's room. I... I hesitated outside the door. I could hear the beeping of machines inside. God, I hated that sound. (Pauses)",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What happened when you entered the room?",
    "Client: I pushed the door open, and... there he was. So small in that bed. His eyes were closed, and his breathing was so shallow. I... I rushed to his side, took his hand. It was cold. (Voice breaks) I kept saying, \"Dad, I'm here. I'm here, Dad.\"",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What were you thinking?",
    "Client: I... I was thinking about all the things I never said. All the times I was too busy to visit. I felt... I felt so guilty. And scared. I didn't want to lose him.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's higher. Maybe an 8?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Take a few deep breaths. Remember, you're here in my office, safe.",
    "Client: (Breathes deeply) Thank you... I'm okay. I can continue.",
    "Therapist: Alright. What happened next?",
    "Client: The nurse came in. She checked his vitals and gave me this look... pity, I think. She said, \"It won't be long now.\" I... I felt like screaming. How could she be so calm? My world was falling apart! (Voice rises)",
    "Therapist: I hear the anger in your voice. It's okay to feel that.",
    "Client: (Sighs) Yeah... I was angry. And terrified. I sat there for hours, just holding his hand. Talking to him about... about everything. Childhood memories, recent news... anything. I don't know if he could hear me, but... I needed him to know I was there.",
    "Therapist: How did your body feel during those hours?",
    "Client: Tense. So tense. My back ached, but I couldn't move. I was afraid if I let go of his hand, he'd... he'd slip away.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Can you describe the moment he passed?",
    "Client: (Long pause) It... it was so quiet. The machines had been beeping all day, but suddenly... silence. His chest just... stopped moving. I... I called for the nurse, but I knew. He was gone. (Starts to cry)",
    "Therapist: It's okay to cry. Let those emotions out. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Crying) I... I wasn't ready. We had so much left unsaid. I kept thinking about all the times I was too busy, too caught up in my own life to visit more often. The guilt... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe with me. In... and out.",
    "Client: (Breathing slowly) Thank you... I'm... I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: What happened after he passed?",
    "Client: It's all a blur. The nurse came in, confirmed what I already knew. I remember sitting there, still holding his hand, for what felt like hours. I couldn't let go. It was like... if I let go, it would make it real.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, in this moment?",
    "Client: Sad. So incredibly sad. But... also a bit lighter? Like... like I'm finally letting some of this out.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Can you give me a SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe a 7 now? It's still intense, but not as overwhelming as before.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's continue. What happened when you left the care home?",
    "Client: I... I remember walking to my car. The sun was setting. It felt wrong, somehow. How could the world just go on when my father was gone? I sat in my car for a long time before I could drive. I didn't want to go home and face telling my wife.",
    "Therapist: What were you thinking during that drive home?",
    "Client: I kept replaying moments with Dad. Good ones, bad ones. I thought about how he taught me to ride a bike, how proud he was when I got my first job. But also... the arguments we had. The times I disappointed him. It was like my whole life with him was flashing before my eyes.",
    "Therapist: Those are important memories. How do they make you feel now?",
    "Client: Nostalgic, I suppose. And regretful. I wish... I wish I had more time. To say all the things I never said.",
    "Therapist: It's common to feel that way. What happened when you got home?",
    "Client: I... I sat in the driveway for a while. I could see my wife through the window, waiting. She knew something was wrong the moment I walked in. I... I couldn't even speak. I just shook my head, and she... she held me as I cried.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a powerful moment. How did it feel to be held?",
    "Client: Safe, I guess. Like I could finally let go. But also... guilty. I felt like I should be stronger, for her, for my family.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to need support. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. Emotionally and physically. But... also a bit relieved? Like I've finally faced this memory head-on.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. Can you give me a final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: I'd say... maybe a 5 now? It's still there, but not as intense.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today, Mr. Singh. How do you feel about the session?",
    "Client: It was... hard. Really hard. But I think... I think it was necessary. I've been carrying this for so long, it feels good to talk about it.",
    "Therapist: I'm proud of the work you've done today. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later. We'll process this more in our next session.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Roberts. I... I appreciate your guidance through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care of yourself, and I'll see you next week."
