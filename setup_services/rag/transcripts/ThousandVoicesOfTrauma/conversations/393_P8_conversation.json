    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. I can still feel the tension in my shoulders, you know? It's like I'm right back there, in that moment, and I can't shake it off.",
    "Therapist: Hmm. What physical sensations are you noticing right now?",
    "Client: My heart is still pounding. I can feel it in my chest, like it's trying to break free. My hands are clammy, and there's this tightness in my throat. It's hard to swallow. I keep thinking about how helpless I felt during the divorce, and it's bringing back memories of... of the abuse. It's all mixed up in my head.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts are coming up for you?",
    "Client: I keep hearing his voice, telling me I'm worthless. It's like a broken record. And then I think about my ex-wife leaving, and I wonder if she saw the same thing in me. Was I not good enough? Did I deserve what happened to me as a child? These thoughts, they're suffocating me.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. How are you coping with these thoughts?",
    "Client: I'm trying to breathe, like we practiced. In through the nose, out through the mouth. But it's hard. I feel like I'm drowning in memories and self-doubt. Part of me wants to run away, to forget it all. But another part knows I need to face this. It's just... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I think I need reassurance. That I'm safe now. That what happened wasn't my fault. It's strange, you know? I'm a 70-year-old man, successful in my career, but right now I feel like that scared little boy again. I need to know that it's okay to feel this way, that I'm not weak for struggling with this.",
    "Therapist: It is okay. You're incredibly brave for facing this. What else?",
    "Client: I need to remind myself that I've survived. That I've built a life despite everything. My marriage ending doesn't erase that. The abuse doesn't define me. But it's so hard to believe that sometimes, especially when these memories are so vivid. I can almost smell the room where it happened...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What do you see around you right now?",
    "Client: I see... I see your office. The green plant in the corner. The sunlight coming through the window. My wedding ring on my finger... It grounds me, reminds me of the good years with my wife, even if it ended. It's a reminder that I can love and be loved.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with those present sensations. How does that feel?",
    "Client: It feels... calming. Like I'm coming back to myself. The memories are still there, but they're not as overwhelming. I'm starting to feel the weight lift a little from my chest. It's like... like I'm resurfacing after being underwater for too long.",
    "Therapist: That's great. What are you learning about yourself through this process?",
    "Client: I'm learning that I'm stronger than I thought. That I can face these memories and survive. It's painful, God, it's so painful. But I'm doing it. I'm also realizing how much the abuse and the divorce are connected in my mind. They both make me feel... abandoned, I guess. Unwanted. But I'm starting to see that those feelings aren't the truth. They're just... echoes of the past.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization impact you?",
    "Client: It's... liberating, in a way. Scary, but liberating. If these feelings aren't the truth, then maybe I can change them. Maybe I can learn to see myself differently. It's like... like I've been carrying this heavy backpack all my life, and I'm just now realizing I can take it off. I don't know how yet, but just knowing it's possible... it gives me hope.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What do you want to remember from this session?",
    "Client: I want to remember that I'm not alone in this. That it's okay to struggle, but also okay to hope. I want to remember the feeling of coming back to the present, of grounding myself. And I want to remember that my past doesn't define my future. It's part of me, yes, but it's not all of me. I'm more than what happened to me. I'm... I'm still learning who I am, at 70. And that's okay.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How do you feel about ending our session here?",
    "Client: I think... I think that's good. I feel drained, but in a good way. Like I've done important work. Thank you for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I'm grateful for the opportunity to heal. Can we... can we end with a grounding exercise? Just to make sure I'm fully back in the present before I leave?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's do that now..."
