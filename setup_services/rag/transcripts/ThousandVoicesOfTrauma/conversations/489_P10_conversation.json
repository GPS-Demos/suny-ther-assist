    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Johnson. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. My back's been acting up something fierce this morning, and the idea of revisiting that day... it's got my stomach in knots.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: Oh, I'd say about a 60. The pain's not helping my nerves any.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Remember, we can pause anytime. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Yes, I suppose I am. Let's get on with it.",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes and take us back to that day of the flood. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I'm in my living room. The TV's on, blaring about this storm coming our way. But we've had storms before, you know? I didn't think much of it. I can hear the rain picking up outside, pattering against the windows. It's getting louder, more insistent.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: The lights start flickering. On, off, on, off. It's making me uneasy. I decide to check outside, see what's going on. As I open the front door, I'm hit with this wall of water. It's... it's coming up to my ankles already. The street's turned into a river.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: Panic. Pure panic. My heart's racing, and I can feel it now, sitting here. My mouth's gone dry. I... I slam the door shut and run to the kitchen. Need to grab some supplies, you know? But my hands are shaking so bad I can barely open the cupboards.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 75, I reckon.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Right, right. So, I'm in the kitchen, trying to grab whatever I can. Canned food, bottled water. The power goes out completely. It's pitch black, and I can hear the water rushing outside. It sounds like it's getting closer, louder. I fumble for my phone, use it as a flashlight. The water's starting to seep in under the door now. It's... it's so cold on my feet.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I start moving things upstairs. As much as I can carry. My back's screaming at me, but I can't stop. I'm huffing and puffing, but the adrenaline's keeping me going. I can hear things crashing outside, car alarms going off. It's chaos.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. I can feel my heart pounding. My back... it's like someone's jabbing hot pokers into it. But I can't stop moving. I keep looking out the window, watching the water rise. It's up to the windowsills now. I... I don't know what to do.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take another deep breath. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's at 85. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: I know. You're very brave. Keep going when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm upstairs now. I can hear things floating around downstairs. The water's made it inside. I'm... I'm scared. Really scared. I try calling for help, but the lines are down. I feel so alone, so helpless. The water keeps rising. I can hear it creeping up the stairs. Step by step. It's like a monster, coming to get me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I drag my mattress to the window. Figure if the water gets too high, I can float on it. My hands are shaking so bad, I can barely tie it to the curtain rod. I sit on it, huddled up, watching the water creep higher and higher. I'm praying, begging for it to stop. But it doesn't. It just keeps coming.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm shivering. Not just from the cold, but from fear. My teeth are chattering. I can feel my heart racing, like it's trying to burst out of my chest. My back is screaming at me, but I can't move. I'm frozen in place, watching the water rise.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's at 90. This is really intense.",
    "Therapist: I know it's difficult. Remember, you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Alright... The water's reached the top of the stairs now. I can see things floating by the doorway. Pictures, books, my life just drifting away. The house is creaking and groaning. I'm terrified it might collapse. I... I start to hear people shouting outside. Screaming for help. I want to do something, but I can't. I'm trapped.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking this is it. This is how I die. Alone, scared, in this flooded house. I'm angry at myself for not leaving earlier, for not taking the warnings seriously. I'm worried about my neighbors, my community. Will anyone survive this?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those thoughts. What happens next?",
    "Client: The water stops rising, finally. But now I'm surrounded. My room's become an island. I can hear helicopters in the distance, but will they find me? I'm exhausted, cold, hungry. My back's in agony from sitting in the same position for so long. I drift in and out of sleep, always jerking awake at the slightest sound. It feels like an eternity.",
    "Therapist: How long were you there?",
    "Client: Two days. Two long, terrifying days. When the rescue team finally arrived, I... I broke down. Just started sobbing. The relief was overwhelming. But as they helped me out, I saw my neighborhood. It was... devastated. Unrecognizable. That's when it really hit me, you know? Everything was gone.",
    "Therapist: That must have been overwhelming. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to 80. Still high, but... talking about it, it helps, somehow.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. Emotionally and physically. My back's aching something fierce. But... there's a sense of relief too, you know? Like I've let something out that's been bottled up for too long.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you name five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: Uh, sure. I see... your desk, the plant in the corner, the bookshelf, that painting on the wall, and the box of tissues.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, take a deep breath. How do you feel physically?",
    "Client: My heart's slowed down a bit. I'm... I'm not as tense. Still sore, but that's normal for me these days.",
    "Therapist: You've shown tremendous courage today. How do you feel about what we've accomplished?",
    "Client: It was tough, real tough. But... I feel like I've faced something I've been running from for a long time. It's... it's a strange mix of exhaustion and accomplishment, if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: It absolutely does. You should be proud of yourself. Let's end our session here. Remember to practice self-care for the rest of the day.",
    "Client: Thank you, Doc. I will. This... this helped more than I thought it would.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue next week. Take care, Mr. Johnson."
