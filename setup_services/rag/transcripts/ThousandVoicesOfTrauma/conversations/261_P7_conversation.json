    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the car accident?",
    "Client: Okay... I was driving home from work. It was raining heavily, and visibility was poor. I remember gripping the steering wheel tightly, trying to focus on the road ahead. Suddenly, I saw headlights coming towards me in my lane. My heart started racing...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The other car was swerving erratically. I tried to move to the side, but everything happened so fast. There was a loud crash, and I felt my car spin. The airbag deployed, hitting me in the face. I couldn't breathe for a moment. The smell of burning rubber filled my nostrils...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that memory. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure I can continue. My hands are shaking just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. Take a deep breath. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... After the initial impact, there was this eerie silence. Then I heard the rain pattering on the roof of the car. I was disoriented, my head was throbbing. I tried to move, but my leg was trapped. I started to panic, thinking the car might catch fire...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I could hear people shouting outside. Someone was calling for an ambulance. I wanted to call out for help, but my voice was stuck in my throat. The pain in my leg was getting worse. I remember thinking about my late wife, wondering if I'd see her soon...",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to have those thoughts. You're safe now.",
    "Client: The wait for help felt like an eternity. I kept drifting in and out of consciousness. When the paramedics finally arrived, they had to use the jaws of life to get me out. The sound of metal being torn apart was terrifying. I thought I might lose my leg...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling anxious. My heart is racing, just like it did that day. But I also feel a bit relieved to be talking about it. It's like a weight is lifting, even though it's painful to remember.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're making progress.",
    "Client: When they finally got me out of the car, the cold rain hit my face. It was oddly refreshing, like it was washing away the nightmare. But then the pain hit me full force. I remember screaming as they lifted me onto the stretcher. The lights of the ambulance were so bright, almost blinding...",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The ride to the hospital was a blur. I kept thinking about my children, wondering if I'd ever see them again. The paramedic kept talking to me, trying to keep me conscious. I wanted to sleep so badly, to escape the pain and fear...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: When we arrived at the hospital, everything was chaos. Doctors and nurses rushing around, machines beeping. I remember feeling so alone and scared. They were cutting off my clothes, sticking needles in me. I tried to ask about the other driver, but no one would tell me anything...",
