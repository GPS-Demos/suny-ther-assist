    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the scene?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in that small room. It's dark, and I can hear voices outside. I'm sitting on a dirty mattress, and my heart is racing. I don't know how long I've been here.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm scared. I can smell cigarette smoke and alcohol. The door opens, and a man comes in. He's big, intimidating. I want to run, but I'm frozen. He starts talking to me in a language I don't understand.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. You're safe here.",
    "Client: He's getting closer. I can see his face now. He looks... angry. I'm shaking. I want to scream, but no sound comes out. I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: He grabs my arm. It hurts. I try to pull away, but he's too strong. I'm thinking about my family, wondering if I'll ever see them again. I feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can. This is too much.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here with me.",
    "Client: Okay... He's yelling now. I don't understand the words, but I know he's threatening me. I'm crying, begging him to let me go. But he just laughs. It's a cruel sound.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it.",
    "Client: He starts pulling me towards the door. I'm resisting, but it's useless. I can hear other voices now, getting louder. I'm terrified of what's going to happen next.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel scared. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: As we get to the door, I see other people. Some look as scared as I feel. Others look... empty. Like they've given up. I feel so alone, even in this crowd.",
    "Therapist: You're not alone now. Keep going.",
    "Client: We're moving through a hallway. It's dimly lit, and I can see stains on the walls. The man is still gripping my arm tightly. We stop in front of another door. I'm shaking uncontrollably now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're here with me.",
    "Client: He opens the door, and I see... I see... I can't. I'm sorry, I can't do this anymore.",
    "Therapist: It's okay. You've done very well. Let's take a break.",
    "Client: I feel so overwhelmed. My heart is pounding, and I'm sweating. It felt so real.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've shown great courage today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I didn't think I could face those memories, but somehow, I did.",
    "Therapist: You did, and that's a significant step. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... also a bit relieved. Like I've let out something I've been holding in for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. You've made progress today.",

    "Therapist: We'll discuss that in our next session. For now, let's focus on grounding you."
