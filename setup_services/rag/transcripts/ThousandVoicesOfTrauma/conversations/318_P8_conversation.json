    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also kind of numb at the same time. The memory of the earthquake, it's so vivid now. I can still feel the ground shaking under my feet, you know? And the sound... that low rumble that just kept getting louder. It's like it's still echoing in my head.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What physical sensations are you noticing right now?",
    "Client: My heart is still pounding pretty hard. And my hands are kind of clammy. I feel this tightness in my chest, like I can't quite catch my breath. It's weird because I know I'm safe here, but my body still feels like it's in danger, you know?",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how powerless I felt during the earthquake. And then... it's stupid, but I can't help comparing it to when my girlfriend broke up with me last month. It's like, in both situations, everything just fell apart, and I couldn't do anything to stop it. I know they're totally different, but somehow my brain is connecting them.",
    "Therapist: Interesting connection. How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Frustrated, I guess. And scared. Like, is this how life is always going to be? Just waiting for the next disaster to hit? Whether it's a natural disaster or a personal one, it feels like I have no control. And that terrifies me.",
    "Therapist: Hmm. What else comes up for you?",
    "Client: I... I feel guilty too. During the earthquake, I froze. I didn't help anyone. I just stood there, paralyzed with fear. And with my girlfriend, I didn't fight for the relationship. I just let it crumble. It's like I'm always letting people down, including myself.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings relate to your everyday life?",
    "Client: I guess... I've been avoiding a lot lately. I don't want to get close to anyone new because I'm afraid they'll leave. And I've been having trouble focusing on my studies. It's like I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop, you know? I keep thinking, what's the point of trying if everything can be taken away in an instant?",
    "Therapist: I see. What do you notice about these thoughts?",
    "Client: They're... pretty negative, aren't they? I mean, logically, I know not everything in life is a disaster waiting to happen. But emotionally, it's hard to shake that feeling. It's exhausting, always being on edge like this.",
    "Therapist: Mm. How would you like things to be different?",
    "Client: I... I want to feel safe again. To be able to trust that things will be okay. I want to be able to form new relationships without this constant fear of loss. And I want to be able to face challenges head-on instead of freezing up or running away. I just... I want to feel like myself again, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful goal. What small step could you take towards that?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe I could try to be more present in the moment? Instead of always worrying about what might happen, I could focus on what's actually happening right now. And maybe... maybe I could try reaching out to a friend I've been avoiding. Just for coffee or something. Baby steps, right?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. How does that idea feel to you?",
    "Client: It's a little scary, to be honest. But also... kind of hopeful? Like, maybe things don't have to stay this way forever. Maybe I can actually do something to change how I'm feeling. It's a small thing, but it feels like a start.",
    "Therapist: Good. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm realizing that talking about this stuff... it's hard, but it also feels kind of liberating? Like, just putting it all out there takes some of the power away from these fears. And hearing myself say it out loud, some of it sounds kind of irrational. I mean, not all of it, but some of it. It's like I can start to see the difference between the real dangers and the ones my mind is creating.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How does your body feel now?",
    "Client: Actually... a bit more relaxed. My heart isn't racing as much anymore. I still feel a little shaky, but not as much as before. It's like... like the pressure in my chest has eased a bit. I can breathe a little deeper now.",
    "Therapist: That's good. What do you make of that change?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe talking about it helps? Like, bringing these fears into the light makes them less scary somehow. And knowing that I have a plan, even if it's just a small step, it makes me feel a bit more in control. Not completely, but... it's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How would you summarize this session?",
    "Client: Wow, um... I'd say it was intense, but in a good way? Like, diving into those memories was really hard, but I feel like I understand myself a bit better now. I can see how the earthquake and the breakup have both affected me, and how I've been carrying that fear with me. But I also feel like maybe, just maybe, I can start to move past it. It's not going to be easy, but for the first time in a while, I feel like there's hope. Like I'm not just stuck in this cycle of fear and avoidance forever.",
    "Therapist: That's a great insight. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. This was... a lot to process, but in a good way. I feel drained, but also kind of... I don't know, lighter? Like I've put down a heavy backpack I didn't even realize I was carrying. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know we have more work to do, but I feel like we made real progress today.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and we'll continue next week."
