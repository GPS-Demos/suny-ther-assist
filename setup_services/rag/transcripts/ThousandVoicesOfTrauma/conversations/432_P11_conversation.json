    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. Going through that memory of the home invasion... it brought back so many intense feelings. I could almost smell the intruder's cologne again, you know? It's like I was right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most?",
    "Client: The fear. The absolute terror of realizing someone was in my home. I remembered how my throat closed up, how I couldn't breathe. And then... the helplessness. I felt so powerless, just like when... when the abuse happened years ago. It's like all those old feelings came flooding back.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel now, talking about it?",
    "Client: It's... strange. I'm still anxious, but it's different. Like, I'm here, safe, but part of me is still stuck in that memory. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How does this compare to previous exposures?",
    "Client: It's... easier, I think. Still hard, but I didn't feel as overwhelmed this time. I was able to stay with the memory longer without completely losing it. That's progress, right?",
    "Therapist: Indeed. What do you think contributed to that?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe it's because we've been working on this for a while now? I feel like I'm starting to understand my reactions better. And knowing you're here, guiding me through it... it helps. I don't feel so alone in facing this anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's great insight. How might this progress apply outside therapy?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe I could use some of these techniques when I'm feeling anxious at home? Like, reminding myself that I'm safe now, that it's just a memory. And maybe... maybe I could try not avoiding things that remind me of what happened so much?",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a good plan. Any other thoughts?",
    "Client: Yeah, actually. I've been thinking... this whole process, it's not just about the home invasion, is it? It's bringing up stuff from the sexual abuse too. I never realized how connected they were in my mind.",
    "Therapist: That's an important connection. How does that realization feel?",
    "Client: It's... scary, but also kind of liberating? Like, maybe if I can work through one, it'll help with the other too. It's all part of the same... I don't know, the same healing process?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I want to keep going. It's hard, but I feel like I'm finally making progress. Maybe... maybe we could work more on some coping strategies for when I'm at home alone? And I think I'm ready to try facing some of the things I've been avoiding. Baby steps, you know?",
    "Therapist: Excellent. We'll focus on that next time. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... okay. Better than I expected, actually. There's this weird mix of exhaustion and... I don't know, hope? Like maybe I really can get through this. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know I've got a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I might actually be able to do this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember to use your coping skills this week.",
    "Client: I will. And... thanks. Really. I know it's your job and all, but... it means a lot, having someone who understands and doesn't judge. I'll practice those breathing exercises we talked about, and maybe try writing in that journal you suggested. See you next week?",
    "Therapist: See you next week. Take care."
