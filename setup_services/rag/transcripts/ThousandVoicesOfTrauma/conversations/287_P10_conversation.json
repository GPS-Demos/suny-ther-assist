    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Uh, to be honest, I'm a bit on edge. We're diving into the earthquake stuff today, right? It's not exactly my favorite topic.",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's right. Remember, you're safe here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I guess so. Just... give me a second to collect myself. *deep breath* Okay, I think I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Good. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in my apartment. It's early morning, maybe 6 AM? I'm just getting up for work. The air feels heavy, like something's off. Then suddenly, the whole place starts shaking. God, it's so vivid...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What's happening around you?",
    "Client: Everything's rattling. Pictures are falling off the walls. I hear glass breaking in the kitchen. I'm frozen, can't move. My heart's racing so fast I think it might burst out of my chest.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'd say... maybe a 70? It's pretty intense.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: The shaking gets worse. I hear people screaming outside. I try to run to the doorway like they always tell you to do, but I stumble. The floor's moving so much, I can barely stand. I... I'm so scared. I think I'm going to die.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. Keep breathing. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I manage to crawl to the doorway. I'm holding on for dear life. The noise is deafening - it sounds like the whole building is going to come down. I can smell dust and... is that gas? Oh God, what if there's a fire?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking. I feel nauseous. My chest is so tight, it's hard to breathe. I want to run, but I'm paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 85. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. Remember, you survived this. Take a moment to ground yourself.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... okay. The shaking starts to slow down. It feels like it lasted forever, but I think it was only a minute or two. As it stops, I hear car alarms going off everywhere. People are crying and shouting outside.",
    "Therapist: What do you do once the shaking stops?",
    "Client: I... I stay in the doorway for a while. I'm too scared to move. My legs feel like jelly. When I finally get up, I see the destruction. My TV's on the floor, shattered. There's broken glass everywhere. I cut my foot on a piece as I try to move.",
    "Therapist: Focus on that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... I need to get out. What if there's an aftershock? But I'm also worried about my neighbors. Mrs. Johnson next door is elderly. I should check on her. But I'm so scared to leave the doorway.",
    "Therapist: How does that conflict make you feel?",
    "Client: Guilty. Ashamed. I want to help, but I'm paralyzed by fear. I feel like a coward.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel conflicted in such a situation. What do you end up doing?",
    "Client: I... I force myself to move. I grab my phone, but there's no signal. I put on some shoes and open my front door. The hallway is a mess. I can hear people crying.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's still pretty high. Maybe 80?",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going. What happens as you enter the hallway?",
    "Client: I see my neighbors coming out of their apartments. Everyone looks shell-shocked. I make my way to Mrs. Johnson's door and knock. No answer. I'm getting really worried now.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I try the door handle. It's unlocked. I call out for her as I enter. The place is a disaster. I find her in the living room, on the floor. She's conscious but bleeding from a cut on her head. I feel a rush of... I don't know, adrenaline? Fear? Relief that she's alive?",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. How do you handle the situation?",
    "Client: I tell her not to move. I find a clean towel and press it to her wound. I'm trying to remember first aid, but my mind's blank. I'm shaking so much, I can barely hold the towel steady.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind at this moment?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"What if there's another quake? What if the building collapses?\" But I can't leave her. I'm terrified, but I know I need to stay and help.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly challenging. How does it feel to recall that now?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. My heart's racing just thinking about it. But there's also this weird sense of... I don't know, pride? That I managed to help despite being so scared.",
    "Therapist: That's a natural response. What's your distress level right now?",
    "Client: It's come down a bit. Maybe 65?",
    "Therapist: Good. You're processing this well. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear sirens outside. It feels like forever, but eventually, paramedics arrive. They take over caring for Mrs. Johnson. As they're working on her, there's an aftershock. It's not as bad as the first quake, but God, it's terrifying.",
    "Therapist: How do you react to the aftershock?",
    "Client: I freeze up again. My mind goes blank. I'm just standing there, useless, while the paramedics keep working. I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. What happens after the aftershock?",
    "Client: The paramedics decide to evacuate Mrs. Johnson. They ask if I can help carry her down the stairs since the elevator's out. I nod, even though I'm still shaking.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to be asked for help in that moment?",
    "Client: Scary, but... also grounding? It gives me something to focus on besides my fear. As we carry her down, I'm hyper-aware of every creak in the building. I keep expecting another quake.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually lower. Maybe 50? Focusing on the task is helping.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Continue with what happens next.",
    "Client: We get Mrs. Johnson outside. The street is chaos. There are people everywhere, crying, hugging. I see a few injured people being treated. The air is thick with dust. I can hear glass crunching under my feet.",
    "Therapist: What do you do once Mrs. Johnson is safely with the paramedics?",
    "Client: I... I don't know what to do. I feel lost. Part of me wants to go back to my apartment to grab some things, but I'm too scared to go back inside. I end up just standing there, watching everything happen around me.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. How long do you stay there?",
    "Client: It feels like hours. The sun is getting higher. I see more emergency vehicles arriving. Someone from the fire department tells us we can't go back into the building yet. They're setting up a shelter at the community center.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about not being able to return to your apartment?",
    "Client: Frustrated. Scared. All my stuff is up there. What if someone loots the place? But also... relieved? I don't want to go back in there. I'm afraid it might collapse.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. What do you decide to do?",
    "Client: I... I end up going to the shelter. I don't know what else to do. As I'm walking there, I keep looking back at my building, half expecting it to crumble.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel arriving at the shelter?",
    "Client: It's overwhelming. There are so many people. Everyone looks shell-shocked. I feel... I don't know, disconnected? Like I'm watching everything happen from outside my body.",
    "Therapist: That's a common trauma response. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually pretty low. Maybe a 30? I think I'm starting to feel numb.",
    "Therapist: Okay, John. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Take a few deep breaths.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... I'm here.",
    "Therapist: You did very well today. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. Drained. But also... I don't know, maybe a little proud? I've never been able to talk about it in this much detail before.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, John. Remember, you survived this. You even helped others. Let's take a moment to acknowledge your strength.",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, I guess I did. It's still hard to think about, but... maybe it's getting a little easier?",
    "Therapist: That's often how it goes. We'll continue to work through this. For now, let's do a quick grounding exercise before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's start by naming five things you can see in this room..."
