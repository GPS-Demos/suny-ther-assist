    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart's still racing, and I feel this tightness in my chest. The memory of being in that hospital room, strapped down... it's so vivid. I can almost smell the antiseptic and hear the beeping of the machines.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I think. No, not just fear... terror. It's like I'm right back there, helpless and alone. I keep thinking about how I couldn't move, couldn't speak. The doctors and nurses, they were talking about me like I wasn't even there. It's... it's suffocating.",
    "Therapist: Can you tell me more about that feeling of suffocation?",
    "Client: It's... it's like there's this weight on my chest. I can breathe, but it feels like I have to fight for each breath. My throat feels tight, and I have this urge to run, to escape. But I couldn't then, and even now, part of me feels frozen. It's like my body remembers being restrained, you know?",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"This isn't fair. I didn't do anything wrong.\" I was just sick, and they treated me like a criminal. I replay the moment when the security guards came in, how rough they were. I wonder if I'll ever feel safe in a hospital again. And then I feel angry, so angry at the system, at the doctors who didn't listen to me.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's hot. Like there's this fire in my stomach that's spreading through my chest and into my arms. My hands are clenched, and I notice I'm gritting my teeth. It's almost like the anger is fighting against the fear, pushing it back a little. But then I feel guilty for being angry, like maybe I'm overreacting or being ungrateful for the medical care I received.",
    "Therapist: What do you make of that guilt?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Part of me knows I have a right to be angry, to feel violated. But there's this voice in my head saying, \"They were just trying to help. You were out of control.\" And I start doubting myself, wondering if I'm remembering it all wrong. But then I think about the nightmares, the panic attacks I've had since then, and I know it was real. It did happen.",
    "Therapist: How does revisiting this memory affect your view of yourself?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. On one hand, I feel weak, like I should have been able to prevent it somehow. I'm a grown man, and I couldn't even protect myself. But then I also feel... I don't know, resilient maybe? Like, I went through this terrible thing, and I'm still here, still fighting. It's confusing. Sometimes I feel like two different people - the one who was helpless in that hospital bed, and the one sitting here now, trying to make sense of it all.",
    "Therapist: What's it like to recognize that resilience?",
    "Client: It's... surprising, actually. I've spent so much time focusing on how the trauma broke me down, I haven't really thought about how I've kept going. I mean, I'm here, right? Talking about it, facing it. That takes strength, doesn't it? But it's hard to feel strong when I'm still struggling with nightmares and anxiety. It's like... like I'm climbing a mountain, and I've made progress, but the peak still seems so far away.",
    "Therapist: How does this experience connect to other parts of your life?",
    "Client: I... I think it's affected everything. My relationships, my work, even how I see the world. I'm always on guard now, especially around authority figures. I've pushed people away because I'm afraid of being vulnerable again. And my chronic pain... it's like a constant reminder of what happened. Every twinge makes me wonder if I'll end up back in a hospital, helpless again. It's exhausting, always being on edge like this.",
    "Therapist: What do you need right now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to feel safe. And heard. Just talking about this, having someone listen without judging... it helps. I need to believe that what happened to me was wrong, that my feelings are valid. And I guess I need hope. Hope that I can work through this, that I won't always feel this way. That maybe, someday, I can trust again - trust doctors, trust the system, trust myself.",
    "Therapist: How can we work towards that sense of safety and hope?",
    "Client: I'm not entirely sure. I think... maybe continuing these sessions, for one. It's hard, but I feel like I'm making progress. And perhaps... perhaps I need to learn some techniques to ground myself when the memories become overwhelming. Maybe find ways to reconnect with my body in a positive way, to counteract the trauma. And I think I need to be kinder to myself, to recognize that healing isn't linear. It's okay to have setbacks, as long as I keep moving forward.",
    "Therapist: That's a thoughtful reflection. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. Drained. But also, there's a small sense of relief. Like I've let out some of the pressure that's been building up inside me. My chest feels a little less tight, and my thoughts aren't racing as much. It's still hard, and I know I have a long way to go, but... I don't know, maybe there's a glimmer of hope there. Is that normal? To feel so exhausted but also... maybe a tiny bit lighter?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to explore more about how to manage the anxiety and hypervigilance in my daily life. Maybe we could talk about strategies for when I have to interact with medical professionals or authority figures? And... I'd like to work on rebuilding some of the relationships I've pushed away. I'm starting to realize how isolated I've become, and I think... I think I need to let people in again, even if it's scary.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. We'll pick up there next time.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you for listening. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't minimize what I've been through. I... I'm grateful for this space to work through everything.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
