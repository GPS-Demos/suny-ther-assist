    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Johnson. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Oh, well... I'm not quite sure. A bit anxious, I suppose. It's been weighing on my mind all week, knowing we'd be talking about... that day.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0-100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: Hmm... I'd say about a 40. My stomach's a bit fluttery.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we can pause anytime. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. Yes, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in the park near our old house. It's a warm day, late summer. The trees are still green, but there's a hint of fall in the air. I can smell freshly cut grass. I'm walking along the path, enjoying the sunshine on my face. It's peaceful, you know? I used to love these walks...",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear something... rustling in the bushes to my left. At first, I think it's just a squirrel or maybe a bird. But then... oh god... (voice trembles) I see it. A large dog, some kind of mixed breed. It's snarling, foam around its mouth. I freeze. I can't move. My heart is pounding so hard...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're safe here. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 65 now. I can feel my palms getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Feel your feet on the floor. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) Okay. The dog... it lunges at me. I try to back away, but I stumble. I fall backwards onto the path. The gravel digs into my hands as I try to push myself away. The dog is so close now, I can smell its hot breath. It's growling, showing its teeth. I'm terrified. I can't breathe. I can't scream. I just... I just want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What do you feel in your body?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. My heart is racing. I feel... I feel so helpless. Like a child again, like when my parents would... (voice breaks) when they'd leave me alone for days. That same fear, that abandonment. But this time, it's not emptiness coming for me, it's teeth and claws and...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: The dog... it bites my arm. The pain is sharp, burning. I can feel its teeth tearing through my skin. I finally find my voice and I scream. It's so loud, it surprises even me. The dog startles and backs off for a moment. I scramble to my feet, holding my bleeding arm. I'm crying, shaking. I look around desperately for help, but the park seems empty. Why is no one here? Why am I always alone when these things happen?",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 80. My arm is actually aching, remembering the bite.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you survived this. You're here now, safe. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) The dog circles me, still growling. I'm backing away slowly, trying to keep my eyes on it. My arm is throbbing. I can feel blood trickling down to my fingers. I'm so scared, but... but I'm also angry. Angry that this is happening, angry that no one is helping me. I see a large stick on the ground and I grab it with my good arm. I hold it out in front of me, trying to look bigger, more threatening. My voice is shaky, but I yell, \"Get away! Go!\" The dog hesitates, still growling. I wave the stick and yell again, louder this time. And then... and then I hear someone calling out. An older man is running towards us, waving his arms. The dog turns and runs off into the bushes. I... I collapse to the ground, sobbing.",
    "Therapist: You showed incredible strength. How do you feel now, remembering that moment?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. But also... maybe a little proud? I didn't just freeze. I fought back. I've never really thought about that part before.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 60. My heart's still racing a bit, but I feel more... I don't know, grounded?",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's continue. What happens after the man reaches you?",
    "Client: He helps me up, asks if I'm okay. I'm still shaking, crying. He offers to call an ambulance, but I... I don't want to go to the hospital. I just want to go home. He insists on walking me there, making sure I'm safe. I remember feeling grateful, but also... ashamed? Like I should have been able to handle it on my own. Like I was a burden.",
    "Therapist: Those are common feelings after trauma. How does it feel to recognize that now?",
    "Client: It's... it's strange. I've carried that shame for so long. But hearing myself say it out loud... it doesn't make sense, does it? I was attacked. It wasn't my fault.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How does your body feel right now?",
    "Client: My shoulders feel less tense. I didn't even realize how much I was holding there. My breathing is easier too.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's continue with what happened when you got home.",
    "Client: I... I remember fumbling with my keys, my hands still shaking. When I finally get inside, I lock the door and just... slide down to the floor. I'm sobbing, holding my injured arm. The pain is really setting in now. I feel so alone, so vulnerable. I wish my husband was still alive. He would have known what to do, how to comfort me. Instead, I'm just sitting there, on the cold floor, feeling like the world has become this dangerous, unpredictable place. I don't know how long I sit there, but eventually, I manage to get up and clean the wound. I'm on autopilot, just going through the motions. I don't call anyone. I don't seek help. I just... retreat into myself.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually down to about 50. Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also like releasing something I've held onto for so long.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How did this experience affect you in the following days?",
    "Client: I... I became afraid to leave the house. Every time I heard a dog bark, I'd jump. I stopped going for walks, stopped going to the park. I felt... I felt like I'd lost a part of myself. The independent woman who enjoyed her solitary walks, who felt at peace in nature... she was gone. And I was angry about that. Angry at the dog, angry at myself for being afraid. I started having nightmares, reliving the attack over and over. But in my dreams, there was never anyone to help me. I was always alone, always... abandoned.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to recognize that connection to your past experiences?",
    "Client: It's... it's eye-opening. I never realized how much that attack brought up those old feelings of neglect. It's like... like it confirmed some deep-seated fear that I'm always going to be alone when bad things happen.",
    "Therapist: That's a profound realization. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, somehow. Like I understand myself a little better. My SUDS is down to about 40 now. It's still there, but it's not overwhelming anymore.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredible work today. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end.",
    "Client: (takes several deep breaths) Thank you. This was hard, but... I think it was important.",
    "Therapist: It absolutely was. You showed great courage. How do you feel about continuing this work in our next session?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm ready. It's not easy, but I can feel that it's helping. Maybe next time we can talk about how I started to overcome that fear?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like an excellent plan. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed between sessions.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you for guiding me through this. I feel... I feel heard.",
    "Therapist: You're very welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
