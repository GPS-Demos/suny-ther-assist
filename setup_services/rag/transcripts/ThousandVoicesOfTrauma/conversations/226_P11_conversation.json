    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. Going through that memory of witnessing the violence online, it felt so real again. My heart was racing, and I could feel my hands shaking. It's like I was right back there, watching it happen on my screen.",
    "Therapist: What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. Seeing that person being attacked and not being able to do anything about it. It's... it's overwhelming. And the comments, God, the awful things people were saying. It makes me sick thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your daily life now?",
    "Client: Well, I'm always on edge when I'm online. I'm constantly worried I'll see something violent or disturbing. It's affected my work, you know? As a self-employed person, I need to be online, but I'm... I'm scared. And then there's the depression. Some days, I can barely get out of bed, thinking about how cruel people can be.",
    "Therapist: What did you learn about yourself today?",
    "Client: I... I guess I realized I'm stronger than I thought. I mean, I got through the exposure without breaking down completely. And maybe... maybe I'm not as helpless as I felt then. I'm here, trying to work through this, right?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How can you build on this?",
    "Client: I suppose I could... try to focus on the positive aspects of being online. Maybe set specific times for work and stick to them, instead of constantly checking and worrying. And perhaps I could look into ways to report cyberbullying or support anti-violence initiatives online. It might help me feel less powerless.",
    "Therapist: Excellent ideas. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: A bit drained, honestly. But also... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful? It's like I've faced this monster in my head, and while it's still scary, it doesn't seem quite as big anymore. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. What's your next step?",
    "Client: I think I want to try those strategies we discussed. Maybe start with setting work hours and gradually increase my online time. And... and I'd like to continue with these exposures. They're tough, but I feel like they're helping me process what happened.",
    "Therapist: That's great. Anything else you'd like to share?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I guess. For guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm making progress. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel completely safe online again, but at least now I feel like I have some tools to cope with it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, definitely. I'll be here. Thank you again."
