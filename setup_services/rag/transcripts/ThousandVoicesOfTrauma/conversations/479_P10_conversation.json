    "Therapist: Welcome back. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I... I think so. It's always a bit daunting, you know? But I'm here, and I want to work through this.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with your SUDS level.",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 4 right now. Just thinking about diving in makes me a bit tense.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we're here together. Whenever you're ready, close your eyes and take us back to that day.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Alright. I'm... I'm there. It's early morning, still dark out. The air is heavy with moisture, and there's this eerie quiet. We're on patrol, moving through a small village. The buildings are all mud-brick, casting long shadows in the dim light. I can smell something... it's like a mix of spices and smoke from cooking fires.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you notice about your body?",
    "Client: My uniform feels damp with sweat. My boots are heavy, each step crunching softly on the dusty ground. My hands are gripping my rifle tightly, and I can feel my heart pounding in my chest.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: We're moving slowly, carefully. There's six of us spread out in formation. I'm second from the front. Suddenly, there's a flash of movement in a doorway to our right. Before I can even process what's happening, there's a deafening explosion. The world goes sideways, and I'm thrown to the ground.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to a 7. My hands are shaking just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Can you tell me more about what you're experiencing in that moment?",
    "Client: There's dust everywhere, and my ears are ringing. I can taste blood in my mouth. I'm disoriented, but training kicks in. I scramble to get behind some cover, dragging myself towards a low wall. That's when I see... oh god...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're doing great.",
    "Client: *voice trembling* Johnson, he was right in front of me. He's... he's just lying there. Not moving. There's so much blood. I want to help him, but I can't move. I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here in the room with me. What do you feel in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. It's hard to breathe. My stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: Focus on those sensations. They're just memories. You're safe now.",
    "Client: *takes a shaky breath* Okay. Okay. I'm... I'm still there, behind the wall. There's shouting, but it sounds muffled. I can see muzzle flashes from nearby buildings. The air smells like gunpowder and dust.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going. What are you thinking in that moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. But also angry. So angry. Johnson was just a kid, barely 20. I should have been watching out for him. I should have seen it coming. God, why didn't I see it coming?",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I force myself to move. I need to find the rest of my team. I start crawling along the wall, keeping my head down. There's debris everywhere, pieces of the building that exploded. I can hear someone screaming for a medic.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My SUDS is probably an 8. It's... it's intense. I can almost feel the heat of the sun starting to rise, the grit of sand on my face.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: *exhales slowly* Okay. I'm... I'm still there, but I can feel the floor too. It helps.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I make it to the corner of the building. I can see two of my team members taking cover behind a destroyed vehicle. They're returning fire. I need to get to them, but there's open ground between us. I take a deep breath, gather my courage, and make a run for it.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind as you run?",
    "Client: It's... it's almost blank. Just pure adrenaline. I'm expecting to feel a bullet any second. My legs are burning, lungs screaming. It feels like slow motion, but I know it's only seconds.",
    "Therapist: And then?",
    "Client: I dive behind the vehicle, scraping my arm on some twisted metal. The pain barely registers. Martinez is there, his face streaked with dirt and sweat. He's yelling something, but I can't make it out over the gunfire.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. My heart is racing just thinking about it. SUDS is probably a 9.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. Remember, you survived this.",
    "Client: *takes several deep breaths* Yeah. Yeah, I did. Okay. I'm... I'm still there. Martinez is gesturing towards a building across the street. I realize he's trying to tell me where the fire is coming from.",
    "Therapist: What do you do with that information?",
    "Client: I peek around the edge of the vehicle. I can see muzzle flashes from a second-story window. I signal to Martinez, and we coordinate our fire. The next few minutes are a blur of noise and smoke.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What do you notice?",
    "Client: The acrid smell of gunpowder. The heat of my rifle barrel. My ears are ringing from the constant gunfire. I can taste dust and fear in my mouth.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What happens next?",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a lull in the firing. We wait, tense, not sure if it's over. Then we hear it - the sound of helicopters approaching. Reinforcements are coming. The relief... it's indescribable.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment with that feeling of relief. How does your body respond?",
    "Client: It's like... like a weight lifting. My muscles start to unclench. I'm exhausted, but the adrenaline is still pumping. I realize I'm shaking.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My SUDS is coming down, maybe to a 6 or 7. It's... it's still intense, but I feel more in control.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Take some deep breaths.",
    "Client: *breathes deeply* Okay. I'm... I'm starting to feel more present in the room.",
    "Therapist: Good. Slowly open your eyes when you're ready.",
    "Client: *opens eyes* That was... that was tough. But I got through it.",
    "Therapist: Yes, you did. You showed incredible strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, but... but also a bit proud, I guess. It's getting easier to talk about, even if it's still hard.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. Let's take a few minutes to process what you experienced today.",
    "Client: Okay. I... I noticed that the physical sensations were really vivid this time. The smells, the sounds... it felt so real.",
    "Therapist: That's common in these exercises. It shows you're engaging deeply with the memory.",
    "Client: Yeah, it was intense. But I also felt like I had more control this time. Like I could step back a bit, even when it got really tough.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. You're developing the ability to engage with the memory without being completely overwhelmed by it.",
    "Client: It's still hard, though. Especially thinking about Johnson... I still feel so guilty.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those feelings. We'll continue to work on processing that guilt. Remember, you weren't responsible for what happened.",
    "Client: I know that logically, but emotionally... it's still a struggle.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Healing takes time. How are you feeling physically now?",
    "Client: Tired. My muscles are sore, like I've been tensing them. But I feel... lighter, somehow. Like I've let go of something.",
    "Therapist: That's a good sign. Your body is processing the trauma too. Let's do some grounding exercises before we end.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Alright, let's start by focusing on five things you can see in this room..."
