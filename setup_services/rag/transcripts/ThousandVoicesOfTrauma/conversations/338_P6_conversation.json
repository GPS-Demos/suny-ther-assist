    "Therapist: Alright, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's begin. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that moment.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm there. I'm in our old house, hiding behind the couch. I can hear my parents shouting in the kitchen. The words are muffled, but their voices are so angry. My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: It's about a 4. I'm tense, but still okay.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The shouting is getting louder. I hear something crash \u2013 maybe a plate? My mom screams. I'm shaking now, trying to make myself as small as possible behind the couch. I want to run, but I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's up to a 6. My palms are sweaty, and I feel a knot in my stomach.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) I hear heavy footsteps coming towards the living room. I'm terrified it's my dad. I can barely breathe. Then I see my mom rush in, her face streaked with tears. She's holding her arm like it hurts. When she sees me, she tries to smile, but I can see the fear in her eyes.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's an 8 now. My chest feels tight, and I'm fighting back tears.",
    "Therapist: That's a big jump. Remember, you're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Inhales shakily) It's hard. I feel so helpless, just like I did then. I wanted to protect her, but I was just a kid. I couldn't do anything.",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. You were a child in a scary situation.",
    "Client: I know that logically, but emotionally... it still hurts. (Pauses) My dad comes in now. He's yelling at my mom to get out. I can smell the alcohol on his breath from here. He hasn't seen me yet.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS?",
    "Client: Still at an 8. My hands are shaking. I feel like I might throw up.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: (Voice cracking) My mom leaves, and my dad collapses on the couch. He's muttering to himself. I'm trying not to make a sound, but I'm crying silently. I'm so scared he'll find me.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down to a 7. I still feel awful, but the worst part is over.",

    "Client: (Sighs) Thanks. It's still hard to talk about, but... it feels a little less overwhelming each time.",
    "Therapist: That's the goal. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end."
