    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Can you start by describing the event and give me your initial SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. It was the day my grandmother passed away. I remember getting the call from my mom. I was at work, and... (voice trembles) I just felt my world stop. My SUDS right now is probably around a 6.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. Let's continue. What happened next?",
    "Client: I left work immediately. The drive home was a blur. I kept thinking about all the times I should have visited her more. When I got home, I just sat in my car, unable to move. I felt... numb, I guess. But also like my chest was being crushed.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Maybe an 8? My hands are shaking a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I finally went inside and called my girlfriend. She came over, but I couldn't really talk. I just sat there, staring at the wall. I kept thinking about how my grandmother was always there for me, especially when I faced racism at school. She'd tell me stories about her life in India, how she overcame so much... (starts crying) I'm sorry, I...",
    "Therapist: It's alright. Take your time. How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Remember to take slow, deep breaths. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay... The next day, we started making arrangements. My mom was a mess, and I had to step up. But all I could think about was how I'd never hear my grandmother's voice again. Never taste her cooking. Never... (voice breaks) never get to tell her how much she meant to me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. SUDS check?",
    "Client: Still a 9. My heart is racing, and I feel hot all over.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Stay with the memory. What happened at the funeral?",
    "Client: The funeral was... it was beautiful, but so painful. Seeing her there, so still... It didn't feel real. I kept expecting her to open her eyes, to smile at me one last time. I remember the smell of incense, the sound of prayers... and this overwhelming sense of loss.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I think it's gone down a bit. Maybe a 7? I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter?",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing the memory. Keep going.",
    "Client: After the funeral, I felt angry. Angry at myself for not spending more time with her, angry at the world for taking her away. I threw myself into work, avoiding my family. But then one night, I found an old voicemail from her. Just hearing her voice... (tears up) It broke me, but also reminded me of how much love she had given me.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 6 again. I feel sad, but also grateful for the memories I have.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. How do you feel about the exercise overall?",
