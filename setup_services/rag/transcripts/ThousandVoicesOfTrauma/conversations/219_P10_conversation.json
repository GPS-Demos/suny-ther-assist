    "Therapist: Welcome, James. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a part of me that wants to dive in, you know? To face this head-on. But there's another part that's... well, it's terrified. My hands are a bit shaky just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0-100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 60. My heart's beating pretty fast.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we can pause anytime. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm... I'm 12 years old. It's hot, really hot. I'm in a small room with... with three other boys. We're all scared. The air is thick with sweat and fear. I can hear voices outside, men speaking in a language I don't understand. My stomach is in knots. I... I haven't eaten in days.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: There's... there's a small window, but it's too high to reach. The walls are dirty, covered in scratches. I think... I think they're from other kids who were here before us. God, it's suffocating in here.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: The door... it opens. A man comes in. He's big, intimidating. He looks at us like... like we're not even human. He points at me and says something to another man behind him. I... I feel like I'm going to throw up.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 80. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Focus on your breathing. In through your nose, out through your mouth. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Breathes deeply) Okay... The man grabs my arm. His grip is so tight it hurts. He's pulling me out of the room. The other boys are crying, begging. I want to fight back, but I'm too weak, too scared. We're in a hallway now. It smells like cigarettes and something... something rotten.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, James. Stay with it.",
    "Client: He's... he's taking me to another room. There's a... a bed in there. Oh God, I can't... I can't do this.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, James. This is just a memory. What's happening now?",
    "Client: (Voice shaking) He's pushing me towards the bed. I'm trying to resist, but he's so much stronger. I'm crying, begging him to let me go. But he... he doesn't care. He's unbuckling his belt and I... I know what's going to happen. I feel so helpless, so... so dirty.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. You're doing incredibly well.",
    "Client: (Breathing heavily) It hurts. It hurts so much. I'm screaming but no one's coming to help. I feel like I'm dying. I want to die. Anything to make it stop.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave, James. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's 95. I feel like I'm back there.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here with me. You're safe. Can you tell me three things you see in this room?",
    "Client: I... I see the clock on the wall. Your desk. And... and the painting of the ocean.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, can you continue?",
    "Client: Yeah... After he's... done, he leaves me there. I'm in so much pain. I can't move. I'm bleeding. I feel... broken. Like something inside me has been shattered forever. I hear other kids crying in the distance. I want my mom. I want to go home. But I don't even know where home is anymore.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well, James. Stay with it.",
    "Client: Hours pass. Maybe days. I lose track of time. Different men come and go. Each time, I die a little more inside. I stop fighting. I stop feeling. It's like... like I'm watching it happen to someone else. I become... numb.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm angry. So angry. Why did this happen to me? What did I do to deserve this?",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault, James. None of this was your fault.",
    "Client: (Voice breaking) But why couldn't I stop it? Why wasn't I stronger?",
    "Therapist: You were a child. You did what you had to do to survive.",
    "Client: I... I guess. It's just... it's hard not to blame myself sometimes.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. What happens next in your memory?",
    "Client: One day, there's a lot of commotion. Shouting, running. I'm terrified they're going to kill us. But then... then the door bursts open and there are police. They're speaking English. I'm crying, but this time it's... it's relief. They wrap me in a blanket and carry me out. I see other kids being rescued too. It's over. It's finally over.",
    "Therapist: You made it through. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. But also... I don't know. There's a small part of me that feels... proud? Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. You survived something horrific. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 70. I'm... I'm exhausted.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've done incredible work today, James.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I never thought I could talk about this. It's always been this... this dark secret I've carried.",
    "Therapist: You've shown immense courage. How are you feeling about having shared this?",
    "Client: It's... it's strange. Part of me feels exposed, vulnerable. But another part feels... lighter? Like I've set down a heavy burden I've been carrying for years.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. What do you think you'll take away from this session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'm starting to understand that what happened wasn't my fault. And maybe... maybe I'm stronger than I thought. I survived. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Those are powerful realizations, James. I'm proud of the work you've done today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I never thought I'd be able to face this. But here I am.",
    "Therapist: Yes, here you are. And you've done remarkably well. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves before we end the session. Can you tell me five things you can see in this room?",
    "Client: Sure. I see the clock, your desk, the painting, the bookshelf, and the plant in the corner.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Now, four things you can touch?",
    "Client: The armrest of the chair, my shirt, my shoes, and... the texture of my jeans.",
    "Therapist: Good. Three things you can hear?",
    "Client: The ticking of the clock, the hum of the air conditioner, and... my own breathing.",
    "Therapist: Very good. Two things you can smell?",
    "Client: The scent of the air freshener and... coffee, I think?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's right. And finally, one thing you can taste?",
    "Client: The lingering taste of the water I drank earlier.",
    "Therapist: Excellent job, James. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. Tired, but... okay. My SUDS is probably around 40 now.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant improvement. You've done incredible work today. Remember to be kind to yourself this week. We'll continue to process this in our next session.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I appreciate your support.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, James. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
