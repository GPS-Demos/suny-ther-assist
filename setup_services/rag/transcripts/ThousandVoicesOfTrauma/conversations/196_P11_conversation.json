    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Jake?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. Going through that breakup again in my mind, it's like I'm right back there, you know? I can feel the weight of it all over again. The rejection, the loneliness... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: I guess... the feeling of helplessness. When Sarah told me she was leaving, it was like the ground disappeared beneath my feet. I remember thinking, \"This can't be happening. Not again.\" It brought back all those memories of being bullied in school, feeling like I wasn't good enough, like something was wrong with me.",
    "Therapist: How did your body react during the memory?",
    "Client: My heart was racing. I felt this tightness in my chest, like I couldn't breathe properly. My palms were sweaty, and I had this urge to run away, to escape somehow. It's crazy how real it felt, even though it happened months ago.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. How are you coping now?",
    "Client: It's... better, I think. The physical sensations are fading. But emotionally, I still feel raw. It's like the breakup reopened all these old wounds from my past. I'm struggling to shake off this feeling that I'm unlovable or that I'll always end up alone.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your PTSD symptoms?",
    "Client: I... I never really made that connection before. But I guess it explains why I've been having so much trouble trusting people lately. Why I've been isolating myself. It's like I'm constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop, you know? Always on edge, expecting rejection or humiliation.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight, Jake.",
    "Client: Yeah, it's... it's eye-opening. I've been pushing people away because I'm terrified of getting hurt again. But in doing that, I'm just making myself more lonely, more depressed. It's a vicious cycle.",
    "Therapist: How might you break that cycle?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe I need to start taking small risks? Like, reaching out to old friends, or joining a club at university? It's scary to think about, but I know I can't keep living like this.",
    "Therapist: That's a brave thought. How do you feel about that idea?",
    "Client: Nervous, definitely. But also... hopeful? For the first time in a while, I feel like maybe there's a way forward. Like maybe I'm not doomed to always feel this way.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Jake. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I think... I think I want to keep working on this. These imaginal exposures are tough, but I can see how they're helping me process everything. And I want to try those small steps we talked about. Maybe start with texting an old friend this week? Baby steps, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How are you feeling about our session today?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... good? Like I've done something important. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like I might actually be able to get there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work, Jake. See you next week?",
    "Client: Definitely. Thanks again, Dr. Thompson. See you then."
