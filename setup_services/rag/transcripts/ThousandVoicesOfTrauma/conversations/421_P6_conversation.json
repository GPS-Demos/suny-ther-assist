    "Therapist: Alright, Ahmad. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Just take a deep breath and begin when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm walking down the street, it's late evening. I see flashing lights in the distance, and my heart starts racing. There's a police car parked on the sidewalk, and two officers are questioning someone. I try to keep my head down and walk past quickly, but one of the officers calls out to me. \"Hey, you! Stop right there!\" I freeze, my palms are sweating, and I can feel my throat tightening.",
    "Therapist: How would you rate your SUDS right now?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 6 out of 10. My heart is pounding just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: I see. Continue, please.",
    "Client: The officer approaches me, his hand on his holster. He demands to see my ID, asking what I'm doing in the neighborhood. I stammer, trying to explain that I live nearby, but he cuts me off. \"You fit the description of a suspect we're looking for,\" he says. I can feel myself starting to panic. My mind races, thinking about all the stories I've heard about police brutality. I want to run, but I know that would only make things worse.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's increased to an 8. I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The other officer joins us, and they start questioning me aggressively. I try to remain calm, but my voice is shaking. They ask to search my backpack, and I reluctantly agree, knowing I have nothing to hide. As they rummage through my belongings, I feel utterly helpless and violated. Memories of childhood neglect flood back - that same feeling of powerlessness and fear.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. I feel like I'm right back there, reliving it all over again.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Stay with it if you can.",
    "Client: They find nothing in my bag, of course, but their attitude doesn't change. One officer tells me to turn around and put my hands behind my back. I comply, terrified. I feel the cold metal of handcuffs on my wrists, and tears start to form in my eyes. I'm thinking about my parents, how they were never there to protect me, and now here I am, alone again, facing this nightmare.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's still at a 9. My chest feels tight, and I'm shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: They pat me down roughly, and I feel so humiliated. Finally, after what seems like an eternity, they remove the handcuffs. They warn me to \"stay out of trouble\" and drive away, leaving me standing there, trembling and confused. I feel a mix of relief and anger, but mostly, I feel alone and vulnerable, just like when I was a child.",
    "Therapist: How about your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 7. The immediate danger is gone, but I still feel shaken.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted, honestly. Reliving that memory is draining, but... I also feel a strange sense of accomplishment for getting through it.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Ahmad. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves before we wrap up."
