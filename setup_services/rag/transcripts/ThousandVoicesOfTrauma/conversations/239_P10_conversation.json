    "Therapist: Welcome, Aditya. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to do this, but another part is screaming to run away. It's like my chest is tight, you know? Like I can't get enough air.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Let's start with a deep breath together.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Okay... I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be.",
    "Therapist: Good. Before we begin, what's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably a 6... maybe 7. My hands are sweating.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Let's start. Close your eyes and take us back to that day.",
    "Client: *closes eyes, breathes shakily* I... I see myself. I'm 12 years old. We're in this... dingy room. The walls are yellowed, and there's this smell... like stale cigarettes and something rotten. I'm sitting on a threadbare couch, and my cousin Raj is next to me. He's 14, but he looks so much older right now.",
    "Therapist: Good, Aditya. What's happening now?",
    "Client: There's a man. He's talking to my uncle in rapid Khmer. I... I can't understand everything, but I catch words like \"fresh\" and \"untouched.\" My stomach is in knots. I want to run, but Raj's grip on my arm is too tight.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My... my heart is racing. I feel like I might throw up. My legs are shaking, and I can't stop them. I want my mom... *voice breaks* I want to go home.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Aditya. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe higher. I don't know if I can do this.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. This is just a memory. Take a deep breath and continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *breathes deeply* Okay... The man approaches us. He's... he's examining us like we're cattle. His eyes are cold, and there's a smell of alcohol on his breath. He reaches out to touch my face, and I flinch. Raj squeezes my arm harder, warning me to stay still.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind at this moment?",
    "Client: I... I'm terrified. I don't understand what's happening, but I know it's wrong. I'm thinking about my parents, wondering if they know where I am. I feel... betrayed. How could my uncle do this?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: The man nods, seeming satisfied. He hands my uncle a thick envelope. My uncle... he doesn't even look at us as he pockets the money. The man grabs my arm, and I... I start to struggle. I'm yelling, \"No! Please, no!\" But no one helps. Raj just looks away, his face blank.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Aditya. Remember, you're here now, safe in my office.",
    "Client: *breathing heavily* It's... it's so vivid. I can feel his grip on my arm, smell his breath... I... I think I need a moment.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take a break. Focus on your breath. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: *follows breathing instructions* Okay... okay. I think I can continue.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe a 9. But I want to keep going.",
    "Therapist: Alright. When you're ready, tell me what happens next.",
    "Client: The man... he drags me towards a door. I'm kicking and screaming, but he's so much stronger. I see other children in the hallway, their eyes vacant. Some are crying silently. I... I realize this is real. This is happening.",
    "Therapist: Stay present with that moment, Aditya. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... helpless. Angry. Scared out of my mind. My throat hurts from screaming, and my arms ache where he's gripping me. I... I wet myself. The shame... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: It's okay, Aditya. You're doing incredibly well. Can you describe the room he takes you to?",
    "Client: It's... it's small. There's just a dirty mattress on the floor. The window is boarded up, but a sliver of light comes through. There's... there's a camera in the corner. I don't want to be here. I don't want this.",
    "Therapist: I know this is difficult. Remember, you're safe now. What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he pushes me onto the mattress. I'm crying, begging him to let me go. He just laughs. Says something about how they always cry at first. He... he starts to unbuckle his belt, and I... I can't... *starts hyperventilating*",
    "Therapist: Aditya, let's pause here. Focus on my voice. You're in my office, you're safe. Take deep breaths.",
    "Client: *gasping* I... I can't... It's too much...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's ground ourselves. Can you name five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: *still breathing heavily* I... I see... your desk. The plant in the corner. The... the painting on the wall. My... my hands. And... and the tissue box.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, four things you can touch.",
    "Client: The... the couch cushion. My jeans. My watch. The... the armrest.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Three things you hear?",
    "Client: Your voice. The... the clock ticking. Traffic outside.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Two things you smell?",
    "Client: Coffee... and... and your air freshener.",
    "Therapist: Last one. One thing you can taste?",
    "Client: The... the mint from the water you gave me earlier.",
    "Therapist: Great job, Aditya. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm calmer. My heart isn't racing as much. But I feel... drained. And ashamed.",
    "Therapist: There's no need for shame. You've shown incredible strength today. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 6, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's good progress. Would you like to continue, or should we end the exposure for today?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to stop. It's just... it's too intense right now.",
    "Therapist: That's perfectly okay. You've done excellent work today, Aditya. Let's take a few minutes to debrief and discuss some coping strategies for the rest of your day.",
    "Client: Okay... thank you. I... I didn't think I could even talk about this at all.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable courage. Remember, healing is a process, and you've taken a significant step today.",
    "Client: It's just... it feels so real when I talk about it. Like it's happening all over again.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal part of the process. Over time, these memories will become less overwhelming. Let's discuss some grounding techniques you can use when you feel triggered.",
    "Client: Alright. I... I think that would help. Sometimes I feel like I'm right back there, even when I'm just going about my day.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We'll work on strategies to help you stay present and manage those flashbacks. You're not alone in this, Aditya.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I know it's going to be a long road, but... I think I'm ready to face it now.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. We'll take it one step at a time. For now, let's focus on self-care for the rest of your day. What's something kind you can do for yourself this evening?",
    "Client: I... I think I might take a long shower and then call my girlfriend. She's been really supportive.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like an excellent plan. Remember to be gentle with yourself. You've done difficult work today.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you... for everything.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Aditya. I'm proud of the work you've done today. We'll continue next week, but please reach out if you need support before then.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again.",
    "Therapist: Take care, Aditya. I'll see you next week."
