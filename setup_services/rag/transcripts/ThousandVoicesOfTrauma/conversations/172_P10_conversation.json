    "Therapist: Good morning, Mr. Johnson. How are you feeling about our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: Oh, hello Dr. Miller. I'm... well, I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. Been tossing and turning all night thinking about this. Not sure if I'm ready to revisit all that.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's start slow. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Right, right. I know that in my head, but my heart's still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's begin with some deep breaths. When you're ready, start describing the day of the severe illness.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... It was a Tuesday morning. I remember because I always had coffee with my neighbor on Tuesdays. I woke up feeling... off. Something wasn't right.",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: I'm in my bedroom. The curtains are drawn, but there's a sliver of sunlight peeking through. I can hear the birds chirping outside. It should be a nice day, but I feel... heavy. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed do you feel right now?",
    "Client: Uh... maybe a 40? It's uncomfortable, but I can manage.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what happens next.",
    "Client: I try to sit up, but it's like my body weighs a ton. I'm sweating, even though the room isn't hot. I... I call out for Martha, my wife, but then I remember she's gone. It's just me now.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm scared. Really scared. I think, \"This is it. I'm having a heart attack.\" My left arm is tingling. I reach for the phone on the nightstand, but it slips from my hand. I... I can't...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *inhales shakily* It's hard. I feel so helpless. I manage to grab the phone and dial 911. My voice sounds strange, like it's not mine. I tell them I think I'm having a heart attack.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 60. My heart's pounding just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe. Keep going.",
    "Client: The dispatcher tells me to stay calm, help is on the way. But I'm alone, and I'm terrified. I think about Martha, about how she died in her sleep. I wonder if this is what she felt. The pain in my chest is getting worse.",
    "Therapist: Focus on your breathing. You're here, in the present.",
    "Client: *takes a deep breath* Right, right. I hear sirens in the distance. They're getting closer. I'm trying to stay awake, but I feel so tired. The door... I need to unlock the door for them.",
    "Therapist: How do you manage that?",
    "Client: I... I force myself to stand. The room is spinning. I stumble to the bedroom door, leaning on the wall. Every step is agony. I make it to the front door, fumble with the lock. As soon as I open it, I collapse.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: It's... it's a blur. There are people around me, asking questions. They're putting something on my chest, an oxygen mask on my face. I'm being lifted onto a stretcher. The lights in the ambulance are so bright.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm at about 70. It's intense, reliving this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you survived this. You're here now.",
    "Client: Yes... yes, I did. In the ambulance, I keep thinking about my kids. Will I see them again? Will they find out in time? The paramedic is saying something about my heart rhythm, but I can't focus.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those thoughts. What else do you remember?",
    "Client: The hospital. It's chaos. So many people, so much noise. They're rushing me somewhere. I hear \"Cardiac unit\" and \"immediate surgery.\" I'm... I'm terrified. I don't want to die alone.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: *deep, shaky breath* It's hard... but I'm okay. I remember the anesthesiologist. She had kind eyes. She told me everything would be alright. I wanted to believe her, but I was so scared.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's at 80 now. My chest feels tight just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're here now, safe.",
    "Client: Right... right. The next thing I remember is waking up in recovery. Everything hurts. There are tubes and wires everywhere. But... I'm alive. I made it.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization feel?",
    "Client: It's... overwhelming. Relief, gratitude, but also... sadness. I survived, but Martha didn't. Why me? Why not her?",
    "Therapist: Those are normal thoughts. Stay with them.",
    "Client: I feel guilty. Like I cheated death somehow. The doctor comes in, tells me I had a major heart attack, that I'm lucky to be alive. Lucky? I don't feel lucky. I feel... broken.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still around 80. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here now, you're safe.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Okay... okay. The next few days are a blur of tests and medications. My children arrive. They look so worried. I hate seeing them like that, knowing I caused it.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel seeing them?",
    "Client: Relieved, but also ashamed. I should be stronger for them. They've already lost their mother. I... I promise myself I'll do whatever it takes to get better.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful moment. How does it feel to recall that promise?",
    "Client: It's... it's bittersweet. I kept that promise, I'm still here. But it's been hard. So much has changed.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm at about 65. It's still intense, but I feel... I don't know, maybe a little proud? I survived. I'm still here.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: Okay... *deep breath* I can feel the chair beneath me. I can hear the ticking of the clock. I'm here, I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How would you like to conclude this session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'm okay. It was hard, but I did it. I faced it. Maybe next time it won't be so scary to remember.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today, Mr. Johnson. I'm proud of your progress.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Miller. It means a lot to hear that. I'm... I'm glad I came today.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful to hear. We'll end here for today. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
