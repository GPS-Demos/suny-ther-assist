    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I've been dreading this all week. My stomach's in knots, and I keep second-guessing whether I'm ready for this.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Can you rate your distress on a scale of 0-100?",
    "Client: Um, probably around 70? Yeah, definitely a 70.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Let's start with some deep breaths. When you're ready, begin describing the event as if it's happening now.",
    "Client: *takes a deep breath* Alright... I'm... I'm at the grocery store. It's a Saturday afternoon, and I'm picking up some things for dinner. The store is busy, lots of people rushing around. I'm in the produce section, choosing some tomatoes. I can smell the fresh fruits and vegetables. The fluorescent lights are bright overhead.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue describing what you see and hear.",
    "Client: I hear raised voices coming from the next aisle. At first, I try to ignore it, thinking it's just a disagreement. But then I hear a crash, like something falling off a shelf. My heart starts racing. I peek around the corner and... oh God...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it, Sarah. What do you see?",
    "Client: There's a man... he's shouting racial slurs at an elderly Asian woman. He's knocked her cart over, groceries are scattered everywhere. She looks terrified, frozen in place. I... I can't believe this is happening. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 85. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: *takes a shaky breath* Okay... The man is getting closer to her, still yelling. Other shoppers are just... watching. Nobody's doing anything. I feel sick to my stomach. I want to help, but I'm scared. What if he turns on me?",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in that moment?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... I'm a coward. I should do something. But I'm also terrified. My heart's pounding so hard I can hear it in my ears.",
    "Therapist: Continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: A store employee finally comes over. He's young, probably just a teenager. He tries to calm the man down, but he's clearly out of his depth. The man shoves him aside. I gasp, and suddenly the man's attention is on me. He glares at me, and I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What do you feel in your body?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. My palms are sweaty. I feel like I might pass out. The fluorescent lights seem even brighter now, almost blinding. The smell of spilled milk from the knocked-over cart is making me nauseous.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's 90 now. This is really intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: *nods* The man starts walking towards me. I'm frozen in place. But then... then I hear sirens. Someone must have called the police. The man hears it too, and he suddenly bolts for the exit. I'm still standing there, shaking. The elderly woman is crying softly. I... I finally move to help her.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to help her?",
    "Client: I feel... ashamed it took me so long. But also relieved. My hands are still shaking as I help her pick up her groceries. She thanks me in broken English, and I feel a lump in my throat. I want to apologize for not acting sooner, but the words won't come out.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... what if I had spoken up sooner? What if I had been braver? Maybe I could have prevented it from escalating. I feel like a failure.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're not responsible for the attacker's actions. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 75 now. Still high, but not as bad.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue with what happened next.",
    "Client: The police arrive. They're asking questions, taking statements. I give mine, but I feel disconnected, like I'm watching it all happen from outside my body. The adrenaline is wearing off, and I just feel... drained. Empty.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: Heavy. My shoulders are tense, and I have a headache forming. I just want to go home, but I know I need to stay and give my statement.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Sarah. Keep going.",
    "Client: After what feels like hours, they finally let us leave. I abandon my shopping cart and just... go. I get to my car and sit there, hands gripping the steering wheel. I can't stop replaying it in my mind. The man's angry face, the woman's fear, the sound of the cart crashing...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Overwhelmed. Guilty. Angry at myself for not doing more. Angry at the world for letting things like this happen. I... I start crying in my car. I can't stop.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's back up to 85. I just... I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now, Sarah. Take another deep breath.",
    "Client: *breathes deeply* I... I eventually calm down enough to drive home. But I can't shake the feeling of guilt. When I get home, my husband notices something's wrong. I break down again trying to tell him what happened.",
    "Therapist: How does your husband respond?",
    "Client: He's supportive. He holds me while I cry. But I can see the shock on his face. He doesn't really understand. How could he? He wasn't there. I feel... alone, even with him right there.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I try to distract myself. I take a long, hot shower. I can still smell the grocery store on me, and I scrub until my skin is red. But it doesn't help. I can't eat dinner. I just... sit on the couch, staring at the TV without really watching it.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 70. I'm exhausted, but my mind won't stop racing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. We're almost done. Can you describe how you felt in the days following?",
    "Client: I... I couldn't sleep well. I kept having nightmares about the incident, but worse. Sometimes I was the one being attacked. Sometimes I was just watching, unable to move or speak. I... I stopped going to that grocery store. I avoided going out as much as possible. Every time I saw someone who looked like that man, my heart would race.",
    "Therapist: How did this affect your daily life?",
    "Client: It... it changed everything. I became hypervigilant. Always looking over my shoulder, always on edge. I started having panic attacks in crowded places. I felt... I felt like I couldn't trust the world anymore. Like at any moment, something horrible could happen, and I'd be powerless to stop it.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level as we finish recounting this memory?",
    "Client: It's... it's at a 65 now. I'm drained, but... I also feel a little lighter, somehow. Like... like I've let some of it out.",
    "Therapist: You've done an incredible job, Sarah. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay... *takes a deep breath* Thank you. This was hard, but... I think it helped.",
    "Therapist: You showed great courage today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted, but... there's a small sense of relief. Like I've started to process it instead of just pushing it away. It's still painful, but... maybe a little less overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. We'll continue to work through this in our future sessions. For now, let's focus on some self-care strategies for the rest of your day."
