    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Patel. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a mix of emotions. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is... hesitant. It's not easy to revisit that day.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start by checking your SUDS level.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 5 right now. Just thinking about it is making my stomach churn a bit.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we're here to work through this together. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Yes, I think so. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day.",
    "Client: (Closes eyes) It's... it's a Saturday morning. I remember because I usually sleep in, but that day I woke up early. The sun was just coming up, casting this golden light through the kitchen window. I'm making coffee, and I hear my wife, Priya, shuffling around upstairs.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: We're planning to go to the market. It's something we do every weekend. I'm... I'm sipping my coffee, waiting for Priya to come down. Then I hear this... this commotion outside. Shouting, angry voices.",
    "Therapist: What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I put my mug down. It makes this loud 'clunk' on the counter. My heart starts racing. I walk to the window, and I see... oh god...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What do you see?",
    "Client: There's a group of men. They're... they're surrounding someone. I can't see who it is at first. They're yelling, pushing. Then I see a flash of metal. A knife. Oh god, they have a knife.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to an 8. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Feel your feet on the floor. You're here, in this room.",
    "Client: (Breathes deeply) Okay... okay. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. Can you continue?",
    "Client: Yes... I... I yell for Priya to call the police. I'm fumbling with the door lock. My fingers feel numb. I finally get it open and I'm running out. The air is cold, it hits my face like a slap.",
    "Therapist: What happens as you get closer?",
    "Client: I'm shouting at them to stop. My voice sounds strange, like it's not mine. They turn and look at me. I see their faces... they're just kids. Teenagers. But their eyes... they look so... empty.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Terrified. Confused. I... I freeze for a moment. That's when I see who they're attacking. It's Mr. Singh, the old man who runs the corner store. He's on the ground, not moving.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you notice?",
    "Client: There's... there's blood. On the pavement. On their hands. The smell... it's metallic. I feel sick. I can hear sirens in the distance, getting closer.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. My chest feels tight. I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe with me. In... and out. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Breathes shakily) Okay... I'm... I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: Can you continue?",
    "Client: Yes... The kids, they start to run. But one of them... he looks right at me. He's holding the knife. It's dripping... oh god. He takes a step towards me.",
    "Therapist: What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I can't move. My feet feel like they're made of lead. He's getting closer. I can see the blood on his shirt. His eyes... they're so cold. I think... I think he's going to kill me too.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you survived this. You're here now.",
    "Client: Right... right. Just then, the police car turns the corner. Its lights are flashing, painting everything in red and blue. The kid... he hesitates. Then he throws the knife down and runs.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel in that moment?",
    "Client: Relieved... but also... guilty. I should have done more. I should have helped Mr. Singh sooner. Maybe if I had...",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. You did what you could in a dangerous situation.",
    "Client: (Voice breaking) But it wasn't enough. Mr. Singh... he died. Right there on the street. I watched as the paramedics tried to save him. But it was too late.",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly difficult to witness. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still at 9. I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. Feel the chair supporting you.",
    "Client: (Breathes) I... I remember sitting on the curb. The police were asking me questions, but I couldn't focus. I kept looking at the spot where Mr. Singh had been. There was so much blood...",
    "Therapist: What were you thinking?",
    "Client: That it could have been me. That life is so... fragile. One moment Mr. Singh was probably thinking about opening his store, and the next... he was gone. Just like that.",
    "Therapist: How did this event change you?",
    "Client: I... I became afraid. Of everything. I stopped going to the market. I couldn't sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that kid with the knife. I saw Mr. Singh's lifeless body. I... I felt like I failed him.",
    "Therapist: It's important to remember that you're not responsible for what happened.",
    "Client: I know that... logically. But emotionally? It's hard. I keep thinking about his family. His grandkids. He used to show me their pictures all the time when I'd go to his store.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 7. Talking about it... it helps. But it still hurts.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. Can you tell me more about the aftermath?",
    "Client: The neighborhood changed. People were scared. The store stayed closed for months. I... I couldn't walk past it without feeling sick. And the nightmares... they were constant.",
    "Therapist: How did you cope?",
    "Client: At first, I didn't. I drank too much. I pushed Priya away. I was angry all the time. But then... then I realized I was letting those kids take even more from me. From us.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. What did you do?",
    "Client: I... I started talking to a counselor. I joined a support group for witnesses of violent crimes. And slowly... slowly, things got better. But I still struggle. Especially on quiet Saturday mornings.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. But... lighter, somehow. Like I've set down a heavy weight I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's good. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5 now. Still there, but... manageable.",
    "Therapist: You've done well today. How do you feel about the progress you've made?",
    "Client: I... I'm surprised. I didn't think I could talk about it like this. It's still painful, but... it feels less overwhelming. Like maybe... maybe I can learn to live with it.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. Is there anything else you want to share before we end?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening. For helping me face this. I know there's still a long way to go, but... I feel hopeful. For the first time in a long time, I feel hopeful.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful to hear. We'll continue working through this together.",
    "Client: (Nods) I'm ready. It won't be easy, but... I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: That's all we have time for today. Well done, Mr. Patel."
