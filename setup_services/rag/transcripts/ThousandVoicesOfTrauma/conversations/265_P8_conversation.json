    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing but also frozen at the same time. The memory of that airplane crash... it's so vivid. I can still hear the screams, the metal tearing. My heart is pounding just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Overwhelming fear. It's like I'm right back there, watching the plane go down. I keep thinking about all those people, their families... and how easily it could have been me. I fly so often for work, you know? It's... it's terrifying to think about.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How does that fear feel in your body?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, like I can't get enough air. My hands are shaking a bit, and I feel this knot in my stomach. It's like my whole body is on high alert, waiting for something terrible to happen.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"What if I had been on that plane?\" Or worse, \"What if my family had been on it?\" I feel so... helpless. Like at any moment, everything could be taken away from me. And then I feel guilty for even thinking about myself when so many others lost their lives.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt manifest for you?",
    "Client: It's... it's heavy. Like a weight on my shoulders. I feel like I don't have the right to be upset or scared because I wasn't directly involved. But then I remember how it triggered all those memories of the emotional abuse from my childhood, and I feel overwhelmed all over again.",
    "Therapist: Can you tell me more about that connection?",
    "Client: Well, during the abuse, I always felt powerless and afraid, like I had no control over what was happening to me. Watching that plane crash, it brought back all those feelings. The helplessness, the fear, the sense that the world isn't safe. It's like... it's like I'm that scared little girl again, waiting for the next bad thing to happen.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with those feelings now?",
    "Client: I... I try to remind myself that I'm not that helpless child anymore. I have resources now, people who support me. But it's hard. Sometimes I find myself constantly checking the news, looking for any signs of danger. Other times, I withdraw from everyone, thinking if I just stay home, I'll be safe.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about those coping strategies?",
    "Client: I guess... they're not really helping, are they? Checking the news just makes me more anxious, and isolating myself doesn't make the fear go away. It's just... it's hard to know what to do with all these feelings.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What would you like to work on moving forward?",
    "Client: I want to feel safe again. I want to be able to travel without this constant fear hanging over me. And I want to stop letting these memories control my life. I'm tired of feeling like a victim all the time.",
    "Therapist: Those are great goals. How do you think we can start working towards them?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe we could work on some coping strategies for when I'm feeling overwhelmed? And perhaps find ways to challenge some of these thoughts I'm having? I know logically that not every flight is going to crash, but it's hard to convince my emotions of that.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What else comes to mind?",
    "Client: I think I need to work on processing some of the emotions from my childhood too. The plane crash brought up so much of that old pain, and I realize I've never really dealt with it. It's like... it's like I've been running from it all these years, and now it's caught up with me.",
    "Therapist: That's a profound realization. How does it feel to acknowledge that?",
    "Client: It's scary, but also... kind of relieving? Like maybe if I face it head-on, I can finally start to heal. I'm tired of carrying all this around with me. I want to be able to enjoy my life without constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop.",
    "Therapist: What support do you need to start that process?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need reassurance that it's okay to feel these things. That I'm not weak for being affected by what happened. And maybe some guidance on how to start processing all of this without getting overwhelmed. It feels like such a big task.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid needs. Shall we discuss some strategies?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I'm ready to start working on this. It won't be easy, I know, but I think it's time. I want to reclaim my life from this fear and anxiety. I want to be able to think about that plane crash without feeling like I'm right back there. And I want to be able to think about my childhood without feeling like that scared, helpless little girl. I'm ready to start healing.",
    "Therapist: That's a courageous step. Where would you like to begin?"
