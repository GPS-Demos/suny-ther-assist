    "Therapist: Welcome, Amir. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do. I've been thinking a lot about my uncle since our last session.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We'll be starting imaginal exposure today. Are you ready to discuss it?",
    "Client: I think so. But to be honest, I'm not sure what to expect. Can you explain what imaginal exposure is exactly?",
    "Therapist: Of course. It's a technique where we'll revisit your traumatic memory in a safe environment. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It sounds... scary, actually. I've been trying so hard not to think about my uncle's illness and death. Won't this make things worse?",
    "Therapist: Your concern is valid. However, this process can help reduce PTSD symptoms. Shall I explain how?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I want to understand why we're doing this if it's going to be so difficult.",
    "Therapist: By facing the memory, we can process it more effectively. This can lead to reduced anxiety over time.",
    "Client: I see. But what if I can't handle it? What if I completely break down during the session?",
    "Therapist: That's a common worry. I'll be here to support you throughout. We can pause anytime you need.",
    "Client: Okay, that's reassuring. How long will this process take? And what exactly will I need to do?",
    "Therapist: We'll spend about 30-45 minutes on the exposure. You'll describe the memory in present tense, with details.",
    "Client: Present tense? That sounds intense. I'm not sure I can do this. What if I forget important details?",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel uncertain. Remember, there's no right or wrong way. Just share what comes to mind.",
    "Client: Alright. I'll try my best. But what if this brings up other painful memories? I'm worried about opening Pandora's box.",
    "Therapist: That's a valid concern. We'll focus on this specific memory, but if others arise, we can address them later.",
    "Client: Okay. I appreciate your guidance. I'm still nervous, but I think I'm ready to give this a try. What's the first step?",
    "Therapist: Let's start with a relaxation exercise. Then, when you're ready, begin describing the day your uncle fell ill.",
    "Client: Alright. I'll do my best. Thank you for being here with me through this. It means a lot to have your support.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Amir. Your courage is admirable. Shall we begin the relaxation exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do it. I'm as ready as I'll ever be."
