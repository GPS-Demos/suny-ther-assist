    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the natural disaster experience?",
    "Client: Okay... It was a cyclone. I was at home with my parents when it hit. The wind was so loud, like a freight train. Trees were bending sideways, and I could hear things crashing outside.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Continue describing what you saw and felt.",
    "Client: I felt terrified. The windows were rattling, and I thought they might shatter at any moment. My mom was crying, and my dad was trying to comfort her, but I could see the fear in his eyes too. I felt so helpless.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: The power went out, and it was pitch black. We huddled in the hallway, away from the windows. I remember the sound of something heavy hitting the roof, and I was sure the house would collapse on us. My heart was racing so fast, I thought I might pass out.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: It's hard to talk about... I can still hear the wind howling. We stayed in that hallway for hours, not knowing if we'd make it through the night. I kept thinking about my friends, wondering if they were okay.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: When the storm finally passed, we emerged to see the destruction. Our neighborhood was unrecognizable. Trees were uprooted, cars overturned, and some houses were completely gone. It was like a war zone. I felt guilty for being relieved that our house was still standing when others had lost everything.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have mixed feelings. You're doing great.",
    "Client: In the days that followed, I couldn't sleep. Every time the wind picked up, I'd panic, thinking another cyclone was coming. I'd check the weather obsessively. Even now, years later, I get anxious during storm season.",
    "Therapist: You're processing this well. How do you feel right now?",
    "Client: I feel... shaky. My hands are clammy, and my heart is racing a bit. Talking about it brings back those feelings of fear and uncertainty. But I also feel a little lighter, like I'm not carrying the weight of it all by myself anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I think what scared me most was the realization of how powerless we are against nature. One day everything's normal, and the next, your whole world is turned upside down. It made me feel so small and vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great strength. Continue.",
    "Client: After the cyclone, I became hyper-vigilant about safety. I'd make elaborate emergency plans, stock up on supplies, and insist my family do the same. It put a strain on my relationships because I was always preparing for the worst.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. You're doing well.",
    "Client: I guess I'm still struggling with that fear. Every time I hear about a natural disaster anywhere in the world, it brings back those memories. I want to be able to feel safe again, to not let this experience control my life so much.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel drained, but also a bit relieved. Talking about it is hard, but I can see how it might help me process things better. I want to be able to face stormy weather without panicking, to enjoy the sound of rain again without fearing it might turn into something worse.",
    "Therapist: You're showing remarkable resilience.",
    "Client: Thank you. I know it's a long process, but I'm hopeful that I can work through this. I want to be able to support others who've been through similar experiences, to use what I've learned to help people prepare and cope with natural disasters.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive outlook. Well done today.",
    "Client: I appreciate your guidance through this. It's tough to relive these memories, but I feel like I'm starting to see them from a different perspective. Maybe I can find some strength in knowing I survived such a terrifying experience.",
    "Therapist: You've made excellent progress today."
