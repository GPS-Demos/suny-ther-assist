    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Thompson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this session all week. The idea of revisiting that animal attack... it's making my anxiety flare up.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. We'll take it step by step.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your understanding. It's just... ever since that day at the beach, I've been struggling to feel safe anywhere. Even here in your office, I find myself constantly scanning for threats. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: That's what we're here to address. Shall we discuss today's plan?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I know we've talked about exposure therapy before, but I'm still not entirely sure what to expect.",
    "Therapist: We'll do an imaginal exposure. You'll recount the event in detail.",
    "Client: In detail? Oh, goodness. I'm not sure I can do that without falling apart. The last time I tried to talk about it, I had a panic attack. What if that happens again?",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel anxious. I'll guide you through it.",
    "Client: Okay... I trust you. But can you tell me more about why we need to do this? It feels counterintuitive to purposely revisit such a traumatic experience.",
    "Therapist: It helps process the memory and reduce its power over you.",
    "Client: I see. So by facing it head-on, we're trying to take away its ability to control my emotions and reactions. That makes sense, but it's still scary. What should I expect to feel during this exercise?",
    "Therapist: You may experience strong emotions. That's okay and normal.",
    "Client: Strong emotions... I'm worried about that. Since the attack, I've been trying so hard to keep my emotions in check. The idea of letting them out here... it's frightening. Will you help me if it becomes too overwhelming?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We can pause anytime. Your safety is my priority.",
    "Client: That's reassuring, thank you. I suppose I should also mention that since we last met, I've been having more vivid nightmares about the attack. Is that normal? Will this exercise help with those too?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it's common. This process often helps reduce nightmares.",
    "Client: That would be wonderful. They've been affecting my sleep, which in turn impacts my work and relationship with my husband. He's been so supportive, but I know it's hard on him too. I really want to get better, not just for me, but for him as well.",
    "Therapist: Your motivation is admirable. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. Yes, I'm ready. But could you remind me one more time why this is important? I need to hear it to gather my courage.",
    "Therapist: This helps you regain control and heal. You're very brave.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot to hear. Okay, I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Where do we start? Do I just... start talking about what happened?",
    "Therapist: Yes. Start from the beginning. Take your time.",
    "Client: Alright. Well, it was a beautiful day. My husband and I had decided to take a walk along the beach...",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue at your own pace."
