    "Therapist: Alright, Mrs. Chen. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's begin. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day of the hostage situation.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm there. It's so vivid. I can see the bank lobby, smell the musty air. My heart is already starting to race.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: It's about a 5... no, maybe a 6.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The men burst in, waving guns. Everyone starts screaming. I... I freeze. I can't move. My legs feel like lead.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: My mouth is dry. I can taste fear... it's metallic. The men are shouting, but it sounds muffled, like I'm underwater.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to an 8. My hands are shaking just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: They're herding us into a corner. I can smell someone's perfume... it's sickly sweet. A woman next to me is sobbing. I want to comfort her, but I'm paralyzed.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking, \"This is how I die.\" I'm convinced I'll never see my family again. Oh god, it's awful.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Keep describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: I'm trying to make myself smaller, invisible. The gunmen are pacing, arguing. One of them looks so young, just a boy really. I remember thinking how sad that was.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling physically right now?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. I'm sweating. I can feel my heart pounding in my ears.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: Still a 9. It's not getting any easier.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're doing great. Continue.",
    "Client: Hours pass. It feels like days. The air is thick, stuffy. People are getting restless. I'm so thirsty, but too scared to ask for water.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind at this point?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm praying. Bargaining with God. Promising anything if we all get out alive.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's dropped a bit. Maybe a 7? Talking about it... it's hard, but it's not as overwhelming as before.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Keep going.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's commotion. The police are here. There's shouting, a loud bang. I think it's a gunshot, but it might be a flashbang. Everything's chaotic.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: Terrified, but... hopeful? It's a strange mix. My heart's racing again, but there's a glimmer of relief.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's back up to an 8. The uncertainty is awful.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What happens next?",
    "Client: It's all a blur. The police rush in. We're being ushered out. I can barely stand, my legs are so weak. The sunlight outside is blinding.",
    "Therapist: What sensations do you notice as you exit?",
    "Client: The fresh air hits me like a wave. I'm gulping it down. My eyes are stinging - from tears or the bright light, I'm not sure. I feel dizzy, lightheaded.",
    "Therapist: And your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 6 now. I'm shaky, but... I made it out. We all did.",
    "Therapist: Well done, Mrs. Chen. You've done an excellent job today. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... relieved, I think. It's still hard to talk about, but it feels a little less overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end the session."
