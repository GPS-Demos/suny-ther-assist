    "Therapist: Hello Maria, how are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Ramirez. I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares lately about the hostage situation at the hospital. It's been hard to focus at work, and I feel like I'm constantly on edge.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's talk about today's session.",
    "Client: Okay... What exactly are we going to do? You mentioned something about imaginal exposure last time, but I'm not sure I fully grasp what that means.",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit your trauma memory in a safe space. It helps process the experience.",
    "Client: Revisit it? I... I don't know if I can do that. Just thinking about it makes my heart race. What if I panic? Or what if it makes everything worse?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace, and I'll support you throughout.",
    "Client: I appreciate that, but... it's just so vivid, you know? I can still hear the gunshots, smell the antiseptic... It's like I'm right back there in that moment. How is reliving that supposed to help?",
    "Therapist: Exposure helps your brain process the memory, reducing its power over time.",
    "Client: I see. But what if I get overwhelmed? Or what if I can't stop crying? I'm worried about losing control.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel emotional. We can pause anytime you need to.",
    "Client: Alright... I trust you, Dr. Ramirez. It's just... this is a big step for me. I've been avoiding thinking about it for so long. What should I expect to feel during this?",
    "Therapist: You might experience anxiety, but it typically decreases as we progress.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm scared, but I want to get better. For my family, for myself. I'm tired of feeling trapped by this memory. How long will this process take?",
    "Therapist: It varies, but we'll work at your pace. Your bravery is commendable, Maria.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot. I've been feeling so weak lately, like I can't handle my own emotions. It's affecting my work, my relationships... I just want to feel like myself again.",
    "Therapist: You're not weak. Facing trauma takes immense strength.",
    "Client: I hope you're right. Okay, I think I'm ready to try this. Can you walk me through exactly what we'll be doing?",
    "Therapist: We'll start with relaxation exercises, then you'll describe the memory in detail.",
    "Client: In detail? That sounds... intense. But I understand why it's necessary. Will you be guiding me through it?",
    "Therapist: Yes, I'll guide you. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm nervous, but I'm also feeling a glimmer of hope. Maybe this will help me move forward. Is there anything I should do to prepare before we start?",
    "Therapist: Just take some deep breaths. We'll begin when you're ready.",
    "Client: Alright. I'm taking those deep breaths now. It's helping a little. Dr. Ramirez, thank you for your patience with me. I know I ask a lot of questions, but it helps me feel more in control.",
    "Therapist: Your questions are welcome. It's important you feel comfortable.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think... I think I'm ready to start now. Let's do this before I lose my nerve.",
    "Therapist: You're very courageous, Maria. Let's begin with a relaxation exercise."
