    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. Talking about my illness always brings up a lot of emotions. It's not easy, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to work through this together. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. As ready as I'll ever be, I guess.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in the doctor's office. The walls are this sterile white color, and there's this faint smell of antiseptic. I'm sitting on the exam table, and the paper is crinkling underneath me every time I shift. My wife, Sarah, she's sitting in a chair next to me. Her hand is on my knee, but I can feel it trembling.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: The doctor comes in. He's holding a clipboard, and his face... it's so serious. I remember thinking, \"This can't be good.\" He sits down on his little stool, and he's looking at us with this... this pitying expression. I hate that look.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, John?",
    "Client: My heart's racing a bit. I'd say... maybe a 6 on the SUDS scale?",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Right... So, the doctor starts talking. He's using all these medical terms, but I catch enough to understand. Cancer. Advanced stage. My mind just... it goes blank for a moment. I hear Sarah gasp beside me, but it sounds far away, like I'm underwater or something.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I... I'm thinking about my grandkids. Will I see them grow up? Will I be there for their graduations, their weddings? And then I think about Sarah. We've been together for so long, and now... now this might be the end. It's not fair. We were supposed to have more time.",
    "Therapist: I hear the pain in your voice, John. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe an 8 now.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. Remember, you're here with me, in a safe place. Can you tell me something you can see in the room right now?",
    "Client: I... I can see the painting on your wall. The one with the ocean.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, when you're ready, let's go back to that moment in the doctor's office.",
    "Client: Okay... The doctor is still talking. He's explaining treatment options, but it all sounds like gibberish to me. I'm nodding, but I'm not really hearing him. I feel Sarah's grip on my knee tighten. I look at her, and she's crying silently. I want to comfort her, but I can't move. I feel... paralyzed.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind at this point?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm angry. Why me? I've lived a good life, tried to be a good person. And now this? It's not fair. And then I feel guilty for being angry because I know there are people worse off than me. But mostly, I'm scared. I'm terrified of what's coming.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel all those emotions, John. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. Maybe a 9 on the SUDS scale.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're safe here. Can you tell me something you can hear right now?",
    "Client: I can hear the ticking of the clock on your desk.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, let's continue with what happened next in the doctor's office.",
    "Client: The doctor finishes talking, and he asks if we have any questions. I have a million questions, but I can't voice any of them. Sarah speaks up, asking about treatment plans, success rates, side effects. I'm grateful for her strength because I feel like I'm falling apart inside.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: My shoulders are tense, and my stomach feels like it's tied in knots. I can feel my heart pounding in my chest. It's like... like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop, you know?",
    "Therapist: I understand. You're doing great, John. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's still pretty high. Maybe an 8.5.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to breathe. Remember, you've survived this moment. What happens as you leave the doctor's office?",
    "Client: We... we walk out in a daze. The receptionist hands us some pamphlets, but I can barely focus on them. Sarah's holding onto my arm, and I can feel her shaking. We get to the car, and that's when it really hits me. I break down. I start sobbing right there in the parking lot.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... overwhelmed. Like the world is crashing down around me. But also, there's this... this strange sense of relief. Like, at least now we know what we're dealing with. It's terrible, but it's not the unknown anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a very common reaction. How are you feeling right now, in this moment?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. My chest feels tight. I'd say I'm at a 9 on the SUDS scale.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here with me, and you're safe. Can you tell me something you can smell right now?",
    "Client: I... I can smell the lavender from that diffuser you have.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, let's continue with what happened after you got in the car.",
    "Client: We... we just sat there for a while. Neither of us could bring ourselves to start the car. Sarah reached over and took my hand. She said, \"We'll get through this together.\" And I wanted to believe her, but part of me was already thinking about... about what would happen to her after I was gone.",
    "Therapist: That must have been a very difficult moment. What were you thinking?",
    "Client: I was thinking about all the things I might miss. All the moments with my family that I'd taken for granted. And I was angry at myself for not appreciating them more. But mostly, I was scared. Scared of the pain, scared of leaving Sarah alone, scared of... of dying.",
    "Therapist: It's completely normal to have those fears. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still pretty intense. Maybe an 8 on the SUDS scale.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, John. Remember, you've survived this moment. What happened when you got home?",
    "Client: We... we walked into the house, and everything looked the same, but it all felt different. Like we'd stepped into a parallel universe where everything was just slightly off. Sarah went to make some tea, and I sat down in my armchair. I remember looking at all our family photos on the mantle and wondering how many more memories we'd get to make.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel a deep sadness. But also, there's this... this determination starting to form. Like, I'm not going to let this beat me without a fight. I remember thinking, \"I'm not done yet. I've got more living to do.\"",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually coming down a bit. Maybe a 7 now.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, John. You're doing really well. Can you tell me what happened next?",
    "Client: Sarah came back with the tea, and we just sat there for a while, holding hands. We didn't talk much, but we didn't need to. After a bit, I said, \"We should call the kids.\" And Sarah nodded. That was... that was one of the hardest things. Telling our children.",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly difficult. How did you manage that conversation?",
    "Client: It was... it was tough. We called them one by one. Each time, having to say those words... \"I have cancer\"... it made it more real. But also, hearing their voices, their love and support... it gave me strength. Our youngest, she said, \"Dad, you're the strongest person I know. If anyone can beat this, it's you.\" And that... that meant everything to me.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a powerful moment. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm actually feeling a bit better. Maybe a 6 on the SUDS scale. Remembering their support... it helps.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent, John. You've done really well today. Let's start wrapping up. Can you tell me three things you're grateful for right now?",
    "Client: I'm grateful for Sarah's unwavering support. I'm grateful for my children and their love. And I'm grateful for the time I have, however much that might be.",
    "Therapist: Those are beautiful things to be grateful for. How are you feeling as we end this session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling drained, but also... lighter somehow. Like I've let go of some of the weight I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after these sessions. You've done excellent work today, John. Remember to be kind to yourself and practice your relaxation techniques. We'll pick up here next time.",
    "Client: Thank you. This... this helps. It's not easy, but it helps.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, John. I'll see you next week."
