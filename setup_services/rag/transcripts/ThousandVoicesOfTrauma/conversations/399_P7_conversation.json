    "Therapist: Good morning, Mr. Johnson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Morning, Dr. Miller. I'm... I'm not sure. A bit nervous, I guess. I know we're going to talk about my divorce today, and it's still hard to think about.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's just... even after all this time, it still feels raw. Sarah and I were together for 35 years. That's more than half my life.",
    "Therapist: I hear you. Let's start slowly. Can you tell me about the day you realized it was over?",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) It was a Tuesday. I remember because I had just gotten home from a business trip. I walked in, and Sarah was sitting at the kitchen table. She didn't even look up when I came in. That's when I knew something was wrong.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: She... she said she couldn't do it anymore. That we'd grown apart. I stood there, frozen. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. We'd had our problems, sure, but I thought we were working through them.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) I felt like the floor was falling out from under me. All those years, all those memories... suddenly, they felt tainted. I remember asking her if there was someone else, and she just looked away. That silence... it was deafening.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What were you feeling?",
    "Client: Anger. Betrayal. But mostly, I felt... lost. Like I didn't know who I was anymore. We'd been \"Tom and Sarah\" for so long, I didn't know how to be just \"Tom\" anymore.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: I remember stumbling to the couch and sitting down. My legs felt weak. Sarah was talking, explaining things, but I couldn't really hear her. It was like I was underwater. All I could think was, \"This is it. This is how my marriage ends.\"",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How did your body feel in that moment?",
    "Client: My chest felt tight, like I couldn't breathe. My hands were shaking. I felt hot and cold at the same time. It was like my body was going into shock.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I started to cry. I'm not usually an emotional man, but in that moment, I couldn't hold it back. Sarah tried to comfort me, but I pushed her away. I couldn't bear her touch. It felt like a lie.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice breaking) I asked her why. Why now? Why after all these years? She said she'd been unhappy for a long time, that she'd tried to make it work. But I hadn't seen it. How could I not have seen it?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happened next?",
    "Client: I got up and walked out. I couldn't be in that house anymore. I drove around for hours, just... trying to process it all. When I came back, Sarah was gone. She'd packed a bag and left a note saying she was staying with her sister.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, recalling this?",
    "Client: It's... it's still painful. But it's different now. Back then, it felt like the end of the world. Now, it's more like... a dull ache. I'm angry at myself for not seeing the signs, for not doing more to save our marriage.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. Remember, you're not alone in this.",
    "Client: I know. It's just... hard. We built a life together, you know? We had plans for retirement, for traveling. Now, I'm 64 and starting over. It's terrifying.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage. How do you see your future now?",
    "Client: (sighs) I'm not sure. Some days, I feel hopeful. Other days, it's hard to imagine a future at all. I miss the certainty I used to have. I miss knowing what my life was going to look like.",
    "Therapist: That uncertainty is normal. You're navigating this well.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm trying. It's just... hard to let go of the life I thought I was going to have. Hard to accept that Sarah and I are really over.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. How do you feel about sharing this today?",
    "Client: It's... it's tough. But I think it helps to talk about it. To say it out loud. Makes it feel more real, you know? And maybe... maybe that's the first step to moving forward.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. We'll end here for today.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you, Dr. Miller. I appreciate your help with this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Mr. Johnson. Take care."
