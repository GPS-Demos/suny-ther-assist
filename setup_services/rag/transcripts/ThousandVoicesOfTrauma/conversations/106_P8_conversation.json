    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is buzzing, you know? My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. The memory of being in that hospital bed, it just... it brings everything back so vividly. I can almost smell the disinfectant and hear the beeping of the machines.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how alone I felt. Even though my wife was there, it's like... I was in this bubble of fear and pain. I remember looking at the ceiling, counting the tiles over and over, trying to distract myself from the fear that I might not make it. It's silly, but I kept thinking about all the things I hadn't done yet, you know? Like, will I ever see my kid graduate? Will I get to retire and travel like we always talked about?",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly overwhelming. How are you coping with those feelings now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. I'm trying to remind myself that I did make it, that I'm here now. But there's this lingering anxiety, like maybe it could happen again at any moment. I find myself checking my pulse more often, or getting worried about little aches and pains. It's exhausting, always being on guard like that.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your body as you share this?",
    "Client: I... wow, I didn't even realize, but my shoulders are so tense. And my breathing... it's shallow. I guess I'm still holding onto that fear, even now. It's like my body remembers even when my mind is trying to move on.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful observation. How does recognizing that make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's kind of a relief, actually. Like, maybe I'm not going crazy. My body is just trying to protect me, even if it's not really necessary anymore. But it's frustrating too, you know? I want to be able to relax, to not always be waiting for the other shoe to drop.",
    "Therapist: Mm. What would it mean to you to be able to relax?",
    "Client: God, it would mean everything. To be able to play with my kids without worrying that every twinge is a sign of something worse. To be able to go to sleep at night without running through a mental checklist of symptoms. To just... exist, without this constant undercurrent of fear. I miss that feeling of being carefree, of taking my health for granted.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a powerful goal. What small step could you take towards that?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe I could try to focus on the present more? Like, when I'm with my family, really be there instead of getting lost in my worries. Or maybe I could talk to my wife more about how I'm feeling, instead of trying to handle it all on my own.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like great ideas. How does it feel to consider those options?",
    "Client: It's a little scary, to be honest. Opening up, being vulnerable... it's not something I'm used to. But there's also this tiny spark of hope. Like, maybe I don't have to carry all this alone. Maybe there's a way to get back to feeling more like myself.",
    "Therapist: That hope is important. What else are you noticing as we talk?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling a bit lighter, actually. Like some of the weight has lifted just by talking about it. My breathing feels a little easier. It's strange, but revisiting that memory, as hard as it was, it's like... it's lost some of its power. It's still there, still painful, but it feels less overwhelming somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant shift. How might you build on this feeling?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to keep talking about it. Not just here, but with my wife, maybe even with close friends. And maybe I need to remind myself more often that I did survive, that I am okay now. It's like... I've been so focused on the fear and the pain that I forgot to acknowledge my own strength in getting through it.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it feel to recognize your strength?",
    "Client: It's... it's good. Really good. I've spent so long feeling weak and vulnerable, it's almost strange to think of myself as strong. But you're right, I did get through it. I'm still here, still fighting. Maybe I'm tougher than I give myself credit for.",
    "Therapist: Indeed. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... I don't know, maybe a little proud? And grateful. Grateful to be here, to have this chance to work through things. I'm starting to see that maybe this experience, as terrible as it was, doesn't have to define the rest of my life. Maybe I can use it to become stronger, to appreciate things more.",
    "Therapist: That's a profound shift. How might this new perspective impact your daily life?",
    "Client: I think... I think it could change a lot. Maybe I can start enjoying things more, without always waiting for the other shoe to drop. Maybe I can be more present with my family, really savor those moments instead of worrying about what might happen. And maybe I can start taking better care of myself, not out of fear, but out of respect for what my body has been through and overcome.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like meaningful changes. How are you feeling as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... hopeful. Tired, but in a good way, like I've done some important work. And I'm feeling grateful for this space to process everything. It's not easy, but I think it's helping. I'm looking forward to seeing where this new perspective takes me.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing so openly. We'll continue next time."
