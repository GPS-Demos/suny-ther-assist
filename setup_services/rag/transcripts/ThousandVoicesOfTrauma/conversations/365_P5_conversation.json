    "Therapist: Welcome, Rahul. Today we'll start imaginal exposure. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of revisiting that earthquake... it's making my heart race a bit. But I trust you, and I know we've been working towards this. I just hope I can handle it.",
    "Therapist: Your anxiety is normal. Remember, you're in control here.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I guess I'm worried about how intense the memories might be. During the earthquake, I felt so helpless watching buildings crumble and people panicking. It's been years, but sometimes it feels like yesterday. Will reliving it make things worse?",
    "Therapist: It may be uncomfortable, but it's a step towards healing. Ready to proceed?",
    "Client: I think so. Can you tell me more about what exactly we'll be doing? And how long will it last? I want to be prepared.",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit the memory for about 30-45 minutes. I'll guide you through it.",
    "Client: Okay, that doesn't sound too overwhelming. I appreciate you breaking it down for me. I'm still a bit apprehensive, but I understand the importance. My anxiety has been affecting my work and relationships, especially since my divorce. I'm ready to take this step.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Remember, we can pause anytime.",
    "Client: Thank you, that's comforting to know. I'm glad you're here to support me through this. It's been difficult to open up about these experiences, especially coming from a culture where we don't typically discuss mental health. But I'm committed to this process.",
    "Therapist: Cultural aspects are important. We'll respect that throughout our sessions.",
    "Client: I appreciate your understanding. It means a lot. So, what should I expect during the exposure? Will I need to close my eyes? And what if I start to panic?",
    "Therapist: You can close your eyes if comfortable. We'll use grounding techniques if needed.",
    "Client: Alright, that sounds manageable. I've been practicing those grounding techniques you taught me, and they've been helpful with my day-to-day anxiety. I'm nervous but also hopeful that this will help me process what happened during the earthquake.",
    "Therapist: Your progress is encouraging. Shall we begin the exposure now?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Just knowing that you're here and that we can stop if it becomes too much gives me the courage to face this. Let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Take a deep breath. We'll start when you're comfortable."
