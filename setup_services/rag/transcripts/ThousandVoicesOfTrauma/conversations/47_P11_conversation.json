    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. Going through that memory of the combat situation was really intense. I could almost smell the gunpowder and feel the heat on my skin. It's like I was right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: That sounds overwhelming. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sounds, definitely. The constant gunfire, the shouting, the explosions... it was deafening. And the fear. I remember feeling so scared, thinking I might die at any moment. It's strange because I've tried so hard to forget all of this, but during the exposure, it all came flooding back.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... difficult. Really difficult. But also, I don't know, maybe a little bit freeing? Like, I've been carrying this weight around for so long, and finally letting it out feels... I'm not sure if 'good' is the right word, but maybe necessary?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. Can you elaborate?",
    "Client: Well, I've spent so much energy trying to avoid anything that reminds me of that day. But going through it in detail, it's like... it's just a memory now. It can't hurt me anymore, even though it feels scary. And talking about it, I feel like I'm taking some control back. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How does this connect to your everyday life?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe it explains why I've been so jumpy and anxious all the time. Always on edge, you know? Like, my body's still in that combat zone, even when I'm just trying to go about my day. And the nightmares... they're probably my brain trying to process all this stuff I've been pushing down.",
    "Therapist: That's a great observation. What else?",
    "Client: I think... maybe this is why I've been having such a hard time connecting with people. I mean, how do you explain this kind of experience to someone who hasn't been through it? It's easier to just isolate myself. But going through this exposure, it makes me realize how much I need support. I can't keep dealing with this alone.",
    "Therapist: That's a crucial realization. How might you act on that?",
    "Client: I... I think I might try to open up more to my roommates. Maybe explain a little bit about what I'm going through. And there's a veterans' support group I've been avoiding. I think I might give it a try now. I'm still scared, but... I feel a bit stronger after today.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted, honestly. But also... hopeful? Like maybe I can actually get through this. It's not going to be easy, but I feel like I've taken a big step today. And even though it was hard, I'm glad I did it. I want to keep going with this therapy.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For guiding me through this. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like recovery might actually be possible. It's scary, but I'm ready to keep working on this.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. We'll continue next session."
