    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Patel. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a mix of emotions. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is... hesitant. It's been so long since I've allowed myself to think about that day.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We'll take it step by step. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Yes, let's start before I change my mind.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see... I see the village. It's early morning, and I'm hanging laundry outside our home. The air is thick with humidity, and I can hear the distant rumble of thunder. I remember thinking it might rain soon, but... but I had no idea what was coming.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: The ground... it starts to shake. Gently at first, like a truck passing by. But then it gets stronger. The clothesline is swaying, and I hear shouting from down the street. People are coming out of their houses, looking confused and scared.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I... I can feel the panic rising in my chest, just like it did that day.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 6.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The shaking gets worse. I hear a terrible cracking sound, and I turn to see our neighbor's house starting to collapse. There's dust everywhere, and people are screaming. I'm frozen in place, watching as the world falls apart around me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. I keep thinking, \"This can't be real. This can't be happening.\" But it is. And then I remember... oh god, my husband is still inside our house!",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. You're doing well. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I run towards our house, stumbling as the ground keeps shaking. The door is jammed, and I'm pushing with all my strength. I'm calling out for him, \"Rajesh! Rajesh!\" But I can't hear anything over the noise of the earthquake and people screaming.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's higher. Maybe an 8.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Feel the chair beneath you. Can you continue?",
    "Client: Yes... yes, I can. I finally get the door open, and I rush inside. Everything is falling off the shelves, and there's dust everywhere. I'm coughing, trying to see through the haze. I find Rajesh in the bedroom. He's trapped under a fallen beam.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in that moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm overwhelmed with fear and desperation. I'm trying to lift the beam, but it's too heavy. Rajesh is conscious, and he's looking at me with such pain in his eyes. I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The shaking is getting worse. Parts of the ceiling are starting to fall. Rajesh... he tells me to leave, to save myself. But I can't... I can't just leave him there. I'm crying, telling him I won't go without him.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I hear people outside. They're shouting, telling everyone to evacuate. The house is groaning, like it might collapse any second. Rajesh... he grabs my hand and tells me he loves me. He makes me promise to go. I... I kiss him one last time, and then... then I run.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I... I feel like I can't breathe. The guilt... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here now. You're safe. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. Maybe higher.",
    "Therapist: Let's take a few deep breaths together. In... and out. You're doing well.",
    "Client: *Takes several deep breaths* Okay... okay, I think I can continue.",
    "Therapist: When you're ready, tell me what happens as you leave the house.",
    "Client: As I stumble out, I see chaos everywhere. Houses are crumbling, people are running and screaming. The ground is still shaking violently. I turn back to look at our house, and... and I see it collapse. Just... just crumble to the ground. I scream, but I can barely hear my own voice over the noise.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel like my whole world has ended. There's this hollowness in my chest, like my heart has been ripped out. I fall to my knees, unable to look away from the rubble that used to be our home.",
    "Therapist: You're doing very well. Can you tell me what happens next?",
    "Client: Someone... a neighbor, I think... pulls me to my feet. They're saying something about getting to higher ground, about a tsunami warning. But I can barely process it. I'm in shock. I let them lead me away, but I keep looking back, hoping somehow Rajesh will appear.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm numb. It's like I'm watching everything happen to someone else. We're moving with a crowd of people, all of us covered in dust and looking shell-shocked. Some are injured, others are crying. I'm just... moving, not really thinking.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response to trauma. What do you notice around you?",
    "Client: The village... it's unrecognizable. Buildings I've known my whole life are just piles of rubble. There are people trapped, calling for help. I want to stop and help them, but the crowd keeps pushing forward. The ground is still shaking with aftershocks.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: We... we reach higher ground. It's a hill just outside the village. From here, we can see the ocean, and... oh god, the water is receding. People are panicking, realizing what's coming. I'm just standing there, feeling lost and alone in the crowd.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking this must be a nightmare. That I'll wake up and Rajesh will be there. But then I look at my hands, covered in dust and scratches, and I know it's real. I'm thinking about how just an hour ago, everything was normal. And now... now everything is gone.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm shaking. My legs feel weak, and my chest is tight. I can taste dust in my mouth, and my eyes are stinging from all the debris in the air. I feel... I feel so small and insignificant in the face of this disaster.",
    "Therapist: You're doing very well. What happens next?",
    "Client: We... we watch as the tsunami hits the village. It's... it's like a wall of water, destroying everything in its path. The sound is deafening. People around me are crying, praying, screaming. I'm just... silent. I can't even cry. I'm watching as everything I've ever known is washed away.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. How are you feeling right now, in this room?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. And sad. So incredibly sad. But also... also a little relieved to have finally talked about it.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe a 6 or 7.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: Okay... yes, that sounds good.",
    "Therapist: Focus on your breath. Feel the chair supporting you. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *Takes several deep breaths* Thank you. I... I never thought I could talk about this.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great courage. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... exhausted, but also like a weight has been lifted. It's still painful, but... but maybe a little less overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. We'll end here for today. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I am. It's been hard, but... but I'm glad I did this.",
    "Therapist: Take care of yourself for the rest of the day. We'll process this more next session.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again."
