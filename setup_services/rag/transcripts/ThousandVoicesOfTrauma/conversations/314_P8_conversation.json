    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. My heart is still pounding, and I feel a bit shaky. That memory... it's so vivid. I can still hear the shouting, see the anger in their eyes. It's like I'm right back there, you know?",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, definitely fear. But also... shame? I feel so helpless, like I should have done something, anything. But I just stood there, frozen. I keep thinking about how different things could have been if I had just spoken up or tried to intervene. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: How does that fear and shame feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like a heavy weight on my chest, making it hard to breathe. My stomach is in knots, and I feel this tension in my shoulders and neck. I can't seem to relax. It's like my body is still on high alert, even though I know I'm safe here.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep hearing those racial slurs they were yelling. It makes me feel so... othered, you know? Like I don't belong here, even though I was born and raised in this country. I'm thinking about all the times I've felt different or out of place because of my ethnicity. It's not just about that one incident anymore; it's like it's connected to everything.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts relate to your everyday life?",
    "Client: It's... it's everywhere. I find myself constantly on edge in public spaces, always scanning for potential threats. I've started avoiding certain areas of campus, and I barely go out at night anymore. It's affecting my studies too. I can't focus in class because I'm always worried about what others might be thinking about me. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your anxiety now?",
    "Client: It's... actually a bit less intense than when we started. Talking about it, putting it into words... it helps somehow. Like, I'm not just trapped in the memory anymore. I can see it from the outside a bit. But it's still there, you know? This underlying current of unease.",
    "Therapist: How does sharing this experience make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... a mix of things. Part of me feels relieved, like I'm finally letting out something I've been holding in for so long. But there's also this vulnerability, like I've exposed a raw nerve. And... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful? Like maybe by talking about it, I can start to make sense of it all.",
    "Therapist: What's one thing you've learned about yourself through this process?",
    "Client: I think... I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. Living with this fear and anxiety every day, but still pushing forward, still trying to live my life... that takes strength, doesn't it? And maybe... maybe it's okay that I didn't do anything in that moment. Maybe being a witness, surviving, and speaking about it now is enough.",
    "Therapist: How does recognizing that strength feel?",
    "Client: It's... empowering, I guess? Like a small flame of confidence in my chest. It doesn't erase the fear or the trauma, but it gives me something to hold onto. Maybe I can use this strength to face other challenges, to speak up more, to be proud of who I am despite what happened.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you could take this week to nurture that strength?",
    "Client: I... I think I could try joining that Middle Eastern student association on campus. I've been avoiding it because I was afraid of drawing attention to my ethnicity, but maybe it could be a place where I feel understood and supported. It's scary, but... I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about our session today?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but in a good way? Like I've released something that's been weighing me down. It was hard, really hard, to go through that memory again. But I feel like I understand it a bit better now. And talking about it, putting it into words... it makes it feel less overwhelming, less all-consuming. I'm grateful for this space to process it all.",
    "Therapist: What will you do to take care of yourself after our session?",
    "Client: I think I'll take a long walk in the park near my apartment. Being in nature always helps me feel grounded. And then maybe I'll call my sister. I haven't told her much about what happened, but I think I'm ready to open up a bit. Just hearing her voice always makes me feel safer and more connected.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... okay. Tired, but also lighter somehow. Like I've taken a step forward, even if it's just a small one. There's still a lot to work through, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this. Thank you for creating this safe space for me to share.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. We'll continue next week."
