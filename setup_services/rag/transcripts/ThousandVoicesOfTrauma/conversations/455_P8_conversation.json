    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mrs. Patel?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. My heart is still racing, and I feel a tightness in my chest. The memories of my ex-husband's anger, his shouting... it all feels so vivid again. I can almost smell the curry I was cooking that day when he came home in a rage.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Mostly fear. And a deep sense of shame. I keep thinking about how I should have left sooner, how I should have been stronger. But I was so afraid of being alone, of disappointing my family. In our culture, divorce is... it's not something you do lightly. I can still hear my mother's voice telling me to be a good wife, to endure.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel in this moment?",
    "Client: Angry. I'm angry at myself for staying, angry at my ex-husband for his cruelty, and... and angry at my parents for not understanding. My hands are shaking just thinking about it. I feel like I wasted so many years of my life, and now here I am, 74 and alone. It's... it's not how I imagined my golden years would be.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice in your body as you express that anger?",
    "Client: My jaw is clenched, and I feel this... this heat rising from my stomach to my chest. It's like a fire inside me. But there's also this heaviness in my limbs, like I'm carrying all those years of pain with me. I want to scream, but I also want to curl up and disappear.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your broader experience?",
    "Client: I suppose it's all tied to this feeling of... of not being enough. Throughout my marriage, I never felt like I was good enough. No matter what I did, it was wrong. And now, even though I'm free from that situation, I still carry that feeling with me. It affects everything - how I interact with people, how I see myself. I'm always second-guessing, always afraid of making mistakes.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are you having about yourself right now?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... I'm thinking that maybe I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. I survived all those years, didn't I? And I finally found the courage to leave. But then there's this other voice, telling me that I'm foolish for feeling proud of something I should have done years ago. It's... it's confusing. I feel both strong and weak at the same time.",
    "Therapist: How does that confusion feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like... like I'm being pulled in two directions. My chest feels tight, like there's a rubber band stretching inside me. And my stomach is in knots. I'm dizzy, almost... almost like I'm on a boat, swaying back and forth between these two feelings. It's exhausting, really.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I think I need reassurance. Not just from you, but from myself. I need to believe that it's okay to feel proud of my strength, even if it took me a long time to find it. And I need... I need to forgive myself, I suppose. For staying as long as I did, for letting fear guide my decisions for so long. It's just... it's so hard to do that.",
    "Therapist: How might self-forgiveness change things for you?",
    "Client: Oh, that's... that's a big question. I think... I think it would free me, in a way. If I could truly forgive myself, maybe I wouldn't be so haunted by the past. Maybe I could start to see a future for myself that isn't defined by what happened to me. I could... I could maybe even start to trust people again, to open myself up to new relationships. Not romantic ones, necessarily, but friendships. Connections. I've been so isolated for so long.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you could take towards that?",
    "Client: I... I suppose I could try to be kinder to myself in my thoughts. When I start to berate myself for past decisions, I could try to remember that I did the best I could with what I knew at the time. And maybe... maybe I could reach out to that nice lady from my building who invited me to her book club. I've been avoiding it, but... maybe it's time to try.",
    "Therapist: How does thinking about that make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's scary, to be honest. But there's also a glimmer of excitement. A tiny spark of hope. My heart is beating faster, but not in the panicky way it was earlier. It's more... more like anticipation. And I feel a little lighter, like some of that heaviness has lifted. It's... it's a strange feeling, but not an unpleasant one.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to remember from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I want to remember this feeling. This mix of fear and hope. And I want to remember that I'm stronger than I often give myself credit for. That surviving isn't nothing - it's everything. And that maybe, just maybe, there's still time for me to build the life I want. It's not too late. I'm 74, yes, but I'm still here. I'm still... I'm still me.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you feel as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel drained, but in a good way. Like I've done something difficult but important. My body feels heavy, but my mind feels clearer. And there's this... this tiny flame of hope in my chest. It's small, but it's there. I'm... I'm grateful for that. Thank you for guiding me through this. It wasn't easy, but... but I think it was necessary.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredible work today. Take care of yourself."
