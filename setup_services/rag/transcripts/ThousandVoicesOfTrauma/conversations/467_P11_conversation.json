    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my heart is still racing a bit. That memory, it's so vivid, you know? Seeing my dad hit my mom, I can still hear the sound of it. It's like I'm right there again.",
    "Therapist: What stood out most?",
    "Client: The fear. I remember feeling so helpless, like I couldn't do anything to stop it. I was just frozen there, watching. And now, even though I know I'm safe here, I still feel that tension in my body.",
    "Therapist: How does that relate to your everyday life?",
    "Client: I guess... I'm always on edge, you know? Like I'm constantly waiting for something bad to happen. It affects my relationships, my work. I struggle to trust people, especially men. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: What did you learn today?",
    "Client: I realized that I've been carrying this weight for so long. It's not just a memory, it's like it's become a part of me. But going through it again, it's... it's different. It's still painful, but I feel like I'm starting to see it from a different perspective.",
    "Therapist: How so?",
    "Client: Well, I've always blamed myself for not doing anything. But now I can see that I was just a kid. There wasn't anything I could have done. It's not my fault. That's... that's huge for me to say out loud.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant insight.",
    "Client: Yeah, it is. It's like a weight lifting, you know? But at the same time, it's scary. If it's not my fault, then I have to face the fact that sometimes terrible things just happen, and we can't control them.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Vulnerable, I guess. But also... maybe a little relieved? Like, I don't have to be on guard all the time. It's okay to let my guard down sometimes. That's new for me.",
    "Therapist: What's next for you?",
    "Client: I want to work on this more. It's hard, but I can see how it's helping. Maybe I can start to let go of some of this anxiety, start trusting people more. I want to feel safe in my relationships, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. How will you practice?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I'll try to be more open with my roommate. Nothing big, just small things. And maybe I'll try that meditation app you suggested. I know I've been resistant, but I think it might help with the anxiety.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a good plan.",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. It's scary, but I'm starting to feel... I don't know, hopeful? Like maybe I can actually move past this. I've carried it for so long, I almost can't imagine what it would be like to not have it weighing me down.",
    "Therapist: How does that possibility feel?",
    "Client: It's exciting. And terrifying. But mostly exciting. I want that freedom, you know? To not be controlled by my past anymore. To be able to form relationships without this constant fear. It's going to take work, but I think I'm ready for it.",
    "Therapist: You've made great progress today.",
    "Client: Thanks. I really appreciate your guidance through this. It's not easy, but having you here, helping me process all of this... it makes a big difference. I feel like I'm not alone in this anymore.",
    "Therapist: You're not. What else is on your mind?",
    "Client: I'm thinking about my mom. We've never really talked about what happened. I wonder if maybe... maybe it's time. Not right away, but someday. I think it might help both of us. Is that... is that something we could work towards?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll approach it gradually.",
    "Client: Okay, good. That feels right. It's all a lot to process, but I feel like I'm on the right path. For the first time in a long time, I feel like there's hope. Real hope, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful. How will you care for yourself today?",
    "Client: I think I'll go for a walk in the park. Being in nature always helps ground me. And maybe I'll call my sister. She's always been supportive, and I think sharing a bit of what I'm going through might bring us closer. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like excellent self-care.",
    "Client: Thanks. I'm nervous about it, but also kind of excited. It feels like a positive step. I'm starting to see that healing isn't just about processing the bad stuff, it's also about building good things in my life. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. You're gaining valuable insights.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess I am. It's weird, but good. I feel drained from the session, but also... lighter? Like I've put down a heavy backpack I've been carrying. There's still work to do, but I feel like I can do it. I'm stronger than I thought.",
    "Therapist: You are. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. Thank you again. This was tough, but really helpful. I'm looking forward to our next session, even though I know it won't be easy. But I'm ready for it. I'm ready to keep moving forward.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Take care.",
    "Client: Thanks, you too. See you next time."
