    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mr. Thompson?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's a bit of a jumble, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel... unsettled. Like I'm back there, you know? In my living room, hearing those footsteps. It's strange how vivid it all becomes.",
    "Therapist: Mhm. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I suppose. But it's different now. Back then, it was raw, paralyzing. Now it's... it's more like an echo. Still there, but not as overwhelming. I keep thinking about how helpless I felt, trapped in my own home. It's... it's hard to shake that feeling, even now.",
    "Therapist: I see. Can you tell me more about that helplessness?",
    "Client: It's... it's like being a prisoner in your own skin. I remember sitting there, frozen, listening to them ransack my house. Everything I'd worked for, memories of my late wife... all at the mercy of strangers. I felt so... insignificant. Powerless. And angry, God, I was angry. At them, at myself for not doing something, at the world for letting this happen to me at my age.",
    "Therapist: Mm. How does your body feel as you recall these emotions?",
    "Client: Tense. Very tense. My shoulders are tight, and there's this knot in my stomach. It's like my body's getting ready to... to do something, but there's nowhere to go. And my throat feels dry, like it did that night when I was too scared to call out or make a sound.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I... I keep wondering what I could've done differently. Should I have confronted them? Hidden better? Called for help earlier? It's... it's exhausting, this constant second-guessing. And then I think about how it's changed me. I used to love my home, you know? Now... now it feels like a reminder of my vulnerability. I've installed all these security systems, but I still don't feel safe. It's like... like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop.",
    "Therapist: How does this compare to how you felt immediately after the incident?",
    "Client: It's... it's less intense now, I suppose. Right after, I couldn't sleep. Every little noise had me on edge. I started drinking more, just to numb myself, to forget. But now... now it's more of a constant unease. Like a background noise I can't quite tune out. I'm functioning better, but I still don't feel like myself. It's as if... as if that night drew a line through my life. There's before, and there's after, and I'm still trying to figure out who I am in this 'after'.",
    "Therapist: I see. What's helping you cope with these feelings?",
    "Client: Well, talking about it helps, oddly enough. At first, I didn't want to. Felt ashamed, you know? But... but it's like lancing a boil. Painful, but necessary. And... and I've been trying to reconnect with old friends. It's not easy at my age, especially after... after losing my wife. But it helps to remember I'm not alone. And... and I've been thinking about volunteering, maybe at the local community center. Feels like... like I need to do something, you know? To feel less... less powerless.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. How do you feel about your progress so far?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mixed bag, really. Some days, I feel like I'm making real headway. I can go about my day without constantly looking over my shoulder. But then... then there are days when it all comes flooding back. A car backfiring, a door slamming... and suddenly I'm right back there. It's frustrating, you know? Like... like taking two steps forward and one step back. But... but I suppose that's still moving forward, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What else have you noticed about your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I've... I've started to appreciate the little things more. Sounds silly, maybe, but... but after something like that, you realize how fragile everything is. A quiet cup of tea in the morning, the sound of birds outside... it's like I'm seeing the world through new eyes. And... and I'm learning to trust again. Slowly, mind you, but... but I'm getting there. It's hard, opening up, letting people in. But I'm starting to see that... that not everyone's a threat. That there's still good in the world.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it make you feel?",
    "Client: Hopeful, I suppose. And... and a bit scared, if I'm honest. It's... it's easier sometimes, you know? To just shut everything out. But... but that's not really living, is it? I keep thinking about my wife, what she'd say if she could see me now. She'd want me to keep going, to... to find joy again. It's not easy, but... but I think I owe it to her, and to myself, to try.",
    "Therapist: That's very insightful. What's your next step?",
    "Client: I... I think I want to start reclaiming my space. My home. It's... it's been a source of anxiety for so long, but... but it's still mine, you know? I'm thinking of redecorating, maybe. Change things up a bit. Make new memories to... to balance out the bad ones. And... and maybe have some friends over. Baby steps, but... but steps nonetheless.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great plan. How do you feel about our session today?",
    "Client: It's... it's been tough, reliving it all. But... but also good, in a way. Like... like I'm taking control of the narrative, if that makes sense. It's not just something that happened to me anymore. It's... it's part of my story now. A part I'm learning to accept and... and maybe even grow from. I... I appreciate you listening, really. It means more than I can say.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. It's... it's a lot to process, you know? But... but I feel lighter somehow. Like... like I've set down a burden I didn't even realize I was carrying. Thank you, doctor. Really.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, Mr. Thompson."
