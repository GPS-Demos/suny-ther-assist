    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and take a deep breath. When you're ready, describe the moment you learned about the breakup.",
    "Client: Okay... I was in the hospital, recovering from my surgery. I had just woken up and was still groggy from the anesthesia. My boyfriend, James, was there. He looked... uncomfortable. I remember thinking something was off, but I couldn't quite place it. Then he said, \"We need to talk.\" My heart started racing immediately.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: He told me that he couldn't handle the stress of my medical issues anymore. That he needed to focus on himself. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I was lying there, still connected to IVs and monitors, and he was breaking up with me. I felt so vulnerable and betrayed.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I started crying. The monitors began beeping faster as my heart rate increased. A nurse rushed in, thinking something was wrong medically. James just stood there, looking guilty and awkward. I wanted to scream at him, but I could barely speak through the tears.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory bravely. Keep going.",
    "Client: The nurse asked James to leave, probably thinking he was upsetting me medically. As he walked out, I felt this overwhelming sense of abandonment. Here I was, at my weakest moment, and the person I trusted most was walking away. I felt so alone and scared.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: After he left, I just lay there, staring at the ceiling. The pain from the surgery seemed insignificant compared to the emotional pain I was feeling. I kept replaying his words in my head, trying to make sense of it all. How could he do this to me now? I felt worthless, like I wasn't even worth sticking around for.",
    "Therapist: You're processing this well. Continue expressing those feelings.",
    "Client: I remember the days that followed were a blur. The doctors and nurses kept asking why I seemed so depressed, but I couldn't bring myself to explain. Every time someone came to check on me, I hoped it would be James coming back to say it was all a mistake. But he never came. I felt so betrayed and angry, but also desperately wanted him to return.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Keep going.",
    "Client: The worst part was when I was discharged. I had planned for James to take me home and help me recover. Instead, I had to call a friend. As we drove home, I saw couples walking together, holding hands, and I just broke down crying in the car. My friend didn't know what to do. I felt so embarrassed and alone.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those feelings. You're doing well.",
    "Client: When I got home, everything reminded me of James. We had been planning to move in together after my recovery. Now, my apartment felt empty and cold. I could barely take care of myself physically, let alone emotionally. I spent days just lying in bed, replaying the breakup in my mind, wondering what I could have done differently.",
    "Therapist: You're showing remarkable courage. Let's pause here for now.",
    "Client: Okay... That was harder than I expected. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: It's very normal. You did excellent work today."
