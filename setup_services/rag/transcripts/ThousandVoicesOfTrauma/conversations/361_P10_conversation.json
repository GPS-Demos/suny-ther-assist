    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to be talking about some heavy stuff today, and I'm not sure I'm ready for it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Can you rate your distress on a scale of 0-100?",
    "Client: Uh, probably around a 60 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Let's begin when you're ready. Start by describing the scene.",
    "Client: Right... okay. I'm at home, it's a typical evening. I'm scrolling through my phone, and suddenly there's this video... It's footage of police brutality at a peaceful protest. I... I can see officers in riot gear, pushing and shoving protesters. There's tear gas in the air, and people are screaming. It's chaos.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: My heart's racing. I feel sick to my stomach. It's... it's bringing back memories of the cyclone that hit our town years ago. The same feeling of helplessness, of being at the mercy of something so much bigger than me.",
    "Therapist: Focus on your breath. What do you notice in your body?",
    "Client: My hands are clammy. I can feel tension in my shoulders, like I'm bracing for impact. God, it's like I'm right there in the middle of it all.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you see.",
    "Client: There's this young woman... she's being knocked to the ground by an officer. Her face is contorted in pain and fear. I can almost hear her cry out over the chaos. It's... it's too much. I want to look away, but I can't.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What's happening now?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling overwhelmed. My chest is tight. It's like I can smell the tear gas, feel the panic in the air. I'm remembering how during the cyclone, we were all trapped, helpless against nature's fury. This feels the same... people trapped, but this time by other humans.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 80. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going. What happens next in the video?",
    "Client: The camera pans to show more of the crowd. There are people trying to help each other, offering water, trying to wash the tear gas from their eyes. It reminds me of how we came together after the cyclone... but this, this is different. It's human-made suffering.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Angry. So damn angry. And sad. How can people do this to each other? During the cyclone, at least we could blame nature. But this... this is a choice. People choosing to hurt other people.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What do you notice in your body?",
    "Client: My jaw is clenched. I can feel heat rising in my face. My fists are balled up. I want to do something, to help somehow, but I'm just watching through a screen, useless.",
    "Therapist: You're not useless. You're processing this experience. Continue.",
    "Client: The video keeps playing. There's a moment where an officer hesitates, looks conflicted. For a split second, I see humanity there. But then he raises his baton again. It's... it's like watching the cyclone destroy everything in its path. Unstoppable, unfeeling.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... how do we recover from this? After the cyclone, we rebuilt. But this... how do you rebuild trust? How do you heal these wounds? I feel so... lost. Hopeless.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. Stay with the moment. What else do you see?",
    "Client: There's a group of protesters linking arms, standing their ground. They look terrified, but determined. It's... it's actually beautiful, in a way. Like seeing neighbors help each other after the storm. There's still good, even in the midst of all this ugliness.",
    "Therapist: How does that image affect you?",
    "Client: It's... comforting, I guess. A reminder that people can still come together, even in the worst situations. My breathing is a little easier now. I feel a glimmer of hope.",
    "Therapist: That's good. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 70. Still high, but... manageable.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep describing what you see.",
    "Client: The video is winding down now. The police are retreating, and the protesters are helping the injured. There's this eerie calm settling over the scene. It reminds me of the eye of the cyclone... that moment of quiet before the second wave hits.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Uneasy. Like it's not really over. I'm worried about what comes next, for those people and for society as a whole. It's the same feeling I had after the cyclone passed... relief mixed with dread about the long road ahead.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What do you notice in your body?",
    "Client: My shoulders are starting to relax a bit, but there's still this knot in my stomach. I feel drained, like I've been through something physically exhausting.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're processing a lot. What happens as the video ends?",
    "Client: I'm left staring at my phone screen, feeling... I don't know, shell-shocked? Like I've witnessed something I can't unsee. It's similar to how I felt watching the news coverage after the cyclone. This overwhelming sense of \"what now?\"",
    "Therapist: And how do you handle that feeling?",
    "Client: I... I put the phone down. Take a deep breath. I remind myself that I'm safe, that I'm not in that situation. But there's still this lingering anxiety, this feeling that the world isn't as safe as I thought it was. Just like after the cyclone.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired. Really tired. But also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I've faced something difficult and made it through.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's down to about 50 now. Still there, but not as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Let's take a few deep breaths together.",
    "Client: Okay... *deep breath* That helps. I feel more grounded now.",
    "Therapist: Good. We'll end here for today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Drained, but... okay. I think I understand my reactions better now. It's not just about the video, it's about how it connects to my past trauma.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. We'll explore that more next time. Well done today.",
    "Client: Thanks. It was tough, but... I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself. We'll continue working through this. Take care until our next session."
