    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Can you describe the animal attack scene?",
    "Client: Okay... I was on patrol in a rural village. It was hot, dusty. We'd been walking for hours. Suddenly, I heard growling. A huge, mangy dog came charging at us from an alley. Its eyes were wild, foam at its mouth. I froze...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The dog lunged at my teammate. I heard screaming, saw blood. I wanted to help, but I couldn't move. My hands were shaking so badly I couldn't even raise my weapon. I felt so useless, so weak...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The locals started yelling, throwing rocks at the dog. It finally backed off, but my teammate was badly hurt. I... I should have done something. I was trained for this, but I just stood there like a coward.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. Continue.",
    "Client: We radioed for help, applied first aid. But I couldn't stop shaking. The guilt was overwhelming. I kept thinking, what if it had been worse? What if he had died because I froze? I don't know if I can ever forgive myself...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) The worst part is, I still hear that growling in my nightmares. I see those eyes, that foam... Sometimes I wake up screaming, thinking the dog is in my room. It's been years, but it feels like yesterday.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Scared. Ashamed. My heart's racing, and I feel sick to my stomach. But... also a little relieved? I've never told anyone the full story before.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're doing excellent work here.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard, but I want to get better. I'm tired of being afraid all the time. I want to be able to walk down the street without flinching at every dog I see. I want to sleep through the night without nightmares.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is admirable. Let's continue.",
    "Client: Okay. After the attack, we had to finish our patrol. I was on edge the whole time, jumping at every sound. When we got back to base, I couldn't stop crying. I felt so weak, so useless. My teammates tried to comfort me, but I pushed them away. I was too ashamed to face them.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel vulnerable. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I know, but it's still so hard. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel normal again. Will I always be this broken? This scared?",
    "Therapist: You're not broken. You're healing.",
    "Client: I hope so. It's just... the memories are so vivid. The sound of my teammate's screams, the smell of blood and dust, the feeling of utter helplessness. It's all burned into my brain. How do I make it stop?",
    "Therapist: We'll work through this together. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Thank you. It helps to talk about it, even though it's painful. I've been carrying this alone for so long. I'm scared, but I'm also hopeful. Maybe I can finally start to move past this.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive outlook. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted, honestly. Talking about it is draining. But I also feel a little lighter, like I've put down a heavy backpack I've been carrying for years. It's a strange mix of relief and sadness.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. You've done well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm nervous about our next session, but I'm also looking forward to it. I want to keep working on this, even if it's hard. I want my life back.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent attitude. We'll end here for today.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you for listening and for your support. It means a lot to me. I'll see you next week.",
    "Therapist: Take care. Remember to use your coping strategies."
