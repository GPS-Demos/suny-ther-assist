    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, John?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. I can still see the violence so vividly in my mind. The shouting, the blood... it's like I'm right back there again. My heart's still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. Watching it happen and not being able to do anything. I keep replaying that moment when I froze, wondering if I could've changed something.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was tough. Really tough. I felt the same fear and panic I did then. But... I don't know, maybe it wasn't as overwhelming as I expected? I mean, it was still awful, but I didn't completely lose it like I thought I might.",
    "Therapist: That's an important observation. What do you make of that?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe I'm stronger than I give myself credit for? Or maybe talking about it is helping, even though it doesn't feel like it sometimes. It's hard to tell.",
    "Therapist: How does this experience connect to your day-to-day life?",
    "Client: Well, I've been avoiding crowds and loud places since it happened. Reliving it today, I can see why. The chaos, the unpredictability... it's all tied together. But maybe... maybe I don't need to be quite so afraid all the time?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How might that affect your goals?",
    "Client: I've been wanting to go back to school, finish my degree. But the thought of being in a crowded lecture hall... it's been paralyzing. If I can face this memory, though, maybe I can face that too. It won't be easy, but... I want to try.",
    "Therapist: That takes courage. What might help you move forward?",
    "Client: I think... talking about it more might help. And maybe trying small steps, like sitting in a coffee shop for a while? I don't know, it seems silly when I say it out loud.",
    "Therapist: Not at all. Those are excellent ideas. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, honestly. But also... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful? Like I've taken a step, even if it's a small one. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... maybe we could talk more about strategies for managing those moments when the memories hit hard? And... um, maybe start planning those small steps we talked about?",
    "Therapist: Sounds good. How will you take care of yourself today?",
    "Client: I hadn't really thought about that. Maybe I'll call my sister. She's always been supportive. And probably try to get some rest. This was... a lot.",
    "Therapist: That's a great plan. Remember, you did important work today.",
    "Client: Thanks. It doesn't always feel like it, but... I guess I did, didn't I? It's just... it's hard to feel like I'm making progress sometimes, you know? Like, I still have nightmares, I still jump at loud noises. But then I think about how I couldn't even talk about this a few months ago, and now here I am, going through it in detail. That's... that's something, right?",
    "Therapist: It certainly is. What else has changed for you?",
    "Client: Well, I... I guess I'm sleeping a little better. Not great, but better. And I've been able to go to the grocery store without having a panic attack. That's new. I even ran into an old classmate there last week and managed to have a short conversation. It was awkward, but I did it.",
    "Therapist: Those are significant steps. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: It's... it's good, I think. Sometimes it's hard to see the progress day-to-day, but when I look back... yeah, I've come a long way. It's just... there's still so far to go, you know? But I'm trying to focus on the positives. That's something else I've been working on.",
    "Therapist: That's a helpful approach. Any final thoughts today?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I guess. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but... I think it's helping. I'm starting to believe that maybe, just maybe, I can get through this and have a normal life again. Or at least, a new normal. That means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work. We'll continue next week.",
    "Client: Okay. Yeah, I'll be here. Thanks again. I'll try to keep working on those small steps we talked about. Maybe I'll even try that coffee shop idea. Baby steps, right? But steps nonetheless. I'm... I'm actually looking forward to seeing what progress I can make before our next session. It's a weird feeling, but a good one."
