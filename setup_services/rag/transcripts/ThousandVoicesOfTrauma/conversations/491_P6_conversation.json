    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important. Let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that moment. Describe what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: I'm... I'm back in the barracks. It's dark, and I can hear the distant sound of explosions. My heart is racing, and my palms are sweaty. I'm clutching my rifle, trying to stay calm, but I can feel panic rising in my chest.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 6. It's uncomfortable, but manageable.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going.",
    "Client: The explosions are getting closer. I can hear shouting outside. My squadmates are scrambling to get ready. I'm frozen, though. I can't seem to move. My breath is coming in short gasps, and I feel like I might throw up.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Maybe an 8? I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with it.",
    "Client: The door bursts open, and someone's yelling at us to move out. I finally snap into action, but my legs feel like lead. As we run outside, the night sky is lit up with flares and explosions. The noise is deafening. I can smell smoke and something burning. My mouth is dry, and I taste fear.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's pretty high. A 9, I think. I feel overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *inhales shakily* Okay. We're moving through the camp now. There's chaos everywhere. People are running, shouting. I see someone fall, hit by debris. I want to help, but we're being pushed forward. I feel guilty, scared, and angry all at once. My whole body is tense, and I'm sweating profusely.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: Still a 9. Maybe even a 9.5. It's really intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: We reach the perimeter, and I can see the enemy advancing. The gunfire is constant now. I raise my rifle, but my hands are shaking so badly. I fire, but I don't know if I hit anything. Someone next to me goes down, and I hear them cry out in pain. I feel helpless, terrified.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually dropped a bit. Maybe an 8 now. I think I'm starting to detach a little.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The firefight seems to last forever. I'm on autopilot now, just reacting. My ears are ringing from the constant gunfire. I smell blood and gunpowder. At some point, I realize the enemy is retreating. The gunfire dies down, but the ringing in my ears continues. I look around, and the devastation hits me. There are bodies... so many bodies. Friends, enemies... I feel numb.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down more. Maybe a 6? I feel drained, emotionally and physically.",
    "Therapist: You've done well. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... also a bit relieved? It's like I've let something out that I've been holding onto for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: Okay. *takes a deep breath* I'm feeling more present now. It's strange, but I feel like I can think about that memory without being completely overwhelmed by it.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. How would you rate your SUDS now?",
    "Client: I'd say it's down to a 3 or 4. I'm tired, but I feel... lighter, somehow.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's end the exposure here and discuss what you experienced."
