    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. We're diving into some heavy stuff today, right? The whole severe illness thing... it's not easy to think about.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Remember, you're safe here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess so. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in the hospital waiting room. The lights are so bright, and there's this antiseptic smell that's making me nauseous. My wife, Maria, is sitting next to me, holding my hand. We're waiting for the test results.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's happening in your body right now?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I can feel it pounding in my chest. My palms are sweaty, and I keep wiping them on my jeans. There's this knot in my stomach that won't go away.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 70. It's pretty intense.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're doing well. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: The doctor walks in. He's got this serious look on his face, and I just know it's bad news. He sits down across from us and starts talking, but I can barely hear him over the sound of my own heartbeat. I catch words like \"advanced\" and \"aggressive treatment,\" and I feel like the room is spinning.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I... I can't believe this is happening to me. I'm only 39, for God's sake. I have a family, a career. This can't be real. I keep thinking about my kids, how am I going to tell them? Will I see them grow up?",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Carlos. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's up to about 85. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: I know it is. You're very brave for facing this. Take another deep breath and continue.",
    "Client: Maria starts crying next to me. I want to comfort her, but I feel paralyzed. The doctor is still talking, explaining treatment options, but it's like I'm underwater. Everything sounds muffled. I'm nodding, but I'm not really processing anything.",
    "Therapist: What do you want to do in that moment?",
    "Client: I want to run. Just get up and run out of there, pretend none of this is happening. But I can't move. I'm just... frozen.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. How are you feeling physically now?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, like I can't get enough air. My hands are shaking. I feel hot and cold at the same time.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: The doctor finishes talking and asks if we have any questions. I open my mouth, but nothing comes out. Maria asks something about treatment schedules, but I can't focus on the answer. I'm just staring at the floor, counting the tiles.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"This isn't fair.\" I've always taken care of myself. I don't smoke, I exercise. Why me? And then I feel guilty for thinking that because why should it be anyone else either?",
    "Therapist: Those are very normal thoughts. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's still pretty high, maybe 80.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Carlos. Can you tell me more about what happens as you leave the doctor's office?",
    "Client: We... we walk out in a daze. The hallway seems longer than when we came in. People are walking by, going about their day like nothing's changed, but everything's changed for us. Maria is still crying softly. I put my arm around her, but I feel so... disconnected.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: We get to the car, and I just sit there, staring at the steering wheel. I can't bring myself to start the engine. It's like... if I drive away, it makes it real. Maria puts her hand on my arm and asks if I want her to drive, but I shake my head.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in that moment?",
    "Client: Numb. Just... completely numb. And then suddenly, I'm hit with this wave of anger. I slam my hands against the steering wheel and yell. I don't even know what I'm saying, just... yelling.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel angry. How does Maria react?",
    "Client: She... she looks startled at first, but then she just puts her arms around me. I break down crying. It's the first time I've cried since we got the news. We just sit there in the parking lot, holding each other and crying.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a powerful moment. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's come down a bit, maybe to 70.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Carlos. Can you tell me about the drive home?",
    "Client: It's... it's quiet. Neither of us knows what to say. I keep thinking about how we're going to tell the kids. They're too young to understand, you know? How do you explain something like this to a 7-year-old and a 5-year-old?",
    "Therapist: That must be overwhelming. What else are you thinking about?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about work. About all the projects I have going on. Will I be able to finish them? Will I even be able to keep working? And then I feel selfish for thinking about work when my life is on the line.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid concerns. How are you feeling physically now?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted. Just... bone-tired. My body feels heavy, like I'm moving through molasses. My head is pounding.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to breathe. You're safe here. What happens when you get home?",
    "Client: We pull into the driveway, and I see our neighbor playing with her kids in the yard. It hits me like a punch to the gut - will I be able to play with my kids like that? Will I see them grow up? I can't bring myself to get out of the car.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to process. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I tell Maria I need a minute. She goes inside, and I just sit there, trying to compose myself. I don't want the kids to see me like this. I take deep breaths, trying to put on a brave face.",
    "Therapist: How successful do you feel in composing yourself?",
    "Client: Not very. I feel like I'm barely holding it together. But I force myself to get out of the car and go inside. The kids run up to me, excited to see me home early. I hug them tight, probably too tight. They ask why mommy looks sad, and I... I don't know what to say.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's back up to about 85. Remembering their innocent faces... it's tough.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Carlos. Take another deep breath. Can you tell me what happens that evening?",
    "Client: We... we decide not to tell the kids yet. We put on a movie, make some popcorn, try to have a normal family night. But it feels like there's this heavy cloud hanging over everything. I can't focus on the movie. I keep looking at my family, wondering how many more moments like this we'll have.",
    "Therapist: That uncertainty must be very hard to deal with. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Scared. Angry. Sad. Guilty for feeling angry. It's like this whirlwind of emotions, and I don't know how to handle it all.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel all of those things. How do you get through the evening?",
    "Client: We put the kids to bed. I read them a story, and it takes everything in me not to break down. After they're asleep, Maria and I sit on the couch. We try to talk about what we're going to do, but we both keep breaking down crying.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like an emotionally exhausting evening. How are you feeling now, recalling all of this?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. My chest feels tight again. But... I don't know, maybe a little less overwhelming than before? Like, I can talk about it without completely falling apart now.",
    "Therapist: That's progress, Carlos. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: Maybe... 65? It's still high, but not as bad as it was.",
    "Therapist: You've done an incredible job today. How do you feel about the session?",
    "Client: It was tough, really tough. But... I guess it feels good to talk about it. To put it all out there.",
    "Therapist: I'm proud of you for facing this. Is there anything else you want to share before we end?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. I know we have more work to do, but I feel like maybe... maybe I can handle this.",
    "Therapist: You're very welcome, Carlos. You've shown tremendous strength today. We'll continue to work through this together."
