    "Therapist: Welcome, Amir. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm honestly a bit on edge. I've been dreading this all week. My hands are a bit shaky, and I feel like my heart's racing already.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to help you process this. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I guess so. I mean, I don't know if I'll ever be truly ready, but... let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that night. What do you see?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in my apartment. It's late, maybe around 11 PM. I'm sitting on my couch, scrolling through my phone. The TV's on in the background, but I'm not really watching it. It's just... comforting noise, you know?",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear... I hear a noise. At first, I think it's just the neighbors, but then... there's a loud crash. It's coming from my bedroom. My heart starts pounding. I... I freeze.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Terror. Pure terror. I can't move. I can't breathe. I'm trying to convince myself it's nothing, but deep down, I know... I know someone's in my home.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 70. My palms are sweating just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... I finally manage to stand up. My legs feel like jelly. I'm inching towards my bedroom, telling myself I need to check, but every fiber of my being is screaming at me to run.",
    "Therapist: What do you see as you approach the bedroom?",
    "Client: The door's open. It shouldn't be. I always close it. I... I can see a shadow moving inside. Oh god, this is... this is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Amir. Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I freeze again. I'm paralyzed with fear. Then I hear his voice. \"Don't move.\" It's low, threatening. I can see him now. He's... he's bigger than me. Wearing all black. I can't see his face.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. I feel like I can't breathe. My hands are shaking. I... I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here. What does the intruder do?",
    "Client: He... he grabs me. Pushes me into the bedroom. I stumble, fall onto the bed. He's... he's on top of me. I can smell alcohol on his breath. I'm... I'm trying to fight, but I can't move. I'm so scared.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's at 90. This is... this is too much.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Amir. Take a moment. Feel your feet on the floor. You're here, in my office. You're safe.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... okay. I'm... I'm here.",
    "Therapist: When you're ready, continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he starts touching me. I'm trying to scream, but no sound comes out. I'm... I'm crying. I can feel his hands... everywhere. I want to disappear. I want to die.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings, Amir. You're safe now. What else do you remember?",
    "Client: I... I can hear him breathing heavily. He's... he's undoing his belt. I'm... I'm begging him to stop. Please stop. Please... *voice breaks*",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you survived this. You're here now.",
    "Client: I... I know. It's just... it feels so real. Like it's happening all over again.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he forces himself on me. The pain is... it's unbearable. I'm crying, but he doesn't stop. I feel... I feel like I'm outside my body, watching it happen to someone else. But I can still feel everything.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in that moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking this can't be real. This doesn't happen to people like me. I'm thinking about how I'll never feel safe again. I'm... I'm wondering if he'll kill me when he's done.",
    "Therapist: How long does the assault last?",
    "Client: It feels like forever, but... maybe 15 minutes? I don't know. Time doesn't make sense. When he's... when he's finished, he just... he just leaves. Like nothing happened.",
    "Therapist: What do you do after he leaves?",
    "Client: I... I can't move at first. I'm in shock. I'm lying there, crying. Eventually, I manage to get up. I'm in pain. I'm... I'm bleeding. I stumble to the bathroom. I throw up.",
    "Therapist: And then?",
    "Client: I... I call the police. I'm shaking so much I can barely dial. When they arrive, I can barely speak. They take me to the hospital. The exam... it's humiliating. I feel... I feel so violated, all over again.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, Amir?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. But also... I don't know. Maybe a little relieved? Like... like I've finally let it all out.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 60. Still high, but... better.",
    "Therapist: You did extremely well, Amir. How do you feel about what we've done today?",
    "Client: It was... it was tough. Really tough. But... I think it helped? I've never talked about it in this much detail before. It's... it's like I can see it more clearly now.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Remember, processing this is a journey. We'll continue to work through this together.",
