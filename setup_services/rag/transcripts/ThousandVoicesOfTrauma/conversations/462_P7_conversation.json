    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe your experience in the cult?",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. It started when I was 19. I had just moved out of my parents' house and was feeling lost. A friend introduced me to this group that promised community and purpose. At first, it seemed wonderful. We'd gather for meetings, sing together, and talk about changing the world. But slowly, things started to change.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: The leader, a charismatic man in his 50s, began to exert more control. We were encouraged to cut ties with family and friends outside the group. They said our families were holding us back from our true potential. I... I actually believed them. I stopped calling my parents, ignored my old friends. I felt so ashamed now, thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to talk about this. As time went on, the control became more intense. We had to ask permission for everything - what to eat, when to sleep, who to talk to. I remember one time, I wanted to visit my sister who had just had a baby. The leader said no, that it would \"contaminate\" my mind. I missed my nephew's birth because of them.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: The worst part was the constant fear. If anyone questioned anything, they were publicly humiliated in front of the group. We were told it was for our own good, to break down our egos. But it was just cruel. I saw my friends cry, beg for forgiveness for imaginary transgressions. And I... I just stood there, too scared to say anything.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable you felt that way. Keep going.",
    "Client: There was this one night... We were told to stay awake for 48 hours straight, chanting and meditating. They said it would bring us closer to enlightenment. I was so exhausted, I could barely think straight. When I started to nod off, one of the senior members slapped me across the face. Hard. They said it was to \"wake me up spiritually.\" I can still feel the sting sometimes.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... angry. And sad. And so, so stupid for falling for it all. How could I have been so blind? I wasted years of my life in that place. I missed so much - birthdays, weddings, just... life. And for what? A lie. A big, manipulative lie.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're processing important experiences.",
    "Client: I think the worst part was the isolation. Even though we were always surrounded by people, I felt so alone. We weren't allowed to form close friendships within the group - they said it would distract us from our \"higher purpose.\" So I was constantly surrounded by people, but couldn't connect with anyone. It was like being in a crowded room, screaming, but no one could hear me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Let's take a deep breath together.",
    "Client: *takes a deep breath* Thank you. It's hard to talk about this, but... it also feels good to finally say it out loud. For so long, I've kept all of this bottled up inside. I was ashamed, you know? Ashamed that I fell for it, ashamed that I stayed as long as I did. But talking about it... it's like I'm finally acknowledging that it really happened. That it wasn't just a bad dream.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, I think. Still sad and angry, but also... relieved? Like I'm not carrying this secret anymore. And talking about it makes me realize how far I've come. I'm not that person anymore. I have a life now, a real life. It's not perfect, but it's mine. And no one can take that away from me again.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent insight. You've shown incredible strength.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. But here I am, doing it. It's still painful, but it doesn't have the same power over me that it used to. I'm starting to see that what happened wasn't my fault. I was vulnerable, and they took advantage of that. But I'm not vulnerable anymore. I'm stronger now.",
    "Therapist: You've made remarkable progress. How are you feeling about ending our session?",
    "Client: I think I'm ready to stop for today. It's been intense, but in a good way. I feel like I've taken a big step forward. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know we still have more work to do, but for the first time, I feel like I might actually be able to move past this someday.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. We'll continue next time. Take care of yourself."
