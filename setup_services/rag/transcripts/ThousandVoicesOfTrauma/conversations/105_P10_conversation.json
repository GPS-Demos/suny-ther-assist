    "Therapist: Welcome, Ava. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is screaming to run away. It's like my insides are twisting.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0-100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: Um... probably around a 60? My heart's already racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we're here together. Are you ready to begin the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I think so. Yes, let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in the marketplace in Kabul. It's hot, and there's dust everywhere. The air smells like spices and... and something else. Something acrid. I can hear people shouting in Dari, children laughing. But there's tension. Everyone's moving quickly.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm walking with my unit. We're on patrol, but it feels different today. The hairs on the back of my neck are standing up. I... I see a man arguing with a shopkeeper. He's gesturing wildly, and I can't understand what they're saying, but... oh God...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Ava. Remember, you're safe here. What do you see?",
    "Client: The man... he reaches into his jacket and I see... I see the wires. I'm screaming \"IED! IED!\" but it's too late. There's a flash, and then... then...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here in the office. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 85. I can still hear the ringing in my ears.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going. What happens after the flash?",
    "Client: Everything's muffled. I'm on the ground, and there's dust and smoke everywhere. I can taste blood in my mouth. People are screaming, but it sounds far away. I... I see body parts. Oh God, there's so much blood...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it, Ava. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I'm trying to get up, but my legs won't work. I see Johnson... he's not moving. His helmet's gone, and there's... there's... I can't...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing well. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The smell. It's... it's awful. Like burnt meat and chemicals. I'm dragging myself towards Johnson, but someone's pulling me back. I'm yelling at them to let me go, but they won't. I can't leave him there!",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. I can barely breathe. My hands are shaking, and I feel like I'm going to throw up.",
    "Therapist: Remember your grounding techniques. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... okay. I'm here. But I can still see it all so clearly.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: More soldiers arrive. They're securing the area, treating the wounded. Someone's putting a tourniquet on my leg. I didn't even realize I was hit. The pain starts to set in, and I'm... I'm crying. Not just from the pain, but... Johnson. He's gone. And all those civilians...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Ava. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 90. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you've survived this. You're here now, safe in this room.",
    "Client: Right... right. *deep breath* I'm being loaded onto a helicopter. The rotors are so loud, drowning out everything else. I'm fading in and out of consciousness. I keep seeing flashes of the market, of Johnson's face. I... I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I failed them. I should have seen it coming. If I had been more alert, maybe... maybe Johnson would still be alive. Maybe all those people... God, there were children there...",
    "Therapist: These are common thoughts, Ava. Remember, you're not responsible for the actions of others.",
    "Client: I know that logically, but... it doesn't feel that way. I was trained for this. I should have been better.",
    "Therapist: What happens as you're in the helicopter?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drifting. The pain is intense, but it's like I'm outside my body. I can hear the medic talking, but I can't make out the words. I keep seeing faces... the man with the bomb, Johnson, the civilians. They're all blurring together.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Numb. Just... numb. And so, so tired.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response to trauma. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 75 now. The numbness is almost worse than the fear.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Can you continue?",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah. We land at the base hospital. Everything's a blur of bright lights and urgent voices. I'm being rushed into surgery. I'm terrified, but I can't speak. I want to ask about my unit, about the civilians, but I can't form the words.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I'm wondering if this is it. If I'm going to die here, so far from home. I'm thinking about my family, about all the things I never said. And I'm... I'm angry. So angry at the senselessness of it all.",
    "Therapist: That anger is valid, Ava. How does it feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like a fire in my chest. My jaw is clenched so tight it hurts. I want to scream, but I can't.",
    "Therapist: Allow yourself to feel that anger. It's a natural response.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... The next thing I remember is waking up in the recovery room. The pain is... it's overwhelming. But there's also relief. I'm alive. But then... then the guilt hits. Why me? Why did I survive when others didn't?",
    "Therapist: That's survivor's guilt. It's very common. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 80 again. The guilt is almost worse than reliving the explosion.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Ava. Can you tell me more about what you're experiencing in the recovery room?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in and out of consciousness. Every time I wake up, I hope it's all been a bad dream. But the pain... the pain reminds me it's real. Nurses come and go. I hear them talking about my injuries, about how lucky I am. Lucky? It doesn't feel like luck.",
    "Therapist: How does hearing that make you feel?",
    "Client: Angry. Confused. I want to tell them there's nothing lucky about this. About losing friends, about seeing... seeing what I saw. But I can't speak. I'm trapped in my own body, with my thoughts spiraling.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly frustrating. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The smell of antiseptic. It's so strong, it makes me nauseous. And the beeping of machines. It's constant, reminding me where I am. I... I start to have flashbacks. Every time I close my eyes, I'm back in that market. I can hear the screams, smell the smoke...",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Ava. Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 85 again. It feels so real.",
    "Therapist: Remember, it's a memory. You've survived this. Can you tell me what happens next?",
    "Client: Days pass. I'm told about the extent of my injuries. Physical therapy starts, and it's... it's hell. Every movement is agony. But the physical pain... it's almost a relief from the mental anguish. At least it's something I can understand.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with the mental anguish?",
    "Client: I... I try to shut it out. I focus on the physical recovery. It's easier to deal with than the memories, the guilt. But at night... at night, I can't escape it. The nightmares are relentless. I wake up screaming, drenched in sweat.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Drained. Like I've run a marathon. My heart's still racing, but... but I feel a little lighter. Like I've let out some of the poison.",
    "Therapist: That's a good way to describe it. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 70. Still high, but... better.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well, Ava. How do you feel about ending the exposure here for today?",
    "Client: I... I think that's good. I'm exhausted, but... but I'm glad we did this. It's hard, but... maybe it's helping?",
    "Therapist: It is helping. You're showing immense courage. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay... *deep breath* Thank you. For... for being here with me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Ava. I'm here to support you. Let's focus on some deep breathing exercises to help you transition out of the exposure."
