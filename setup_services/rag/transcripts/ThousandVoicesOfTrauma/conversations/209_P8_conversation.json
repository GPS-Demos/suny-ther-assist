    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is buzzing, you know? My hands are shaking a little. I can still see those images so clearly in my mind. The violence I witnessed... it's like it's happening all over again.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's this overwhelming sense of helplessness, like I'm that young boy again, watching something I shouldn't be seeing. I feel so small and powerless.",
    "Therapist: Where do you feel that fear in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's in my chest. Like a heavy weight pressing down on me. My heart is racing, and I'm having trouble catching my breath. It's as if I'm right back there, frozen in place, unable to move or look away.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why didn't I do something?\" I know I was just a kid, but... I feel like I should have tried to stop it somehow. And then there's this voice in my head saying, \"You're weak. You're a coward.\" It's... it's hard to shake those thoughts.",
    "Therapist: How do those thoughts make you feel?",
    "Client: Ashamed. Guilty. Like I'm somehow responsible for what happened. And angry too, I guess. Angry at myself for not doing more, angry at the people who were hurting others. It's... it's a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about how you're coping with these feelings now?",
    "Client: Well, I... I'm here, talking about it. That's something, right? In the past, I would've reached for a drink to numb these feelings. But now, I'm... I'm trying to face them. It's hard, really hard, but I'm doing it.",
    "Therapist: How does that feel, to be facing these emotions?",
    "Client: It's... it's terrifying, honestly. But there's also this tiny sense of... I don't know, maybe pride? Like, I'm finally confronting this thing that's haunted me for so long. It hurts, but it also feels like maybe I'm taking back some control.",
    "Therapist: What's different about how you're handling this now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm actually allowing myself to feel it. Before, I'd push it all down, pretend it didn't exist. Now, I'm acknowledging the pain, the fear. And I'm... I'm talking about it. That's huge for me. It's like I'm finally giving that scared little boy a voice.",
    "Therapist: How does giving voice to that experience impact you?",
    "Client: It's... it's liberating, in a way. Painful, but liberating. Like I'm finally letting out this secret I've been carrying for decades. And it's... it's making me realize that maybe it wasn't my fault. Maybe I was just a kid in a terrible situation.",
    "Therapist: What does that realization mean for you?",
    "Client: It's... it's huge. It's like this weight I've been carrying is starting to lift a little. Don't get me wrong, it's still there, but... but maybe I don't have to carry all of it. Maybe I can start to forgive that little boy who was so scared and confused.",
    "Therapist: How does the idea of self-forgiveness feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's strange. Part of me wants to reject it, like I don't deserve it. But another part... it feels like taking a deep breath after being underwater for too long. Like maybe, just maybe, I can start to heal.",
    "Therapist: What do you need right now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I think I need a moment to just sit with this. To let it all sink in. And maybe... maybe I need to remind myself that I'm safe now. That I'm not that helpless kid anymore. I'm an adult who's strong enough to face this.",
    "Therapist: Take all the time you need. How can I support you?",
    "Client: Just... just being here helps. Listening without judgment. Helping me make sense of all this. And... and reminding me that it's okay to feel whatever I'm feeling. That I don't have to be strong all the time.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly brave work. How do you want to close our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I think I want to take a few deep breaths. To ground myself in the present. And maybe... maybe acknowledge that little boy inside me. Tell him that he's safe now, and that we're working on healing together.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a wonderful way to end. Shall we do that together?",
    "Client: Yes, I'd like that. Thank you... for everything. This is hard, but... but I think it's worth it. I'm starting to see a glimmer of hope, you know? Like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this and come out stronger on the other side."
