    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Rahul?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. Going through that car accident again, it just... it brings everything back so vividly. The screeching tires, the impact, the smell of burnt rubber... It's like I'm right there again.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most?",
    "Client: The sound, I think. The awful crunch of metal... and then the silence right after. It was so eerily quiet for a few seconds before I heard people shouting. That contrast, it's... it's haunting.",
    "Therapist: How did reliving that memory feel today?",
    "Client: It was hard, really hard. But... different from before? I mean, it still scared me, but I didn't feel as overwhelmed as I usually do when I think about it. Does that make sense? It's like... I could observe it a bit more, even though it was still frightening.",
    "Therapist: That's insightful. How does this relate to your daily life?",
    "Client: Well, I've been avoiding driving since the accident. But going through this... maybe I'm stronger than I thought? I still feel anxious about getting behind the wheel, but it doesn't seem as impossible as before. It's like... maybe I can face it, bit by bit.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant realization. What else?",
    "Client: I noticed... during the memory, I kept thinking about my mom. She was so worried when she found out about the accident. It made me realize how much I've been isolating myself lately. I haven't really talked to her or my friends about how I'm feeling. I've just been... hiding, I guess.",
    "Therapist: How might opening up change things?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to reach out, but it's scary. What if they don't understand? Or what if I burden them? But then again, keeping it all inside isn't really working either. Maybe... maybe talking about it could help? It's just... it's hard to take that first step.",
    "Therapist: That's a common struggle. What small step feels doable?",
    "Client: Hmm... Maybe I could start by texting my best friend? Just to catch up, nothing heavy at first. And maybe... maybe I could tell my mom I've started therapy. She's been worried, and it might help her to know I'm working on things.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like great ideas. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: It's tough, but... I think it's helping. Each time we do this, it gets a little easier to face. I'm still scared, but I'm also... I don't know, maybe a little proud? That I'm not letting the fear control me completely anymore. I want to keep going. I want my life back.",
    "Therapist: That's powerful. What's your takeaway today?",
    "Client: I guess... that I'm stronger than I thought. And that facing the memory, as hard as it is, is actually helping me move forward. It's like... by revisiting it, I'm slowly taking back control. I'm not there yet, but... I feel like I'm on the right path.",
    "Therapist: Excellent insight. How will you care for yourself today?",
    "Client: I think I'll go for a walk in the park near my apartment. Being in nature always helps calm me down. And maybe I'll actually send that text to my friend. Just a simple \"hey, how are you?\" It's a small step, but it feels like a start.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a solid plan. Anything else you want to discuss?"
