    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's strange, you know? I'm 77 years old, and here I am, still affected by things that happened so long ago. The memory of that domestic violence... it's like it happened yesterday. I can still hear the shouting, the sound of glass breaking. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The fear. I remember feeling so helpless, so small. I was just a child, but I felt responsible somehow. Like I should have been able to stop it, you know? And then there's this... this guilt. Why couldn't I protect my mother? Why didn't I do more?",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt feel in your body right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a weight on my chest. Heavy. Makes it hard to breathe sometimes. And my hands... they're shaking a bit. I guess that's the fear still lingering.",
    "Therapist: You're very in tune with your body's responses. How does this compare to your day-to-day experiences?",
    "Client: Well, it's... it's more intense right now. But I realize, now that you ask, that I feel these things often. The weight, the shaking... it's there in the background a lot. Especially when I hear loud noises or arguments. I've always attributed it to old age, but maybe... maybe it's been this all along?",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. How do you feel about that realization?",
    "Client: It's... it's a bit scary, actually. But also... relieving? Like, maybe there's a reason for how I've been feeling all these years. Maybe I'm not just being silly or oversensitive.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. What else came up during the exposure?",
    "Client: I... I remembered the bullying too. How the kids at school would tease me about my home life. It's like... like the violence followed me everywhere. At home, at school... I felt so alone. And now, even at my age, sometimes I still feel that way.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly isolating. How are you coping with those feelings now?",
    "Client: I... I try to keep busy. I spend time with my grandchildren. They're a joy, really. But sometimes, when it's quiet, those old feelings creep back in. I've never really talked about this before. It's... it's both terrifying and freeing to speak about it now.",
    "Therapist: You're showing tremendous courage. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm scared. But I think I need to do this. For myself, for my family. I don't want to carry this burden anymore. It's exhausting, you know? Always being on edge, always waiting for the other shoe to drop. I want to feel... peace, I suppose. Is that too much to ask at my age?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. Your desire for peace is valid and achievable. What's one small step you can take this week?",
    "Client: I... I think I'd like to try talking to my daughter about this. Just a little. She's always wondered why I get so nervous sometimes. Maybe... maybe if I open up a bit, it'll help. And maybe it'll help me feel less alone.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great step. How can we prepare for that conversation?",
    "Client: Could we... could we maybe practice what I might say? I'm not sure how to start that kind of conversation. It's been a secret for so long, I don't know how to begin letting it out.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's work on that together next session. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. But also... lighter? Like I've set down a heavy bag I've been carrying for years. It's strange, but... good, I think. Thank you for listening. For not thinking I'm just a silly old woman.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your experiences and feelings are valid. We'll continue this journey together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I'm ready to go home now. But I'll be back next week. This is important, isn't it? It's not too late for me?",
    "Therapist: It's never too late. You're taking brave steps. See you next week.",
    "Client: See you next week. And... thank you again. Really."
