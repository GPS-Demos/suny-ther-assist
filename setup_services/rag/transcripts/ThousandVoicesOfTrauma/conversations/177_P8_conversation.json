    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. The memory of being in that cell, it's so vivid now. I can almost smell the damp concrete and feel the cold seeping into my bones. It's like I'm right back there, you know?",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: Anger, mostly. And fear. I keep thinking about how unfair it all was. I was innocent, but nobody believed me. I lost everything - my job, my family, my freedom. And for what? A mistake. A bloody mistake. I can feel my heart racing just talking about it.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a fire in my chest. My fists are clenched, and I want to punch something. But there's also this heaviness, like a weight pressing down on me. It's suffocating. I remember feeling so helpless in that cell, and now... now I'm feeling it all over again.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why me?\" Why did this have to happen to me? I was a good person, I worked hard, I took care of my family. And then in an instant, it was all gone. I think about my ex-wife, how she looked at me during the trial. The disappointment, the disgust... God, it hurts so much to remember that.",
    "Therapist: How does remembering her reaction affect you now?",
    "Client: It... it makes me feel so small. Worthless. Like maybe I deserved what happened to me. But then I get angry again because I know I didn't. It's this constant back and forth between anger and self-doubt. And underneath it all, there's this deep sadness. I lost so much time, so many opportunities. My kids grew up without me. I can never get that back.",
    "Therapist: What's the hardest part about sitting with these memories?",
    "Client: The hardest part is... is feeling so powerless. Even now, years later, I feel like I have no control. The memory takes over, and I'm right back in that cell, counting the days, wondering if I'll ever see the outside world again. It's like I'm still imprisoned in my own mind.",
    "Therapist: How does that feeling of powerlessness compare to how you feel in your life now?",
    "Client: I... I guess it's not as bad now. I mean, I'm free, I have a job. But there's always this fear that it could all be taken away again. I struggle to trust people, to feel secure. It's like I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop. But... but I suppose I do have more control now than I did then. It's just hard to remember that sometimes.",
    "Therapist: What helps you feel more in control?",
    "Client: Hmm... I guess talking about it, like we're doing now. It helps to put it all into words, to make sense of it. And my work, actually. When I'm focused on a project, solving problems, I feel capable again. It's like I'm proving to myself that I still have value, that I can contribute something to the world.",
    "Therapist: How does that sense of contribution affect your view of yourself?",
    "Client: It... it helps. It reminds me that I'm more than what happened to me. I'm not just an ex-prisoner or a victim. I'm a professional, I'm good at what I do. But it's a constant struggle. Some days I feel almost normal, and then something will trigger a memory, and I'm right back in that dark place.",
    "Therapist: What do you do when those triggers happen?",
    "Client: I try to breathe, to remind myself where I am. Sometimes I call my sister - she's been really supportive through all of this. Or I'll go for a long walk, just to feel the open air and remind myself that I'm free now. But it's hard. Sometimes the memories are so strong, it's like I can't escape them.",
    "Therapist: How do you think these memories are affecting your current relationships?",
    "Client: They... they make it hard to connect with people. I'm always on guard, always worried that if people knew the truth about my past, they'd reject me. It's why my marriage fell apart. I couldn't open up, couldn't let her in. And now, living alone... it's safer, but it's lonely. I miss having someone to talk to, to share my life with.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to you to be able to open up to someone?",
    "Client: It would mean... everything. To be accepted, understood. To not have to carry this burden alone. But it's terrifying. The thought of being vulnerable, of risking rejection again... it's almost too much to bear. Yet, at the same time, I crave that connection. It's like I'm torn between my fear and my need for companionship.",
    "Therapist: How does exploring these feelings in therapy impact you?",
    "Client: It's... it's challenging. Painful, even. But there's also a sense of relief. Like I'm finally facing these demons instead of running from them. And talking about it, putting it all into words... it helps make it feel more manageable somehow. Less overwhelming. I guess... I guess I'm starting to see that maybe I'm stronger than I thought.",
    "Therapist: What does that strength mean to you?",
    "Client: It means... hope, I suppose. Hope that maybe I can move past this, that I'm not doomed to be a prisoner of my memories forever. It means that maybe, just maybe, I can rebuild my life, my relationships. That I can find a way to live with what happened without letting it define me. It's scary, but... but it's also exciting. Like I'm finally starting to see a future for myself again.",
    "Therapist: How do you want to use that strength moving forward?",
    "Client: I... I think I want to try connecting with people more. Maybe reach out to my kids, try to rebuild those relationships. And perhaps... perhaps even consider dating again. It's terrifying, but I'm tired of being alone. I want to live, not just survive. And maybe... maybe even use my experience to help others who've been through similar situations. Turn this pain into something meaningful, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a powerful goal. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, to be honest. But there's also this strange sense of lightness. Like I've put down a heavy load I've been carrying for years. It's not gone, but it feels... manageable. I'm scared about what comes next, but for the first time in a long time, I'm also feeling a bit hopeful. Thank you for listening, for helping me work through this. It means more than I can say.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredible work today. How would you like to close our session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to take a moment to just breathe. To sit with this new feeling of hope, however small it might be. And maybe... maybe make a plan for one small step I can take this week. Something to keep moving forward. Even if it's just sending a text to my kids or going for coffee with a colleague. Something to remind myself that I'm not trapped anymore, that I have choices now.",
