    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Can you describe the event we've been working on?",
    "Client: Okay... It was about two months ago. I was walking home from work, and a group of men started following me. They were shouting racial slurs and making threatening gestures. I felt my heart racing, and I couldn't breathe properly. I wanted to run, but I was afraid they'd catch me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: As I walked faster, they picked up their pace too. One of them grabbed my arm, and I screamed. I tried to pull away, but he was too strong. The others were laughing and jeering. I felt so helpless and scared. I kept thinking, \"This is it. They're going to hurt me.\"",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What were you feeling?",
    "Client: I felt... terrified. My whole body was shaking. I could smell alcohol on their breath, and it made me feel sick. I closed my eyes, waiting for the worst to happen. I was thinking about my family, wondering if I'd ever see them again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: Suddenly, I heard someone shout from across the street. It was an elderly man who had seen what was happening. He was calling for help and threatening to call the police. The men let go of me and started to back away. I was still frozen in place, unable to move.",
    "Therapist: How did you feel when the men started to leave?",
    "Client: I felt... relieved, but also angry and humiliated. My legs were weak, and I was struggling to breathe normally. I wanted to cry, but I couldn't. I just stood there, watching them walk away, laughing as if it was all a joke to them.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) I... I can't believe this happened to me. I've always been careful, always tried to avoid dangerous situations. But in that moment, I felt so powerless. Like I was nothing. Just because of the color of my skin.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength by facing this memory.",
    "Client: (taking a deep breath) After they left, the old man came over to check on me. He was kind, but I couldn't stop shaking. I thanked him and hurried home. Once I got inside, I locked the door and broke down crying. I felt so violated, so angry at the world. Why did this have to happen to me?",
    "Therapist: You're handling this really well. How do you feel right now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. Talking about it brings back all those feelings of fear and anger. But there's also a part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I'm facing it head-on instead of trying to push it away.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive perspective. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I notice that my hands are clenched, and my heart is racing a bit. But I also feel more grounded than when we started. It's like... I'm acknowledging what happened without letting it consume me entirely.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How would you like to proceed?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to talk about how this experience has affected my daily life. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Please, go ahead.",
    "Client: Well, since that day, I've been struggling with anxiety whenever I'm out in public. I'm constantly looking over my shoulder, expecting something bad to happen. I've started taking longer routes home to avoid certain areas, even if it means walking for an extra 20 minutes. I hate that I feel this way, but I can't seem to shake it off.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to feel that way. Continue.",
    "Client: I've also been having trouble sleeping. I keep replaying that night in my head, thinking about what I could have done differently. Sometimes I have nightmares where I'm back in that situation, but this time no one comes to help me. I wake up in a cold sweat, feeling just as terrified as I did that night.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave sharing this. How else has it impacted you?",
    "Client: It's affected my relationships too. I find it hard to talk about what happened with my partner or friends. I don't want them to see me as a victim or treat me differently. But at the same time, I feel disconnected from them because they can't really understand what I'm going through.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. You're doing well expressing it.",
    "Client: Thank you. I guess... I'm also angry at myself for letting this affect me so much. I know logically that it wasn't my fault, but there's a part of me that feels weak for not being able to just move on. I keep wondering if I'll ever feel normal again.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have those feelings. They're part of healing.",
    "Client: (sighing) I suppose you're right. It's just... hard. Some days are better than others. There are moments when I almost feel like my old self, and then something will trigger a memory, and I'm right back there. I'm tired of feeling this way, but I'm also scared of forgetting. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. Many people experience similar conflicts.",
    "Client: I guess what I'm hoping for is to find a balance. To be able to acknowledge what happened without letting it control my life. To feel safe again, but also stay aware. I want to reclaim my life, you know? To walk down the street without fear, to enjoy time with my friends without this constant cloud hanging over me.",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. How do you feel after sharing all this?",
    "Client: I feel... exhausted, but also a bit lighter. Like I've been carrying this weight around, and now I've set it down for a moment. It's still there, but it doesn't feel as heavy. I'm grateful for the chance to talk about it openly, even though it's difficult.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. Thank you for listening and for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't judge. I know we still have a long way to go, but I feel like I've taken a step forward today.",
    "Therapist: You absolutely have. We'll continue next session."
