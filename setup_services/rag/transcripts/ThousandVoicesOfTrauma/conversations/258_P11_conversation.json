    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. Going through that memory of the hostage situation... it brought back so many intense feelings.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The fear. It was so... visceral. I could almost smell the musty air in that room again, feel the rough texture of the rope on my wrists. And the uncertainty... not knowing if I'd make it out alive. It's like I was right back there.",
    "Therapist: How does that compare to your daily experiences?",
    "Client: It's... it's similar, actually. I realize now that I carry that fear with me all the time. Even when I'm just walking to class or trying to sleep at night. It's always there, lurking in the background.",
    "Therapist: What else did you notice?",
    "Client: I felt so... helpless. Both then and now. Like I have no control over my life or my safety. And angry too. Why did this happen to me? It's not fair.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings impact your life now?",
    "Client: They... they hold me back. I'm always on edge, always waiting for something bad to happen. I've been pushing people away, afraid to get close. And I've been struggling with my studies. It's hard to focus when you're constantly looking over your shoulder.",
    "Therapist: What did you learn from this experience?",
    "Client: I... I guess I realized how much this event is still affecting me. But also... I got through it. Both then and now. Maybe I'm stronger than I give myself credit for.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. How can you build on that?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I could try to be a bit braver in my daily life. Take small steps, like going out with friends more often or speaking up in class. I've been avoiding so much, but facing this memory head-on... it shows me that I can face other things too.",
    "Therapist: That's a great idea. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: It's hard, really hard. But I think it's helping. Each time we do this, it gets a little easier to talk about. And I'm starting to see how it all connects to my current struggles. I want to keep going. I want my life back.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. What else would you like to share?",
    "Client: I... I'm grateful for this space. For the first time in a long time, I feel like someone really understands what I've been through. And I'm starting to understand it better myself. It's painful, but it's also... freeing, in a way.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful progress. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I feel drained, but also... lighter somehow. Like I've put down a heavy burden, even if just for a moment. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care of yourself this week.",
    "Client: I will. And... I'm actually looking forward to our next session. I never thought I'd say that, but I am. This is hard work, but I can see now that it's worth it."
