    "Therapist: How are you feeling after going through that memory today?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving that time of imprisonment, it brings back so many complicated emotions. The neglect I experienced, the isolation... it's like I'm right back there in that cell, you know? I can almost feel the cold concrete against my skin and smell the musty air. It's strange how vivid it all becomes.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The silence. God, the silence was deafening. I remember lying awake at night, straining to hear any sound of life outside my cell. Sometimes I'd hear footsteps, and my heart would race, not knowing if it meant food or... something worse. I felt so small, so insignificant. Like I'd been forgotten by the world.",
    "Therapist: How did that make you feel?",
    "Client: Terrified. Angry. Hopeless. It's a cocktail of emotions that's hard to describe. I felt this deep sense of injustice, you know? I kept thinking, \"This isn't right. I don't deserve this.\" But then there were moments when I started to doubt myself, wondering if maybe I did deserve it somehow. It's messed up, I know, but that's where my mind went sometimes.",
    "Therapist: Mm. How do those feelings connect to your daily life now?",
    "Client: Well, I still struggle with feeling invisible sometimes. Like my needs don't matter. And there's this constant anxiety, always waiting for the other shoe to drop. I have a hard time trusting that good things will last. It's like I'm still waiting for someone to come and take everything away from me.",
    "Therapist: I see. What's helping you cope?",
    "Client: Honestly? This therapy. Talking about it, as hard as it is, helps. And my partner... they've been incredibly patient. Oh, and I've started keeping a journal. Writing things down helps me process and reminds me that I have a voice now. I'm not silenced anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How else has this impacted you?",
    "Client: It's... it's made me more compassionate, I think. Towards others who are suffering or feeling trapped. But it's also made me fiercely protective of my freedom. Sometimes to a fault. I can get pretty anxious in crowded spaces or if I feel like I can't leave somewhere easily. It's like my body remembers that feeling of confinement and just... reacts.",
    "Therapist: How do you manage those reactions?",
    "Client: Deep breaths help. And grounding techniques - you know, focusing on what I can see, hear, touch. It reminds me that I'm here, now, not back there. And I try to talk to myself kindly, like I would to a friend. Reminding myself that I'm safe, that this will pass. It doesn't always work, but it helps.",
    "Therapist: That's very insightful. What's been challenging lately?",
    "Client: Nightmares. They've been more frequent since we started these sessions. I know you said that might happen, but it's still tough. I wake up in a cold sweat, feeling like I'm back there. It takes me a while to reorient myself, to remember that I'm home, that I'm safe. My partner's been great, but I can tell it's taking a toll on them too.",
    "Therapist: How are you handling that?",
    "Client: I'm trying to be patient with myself. Reminding myself that this is part of the healing process. I've started doing some light yoga before bed, which seems to help a bit. And I'm working on communicating more with my partner about what I need when I wake up from a nightmare. Sometimes it's space, sometimes it's closeness. It's a learning process for both of us.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent self-awareness. What else have you noticed?",
    "Client: I've noticed that I'm starting to feel... stronger? Like, talking about this doesn't completely knock me off my feet anymore. Don't get me wrong, it's still hard. But I feel like I'm starting to see it as something that happened to me, not something that defines me. It's a subtle shift, but it feels important.",
    "Therapist: It is. How does that shift feel?",
    "Client: It feels... liberating. Like I'm taking back some control. I'm not just a victim of my past anymore. I'm a survivor, and I'm actively working on my healing. It's empowering, even on the days when it feels impossibly hard. And it makes me feel like maybe, just maybe, I can help others who've been through similar experiences someday.",
    "Therapist: That's powerful. What's your focus moving forward?",
    "Client: I want to keep pushing through this, as hard as it is. I want to get to a place where the memories don't have so much power over me. Where I can think about that time without feeling like I'm right back there. And I want to keep working on my relationships - with my partner, with myself. I want to be fully present in my life, you know? Not always looking over my shoulder or waiting for the worst to happen.",
    "Therapist: Excellent goals. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. This was tough, but... good. Thank you for guiding me through it. I know we still have a long way to go, but I'm starting to feel like there's light at the end of this tunnel. It's not always visible, but I know it's there. And that gives me hope.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Take care."
