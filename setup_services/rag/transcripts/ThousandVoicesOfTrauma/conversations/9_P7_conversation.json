    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the moment when you first realized you were seriously ill?",
    "Client: It was a regular checkup... I didn't expect anything. The doctor's face changed when he looked at my test results. He said, \"Mr. Johnson, we need to talk.\" My heart started racing. I knew something was wrong.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: He told me I had stage 3 cancer. I felt like the room was spinning. I couldn't breathe. All I could think was, \"This can't be happening.\" I remembered my wife waiting outside. How could I tell her? It brought back memories of when I was abused as a child... that same feeling of helplessness.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I felt so alone, just like back then. The doctor was talking, but I couldn't hear him. All I could think about was dying, leaving my wife alone. I started sweating, my hands were shaking. I wanted to run away, but I couldn't move.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I managed to ask about treatment options, but my voice sounded strange, distant. The doctor mentioned chemotherapy, radiation... it all sounded so scary. I thought about losing my hair, being sick all the time. I felt so vulnerable, exposed... just like when I was abused.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I left the office in a daze. My wife knew something was wrong as soon as she saw me. I couldn't speak, I just broke down crying. She held me, but I felt so ashamed, so weak. It was like being that helpless child again, unable to protect myself.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking a bit. My heart's racing. It's hard to talk about this, to remember how scared I was. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I survived that moment, and I'm here now.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) It's strange... talking about it makes it feel both more real and less overwhelming at the same time. I remember driving home that day, everything looked different. The trees, the sky... it was like I was seeing them for the first time. I kept thinking, \"Will I see another summer?\"",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job staying present with the memory.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard, but... I think it's helping. That night, I couldn't sleep. I kept replaying the doctor's words in my head. My wife tried to comfort me, but I felt so distant. I was angry too - angry at my body for betraying me, angry at the world. It reminded me of the anger I felt after the abuse, but I never let myself feel it back then.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to acknowledge those feelings. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I think that's what scared me the most - all these emotions I'd buried for so long were suddenly right there, impossible to ignore. The fear of dying mixed with old fears from my childhood. I felt like I was drowning in it all.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this incredibly well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... intense. But I feel like I'm starting to understand how these experiences are connected. The helplessness, the fear... but also the strength I found to face them. I'm still here, aren't I? I survived both times.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's exhausting to talk about, but I think it's helping. I've never really connected these experiences before. It's like I'm seeing my life from a new perspective. It's scary, but also... maybe a little liberating?",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. How do you feel physically right now?",
    "Client: My heart rate is slowing down a bit. I feel drained, but also... lighter? Like I've set down a heavy load I've been carrying for a long time. My hands are still shaking a little, but not as much as before.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Let's start winding down.",
    "Client: Okay. I... I appreciate your guidance through this. It's not easy, but I think I'm starting to see how facing these memories can help me. I've spent so long trying to avoid thinking about the abuse and the illness, but maybe that's been holding me back.",
    "Therapist: That's a valuable insight. How would you like to end our session?",
    "Client: Could we just sit quietly for a moment? I need some time to process everything we've talked about. And maybe... could you remind me of some grounding techniques? I want to make sure I'm okay before I leave.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take a few deep breaths together.",
    "Client: (takes several deep breaths) Thank you. This has been intense, but I think it's been good. I feel... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I can face these memories without being overwhelmed by them.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: Thank you. I am feeling proud, actually. It's a new feeling for me, especially when it comes to these difficult memories. I think I'm ready to end the session now. Same time next week?",
    "Therapist: Yes, same time next week. Take care of yourself."
