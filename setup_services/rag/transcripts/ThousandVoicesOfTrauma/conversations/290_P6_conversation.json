    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's begin. Close your eyes and recall the home invasion...",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in my living room, reading a book. It's late evening, and I'm alone. Suddenly, I hear a loud crash from the kitchen. My heart starts racing immediately. I freeze, unable to move.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 5. I can feel my chest tightening as I remember it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue...",
    "Client: I hear footsteps coming closer. They're heavy, definitely a man's. I'm paralyzed with fear, my book falls from my hands. The intruder enters the living room, and I see him - tall, wearing dark clothes and a mask. My breath catches in my throat.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 7. My palms are sweating just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: He sees me and rushes forward. I try to scream, but no sound comes out. He grabs my arm roughly, and I can smell alcohol on his breath. I'm shaking uncontrollably, thinking this is how I'm going to die.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) He's yelling at me, asking where I keep my valuables. I'm sobbing, pointing towards the bedroom. He drags me there, his grip bruising my arm. I'm praying someone, anyone, will hear and come help.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: Still at a 9. My heart is pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you survived this. Keep going.",
    "Client: In the bedroom, he throws me onto the bed. I'm crying hysterically as he ransacks the room. Drawers are flying open, clothes everywhere. I'm curled up, trying to make myself as small as possible. The noise is deafening - drawers slamming, him cursing.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down a bit. Maybe an 8 now. I'm starting to remember that I get through this.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing it. Continue.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud knock at the front door. My neighbor must have heard the commotion. The intruder panics, grabs what he can, and runs out. I'm left there, shaking and sobbing. I can barely move to call for help.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6. I'm feeling relief that it's over in the memory.",
    "Therapist: You did exceptionally well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, but... oddly relieved. Like I've faced it head-on for the first time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. Well done today."
