    "Therapist: Welcome back, John. Are you ready to continue our imaginal exposure work today?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here.",
    "Client: Okay. I'll try my best. Where should I start?",
    "Therapist: Begin with the memory we discussed last time. Take a deep breath and describe what you see.",
    "Client: Alright. I'm... I'm in my childhood home. It's late at night, and I can hear my parents arguing downstairs. The shouting is getting louder, and I'm scared. I'm hiding under my blanket, trying to block out the noise.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: I can feel my heart racing. The blanket feels suffocating, but I'm too afraid to come out. I hear something crash downstairs, and my mom screams. I want to help her, but I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I can't breathe. It's like I'm back there, and I can't do anything. I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're handling this bravely.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm trying. I can hear footsteps coming up the stairs now. They're heavy and angry. I know it's my father, and I'm terrified he'll come into my room.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: The footsteps stop outside my door. I'm holding my breath, praying he won't come in. I can hear my mom sobbing downstairs. I feel so guilty for not helping her, but I'm paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. You're processing this well.",
    "Client: The doorknob starts to turn, and I'm shaking uncontrollably. I want to scream, but no sound comes out. As the door opens, I can smell the alcohol on his breath...",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Keep going if you can.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can. It's too much. I feel like I'm right back there, and I can't escape.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You've done excellent work today.",
    "Client: Really? It feels like I failed because I couldn't finish.",
    "Therapist: Not at all. You've made significant progress.",
    "Client: I guess so. It's just... it's so hard to relive those moments. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever be free from these memories.",
    "Therapist: Your resilience is admirable. Each session helps.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your support. It means a lot to have someone listen without judgment. I've never really talked about this with anyone before.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, honestly. But also a little lighter, if that makes sense. Like I've let go of a small piece of the burden I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive sign. You're processing well.",
    "Client: I hope so. It's strange, but even though it's painful, I feel like I'm starting to understand my past better. And maybe... maybe it's not all my fault.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. You're making progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. I know we're almost out of time, but there's something else I wanted to ask. Is it normal to feel... angry? Not just scared, but really angry at my parents?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Anger is a natural response.",
    "Client: That's... that's good to know. I've always felt guilty about being angry, like I didn't have the right. But hearing you say that helps.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. We'll explore this more.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I think I'm starting to see how much this has affected my current relationships, especially with my wife. I want to work on that.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent goal. We'll address it.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm nervous about our next session, but I'm also... hopeful? Is that the right word?",
    "Therapist: Hope is powerful. You're on the right path.",
    "Client: I think so too. Thank you for today. It was tough, but I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: You've done well. We'll continue next week.",
    "Client: Alright. I'll try to practice some of those grounding techniques we talked about before. See you next week.",
    "Therapist: Take care, John. You've made real progress today."
