    "Therapist: Welcome back, Mei. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares lately, and I'm not sure if I'm ready for this.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's discuss the imaginal exposure we planned.",
    "Client: Okay... I remember you mentioning it last time, but I'm still not entirely sure what it involves. Can you explain it again?",
    "Therapist: Of course. It's a technique where you'll recount your trauma in detail. It helps process memories and reduce symptoms.",
    "Client: That sounds... intense. I'm worried about reliving everything. What if I can't handle it?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace, and I'll support you throughout.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's just... I've spent so long trying to forget what happened during my imprisonment. The idea of voluntarily bringing it all up is terrifying. How will this help me?",
    "Therapist: By facing memories, we can reduce their power over you. It may decrease nightmares and anxiety.",
    "Client: I see. I do want those to stop. But what if I freeze up or panic during the session?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. We have grounding techniques, and can pause anytime you need.",
    "Client: Alright, that makes me feel a bit better. How long will this process take? Will we do it every session?",
    "Therapist: We'll do it for about 30-45 minutes today, then discuss. We'll repeat in future sessions as needed.",
    "Client: That's longer than I expected. I'm worried about how I'll feel afterwards. Will I be able to function normally?",
    "Therapist: It may be emotionally draining. I recommend taking it easy after our session.",
    "Client: Okay, I'll make sure to clear my schedule for the rest of the day. Is there anything I should do to prepare myself?",
    "Therapist: Just bring your willingness to engage. Your courage in facing this is admirable.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot. I'm still scared, but I trust you. I know you've helped me make progress so far. I just hope this works.",
    "Therapist: Your trust is appreciated. Remember, this is a step towards healing. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Let's do this before I lose my nerve. Where do you want me to start?",
    "Therapist: Start from the beginning of the imprisonment. Describe it as if it's happening now.",
    "Client: Okay... *deep breath* I'm in a small, dark room. The air is thick and musty..."
