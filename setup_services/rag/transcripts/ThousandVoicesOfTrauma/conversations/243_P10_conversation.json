    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is dreading it. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Uh, probably around a 6 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. When you're ready, close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day in the hospital.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Alright... I'm there. The room is so white, it's almost blinding. The antiseptic smell is overwhelming. I'm lying in the bed, and I can hear the beeping of machines all around me.",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see... I see nurses rushing in and out. They look worried. My chest feels tight, and I'm struggling to breathe. It's like... like I'm trapped in my own body. God, I hate this feeling.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: The doctor comes in. He's frowning, looking at my chart. He says something about my blood pressure dropping dangerously low. I... I can't seem to focus on his words. Everything's getting hazy.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Panic. Pure panic. I want to get up, to run away, but I can't move. It's like I'm paralyzed. My heart is racing so fast I think it might burst out of my chest.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Shaky breath) Right, right... The nurse, she's attaching more wires to me. Each touch feels like ice on my skin. I'm trying to ask what's happening, but my voice won't work. It's like... like I'm trapped in a glass box, watching everything happen to me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe higher. I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The room starts spinning. I can hear alarms going off, but they sound far away. The doctor is shouting orders, and I see a crash cart being wheeled in. Oh God, I think I'm dying. I'm actually dying.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, John. This is just a memory.",
    "Client: (Breathing heavily) I know, I know. But it feels so real. I can feel the cold sweat on my skin, the way my body's shaking uncontrollably. The nurse is trying to calm me down, but her words are just noise.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: They're preparing to intubate me. I see the tube, and panic overwhelms me. I try to shake my head, to tell them no, but I can't move. It's like I'm a prisoner in my own body. The feeling of helplessness is suffocating.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. Describe it.",
    "Client: It's... it's like being buried alive. I can't move, can't speak, can't even breathe on my own. The tube goes in, and it burns. My throat feels like it's on fire. I want to cough, to fight against it, but I can't.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: I know. You're very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: Everything starts to fade. The voices become muffled, the lights dim. I'm slipping away, and I can't do anything about it. I think... I think this is what dying feels like. The loneliness, the fear, it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you survived this. You're here now.",
    "Client: (Nodding) Yeah... yeah. But in that moment, I didn't know that. I thought it was the end. The darkness closes in, and I'm floating. It's quiet, eerily quiet. And then... nothing.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What do you notice as you come out of that memory?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. My hands are shaking. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, relief maybe? Like I've faced it again and survived.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 6 again. Still high, but not as bad as before.",
    "Therapist: You did very well. How do you feel about what you just experienced?",
    "Client: It's still terrifying, but... I feel like I understand it better now. Like I can see it from the outside a bit more. It's not just this overwhelming blur of panic anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a great insight. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: Okay... (deep breath) I can feel the chair beneath me. The air conditioning on my skin. I'm here, in your office. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: My heart rate is slowing down. The knot in my stomach is loosening a bit. I feel... tired, but also kind of accomplished? Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a common reaction after processing trauma.",
    "Client: I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It's still hard, but... I don't know, it feels different now.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How do you think this experience might change things for you?",
    "Client: I think... I think it might help me feel less trapped by the memory. Like, I know now that I can face it and come out the other side. It's still scary, but not as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How might you use this in your daily life?",
    "Client: Well, maybe the next time I have a doctor's appointment, I won't be as paralyzed by fear. I might still be anxious, but I can remind myself that I've faced worse and survived.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent application. Any other thoughts?",
    "Client: I'm just... I'm proud of myself, I guess. I didn't think I could do this. It makes me wonder what else I might be capable of that I've been too afraid to try.",
    "Therapist: That's a very positive outlook. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... good. Like I've run a marathon or something. My SUDS is probably down to a 3 now.",
    "Therapist: That's fantastic progress. Let's end here for today. Remember to practice your breathing exercises this week.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you... this was tough, but I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: You did all the hard work. Well done, John. We'll continue next week."
