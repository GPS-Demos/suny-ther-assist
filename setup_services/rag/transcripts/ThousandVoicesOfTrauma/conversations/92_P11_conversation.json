    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. Going through that memory of the earthquake again, it's like I was right back there. The ground shaking, the sounds of things falling and breaking, people screaming... It's a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: Understandable. What stood out most?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. I remember feeling so powerless, like the world was literally crumbling around me and there was nothing I could do. It's strange because I've always prided myself on being in control, you know? But in that moment, all of that just... disappeared.",
    "Therapist: How does that connect to your everyday life now?",
    "Client: I guess... I'm always on edge, waiting for the next disaster. It's like I'm constantly preparing for everything to fall apart again. Even in my relationships, I struggle to let my guard down. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: What did you notice about your body during the exposure?",
    "Client: My heart was racing, and I felt this tightness in my chest. My hands were shaking too. It's funny, I didn't even realize how tense I was until you asked. I think I was holding my breath for part of it.",
    "Therapist: How does this compare to your usual reactions?",
    "Client: It's similar, but more intense. I get these physical reactions sometimes when I'm stressed about exams or when I argue with my partner. But during the exposure, it was like everything was amplified. I could feel every little sensation.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts came up for you?",
    "Client: Mostly \"I can't handle this\" and \"I'm going to die.\" It's irrational, I know. I'm safe here, but in the moment, it felt so real. I also had this overwhelming thought of \"I'm alone in this.\" Even though I know I have support now, it's like my brain forgets that sometimes.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts impact you day-to-day?",
    "Client: They make me withdraw, I think. I don't reach out to friends as much as I used to. I'm always second-guessing myself, wondering if I can handle things. It affects my studies too. I procrastinate because I'm afraid of not being able to cope with the workload.",
    "Therapist: What did you learn about yourself today?",
    "Client: I... I think I realized I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. Going through that memory was tough, but I did it. And I'm still here, still breathing. Maybe I can handle more than I thought.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How can you apply this?",
    "Client: I suppose I could try to challenge those negative thoughts more. When I start feeling like I can't handle something, I could remind myself of this session. If I can face this memory, maybe I can face other challenges too.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. What else might help you moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe talking to my partner about this more. They've been so supportive, but I've been keeping a lot of it inside. Sharing might help me feel less alone in this.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great step. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... kind of hopeful? It's like I've climbed a mountain. It was hard, but the view from here is different. I can see things I couldn't before.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think I'd like to work more on those physical reactions. Maybe some techniques to help when I start feeling overwhelmed? And... I'd like to explore how this is affecting my relationships more. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll cover that next session. Well done today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It means a lot to have this support. I know it's your job, but... it helps. I'm nervous about continuing, but I think I'm ready to keep going with this.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, I'll be here. Thanks again."
