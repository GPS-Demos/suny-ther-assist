    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. That memory of the dog attack... it's still so vivid. I can feel my heart pounding, just like it did that day.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you noticing right now?",
    "Client: My palms are sweaty, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's hard to breathe normally. I keep expecting to hear that growling sound again, you know? It's like... like I'm right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: And what thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt. How I couldn't do anything to stop it. And then... then I remember my father's reaction afterward. He just... he told me to man up, that it wasn't a big deal. But it was. It still is.",
    "Therapist: How does recalling your father's response make you feel?",
    "Client: Angry. Hurt. Like I wasn't important enough. It's not just about the dog attack anymore, it's... it's about feeling dismissed, you know? Like my feelings didn't matter. And now, even years later, I struggle to express how I feel because... because what if no one cares?",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. What else comes up for you?",
    "Client: I feel... ashamed, I guess. Like I should have been stronger or braver. Maybe if I had reacted differently, my father would have taken it more seriously. And now, here I am, 28 years old, living with my parents, unemployed. It's like I'm still that scared kid who can't face the world.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings connect to your day-to-day life now?",
    "Client: It's... it's everywhere. I avoid parks, I cross the street if I see a dog. I've turned down job opportunities because they involved working in areas where I might encounter dogs. And relationships? Forget about it. How can I protect someone else when I couldn't even protect myself?",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your body as you share this?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking a bit. My jaw feels clenched. There's this knot in my stomach that just won't go away. It's like my body is always on high alert, always waiting for the next attack.",
    "Therapist: And how does that constant state of alertness affect you?",
    "Client: It's exhausting. I'm always tired, always in pain. The chronic pain... sometimes I wonder if it's my body's way of keeping me on guard. Like, if I hurt all the time, I'll always be ready to react. But it's no way to live. I feel stuck, trapped in this cycle of fear and pain.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you reflect on feeling stuck?",
    "Client: Frustration. Anger at myself for not being able to move past this. But also... a tiny bit of hope? Like, maybe by talking about it, by facing it head-on in these sessions, I can start to break free. It's terrifying, but... but I want to try. I want to feel safe again.",
    "Therapist: That desire for change is powerful. What does safety look like to you?",
    "Client: Safety... it's being able to walk down the street without constantly looking over my shoulder. It's being able to express my feelings without fear of judgment or dismissal. It's... it's feeling comfortable in my own skin, in my own mind. And maybe, someday, it's being able to pet a dog without having a panic attack.",
    "Therapist: How does imagining that future make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's both exciting and scary. Part of me wants to reach for it, but another part is afraid of being disappointed. What if I can't get there? What if I'm just broken beyond repair?",
    "Therapist: Those are understandable concerns. What gives you hope?",
    "Client: I guess... the fact that I'm here, talking about it. That's something I couldn't have done a year ago. And... and the fact that you're listening, really listening. It makes me feel like maybe I'm not alone in this. Maybe there is a way forward.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What else?",
    "Client: I... I think about my chronic pain too. How it's always there, but some days are better than others. Maybe healing from trauma is like that? It might always be part of me, but it doesn't have to control me. I want to learn how to have better days, how to manage it.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea sit with you?",
    "Client: It feels... possible. Like maybe I'm not aiming for some perfect, trauma-free life, but a life where I can cope, where I can thrive despite what happened. It's still scary, but... but it feels more achievable. More real.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to explore more about how to manage those moments of panic when they come up. And maybe... maybe start talking more about my relationship with my parents. I feel like there's a lot there that I need to unpack.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, but... but also a bit lighter? Like I've set down a heavy backpack I've been carrying for years. I know I'll have to pick it up again when I leave, but... but now I know I can set it down sometimes. That feels... that feels important.",
    "Therapist: It is important. We'll end here for today. Take care.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I'll see you next week."
