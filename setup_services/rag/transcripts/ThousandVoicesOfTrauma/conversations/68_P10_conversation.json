    "Therapist: Good afternoon, Mrs. Patel. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Oh, hello Dr. Thompson. I'm... well, I'm a bit anxious, to be honest. I know we're going to be talking about that awful night, and it's making my stomach churn a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I suppose we should. *deep breath* Where do I start?",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes if you're comfortable. Take us to that night.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm in my bed. It's late, maybe around 11 PM. I remember feeling so tired after a long day of volunteering at the community center. The house is quiet, and I can hear the gentle hum of the fan...",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I hear a noise. At first, I think it's just the house settling, you know? But then there's another sound, louder this time. Like... like something breaking. My heart starts racing. I sit up in bed, straining to listen.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking. I can feel my pulse in my throat. It's... it's hard to breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing well. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I get out of bed. My legs feel weak, like they might give out. I'm thinking, \"This can't be happening. Not here, not to me.\" I grab my phone from the nightstand, but my hands are trembling so much I can barely hold it.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling?",
    "Client: Oh, goodness. It's... it's about an 80. My heart is pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take another deep breath. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Okay... I'm creeping towards my bedroom door. The hallway is dark, but I can see a sliver of light coming from downstairs. I'm trying to be quiet, but the floorboards creak under my feet. I freeze, terrified they'll hear me.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in that moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about my granddaughter's picture on the wall. How I might never see her again. I'm wondering if I should call for help or try to hide. I feel so helpless, so... vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: I can hear them moving around downstairs. The sound of drawers opening, things being tossed around. I'm paralyzed with fear, but I know I need to do something. I... I decide to try and make it to the guest room. It has a lock on the door.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 90. I can feel my heart racing, even now.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here with me. You're safe. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: *takes a shaky breath* Thank you... I'm okay. I can do this. So, I'm inching towards the guest room. Every step feels like an eternity. I keep thinking they'll come up the stairs any second. I finally reach the door and slip inside, closing it as quietly as I can.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens once you're in the room?",
    "Client: I'm fumbling with the lock, my hands are shaking so badly. I finally get it locked and I slide down against the door. I can hear my own ragged breathing, and I'm trying to muffle it. I've got my phone clutched to my chest, and I'm trying to decide whether to call the police.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified they'll hear me if I speak. But I'm also worried that if I don't call now, it'll be too late. I keep thinking about all the stories in the news, about home invasions gone wrong. I feel so alone, so... helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 85? My chest feels tight, like I can't get enough air.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *takes several deep breaths* Thank you... I'm... I'm okay. So, I decide to call the police. I'm trying to keep my voice as low as possible as I give them my address. The operator is telling me to stay calm, that help is on the way. But all I can think about is how long it might take them to get here.",
    "Therapist: What do you do while you're waiting?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm huddled in the corner of the room, as far from the door as possible. I can hear them moving around downstairs. Something shatters - I think it might be the vase my late husband gave me. I have to bite my lip to keep from crying out.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling a mixture of fear and anger. Fear for my life, but also anger that these people are in my home, destroying my memories. I'm clutching my phone like a lifeline, praying that the police will arrive soon.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 80? My hands are clammy, and I feel a bit lightheaded.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here with me.",
    "Client: *takes a deep breath* Thank you... I'm trying. So, I'm sitting there, and suddenly I hear a loud bang downstairs. At first, I think they've broken something else, but then I hear shouting. \"Police! Don't move!\" My heart leaps into my throat. I want to cry with relief, but I'm still too scared to make a sound.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: There's a lot of commotion downstairs. I can hear running, more shouting. Then there's a knock on the bedroom door, and a woman's voice saying, \"Ma'am? This is the police. Are you in there? You're safe now.\" I... I can barely get my legs to work. I stumble to the door, fumbling with the lock again.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking all over. Relief is washing over me, but I'm also still terrified. What if it's a trick? What if the intruders are forcing the police to say this? I open the door just a crack at first, peering out.",
    "Therapist: And what do you see?",
    "Client: I see a female officer, her uniform, her badge. She looks concerned but kind. Behind her, I can see other officers in the hallway. It's... it's really over. I burst into tears, all the fear and tension finally releasing.",
    "Therapist: You've done so well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. But also... I don't know, maybe a little proud? I made it through. I did what I needed to do to stay safe.",
    "Therapist: That's right, you did. You showed incredible strength. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down. Maybe a 60 now? My heart isn't racing as much anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Let's take a few deep breaths together.",
    "Client: *breathes deeply* Thank you, Dr. Thompson. This... this wasn't easy, but I think it helped. Talking about it... it makes it feel less overwhelming somehow.",
    "Therapist: You've made excellent progress today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but also a bit lighter. Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time. It's still scary to think about, but... maybe a little less so now.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. Remember, healing takes time.",
    "Client: Yes, I understand. It's a process, isn't it? I... I think I'm ready to face this memory now, instead of running from it. It's hard, but... I think it's necessary.",
    "Therapist: That's a very insightful perspective. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. I'm feeling quite tired now, but... in a good way, if that makes sense? Like I've accomplished something important.",
    "Therapist: You have. You've shown great courage today.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Thompson. I... I appreciate your guidance through this. It means a lot to have someone to talk to about this, someone who understands.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later.",
    "Client: I will. I'll practice those breathing exercises we talked about. And maybe I'll call my daughter later... I think talking to her might help too.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Take care, Mrs. Patel.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Thompson. I'll see you next week."
