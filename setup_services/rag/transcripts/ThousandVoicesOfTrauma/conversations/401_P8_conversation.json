    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. I can still see those images, you know? The violence, the fear in their eyes. It's all so vivid.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Anger. Definitely anger. But also... guilt? I feel this overwhelming sense of guilt. Like, why didn't I do more? I was just a bystander, watching these people suffer. I should have done something, anything.",
    "Therapist: I see. Can you tell me more about that guilt?",
    "Client: It's... it's crushing. I keep replaying the scene in my head, thinking of all the things I could have done differently. Maybe if I had spoken up or tried to intervene, I could have helped someone. But I was so paralyzed with fear. I just... froze.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you noticing as you describe this?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking. I can feel my heart racing, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's like I can't get enough air. And my stomach... it's in knots. I feel nauseous, like I might be sick.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. How does your body feel now?",
    "Client: A little better, I guess. The nausea is still there, but the tightness in my chest has eased a bit. I'm trying to ground myself, focus on the present, but it's hard. The memories keep pulling me back.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about the victims. Where are they now? Are they safe? Did they ever escape that horrible situation? And then I think about myself, and I feel so... selfish. Here I am, safe and free, while they might still be suffering. It's not fair.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts relate to your overall experience with this trauma?",
    "Client: I guess... I've always struggled with feeling powerless. This experience just amplified that. I saw firsthand how cruel people can be, how easily they can exploit others. It shattered my sense of safety, my belief in the goodness of humanity. And now, I feel like I'm constantly on edge, waiting for the next terrible thing to happen.",
    "Therapist: I hear you. How has this affected your daily life?",
    "Client: It's... it's everywhere. I have trouble sleeping because I'm afraid of the nightmares. I avoid crowded places because I'm always scanning for danger. I've become so isolated. My studies are suffering because I can't focus. It's like this experience has tainted everything.",
    "Therapist: What strategies have you found helpful in coping so far?",
    "Client: Honestly, not much. Sometimes I try to distract myself with movies or books, but it only works for a little while. Deep breathing helps sometimes with the anxiety. And... talking about it here, as hard as it is, feels like it might be doing something. At least I'm not bottling it all up anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a good observation. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's terrifying, to be honest. Reliving these memories is so painful. But at the same time, I'm desperate for some relief. I want to feel normal again, to not be controlled by this trauma. So yeah, I think I want to keep going. It's hard, but... maybe it's worth it?",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. What do you hope to gain from this process?",
    "Client: I want to find peace, I guess. To be able to think about what happened without feeling overwhelmed by guilt and anger. I want to sleep through the night without nightmares. I want to feel safe in the world again. And maybe... maybe I want to find a way to make a difference. To help others who've been through similar experiences. I don't know how yet, but I feel like I need to do something positive with this awful experience.",
    "Therapist: Those are meaningful goals. How are you feeling now, as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted, emotionally drained. But there's also this tiny spark of... hope? Like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this. It's small, but it's there. And that feels important.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. We'll continue next session."
