    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. My heart is still racing a bit. It's like I'm back there, you know? I can still hear the growling, the sound of its claws on the pavement. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: Fear, mostly. And a sense of helplessness. I keep thinking about how quickly it all happened. One moment I was just walking home from work, and the next... chaos. The dog came out of nowhere, and I froze. I couldn't move, couldn't think. I just... stood there.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you noticing?",
    "Client: My palms are sweaty, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's hard to breathe normally. And my legs... they feel weak, like they might give out. It's as if my body is preparing to run, even though I know I'm safe here.",
    "Therapist: How do these sensations compare to when the attack happened?",
    "Client: They're... they're similar, but not as intense. Back then, it was like my whole body shut down. Now, it's more like an echo of that feeling. It's uncomfortable, but I can handle it better.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why didn't I do something?\" I feel... ashamed that I couldn't protect myself. And then I worry, what if it happens again? What if next time it's worse? It's... it's hard not to spiral into these \"what ifs.\"",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts affect you?",
    "Client: They make me feel vulnerable, scared to go out alone. I've been avoiding parks, taking longer routes to work. It's... it's impacting my life more than I'd like to admit. I feel angry at myself for letting it affect me this much.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about that anger?",
    "Client: I... I guess it's not just directed at myself. I'm angry at the owner who let their dog off-leash. I'm angry at the bystanders who just watched. And I'm... I'm angry at the world for being so unpredictable and dangerous.",
    "Therapist: How does expressing that anger feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a bit of a relief. I've been holding onto it, trying to be \"strong,\" you know? But saying it out loud, it feels like... like I'm allowing myself to acknowledge how unfair it all was.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I... I feel a bit lighter, actually. Talking about it, facing those memories... it's hard, but it's like I'm taking some of their power away. They're still scary, but maybe... maybe a little less overwhelming?",
    "Therapist: How does that shift feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's encouraging. Like maybe I'm making progress? I still feel anxious, but there's a glimmer of hope too. Like maybe I won't always feel this way. It's... it's a strange mix of emotions.",
    "Therapist: What do you make of that mix?",
    "Client: I think... I think it shows I'm healing, slowly but surely. The fear is still there, but so is the strength to face it. It's... it's exhausting, but also empowering in a way. Like I'm reclaiming parts of myself.",
    "Therapist: How might you use this experience going forward?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to be kinder to myself, for starters. And maybe... maybe I can use these techniques when I feel anxious in daily life. It's hard, but facing the fear seems to help. I want to... to keep working on this.",
    "Therapist: What support do you need?",
    "Client: I... I think I need reassurance that it's okay to take my time with this. And maybe... maybe some strategies for when the anxiety gets overwhelming in public. It's... it's a journey, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: Indeed. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired, but in a good way. Like I've done something important. The fear is still there, but it feels... manageable. I'm grateful for this space to work through it all. Thank you.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. This session has given me a lot to reflect on. I'm... I'm looking forward to continuing this work, as challenging as it can be. It feels... it feels like I'm moving in the right direction.",
    "Therapist: That's great. Take care, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. See you then."
