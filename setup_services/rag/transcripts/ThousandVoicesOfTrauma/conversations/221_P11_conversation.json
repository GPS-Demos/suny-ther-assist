    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. That memory of the police brutality during my deployment... it's just so vivid. I can still hear the screams, you know? The chaos, the fear... it's all there.",
    "Therapist: What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The helplessness. I was trained to protect people, but in that moment, I couldn't do anything. I saw civilians being beaten, and I... I froze. I've never felt so powerless in my life. It's like everything I believed in just crumbled.",
    "Therapist: How does that connect to your daily life now?",
    "Client: I guess... I'm always on edge. I don't trust authority figures anymore. Even simple things like seeing a police car can send me into a panic. It's affecting my work, my relationships... everything.",
    "Therapist: What emotions came up during the exposure?",
    "Client: Anger, definitely. But also shame. I'm angry at the officers who abused their power, but I'm ashamed that I didn't do more to stop it. And fear... God, the fear is overwhelming sometimes. It's like I'm right back there, heart pounding, unable to breathe.",
    "Therapist: How does sharing this make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. But also, I don't know, maybe a little relieving? Like, I've been carrying this around for so long, and now it's out there. It doesn't make it better, but it feels less... heavy, I guess.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. What else?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about the faces of the people who were hurt. They haunt me. I wonder what happened to them, if they're okay. Sometimes I dream about them, and I wake up in a cold sweat. It's like my brain won't let me forget.",
    "Therapist: How does this memory impact your anxiety?",
    "Client: It's like fuel for my anxiety. I'm always waiting for something bad to happen. I struggle to feel safe anywhere. Even in my own home, I'm constantly checking locks, looking out windows. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: What strategies have helped you cope?",
    "Client: The breathing exercises we've practiced help sometimes. And... talking about it, like now. It's painful, but it also feels like I'm regaining some control. Writing in my journal has been surprisingly helpful too.",
    "Therapist: How do you see these experiences shaping your future?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Part of me feels like I'll never be the same. But another part... maybe this can make me stronger? More empathetic? I want to find a way to use this experience to help others, but I'm not sure how yet.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful perspective. What's your next step?",
    "Client: I think... I want to keep doing these exposures. They're tough, but I feel like I'm finally facing this head-on. And maybe... maybe I could look into advocacy groups for veterans or victims of police brutality. I'm not ready yet, but someday I might be able to share my story and make a difference.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about your progress so far?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix. Some days I feel like I'm making real progress, like today. Other days it feels like I'm right back where I started. But overall, I think I'm moving forward. Slowly, but forward.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... maybe we could work more on my anxiety in public spaces? It's still really hard for me to be in crowded areas or around authority figures. If we could address that, it might help me feel more normal in day-to-day life.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm finally starting to process what happened instead of just reliving it. It's a small step, but it feels important.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yeah, I'll be here. Thanks again."
