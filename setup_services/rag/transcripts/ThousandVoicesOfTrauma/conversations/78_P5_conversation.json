    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Thompson. I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more trouble sleeping lately, and I can't shake this feeling of unease at work.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you familiar with it?",
    "Client: Not really. I mean, I've heard you mention it before, but I'm not sure what it involves. Is it... is it going to be difficult?",
    "Therapist: It can be challenging, but it's a crucial step in your recovery. Shall I explain more?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I'd like to know what I'm getting into.",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit your workplace trauma memory in detail. This helps process the experience.",
    "Client: Oh... that sounds intense. I'm not sure if I'm ready to relive that. What if I panic or can't handle it?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace and I'll support you throughout.",
    "Client: Okay... I appreciate that. But why do we need to do this? Isn't it better to just try and forget about it?",
    "Therapist: Avoidance can actually maintain PTSD symptoms. This helps you process the memory safely.",
    "Client: I see. It's just... every time I think about it, I feel so overwhelmed. My heart starts racing, and I feel like I'm right back there again.",
    "Therapist: Those reactions are normal. We'll work through them together. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It's scary, but I trust you. If you think this will help, I'm willing to try. What exactly will we be doing?",
    "Therapist: You'll describe the event in present tense, as if it's happening now. I'll guide you through.",
    "Client: Present tense? That sounds... really intense. How long will we be doing this for?",
    "Therapist: About 30-45 minutes. We can take breaks if needed. Your comfort is important.",
    "Client: Okay, I think I can manage that. Will this help with my anxiety at work too?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it should help reduce overall anxiety and PTSD symptoms.",
    "Client: That would be amazing. I've been so on edge lately, especially around my coworkers. It's affecting my performance, and I'm worried about losing my job.",
    "Therapist: I understand. This process aims to help with those concerns. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm nervous, but I want to get better. Can you... can you hold my hand if it gets too much?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we start?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do this. I'm as ready as I'll ever be."
