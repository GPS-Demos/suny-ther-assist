    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the scene?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in our old house. I'm about 8 years old. My parents are arguing in the kitchen. It's late at night, and I should be asleep, but their voices woke me up. I'm at the top of the stairs, peeking through the banister. My heart is racing...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: My father is yelling. His face is red, and he's gesturing wildly. My mother is crying, trying to speak, but he keeps interrupting her. I've never seen him this angry before. Suddenly, he grabs a plate from the counter and throws it against the wall. The sound of it shattering makes me flinch.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. My whole body is shaking. I want to run and hide, but I'm frozen in place. I can't stop watching. My mother is sobbing now, backing away from my father. He's advancing towards her, still shouting. I... I can't make out the words, but his tone is so menacing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: I understand. You're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: Okay... My mother bumps into the kitchen table, and she can't back up any further. My father is right in front of her now. He raises his hand, and I think he's going to hit her. I want to scream, to do something, but I'm paralyzed with fear. I close my eyes tightly, waiting for the sound of the slap...",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear a loud thud instead. When I open my eyes, I see my father has slammed his fist on the table next to my mother. She's cowering, her arms over her head. He's breathing heavily, glaring at her. Then he turns and storms out of the kitchen. I hear the front door slam a moment later.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... overwhelmed. My chest is tight, and I'm struggling to breathe. It's like I'm that little boy again, helpless and scared.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're doing well.",
    "Client: After my father leaves, the house is so quiet. I can only hear my mother's muffled sobs. I want to go to her, to comfort her, but I'm afraid to move. What if my father comes back? What if he sees me? So I just sit there, clutching the banister, tears silently rolling down my face.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this remarkably. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I eventually creep back to my room. I climb into bed and pull the covers over my head. I can still hear my mother crying downstairs. I feel so helpless, so scared. I don't know what's going to happen, if my father will come back, if my mother will be okay. I lie there, wide awake, until I see the sun starting to rise through my window.",
    "Therapist: You've done an excellent job. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. Sad. Angry. It's like I've relived it all over again. But... there's also a sense of relief. Like I've finally let out something I've been holding onto for a very long time.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've shown great strength today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It wasn't easy, but I think... I think it helped. I've never really talked about that night before. It's always been this dark, heavy secret I've carried around.",
    "Therapist: You've taken an important step. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's scary, but I think I need to. There's more... more memories like this one. I want to work through them. I don't want them to have power over me anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a courageous decision. We'll take it one step at a time.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I know it won't be easy, but I feel... I don't know, maybe hopeful? Like maybe I can finally start to heal from all of this.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive outlook. We'll end here for today."
