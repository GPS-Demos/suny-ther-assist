    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of revisiting those memories... it's unsettling. I've spent so long trying to push them away, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about losing control. What if I can't handle reliving the experience? And... I'm scared of how it might affect me afterward. Will I be able to function at work? My wife and I have been doing better lately, and I don't want to jeopardize that progress.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. Let's address them one by one.",
    "Client: Okay, I appreciate that. It's just... ever since the earthquake, I've been having these flashbacks. They remind me of... of the abuse. I never thought the two would be connected, but somehow they are. It's like the ground shaking beneath me brought back all those feelings of helplessness and fear from when I was a kid.",
    "Therapist: I see. The exposure might help untangle those connections.",
    "Client: Really? How does that work exactly? I mean, I understand the concept of facing fears, but this seems different.",
    "Therapist: It allows us to process the memories safely, reducing their power over time.",
    "Client: That makes sense, I guess. But what if I panic during the exercise? I've had moments where I've completely frozen up just thinking about what happened.",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. You're in control, and we can pause anytime.",
    "Client: Okay, that's reassuring. I'm still nervous, but I think I'm willing to give it a try. What should I expect during the exercise? Will you be guiding me through it?",
    "Therapist: Yes, I'll guide you. We'll focus on one memory at a time, in detail.",
    "Client: Alright. And afterward? How might I feel? I'm worried about being too shaken up to go about my day.",
    "Therapist: It may be intense, but many find relief. We'll debrief and ensure you're grounded.",
    "Client: I see. It's a bit scary, but I understand why it's important. I've been struggling with these memories for so long, and if this can help... I want to try. I want to be able to move forward, you know? To be present for my wife, to focus on my work without these intrusive thoughts.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. This is a significant step towards healing.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm trying to remind myself that this discomfort is temporary if it leads to long-term improvement. Is there anything I should do to prepare for our next session when we actually start the exposure?",
    "Therapist: Just come as you are. Your willingness to engage is the best preparation.",
    "Client: Okay, I can do that. I'm nervous but also... hopeful? Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Hope is a powerful ally in this process.",
    "Client: That's good to hear. I'm ready to take this step, even if it's difficult. Thank you for your guidance and support. I feel a bit more prepared now.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your readiness is a strength. See you next session."
