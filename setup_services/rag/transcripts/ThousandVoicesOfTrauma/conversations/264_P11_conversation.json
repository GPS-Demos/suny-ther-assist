    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. The memory of that animal attack feels so vivid now. I can still hear the growling, you know? It's like I'm right back there, watching it happen all over again.",
    "Therapist: What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. Seeing that poor person being mauled and not being able to do anything about it. I froze. I wanted to help, but my body just wouldn't move. I feel so guilty about that.",
    "Therapist: It's common to feel that way. How does reflecting on it now feel different?",
    "Client: Well, um, I guess I'm able to talk about it without completely falling apart. That's something, right? But I still feel this tightness in my chest when I think about it. Like I can't quite catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I'm noticing that... well, this might sound strange, but I'm angry. Not just at the animal, but at myself. For not doing more, for not being braver. I keep thinking, \"Why didn't I do something?\" And then I feel ashamed all over again.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your day-to-day experiences?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's why I've been avoiding parks and open spaces. I'm always on edge, expecting something terrible to happen. And when I see dogs, even small ones, I just panic. It's affecting my whole life. I can't even take walks anymore without feeling terrified.",
    "Therapist: That makes sense. What have you learned from this experience?",
    "Client: I've realized that I'm stronger than I thought. I mean, I'm here, talking about it. That's something I couldn't do before. And maybe... maybe I need to be a little kinder to myself? It wasn't my fault, was it? I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. How can you apply this moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I need to work on not blaming myself so much. And maybe I can start small, like looking at pictures of animals or watching nature documentaries. Baby steps, right? I want to get back to enjoying life without this constant fear.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How do you feel about continuing with these exposures?",
    "Client: Honestly? They're tough. Really tough. But I can see how they're helping. It's like... by facing it head-on, I'm taking back some control. I'm scared, but I'm also... determined? Yeah, determined to get better.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is commendable. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I guess. For guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm finally moving in the right direction. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel hopeful. Like maybe I can actually overcome this and get my life back.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work. Shall we schedule our next session?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I'm nervous, but I'm ready to keep going. This process is hard, but I can feel it making a difference. I'm starting to believe that maybe, just maybe, I can get past this and feel normal again. It's a small glimmer of hope, but it's there."
