    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the natural disaster you experienced?",
    "Client: Okay... It was a devastating earthquake in my hometown in Mexico. I remember waking up to violent shaking. The walls were cracking, and I could hear screams from outside. I froze in terror, unable to move.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: As I finally managed to get out of bed, I stumbled towards the door. The floor was moving so much, I could barely keep my balance. I heard a loud crash and realized part of my ceiling had collapsed. I was trapped in my room, surrounded by debris and dust.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. How were you feeling?",
    "Client: I was terrified. My heart was racing, and I couldn't breathe properly. I thought I was going to die right there. The noise was deafening - a mixture of rumbling earth, falling objects, and people screaming. I felt so alone and helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. It's okay to feel those emotions.",
    "Client: I managed to squeeze through a small opening in the debris and made it to the hallway. The stairs were partially collapsed, but I had to try. As I carefully made my way down, I saw my neighbors - some injured, others crying. The building kept shaking with aftershocks. I was sure we'd all be buried alive.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: When I finally got outside, it was chaos. Buildings were damaged, cars overturned, and people were running everywhere. I saw a young woman pinned under a fallen streetlight. I wanted to help her, but I was paralyzed with fear. I just stood there, watching helplessly as others rushed to her aid.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel overwhelmed in such situations. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I feel so guilty about not helping her. I've always prided myself on being strong, on helping others. But at that moment, I was useless. I couldn't even move. I just stood there, trembling, as the world fell apart around me.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you were in shock. It's a normal reaction.",
    "Client: I know, but it's hard to accept. After what felt like hours, emergency services arrived. They were helping the injured, but I still couldn't move. A paramedic approached me, asked if I was hurt. I couldn't even speak. I just shook my head and burst into tears.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How do you feel recounting this?",
    "Client: It's... it's difficult. My heart is racing again, just like it did that day. I can almost feel the ground shaking beneath my feet. But at the same time, I feel... I don't know, maybe a little relieved to be talking about it?",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. You're handling this bravely.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's strange, but as I talk about it, I'm remembering more details. The smell of dust and smoke, the sound of car alarms going off all around us. It was like being in a war zone. I remember thinking about my family, wondering if they were safe. I couldn't reach them on my phone - the lines were down.",
    "Therapist: It's normal for memories to resurface. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I spent the next few days in a daze. The city was in ruins, and aftershocks kept coming. I was terrified to go back into any building. I slept in a makeshift camp in a park with hundreds of others. The uncertainty was overwhelming. Would there be another big quake? Would my home still be there? It felt like the ground could open up and swallow us at any moment.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. It's still hard to talk about, but I feel a bit lighter. Like I'm not carrying this burden alone anymore. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. That's a positive sign. You've done well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It's still painful, but maybe... maybe it's getting a little easier?",
    "Therapist: That's often the case. We'll end here for today. You've made great progress."
