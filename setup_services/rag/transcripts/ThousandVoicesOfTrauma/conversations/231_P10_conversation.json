    "Therapist: Welcome, James. How are you feeling about our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is terrified of revisiting those memories. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here together. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Let's... let's do this before I lose my nerve.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see the compound. It's early morning, the sun's just coming up. The air is crisp, and there's dew on the grass. I can smell breakfast cooking from the communal kitchen. Eggs and... and something burning.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm walking towards the main hall. My heart's racing because I know what's coming. The \"cleansing ritual\" they call it. God, I can feel my palms getting sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Uh... probably a 6. Maybe 7.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Right... okay. I'm entering the hall now. It's dim, lit only by candles. The smell of incense is overwhelming, makes me want to gag. I see the others lined up, waiting their turn. Some are crying quietly.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Terror. Absolute terror. My legs feel weak, and I want to run, but I know I can't. If I run, they'll... they'll catch me, and it'll be worse.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, James. Remember, you're here now, safe in my office.",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah. Okay. I'm in line now. I can hear the crack of the whip and someone crying out in pain. My turn is getting closer, and I'm shaking. I want to throw up.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe 9. God, this is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. If it gets too intense, we can pause. Do you want to continue?",
    "Client: I... yes. I need to get through this. It's my turn now. They're calling me forward. My legs feel like lead as I walk up to the altar. The leader, he's standing there with the whip, that sick smile on his face.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he tells me to kneel and take off my shirt. My fingers are trembling so much I can barely undo the buttons. I can feel everyone's eyes on me. The shame is... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, James. Remember, you're here now, safe in my office.",
    "Client: Right... right. I'm kneeling now, my back exposed. I can hear the whip whistling through the air and then... God, the pain! It's like fire across my back. I bite my lip to keep from screaming, but I can't help the tears.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 10. I can't... I can't do this.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, James. You're safe here. Let's ground ourselves. Can you tell me five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: I... okay. I see... your desk. The painting on the wall. The clock. The plant in the corner. And... and the box of tissues.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, four things you can feel.",
    "Client: The... the chair I'm sitting on. My hands gripping the armrests. My feet on the floor. The air conditioning on my skin.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Are you ready to continue, or do you need a break?",
    "Client: No, I... I think I can continue. I need to get through this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Take us back to that moment.",
    "Client: Okay... The whip comes down again. And again. I've lost count of how many times. My back is on fire, and I can feel blood trickling down. The leader is saying something about purification, but I can barely hear him over the ringing in my ears.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Pain. So much pain. But also... anger. I'm furious that they're doing this to me, to all of us. And I feel so... so helpless. I can't stop it. I can't fight back.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, James. What happens next?",
    "Client: It's... it's finally over. I'm told to stand, but my legs are shaking so badly I can barely manage it. Someone helps me up and leads me to the side. I can feel the blood sticking my shirt to my back as they put it on me.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about a 7, I think. The worst is over.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I stumble out of the hall. The sunlight is blinding after the dimness inside. I make my way back to my bunk, every step agony. I just want to collapse, to sleep, to forget.",
    "Therapist: And how are you feeling at this point?",
    "Client: Numb. Just... numb. And exhausted. Like I've been hollowed out. But there's also this tiny spark of... of rebellion. A voice in my head saying, \"This isn't right. You need to get out.\"",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it feel to acknowledge that?",
    "Client: It's... it's scary. But also liberating. Like maybe, just maybe, there's hope.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well, James. We're nearing the end of our session. Can you bring yourself back to the present moment?",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, I can. I'm... I'm here. In your office. Safe.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about a 4, I think. I feel drained, but... but okay.",
    "Therapist: That's normal after such an intense session. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm surprised, actually. It was horrible to relive that, but... but I did it. And I feel... I don't know, maybe a little stronger for having faced it?",
    "Therapist: That's a significant realization, James. You've shown immense courage today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I couldn't have done it without your guidance.",
    "Therapist: You did the hard work. Now, let's take a few moments to ground ourselves before we end the session. Can you tell me three things you're looking forward to this week?",
    "Client: Sure. I'm... I'm looking forward to dinner with my wife tonight. And I have a golf game with friends on Saturday. Oh, and my grandson's birthday party on Sunday.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like wonderful things to focus on. Remember to be kind to yourself this evening. You've done challenging work today.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you... really. This wasn't easy, but I think... I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that, James. We'll continue this work in our next session. Take care, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. See you next week."
