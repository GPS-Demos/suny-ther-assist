    "Therapist: Alright, Mrs. Patel, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the day you arrived at the refugee camp.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm there. It's hot, so hot. The sun is beating down on us as we stand in line. There are so many people, all looking tired and scared. I can smell sweat and dust. My legs ache from standing for hours.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, about a 4, I'd say.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue.",
    "Client: We're moving slowly. I can hear children crying, people arguing. Someone pushes past me, nearly knocking me over. I feel so small, so helpless. My heart is racing. I'm clutching my bag tightly, afraid someone might steal it. It's all I have left.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. My palms are getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) I finally reach the front of the line. The officer looks at me with such... such disdain. He barks questions at me in a language I barely understand. I fumble with my papers, my hands shaking. I can feel everyone's eyes on me. I'm so ashamed, so humiliated. I want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: (Sniffles) It's an 8 now. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: (Nods) The officer is yelling at me now. I don't understand what he wants. Tears are streaming down my face. I feel so alone, so far from home. I miss my husband. Why did this have to happen to us? It's not fair!",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS?",
    "Client: (Voice breaking) It's... it's a 9. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great.",
    "Client: (Inhales shakily) The officer finally stamps my papers and waves me through. I stumble into the camp, overwhelmed by the sea of tents and people. I don't know where to go, what to do. I feel so lost, so scared. I collapse onto the ground, sobbing. I've never felt so alone in my life.",
    "Therapist: And now? Your SUDS?",
    "Client: (Wiping tears) It's still a 9. My heart is pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. Take another deep breath.",
    "Client: (Breathes deeply) I... I think I'm starting to calm down a little. The memory is fading.",
