    "Therapist: Alright, Carlos, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the scene.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back at my son's house. It's a sunny afternoon, but the atmosphere is tense. My son and his wife are arguing loudly in the kitchen. I can hear dishes clattering, voices rising. I'm in the living room, frozen, unsure what to do.",
    "Therapist: Good. SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Um, about a 5 right now.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue.",
    "Client: The argument is getting worse. I hear my daughter-in-law scream, \"I can't take this anymore!\" There's a loud crash. My heart starts racing. I... I stand up, my legs shaking.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's going up. Maybe a 7.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I walk towards the kitchen, my mouth dry. As I reach the doorway, I see my son grab his wife's arm. She's crying, mascara running down her face. There's a broken plate on the floor. I feel... I feel helpless, angry, scared all at once.",
    "Therapist: What's happening in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. My hands are clammy. I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: I... I try to speak, but no words come out. My son sees me and yells, \"Stay out of this, Dad!\" His face is red, contorted with anger. I've never seen him like this before. I feel my world crumbling. These are my children, and I can't protect them.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: I know it's difficult. You're very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: My daughter-in-law breaks free and runs past me, sobbing. I hear the front door slam. My son punches the wall, leaving a dent. He turns to me, his eyes full of pain and rage. \"Are you happy now?\" he shouts. \"This is what your perfect family looks like!\" I feel... I feel like I've failed as a father, as a man.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's still a 9. My heart is pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Let's stay here a bit longer.",
    "Client: I... I sink to the floor, my back against the wall. My son storms out, leaving me alone in the messy kitchen. The silence is deafening. I can smell the lingering scent of their dinner, mixed with the acrid tang of their anger. I feel hollow, useless. This isn't how I raised him. Where did I go wrong?",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm starting to calm down a bit. Maybe an 8 now.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Let's continue for a few more minutes.",
    "Client: I sit there for what feels like hours. The sun starts to set, casting long shadows across the room. I feel old, tired. I think about my own marriage, how we worked through our problems. I wish I could help them, but I feel so powerless. Eventually, I gather the strength to stand up. My joints ache as I start cleaning up the broken plate. It feels like I'm trying to piece together their broken relationship.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6, I think. I feel drained, but the panic has subsided.",
    "Therapist: You've done exceptionally well. Let's start to bring you back to the present.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay. I'm... I'm back here with you.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... oddly relieved. It wasn't easy, but I made it through.",
    "Therapist: You did incredibly well, Carlos. We'll process this more next time."
