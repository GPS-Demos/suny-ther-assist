    "Therapist: Welcome back. Are you ready to continue our imaginal exposure today?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay. Well, I'm back at that party. I can see the dimly lit room, hear the music playing in the background. The air feels heavy, and there's a faint smell of alcohol and cigarettes. I'm standing near the corner, trying to blend in with the wall.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: I see him approaching. My heart starts racing, and I feel my palms getting sweaty. He's smiling, but it doesn't reach his eyes. I want to run, but my feet won't move.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: He's getting closer, and I can smell his cologne. It's overpowering, making me feel nauseous. He puts his hand on my arm, and I flinch. I want to scream, but no sound comes out. I feel so helpless, so small.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: He's leaning in, whispering something in my ear. I can't make out the words, but his breath is hot on my skin. I'm frozen, my mind is racing, but my body won't respond. I feel like I'm watching this happen to someone else.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can continue. This feels too real. My chest is tight, and I'm starting to feel dizzy.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here with me.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm trying to focus on my breathing. He's still there, his hand now on my waist. I feel trapped, cornered. The music seems to fade away, and all I can hear is my own heartbeat pounding in my ears.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Keep going if you can.",
    "Client: I manage to whisper \"no,\" but he doesn't seem to hear or care. His grip tightens, and I feel myself being pulled away from the wall. The room starts to spin, and I'm desperately looking for someone, anyone to help me. But everyone seems oblivious to what's happening.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Remember, you're in control now.",
    "Client: I close my eyes, wishing I could disappear. When I open them again, we're in a different room. It's darker here, more isolated. The fear is overwhelming now. I feel like I can't breathe. My body is shaking, but I still can't move.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I don't think I can go on. It's too much. I feel like I'm right back there, and I can't escape.",
    "Therapist: That's alright. Let's take a break. You've done exceptionally well.",
    "Client: Thank you. I didn't realize how vivid these memories still were. It's like I was reliving it all over again.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You showed great courage today.",
    "Client: It's strange. Even though it was difficult, I feel a bit lighter somehow. Like I've faced something I've been running from for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive sign. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? It's hard to explain.",
    "Therapist: That's common. Would you like to discuss coping strategies?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be helpful. I want to be better prepared for next time.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's start with grounding techniques..."
