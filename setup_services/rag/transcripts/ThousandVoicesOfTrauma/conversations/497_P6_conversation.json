    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your current SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10. My heart's beating a little faster than usual.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and describe the night of the home invasion.",
    "Client: It was around 11 PM. I was alone in my flat, working late on my laptop. Suddenly, I heard a loud crash from the living room. My body froze. I couldn't move for a few seconds. Then I heard footsteps, heavy and fast. I panicked and tried to reach for my phone, but it wasn't on the bedside table where I usually keep it.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. My palms are sweating, and I can feel my heart pounding in my chest.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Continue with what happened next.",
    "Client: I heard them rummaging through the living room. The sound of things being knocked over and drawers being pulled out was terrifying. I was trapped in my bedroom, afraid to make a sound. Then, the bedroom door burst open. Two men, both wearing masks, stormed in. One of them grabbed me by the arm and threw me to the floor.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's an 8. I feel like I can't breathe properly. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What happened after they threw you down?",
    "Client: The larger man held me down while the other one demanded to know where I kept my valuables. I was shaking so much I could barely speak. I pointed towards the wardrobe where I kept some cash and jewelry. They ransacked it, taking everything of value. The man holding me down kept threatening to hurt me if I made any noise.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's still an 8. My throat feels dry, and I'm trembling a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You're doing well. What happened next?",
    "Client: They continued to search the room, becoming increasingly agitated when they couldn't find more valuable items. The smaller man started kicking me, demanding to know if I was hiding anything else. Each kick felt like a shock through my body. I curled up, trying to protect myself, but it didn't help much.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 9. I feel nauseous, and my muscles are so tense.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Remember, this is a memory. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm trying. After what felt like an eternity, they finally left. I heard them ransacking the rest of the flat before the front door slammed shut. I lay there on the floor, too terrified to move, for what must have been hours. Every small noise made me flinch. I was afraid they might come back.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 7. I still feel shaky, but the nausea is subsiding a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're doing great. What happened when you finally moved?",
    "Client: When I finally found the courage to get up, I was sore all over. I stumbled to the living room and saw the destruction. Everything was turned upside down. I felt so violated, so vulnerable. I couldn't stop crying as I called the police.",
    "Therapist: And your current SUDS?",
    "Client: It's a 6 now. I feel drained, but the intense fear is fading.",
    "Therapist: You've done well. Let's start winding down. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel exhausted, but also a bit relieved. It's like a weight has been lifted, even though it was hard to go through it again.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. Your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 4 now. I'm feeling more grounded.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's end the exercise here. You've shown great courage today."
