    "Therapist: Welcome back, Tom. Are you ready to continue our imaginal exposure exercise focusing on your workplace trauma?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Let's start with your SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10 right now. Just thinking about it makes me a bit tense.",
    "Therapist: Okay. When you're ready, close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm at my desk, it's just another ordinary day. Suddenly, the ground starts shaking. At first, I think it's just a tremor, but it keeps getting stronger. Papers are falling off desks, people are shouting. I can hear the building creaking...",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. My heart's beating faster just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Keep going, you're doing well.",
    "Client: The shaking is so violent now. I'm trying to get under my desk, but I'm fumbling. I can hear glass shattering somewhere. Someone screams. I'm under the desk now, but I feel so helpless. The lights go out, and there's this awful groaning sound from the building...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating at this point?",
    "Client: It's an 8 now. I can feel my palms getting sweaty, and my chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's hard, but... okay. The shaking seems to go on forever. I can hear things crashing all around me. I'm terrified the ceiling's going to come down. I'm thinking about my family, wondering if I'll see them again. The air is full of dust, and I'm coughing...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's still at an 8. My stomach's in knots, and I feel kind of dizzy.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing great. Take a deep breath if you need to.",
    "Client: Okay... The shaking finally stops, but I'm too scared to move. I can hear people crying and calling out. Someone's shouting for everyone to stay calm. I slowly crawl out from under the desk. The office is a mess, and there's a crack in the wall. I'm shaking so much I can barely stand...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's gone down a bit, maybe a 7. I still feel really anxious, but not as intense.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: We all gather in the stairwell. Someone's hurt their arm. We start making our way down, and I'm worried the aftershocks will start. The stairwell seems so unstable. When we finally get outside, the street's chaos. Car alarms are going off, there's debris everywhere. I just stand there, feeling shocked and overwhelmed...",
