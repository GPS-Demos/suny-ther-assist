    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like I'm numb, but also overwhelmed at the same time. My heart's racing, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. The memory of losing Jake in that ambush... it's so vivid. I can still hear the gunfire, smell the smoke. It's like I'm right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's the strongest emotion coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: Guilt. Overwhelming guilt. I keep thinking, \"Why him and not me?\" We were side by side, and in a split second... he was gone. I should've been more alert, should've seen the signs. Maybe if I had, Jake would still be here.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt manifest in your body?",
    "Client: It's like a heavy weight on my shoulders. My stomach's in knots, and I feel this... this hollowness in my chest. It's hard to breathe sometimes when I think about it. And my hands... they're shaking. I can't seem to stop them.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are accompanying these physical sensations?",
    "Client: I keep hearing Jake's voice in my head, you know? His laugh, the jokes he used to tell. And then... silence. Just this deafening silence. I think about his family, his little girl. She'll never know her dad because I couldn't protect him. It's... it's crushing.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts impact your daily life?",
    "Client: They're always there, lurking in the background. I have trouble sleeping, and when I do, I have nightmares. I've been isolating myself, pushing away friends and family. It's easier than trying to explain... this. And work? I can barely focus. Everything seems trivial compared to what happened.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about how you're coping with these feelings?",
    "Client: I... I guess I'm not coping very well. I've been drinking more than I should, trying to numb it all out. But it doesn't work. The memories, the guilt... they always come back. I feel like I'm stuck, you know? Like I can't move forward, can't let go. It's like I'm betraying Jake if I try to be happy or live my life.",
    "Therapist: How does that belief about betraying Jake affect you?",
    "Client: It's paralyzing. I feel guilty for every moment of joy or peace I experience. It's like I don't deserve to be happy when Jake can't be. I've stopped doing things I used to enjoy. I can't even look at photos from before the deployment without feeling this overwhelming sense of loss and anger.",
    "Therapist: What do you think Jake would want for you?",
    "Client: I... (long pause) I've never really thought about it that way. Jake was always looking out for everyone else. He'd probably... he'd probably want me to be okay. To take care of myself and his family. But it's so hard. How do I honor his memory without letting it consume me?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How might you start to honor Jake in a way that also allows you to heal?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe I could reach out to his family? See if they need anything? And... and maybe I could start talking to some of the other guys from our unit. We've all been avoiding each other, but maybe... maybe we need each other to get through this.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful approach. How does considering these steps make you feel?",
    "Client: It's scary, to be honest. The idea of facing his family, facing my own emotions... it's terrifying. But there's also this tiny spark of... hope? Like maybe there's a way to keep Jake's memory alive without drowning in guilt. It's overwhelming, but... maybe it's a start?",
    "Therapist: What support do you need to take these steps?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need help managing my anxiety around this. And maybe... maybe some guidance on how to approach Jake's family without falling apart. I don't want to burden them with my guilt, you know? And I might need some help with the drinking. It's become a crutch, and I know it's not healthy.",
    "Therapist: Those are important areas to address. How do you feel about exploring them further in our sessions?",
    "Client: I'm nervous, but... I think I'm ready. Or at least, I want to be ready. I can't keep living like this, trapped in that moment. Jake wouldn't want that for me. It's going to be hard, but... I want to try. For Jake, for his family, and... and for myself.",
    "Therapist: That's a courageous decision. We'll take it step by step. What's one small thing you can do this week to start this process?",
    "Client: I think... I think I could write a letter to Jake. Not to send, obviously, but... to get some of these feelings out. Maybe it'll help me figure out what I want to say to his family when I'm ready to reach out. Is that... is that okay?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like an excellent idea. How does it feel to have this plan?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of emotions. I'm scared, but there's also this sense of... I don't know, maybe purpose? Like I'm finally doing something instead of just drowning in these feelings. It's overwhelming, but... maybe in a good way this time?",
    "Therapist: That's a significant shift. We'll work through this together. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I... I just want to say thank you. For listening, for pushing me to face this. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe... maybe there's a way forward. It's terrifying, but... I'm grateful.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength today. We'll continue this work in our next session. Take care of yourself this week."
