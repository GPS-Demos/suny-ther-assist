    "Therapist: Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of revisiting those violent scenes from my childhood... it's unsettling. As a professional, I'm used to being in control, but this feels like I'm stepping into unknown territory.",
    "Therapist: Your nervousness is understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I worry about how it might affect me. Will it make my chronic pain worse? And... I'm concerned about how it might impact my work performance or my relationship with my wife. We've been through so much already with my PTSD symptoms.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How do you think this exercise might help?",
    "Client: I suppose... it could help me process those memories better? Maybe reduce the nightmares and flashbacks I've been experiencing? But it's hard to imagine reliving those moments voluntarily.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. It's about processing and reducing symptoms. How can I support you during this?",
    "Client: I think I'd feel more comfortable if we could take breaks if it gets too intense. And maybe... could you remind me that I'm safe here? Sometimes when I recall those memories, I feel like that scared child again.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll take breaks and I'll ensure you feel safe. Any other questions?",
    "Client: Yes, actually. How detailed do I need to be? There are some parts of the violence I witnessed that are... particularly graphic. I'm not sure I can talk about those specifics.",
    "Therapist: Share what you're comfortable with. We can work up to more details gradually. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. It's strange, you know. Growing up in a South Asian family, we didn't talk about these things. Trauma was just something you were expected to get over. But I'm here now, and I want to get better. For myself, for my wife. So yes, I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. Let's start. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay. I'll do my best. It's just... even thinking about starting makes my heart race a bit. But I trust you, and I trust this process. I know it won't be easy, but if it can help me move past this and reduce my PTSD symptoms, it'll be worth it. I'm tired of these memories controlling my life.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. Shall we begin the exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do it. I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Thank you for your patience and support through this. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't judge. Alright, I'm taking a deep breath... where should I start?"
