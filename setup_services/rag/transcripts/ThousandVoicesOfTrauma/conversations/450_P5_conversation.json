    "Therapist: Hello, Maria. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hola, Dr. Martinez. I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. You mentioned something about exposure therapy last time?",
    "Therapist: Yes, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. It's a key part of your treatment. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: Honestly? I'm scared. The idea of reliving those memories... it's terrifying. I've spent so many years trying to forget.",
    "Therapist: I understand. It's natural to feel anxious. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about losing control. What if I can't handle it? And... and I'm embarrassed. Some of what happened... I've never told anyone. Plus, you're so much younger than me. It feels strange.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. This process can be challenging, but you're not alone. How can I support you?",
    "Client: I don't know... Maybe... could you explain more about what exactly we'll be doing? And why it's supposed to help? I mean, I've managed for years by not thinking about it. Why stir it all up now?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Imaginal exposure helps process traumatic memories. It can reduce PTSD symptoms over time. Shall I explain the process?",
    "Client: S\u00ed, por favor. I need to know what I'm getting into.",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit the traumatic memory in a safe environment. You'll describe it in detail while I guide you. It may be uncomfortable, but it's therapeutic.",
    "Client: That sounds intense. Will I... will I lose myself in the memory? I'm afraid of getting stuck there, you know? Sometimes when I remember, it feels so real, like it's happening all over again.",
    "Therapist: You'll remain grounded in the present. I'll be here to support you throughout. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It's still scary, but... I trust you, Dr. Martinez. You've been patient with me, even when I struggle with my English or when the cravings get bad. I want to get better, for my grandkids, you know?",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable, Maria. This work is challenging but can lead to healing. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. Can we start slow? And if it gets too much, can we stop?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're in control. We'll go at your pace. Any other questions before we start?",
    "Client: Just one... will this help with the nightmares too? They've been getting worse lately, and I'm tired of waking up screaming. My neighbor's starting to worry.",
    "Therapist: Yes, it often helps reduce nightmares. Your bravery in facing this is commendable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Okay, Dr. Martinez. I'm ready. Let's do this... for my future, for my peace. Just... please be patient with me if I struggle.",
    "Therapist: Of course, Maria. We're in this together. Let's start by getting comfortable..."
