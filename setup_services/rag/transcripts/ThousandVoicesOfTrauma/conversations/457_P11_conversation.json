    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Ahmed?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Going back to those cult experiences, it's like I'm right there again. The isolation, the manipulation, it all feels so real. I can still hear the leader's voice in my head, you know? It's like this constant buzz that won't go away.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The feeling of helplessness, I think. It's like... I was trapped, not just physically but mentally. They had this way of making you doubt everything you've ever known. Your family, your friends, even your own thoughts. It's crazy how they could twist reality like that. And the worst part is, I believed it all. I really thought they were the only ones who cared about me.",
    "Therapist: How did reliving that memory feel today?",
    "Client: It was... harder than I expected. I thought I'd moved past a lot of this, but clearly, there's still so much pain there. My heart was racing, and I felt this tightness in my chest. It's like my body remembers even when my mind wants to forget. And there's this guilt, you know? Like, how could I have been so stupid to fall for all of it?",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to have those feelings. How does this connect to your current struggles?",
    "Client: I guess... I still have trust issues. It's hard for me to open up to people, even my roommates. I'm always second-guessing everyone's intentions. And then there's the substance use. I think I've been using it as a way to numb these memories, to escape from the shame and the fear. It's like I'm still trying to run away from what happened.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. How might addressing these memories help your recovery?",
    "Client: I... I never thought about it that way. Maybe if I can face these memories head-on, I won't need to escape so much. Perhaps I could start trusting people again, building real relationships. It's scary, but... maybe it's necessary for me to move forward.",
    "Therapist: That's a brave perspective. What's one small step you could take?",
    "Client: Um, maybe... maybe I could try sharing a bit more with my roommates. Nothing too deep, but just... being more open about my day or my feelings. And maybe cut back on the substances, at least a little. It's terrifying, but I want to feel real connections again, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great start. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... kind of hopeful? Like, for the first time in a while, I can see a way forward. It's still scary, and I know it won't be easy, but... I think I'm ready to try. Thank you for guiding me through this. I didn't think I could face these memories, but somehow, talking about it here... it makes it feel a little less overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength today. What would you like to focus on next session?",
    "Client: I think... maybe we could dig a little deeper into how the cult experiences have affected my relationships. And maybe explore some healthier coping mechanisms? I want to be better prepared for when these memories and feelings come up outside of our sessions.",
    "Therapist: That's a thoughtful plan. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in years, I feel like I'm not alone in this. It's a strange feeling, but a good one. I'm nervous about what's to come, but I'm also kind of excited to see where this journey takes me. Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a positive sign. We'll continue this work next time.",
    "Client: Okay. Yeah, I'm looking forward to it. It's tough, but... I think it's worth it. I want to reclaim my life, you know? Build something new, something that's truly mine. I know it won't happen overnight, but I'm ready to put in the work. Thank you again for your help and patience. I'll see you next week."
