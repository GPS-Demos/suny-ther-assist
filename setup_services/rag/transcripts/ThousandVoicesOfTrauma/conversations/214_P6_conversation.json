    "Therapist: Alright, Raj. Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and describe the car accident.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm driving home from my night shift. It's dark, around 2 AM. The roads are empty. I'm tired, but alert. Suddenly, I see headlights coming straight at me. They're in my lane. My heart starts racing. I try to swerve...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, about a 4 out of 10. I'm tense, but okay.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue.",
    "Client: The other car is getting closer. I can see it's a red SUV. I slam on the brakes and turn the wheel hard. There's a screeching sound. My car starts to spin. I'm gripping the steering wheel so tight my knuckles are white. I can smell burning rubber...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. My palms are sweating, and my heart's pounding.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The world is spinning around me. I hear a loud crash. Glass is shattering. I feel a sharp pain in my left side. Everything goes dark for a moment. When I open my eyes, I'm upside down. The airbag has deployed. I can taste blood in my mouth. I'm disoriented... scared...",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I hear sirens in the distance. I'm trying to move, but I'm stuck. My left arm is pinned. I smell gasoline. I'm terrified the car might explode. I'm calling for help, but my voice sounds weak. I can hear someone outside yelling, asking if I'm okay. I want to respond, but I can barely speak...",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm back there. My chest is so tight.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Raj. Remember, you're here with me. You're safe.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can continue. It feels too real.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Let's pause. Take some deep breaths.",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) Okay... okay... I'm trying.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, what do you notice around you in this room?",
    "Client: I... I can see your bookshelf. The clock on the wall. My hands... they're shaking.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're safe here. How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's coming down... maybe a 7 now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Do you feel ready to continue?",
    "Client: I... I think so. But it's hard.",
    "Therapist: I understand. You're very brave. Let's proceed slowly.",
    "Client: Alright. So... I'm still in the car. I hear people outside now. Someone's telling me they're going to get me out. I'm crying, telling them I'm scared. My whole body hurts. I can feel something warm trickling down my face - blood, I think. The firefighters are using tools to cut open the car. The noise is so loud, it's making my head hurt even more...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's back up to an 8. My heart's racing again.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing really well. Keep going.",
    "Client: They finally get me out. As they pull me from the wreckage, I see the other car. It's completely crushed. There's a body on the ground covered with a sheet. I realize the other driver didn't make it. I feel... I feel so guilty. Even though it wasn't my fault, I can't help but think...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS now, Raj?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 again. I feel overwhelmed. The guilt... it's crushing me.",
    "Therapist: I hear how difficult this is. Remember, you're not responsible for the other driver's actions.",
    "Client: I know, but... it's hard not to feel responsible somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. My SUDS is probably down to a 7 now.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today, Raj. Let's start winding down.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you. This was... intense.",
    "Therapist: It was. You showed great courage. How do you feel about today's session?",
    "Client: It was tough, but... I think it helped. I feel... lighter, somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's good to hear. We'll continue working through this. You're making progress."
