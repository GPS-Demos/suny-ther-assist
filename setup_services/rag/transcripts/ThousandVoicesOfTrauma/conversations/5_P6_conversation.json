    "Therapist: Welcome, Jake. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember to share your SUDS ratings as we progress. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the memory of losing your loved one.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm there. I'm in the hospital room. It's so quiet, except for the beeping of the machines. My grandmother is lying there, looking so frail. I can't believe this is happening.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10. It's uncomfortable, but not overwhelming yet.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The smell of antiseptic is so strong. It's making me feel a bit nauseous. I'm holding her hand, and it's so cold. I keep willing her to wake up, but she's not responding. My heart is starting to race a bit.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's gone up. Maybe a 6? I can feel my palms getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The doctor comes in. He's talking, but I can barely hear him over the rushing in my ears. I catch words like \"organ failure\" and \"not much time left.\" I feel like I can't breathe. My chest is so tight.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's an 8 now. I feel like I'm right back there, and I can't escape.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: I'm trying to say goodbye, but the words won't come out. I'm choking on them. And then... and then the machine flatlines. That sound... it's piercing. I can't... I can't handle this.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating at this moment?",
    "Client: It's a 9. I feel like I'm about to break down.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it.",
    "Client: The nurses are rushing in, but I know it's too late. I'm frozen, can't move. I want to scream, but nothing comes out. I feel so helpless, so alone. Why couldn't I do anything?",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Still a 9. My heart is pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: You're safe. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: I'm watching them turn off the machines. The silence is deafening. I can't believe she's gone. I should have been there more, should have visited more often. The guilt is crushing me.",

    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm at a 7. It still hurts, but I can breathe a little easier.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Let's start wrapping up.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm saying my final goodbye. Telling her I love her. My eyes are so blurry from tears. I can barely see her face.",
    "Therapist: And your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's a 6 now. I feel drained, but... I got through it.",
    "Therapist: Well done, Jake. You showed great courage. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... kind of relieved too. It was hard, but I feel like I faced something important.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. We'll end here for today."
