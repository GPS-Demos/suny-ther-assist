    "Therapist: Alright, Raj. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the memory.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm back in our old house. I can hear my parents arguing in the kitchen. The air feels heavy, and I'm sitting on the stairs, trying to make myself invisible.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 4. It's uncomfortable, but manageable.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue.",
    "Client: The argument is getting louder. I can hear dishes clattering. My father's voice is rising, and I'm starting to feel scared. My hands are getting sweaty, and my heart is beating faster.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's getting more intense. Maybe a 6 now? I'm feeling really anxious.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) Suddenly, there's a loud crash. I hear my mother cry out. I'm frozen, I can't move. I want to run and hide, but I'm paralyzed with fear. My chest feels tight, and I'm struggling to breathe.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: (Gasping) It's... it's an 8. I feel overwhelmed. My hands are shaking, and I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a deep breath. Can you continue?",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) Y-yes. I hear footsteps coming towards the stairs. I'm terrified it's my father. I squeeze my eyes shut, hoping he won't see me. But it's my mother. She's crying, and there's a red mark on her face. She sees me and tries to smile, but I can see the pain in her eyes.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's still high, maybe a 7.5. My heart is racing, but seeing my mother makes me feel a mix of relief and sadness.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: She comes and sits next to me on the stairs. She puts her arm around me, and I can feel her trembling. She tells me everything will be okay, but I know it's not true. I feel so helpless and angry.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down a bit. Maybe a 6? I still feel tense, but talking about my mother comforting me helps.",

    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's hovering around a 5 now. I'm still anxious, but talking about it is helping. My breathing is getting easier.",
    "Therapist: You're doing excellent work. Let's continue for a few more minutes.",
    "Client: Okay. We sit there for what feels like hours, but it's probably only minutes. Eventually, my father storms out of the house, slamming the front door. The silence afterwards is deafening. My mother hugs me tighter, and I can feel her tears on my head. I'm relieved he's gone, but I'm also worried about when he'll come back.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 4. I feel drained, but also a bit lighter. Like I've let go of something I've been holding onto for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's start to wrap up the exercise.",
    "Client: (Opens eyes, takes a deep breath) Wow, that was intense. But I feel... I don't know, maybe a bit relieved?",
    "Therapist: That's common. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I'm at about a 3. I feel tired, but also like I've accomplished something important.",
    "Therapist: You have. You did excellent work today, Raj."
