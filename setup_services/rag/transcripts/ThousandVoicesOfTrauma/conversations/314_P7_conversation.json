    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you describe the scene of the racial incident you witnessed?",
    "Client: Okay... I was walking home from class one evening. It was getting dark, and I saw a group of men surrounding someone near the campus coffee shop. As I got closer, I realized they were yelling racial slurs at a Middle Eastern man, probably another student. My heart started racing, and I froze, not knowing what to do.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The men were getting more aggressive, pushing the student and threatening him. I wanted to help, but I was terrified. I couldn't move. I just stood there, watching it happen. The student was trying to back away, but they had him cornered. I could see the fear in his eyes, and it reminded me of times when I've felt targeted for my ethnicity.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I felt so helpless and angry. I wanted to scream for help, but my voice was stuck in my throat. My hands were shaking, and I felt like I couldn't breathe. I kept thinking, \"This could be me. This could be my brother or my father.\" The violence escalated quickly. One of the men threw a punch, and the student fell to the ground.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I saw blood. The student was on the ground, trying to protect his face as they kicked him. I heard him crying out in pain, begging them to stop. I felt sick to my stomach. I wanted to run away, but I couldn't move. I felt like a coward for not helping him. Finally, someone else came by and started yelling at the attackers. They ran off, leaving the student on the ground.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: After they left, I finally found the courage to approach the student. He was badly beaten, his face swollen and bloody. I helped him sit up and called for an ambulance. He was sobbing, and so was I. I felt so guilty for not doing anything sooner. I kept apologizing to him, but he just held onto my hand, grateful that someone was there now.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great strength in sharing this. Continue.",
    "Client: The wait for the ambulance felt like forever. I stayed with him, trying to comfort him, but I felt so inadequate. When the paramedics arrived, I gave them my statement, but I felt ashamed that I couldn't provide more information about the attackers. As they took him away, I realized I was shaking uncontrollably. I couldn't stop crying. I felt so angry at those men, at myself, at the world for allowing this to happen.",
    "Therapist: You're processing this well. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Recalling it makes me feel sick and scared all over again. I still feel the guilt and shame of not acting sooner. But I also feel angry - angry that this kind of hate exists, angry that I wasn't prepared to handle it. I worry about it happening again, to me or to someone else. It's made me hyper-vigilant when I'm out, always looking over my shoulder. I don't feel safe anymore.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to have these feelings. You're doing well in expressing them.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to talk about, but I know I need to. I just wish I could've done more. I keep replaying the scene in my head, imagining different outcomes if I had acted differently. But mostly, I remember the fear in that student's eyes and the sound of his cries. It haunts me. I want to feel safe again, to not be afraid every time I walk home. But I don't know how to get past this.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress by confronting these memories. Let's continue working through this together."
