    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's like I was right back there, you know? The fear, the helplessness... it all came rushing back. I could almost smell the musty air in that room where they kept us.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The silence. It was deafening. We were all too scared to make a sound, afraid of what might happen if we did. I remember thinking, \"Will I ever see my family again?\" It's... it's hard to shake that feeling of uncertainty, even now.",
    "Therapist: How does recalling that uncertainty affect you today?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a shadow that follows me. Sometimes, I find myself hesitating to make plans for the future. What if something happens? What if I'm taken away again? It's irrational, I know, but the fear is still there.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. How did it feel to confront that memory today?",
    "Client: It was tough, really tough. But... I don't know, there's also a sense of... relief? Like I'm finally facing it head-on instead of running from it. It's exhausting, but I feel like I'm doing something, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a significant insight. How does this relate to your recovery goals?",
    "Client: I guess... I want to feel in control again. Going through this memory, as painful as it is, makes me feel like I'm taking back some of that control. It's like I'm telling myself, \"You survived this. You can face it now.\"",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What strategies helped you get through today's session?",
    "Client: I tried to focus on my breathing, like you taught me. And I kept reminding myself that I'm safe now, that it's just a memory. It didn't always work, but when it did, it helped me stay grounded.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's... it's scary, I won't lie. But I also feel a determination I didn't have before. I want to keep going. I want to reclaim my life, you know? I don't want to be a victim anymore. I want to be a survivor.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is admirable. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'm ready to talk about the day we were rescued. It's still fuzzy, but I feel like it's important. It might help me remember that there was an end to it all, that I did get out.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How can I support you until then?",
    "Client: Just... just knowing that I have these sessions, that I have a safe space to process all of this, it helps. Could we maybe go over some more grounding techniques? I think they're really helping.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll start our next session with that. Is there anything else you'd like to share?",
    "Client: I... I just want to say thank you. I know I'm not an easy client, and this isn't easy work. But I feel like I'm making progress, even if it's slow. And I appreciate your patience and guidance through all of this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your courage is inspiring. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, I'll be here. Thank you again."
