    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Can you describe the hostage situation you experienced?",
    "Client: Okay... I was at the hospital for a routine checkup when suddenly there was shouting in the hallway. A man burst into the room, waving a gun. He was demanding drugs and threatening to hurt people if he didn't get them. I froze, my heart racing. The doctor tried to calm him down, but he grabbed me and held the gun to my head, using me as a shield.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I could feel the cold metal against my temple. The man's hand was shaking, and I was terrified he might accidentally pull the trigger. Security arrived, but that only made him more agitated. He started shouting louder, pressing the gun harder against my head. I closed my eyes, thinking this might be the end.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What were you feeling?",
    "Client: Pure terror. My legs felt weak, and I was struggling to breathe. I could hear my pulse pounding in my ears. The smell of the man's sweat was overwhelming. I felt so helpless, like my life was completely out of my control.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: Time seemed to stretch on forever. I don't know how long we were there, but eventually, a negotiator arrived. They started talking to the man, trying to calm him down. I remember feeling a glimmer of hope, but also intense fear that any wrong move could end badly.",
    "Therapist: That must have been incredibly difficult. How did you cope?",
    "Client: I tried to focus on my breathing, anything to distract myself from the immediate danger. I thought about my family, wondering if I'd ever see them again. The negotiator kept talking, and slowly, I felt the gun's pressure lessen slightly.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: After what felt like hours, the man finally agreed to release me in exchange for the drugs he wanted. As soon as he let go, I collapsed to the floor. Security rushed in and subdued him. I was shaking uncontrollably, gasping for air. The medical staff quickly surrounded me, checking if I was hurt.",
    "Therapist: How did you feel once it was over?",
    "Client: Relieved, but also numb. It was like my mind couldn't process what had just happened. I burst into tears, overwhelmed by the realization that I was safe. But even then, I couldn't shake the feeling of vulnerability. It was like the world had suddenly become a much more dangerous place.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. You're safe now.",
    "Client: In the days and weeks that followed, I struggled to sleep. Every loud noise made me jump. Going to any medical facility became nearly impossible. I'd have panic attacks just thinking about it. The feeling of that gun against my head... it haunted me. I felt like I couldn't trust anyone or feel safe anywhere.",
    "Therapist: You've been through a lot. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Talking about it brings back a lot of those feelings. My heart is racing, and I feel tense all over. But there's also a part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I survived something terrible, and I'm still here.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. You are resilient.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to see it sometimes, but I'm trying. I want to get past this, to not let that moment define my life. But it's challenging. Every time I need medical care, I have to fight through the fear. I'm worried it will never fully go away.",
    "Therapist: It's a process, but you're making progress.",
    "Client: I hope so. I miss feeling normal, you know? Being able to go to a doctor without reliving that trauma. I want to feel safe again, to trust that the world isn't always out to harm me. It's exhausting being on high alert all the time.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. Sometimes I feel silly for still being so affected by it. I mean, I wasn't physically hurt. But the emotional impact... it's like it rewired my brain. I'm trying to be patient with myself, but it's frustrating when seemingly simple things are now so difficult.",
    "Therapist: Healing takes time. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Thank you. I guess I just need to keep working at it. It's hard to imagine ever feeling completely okay again, but moments like this, where I can talk about it without completely falling apart, give me hope. I want to reclaim my life, to not let that man and that moment have power over me anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. You've shown incredible strength today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It means a lot to hear that. I know I have a long way to go, but being able to talk about it like this... it feels like a step in the right direction. I'm grateful for your support and guidance through this process.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling drained, but also a bit lighter. Like I've released some of the weight I've been carrying. There's still fear and anxiety, but also a glimmer of hope that I can work through this. Thank you for guiding me through this session.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable courage. We'll end here for today."
