    "Therapist: Mrs. Johnson, today we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: I'm not sure, to be honest. I've been dreading this part. The idea of reliving those moments in the prison... it's terrifying. I've spent so many years trying to forget.",
    "Therapist: Your apprehension is understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm afraid that if I start talking about it, I won't be able to stop. What if I completely fall apart? At my age, I don't know if I can handle that kind of emotional stress. And... what if it makes my depression worse?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How about we discuss the process and benefits?",
    "Client: Alright, I suppose that would help. But I'm still nervous. You know, being African and growing up during a time of such turmoil, we were taught to be strong and silent. Opening up like this feels... wrong somehow.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's talk about how this can help you heal.",
    "Client: Okay, I'm listening. But please, explain it to me slowly. My mind isn't as sharp as it used to be.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Imaginal exposure helps process traumatic memories. We'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: Process the memories? But won't that just make everything worse? I've been trying to avoid thinking about my time in prison for decades.",
    "Therapist: Avoidance can actually maintain PTSD symptoms. This helps reduce their power over time.",
    "Client: I see. But how will you make sure I don't get overwhelmed? Living in shared accommodation, I can't afford to be a mess.",
    "Therapist: We'll start slowly and use grounding techniques. You're in control throughout.",
    "Client: That's somewhat reassuring. But what if I can't remember everything clearly? It was so long ago.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. We work with what you remember. There's no pressure to recall everything.",
    "Client: Alright. And you'll be here the whole time? You won't leave me alone with these memories?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'll be right here, supporting you every step of the way.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot. I've felt so alone with this for so long. Even my housemates don't know about my past. It's not something we discuss in our generation.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. This work can significantly improve your PTSD symptoms.",
    "Client: I hope so. The nightmares and constant fear... it's exhausting. But tell me, how long will this process take?",
    "Therapist: It varies for each person. We'll go at a pace that feels right for you.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. You know, part of me wonders if at my age, it's even worth dredging all this up. But then I think about the possibility of finding some peace...",
    "Therapist: It's never too late to heal. Your well-being matters, regardless of age.",
    "Client: You're right. I want to try, for myself. But also for my late husband. He always encouraged me to seek help, but I never found the strength until now.",
    "Therapist: That's beautiful. Shall we begin with a breathing exercise to center ourselves?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be helpful. I'm still nervous, but I'm ready to take this step. Thank you for your patience with an old woman like me.",
