    "Therapist: Welcome back. Today we'll be doing an imaginal exposure exercise focusing on your cult experiences. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm feeling a bit apprehensive, to be honest. It's not easy to revisit those memories.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 6 out of 10 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath and start describing the scene.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm standing outside the compound. It's dusk, and the air feels heavy with moisture. The gates are tall, imposing. I can hear chanting from inside...",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I know once I step through those gates, everything will change. The leader, he's waiting for us new recruits. I... I can smell incense drifting on the breeze.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My palms are sweaty. There's this knot in my stomach, like I'm about to be sick. But I force myself to walk forward. The gates creak open...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Inside, it's like entering another world. People in white robes are everywhere, their eyes... they seem vacant. The leader approaches me, his smile doesn't reach his eyes. He says, \"Welcome home, child.\" I feel... trapped.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe an 8?",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... The leader puts his hand on my shoulder. It feels wrong, invasive. He starts talking about our \"divine purpose,\" but all I can focus on is how badly I want to run. But I can't. I'm frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice around you?",
    "Client: There's... there's a large bonfire in the center of the compound. People are gathered around it, swaying and chanting. The flames cast eerie shadows on their faces. I'm being led towards it...",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What happens next?",
    "Client: They... they want me to join the circle. My feet feel like lead. The chanting gets louder, it's overwhelming. I... I can't breathe...",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Remember you're here, safe in my office.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... I'm in the circle now. They're passing around a cup. Some kind of ritual drink. When it gets to me, I hesitate. The leader's eyes are boring into me. I know I have to drink it...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Terrified. Disgusted. But also... a part of me is curious. What if they're right? What if this is where I belong? I... I take a sip.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those conflicting emotions. What happens after you drink?",
    "Client: The liquid burns going down. Almost immediately, I feel... different. Lightheaded. The world starts to blur at the edges. The chanting becomes hypnotic. I find myself swaying with the others...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. This is intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're just observing now.",
    "Client: Right... As the drug takes effect, I feel like I'm floating. The leader's words start to make sense in a way they never did before. He's talking about leaving our old lives behind, about becoming part of something greater...",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel?",
    "Client: Heavy. Warm. Like I'm melting into the ground. But there's also this underlying tension, a part of me that's screaming to wake up, to run...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that tension. What does it tell you?",
    "Client: It's... it's my survival instinct. Even as I'm being pulled in, a part of me knows this is wrong. But I can't... I can't act on it. I'm too far gone.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: Days start to blur together. We're working in the fields, attending endless meetings. They separate me from the others I came in with. I'm always tired, always hungry. But they say it's part of the cleansing...",
    "Therapist: How does this isolation affect you?",
    "Client: It's... it's crushing. I feel so alone, even surrounded by people. I start to forget who I was before. My family, my friends... they all seem like a distant dream.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: Still... still a 9. It's hard to shake these feelings.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: Months pass. I'm... I'm fully indoctrinated now. Or so they think. I parrot their teachings, I follow every rule. But deep down, that spark of doubt never fully dies. I'm waiting... waiting for a chance.",
    "Therapist: What keeps that spark alive?",
    "Client: Memories... fleeting memories of my life before. The smell of my mother's cooking, the sound of my best friend's laugh. They're like lifelines.",
    "Therapist: Hold onto those lifelines. What happens next?",
    "Client: One night, I overhear the leaders talking. They're planning something big, something terrible. I realize I can't stay silent anymore. I have to get out, to warn someone...",
    "Therapist: How do you feel in this moment of realization?",
    "Client: Terrified. But also... alive. For the first time in months, I feel like myself again. I start planning my escape.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling of coming back to yourself.",
    "Client: It's like waking up from a long nightmare. I wait until the dead of night. My heart is pounding so hard I'm sure someone will hear it. I make my way to the fence...",
    "Therapist: What do you notice around you?",
    "Client: It's so quiet. Just the sound of crickets and my own ragged breathing. The moonlight casts long shadows. I reach the fence and start to climb...",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to take this action?",
    "Client: Exhilarating. Terrifying. My muscles are screaming, but I keep going. I reach the top, and for a moment, I hesitate. What if I can't make it on my own?",
    "Therapist: What gives you the strength to continue?",
    "Client: The thought of my family. The need to warn others. I... I jump. The impact knocks the wind out of me, but I force myself up. I start running...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment of freedom.",
    "Client: I run until my lungs burn. Until I can't hear any sounds of pursuit. I find a road, flag down a car. The driver looks scared, but he stops. I'm sobbing, trying to explain...",
    "Therapist: How do you feel now, in this moment of escape?",
    "Client: Relief. Overwhelming relief. But also... guilt. For those I left behind. Fear of what comes next. It's... it's a lot.",
    "Therapist: That's a complex mix of emotions. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 7 now. Talking through it... it helps.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Look around the room and name five things you see.",
    "Client: Okay... I see your desk, the bookshelf, the window, the plant in the corner, and the clock on the wall.",
    "Therapist: Good. Take a deep breath. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. But... lighter somehow. Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after these sessions. You've shown incredible strength today. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I just... I never thought I'd be able to talk about this. Thank you for guiding me through it.",
    "Therapist: You did all the hard work. I'm here to support you. Let's end with a final SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I think... I think I'm down to a 5 now. Still shaky, but better.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. We'll continue to work through this in our future sessions. For now, let's focus on some self-care strategies for the rest of your day..."
