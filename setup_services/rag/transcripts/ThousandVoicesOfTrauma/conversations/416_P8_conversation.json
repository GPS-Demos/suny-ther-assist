    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like I'm numb, but also overwhelmed at the same time. My heart is racing, and I feel a bit dizzy. The memory of my ex-husband telling me he wanted a divorce... it's so vivid now. I can see his face, hear his voice. It's like I'm right back there in our kitchen, and I can smell the coffee brewing. It's... it's too much.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's like... like I'm that little girl again, helpless and alone. When my ex-husband left, it triggered all those feelings from my childhood. The abandonment, the uncertainty. I feel like I can't trust anyone, you know? Like everyone I love will eventually leave me.",
    "Therapist: How does that fear manifest in your body?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, like I can't breathe properly. My hands are shaking, and I feel this knot in my stomach. It's like my body is preparing for something terrible to happen. I... I think I need a drink. I know I shouldn't, but it's the only thing that helps sometimes.",
    "Therapist: I hear you're struggling. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"I'm not good enough.\" It's on repeat in my head. Maybe if I had been a better wife, he wouldn't have left. Maybe if I had been a better daughter, my parents wouldn't have... you know. And then I get angry at myself for thinking that way. I know logically it's not my fault, but emotionally... it's hard to shake that belief.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts relate to your childhood experiences?",
    "Client: Oh, they're so connected. Growing up, I always felt like I had to be perfect to earn love. My parents were... well, they weren't great. There was a lot of neglect, some abuse. I learned early on that if I wasn't useful or perfect, I'd be ignored or worse. So when my marriage ended, it just confirmed all those old beliefs. It's like... like I'm destined to be alone because I'm fundamentally flawed somehow.",
    "Therapist: I see. What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Part of me wants to run away, to hide. Another part wants to curl up and cry. And there's this small voice inside that's telling me to stay, to face this. I guess... I guess I need to feel safe. To know that even though I'm reliving these painful memories, I'm actually okay right now. That I'm not that helpless child or that devastated wife anymore. But it's so hard to believe that.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength by staying present. What's one thing you can do to ground yourself right now?",
    "Client: I... I can focus on my breathing, I suppose. In and out. And maybe... maybe I can remind myself that I've survived all of this. That I'm here, in this room, talking to you. That I'm not alone anymore. It's hard, but... but I'm doing it, aren't I? I'm facing these memories instead of running away or... or drinking them away.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. How does acknowledging that make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of emotions. There's a bit of pride, I guess. Like, maybe I'm stronger than I thought. But there's also this sadness. For the little girl I was, for the woman I became. All the years I spent feeling so... so worthless. And there's fear too. Fear that I'll slip back into old patterns, that I'll let these memories control me again. But underneath all of that, there's this tiny spark of hope. Like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this and come out the other side.",
    "Therapist: That spark of hope is important. What does it tell you?",
    "Client: It tells me that... that maybe I'm not broken beyond repair. That maybe all the pain and trauma I've been through doesn't define me. It's hard to believe, but... but I want to. I want to believe that I can heal, that I can have healthy relationships, that I can trust again. It's terrifying, but also... exciting? Is that weird to say?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. How can you nurture that spark of hope?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to be kinder to myself. To recognize when I'm falling into those old thought patterns and challenge them. Maybe I can start by acknowledging one good thing about myself each day. And... and I think I need to keep doing this work, as hard as it is. To face these memories and feelings instead of numbing them with alcohol. It's not easy, but... but I think it's worth it. I want to be whole, you know? Not just surviving, but actually living.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How are you feeling now compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, honestly. But also lighter somehow. Like I've set down a heavy burden, even if it's just for a moment. The fear and pain are still there, but they don't feel as overwhelming. And that spark of hope? It feels a little stronger. I'm exhausted, but... but I'm glad I did this. Thank you for... for guiding me through it.",
    "Therapist: You did the hard work. What's one thing you want to remember from today's session?",
    "Client: I want to remember that I'm not alone. That these feelings, as intense as they are, won't last forever. And that I have the strength to face them. It's not easy, and I know I'll have setbacks, but... but I'm on the right path. I'm doing the work, and that counts for something. I just need to keep going, one day at a time.",
    "Therapist: That's a great takeaway. How would you like to close our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to do a quick grounding exercise if that's okay. Just to help me transition back to the present moment. And maybe... maybe we could end with a reminder of my coping strategies for when these memories and feelings come up outside of our sessions. I want to be prepared, you know?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's do that grounding exercise now."
