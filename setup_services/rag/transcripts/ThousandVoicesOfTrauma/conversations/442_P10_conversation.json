    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to dive into that hospital situation again, and just thinking about it makes my heart race a little.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in the hospital waiting room. It's busy, people everywhere. The fluorescent lights are so bright, making everything look stark and clinical. I can smell that distinct hospital scent - antiseptic and something else I can't quite place.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear shouting. At first, I think it's just an upset patient, but then... oh God, I see him. A man with a gun, waving it around wildly. He's yelling something about needing drugs. Everyone starts screaming and ducking for cover.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. My heart is pounding so hard I can hear it in my ears. I... I can't breathe properly. I want to run, but my legs won't move.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about an 80. It feels so real.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... The man is getting more agitated. He's grabbing a nurse, pointing the gun at her head. I can see the fear in her eyes. I'm frozen in place, watching this unfold. I keep thinking, \"This can't be happening. This isn't real.\"",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about my family. Will I ever see them again? I'm angry too - I came here for a routine check-up, and now... now I might die. It's not fair!",
    "Therapist: Allow yourself to feel those emotions. What happens next?",
    "Client: Security guards are trying to talk him down, but he's not listening. He's sweating, his eyes wild. I can see his finger tightening on the trigger. I close my eyes, waiting for the sound of a gunshot.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 90. I can feel my hands shaking.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. Feel your feet on the floor. You're here, you're safe.",
    "Client: *takes a shaky breath* Okay... okay. I open my eyes, and suddenly there's a commotion. One of the patients - a big guy - he tackles the gunman from behind. The gun goes off, but it hits the ceiling. There's plaster falling, people screaming even louder.",
    "Therapist: What are you doing during this?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm still frozen. But now I'm looking for an exit. My legs are starting to work again. I see a door to my left and I'm inching towards it, trying not to draw attention.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going.",
    "Client: The security guards are on the gunman now, trying to restrain him. He's fighting back, screaming incoherently. I make it to the door and push it open. The cool air hits me, and I... I just start running. I don't stop until I'm in the parking lot, gasping for air.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel now that you're out?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking all over. Relief, I guess, but also... guilt? I left everyone else behind. What if someone got hurt? I should have helped, should have done something...",
    "Therapist: It's common to feel that way. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's down to about 70 now. My heart's still racing, though.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. Take another deep breath. What happens after you're in the parking lot?",
    "Client: I... I see other people who've escaped. Some are crying, others on their phones. I realize I should call my husband. My hands are shaking so much I can barely dial. When he answers, I just break down. I can't even form words at first.",
    "Therapist: That must have been overwhelming. How does your body feel as you're making that call?",
    "Client: It's like... like I'm not fully in my body. My voice sounds strange to me, far away. I'm cold, even though it's a warm day. I keep looking back at the hospital, expecting the gunman to come bursting out.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I finally manage to tell my husband what happened. He says he's coming right away. I sink down onto the curb, waiting. Time feels... weird. Like it's stretching and compressing at the same time. I can hear sirens in the distance getting louder.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 60. I'm starting to feel a bit more grounded, but still shaky.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The police arrive, then ambulances. It's chaos. They're evacuating the hospital. I see people I was just sitting with in the waiting room, looking shell-shocked. Someone - a paramedic, I think - comes to check on me. I try to tell them I'm fine, others need help more, but my voice is barely a whisper.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in that moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm numb. Like I'm watching everything happen from outside myself. But there's also this undercurrent of panic, like at any moment I might just start screaming and not be able to stop.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction to trauma. What happens after the paramedic checks on you?",
    "Client: I... I see my husband's car pull up. He jumps out before it's even fully stopped. When he hugs me, it's like... like I finally break. I start sobbing uncontrollably. He's asking me questions, but I can't answer. I just cling to him.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to be held by your husband?",
    "Client: It's... it's comforting, but also overwhelming. Like the reality of what just happened is finally hitting me. I feel safe, but also... fragile? Like I might shatter at any moment.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 50. I'm calmer, but still very shaken.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: The police want to take my statement. I don't want to leave my husband's side, so he comes with me. Talking about it... it makes it all fresh again. I keep stumbling over my words, forgetting details, then remembering them in vivid flashes.",
    "Therapist: How does recounting the experience to the police affect you?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. My mouth is dry, and I keep feeling waves of nausea. But there's also... I don't know, a sense of purpose? Like by telling them what happened, I'm doing something to help.",
    "Therapist: That's a very normal response. What happens after you give your statement?",
    "Client: They tell us we can go home. My husband has to practically carry me to the car. I'm exhausted, like I've run a marathon. The drive home is a blur. I keep expecting to wake up and find out it was all a nightmare.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel once you're home?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm relieved to be in familiar surroundings, but also... jumpy? Every little noise makes me flinch. I can't settle. I keep replaying everything in my mind, wondering what I could have done differently.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 40. I'm calmer, but still very on edge.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How does the rest of that day unfold?",
    "Client: It's... it's strange. I can't eat, can't focus on anything. My husband tries to get me to rest, but every time I close my eyes, I see that gun. I end up just sitting on the couch, staring at the TV without really seeing it. The news is covering the incident, and I can't decide if I want to watch or not.",
    "Therapist: How do you handle seeing it on the news?",
    "Client: It's... it's surreal. Hearing them talk about it like it's just another story... it makes me angry. They don't understand what it was like to be there. But I also can't look away. I need to know what happened after I left.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What do you learn from the news?",
    "Client: They... they say no one was seriously hurt. The gunman was arrested. Hearing that... it's like a weight lifts off my chest. But then I feel guilty for feeling relieved when so many people were traumatized.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel relief. How does the night go?",
    "Client: It's... it's rough. I can't sleep. Every time I start to drift off, I jerk awake in a panic. My husband stays up with me, just holding me. By morning, I'm exhausted, but also... wired? Like my body won't let me relax.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response to trauma. What's your distress level now, thinking back on that night?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 30. It's still uncomfortable to think about, but not as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well today, Maria. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained, but also... I don't know, lighter? Like talking through it all has helped release some of the tension I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. We'll end here for today. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later. You did excellent work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It... it wasn't easy, but I'm glad we did this.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself. We'll continue working through this in our next session. Take care, Maria."
