    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the memory we've been working on?",
    "Client: Okay... It was during my first year of university. My roommate and I got into an argument, and he locked me in our dorm room. I remember feeling so trapped and scared.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: He was yelling at me through the door, calling me names and threatening to tell everyone I was a terrorist because of my ethnicity. I felt my heart racing, and I couldn't breathe properly. I kept thinking, \"What if I can't get out? What if he really tells people those lies about me?\"",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I tried to open the door, but it wouldn't budge. I started panicking, thinking about how my parents would react if they found out. Would they be disappointed in me? Would they believe him? I felt so alone and helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Keep going.",
    "Client: I sat on the floor, my back against the wall, trying to calm myself down. But all I could hear was his voice, those horrible things he was saying. I started to doubt myself, wondering if maybe I deserved this somehow.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can continue. This feels too real.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a deep breath. Can you stay with the memory a bit longer?",
    "Client: I'll try. Um, I remember looking at my phone, wanting to call for help, but I was too ashamed. What if people thought I was overreacting? What if they sided with him? I felt so small and powerless.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Keep going.",
    "Client: After what felt like hours, but was probably only 30 minutes, he unlocked the door. He acted like nothing had happened, like it was all a joke. But I couldn't shake the feeling of being trapped, of being at someone else's mercy.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. But also a bit relieved, I guess. It's still hard to talk about, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming as it used to.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still difficult to think about how this affected me. I became so anxious about going to classes, always worried that he might have spread rumors about me. I started isolating myself, which only made my anxiety worse.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to have those feelings. You're processing this well.",
    "Client: I think what hurts the most is how it affected my trust in others. I became so guarded, always worried that people might turn on me or trap me somehow. It's been hard to open up in relationships since then.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. You're gaining insight into your experiences.",
    "Client: I guess I am. It's just... sometimes I still feel that fear, you know? Like when I'm in a crowded elevator or a small room. I have to remind myself that I'm not actually trapped.",
    "Therapist: Those are normal responses. You're learning to cope with them.",
    "Client: Yeah, I am. It's getting easier, but there are still moments when it all comes rushing back. Like when I hear someone yelling or when a door slams shut unexpectedly. It's like I'm right back in that room.",
    "Therapist: You're becoming more aware of your triggers. That's important progress.",
    "Client: I suppose so. It's just frustrating sometimes, feeling like I'm still affected by this after all this time. But I know I've come a long way too. I can talk about it now without completely falling apart, which is something I couldn't do before.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... okay, actually. A bit drained, but also somewhat lighter. Like I've let go of a little bit of the weight I've been carrying. It's still there, but it feels more manageable somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. You've done great work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your support through this. It's not easy, but I think it's helping. I'm starting to see that what happened wasn't my fault, and that I'm stronger than I thought I was.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable resilience. We'll end here for today."
