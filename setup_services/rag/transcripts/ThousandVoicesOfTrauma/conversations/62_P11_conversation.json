    "Therapist: How are you feeling after going through that memory today, Mr. Singh?",
    "Client: I... it's hard to put into words, doctor. I feel drained, like I've run a marathon. My hands are still shaking a bit. It's strange, you know? I've lived with this memory for so long, but reliving it like that... it feels different.",
    "Therapist: Different how?",
    "Client: Well, it's more... immediate, I suppose. When I usually think about that night, it's like watching an old film. But today, it was like I was there again. I could smell the curry my wife had made for dinner, hear the clock ticking on the wall. It's... unsettling.",
    "Therapist: What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The sound of glass breaking. When my son threw that vase at his wife... I can still hear it shattering. It's funny, isn't it? Out of everything, that's what sticks with me. Not the shouting or the crying, but that sound of breaking glass.",
    "Therapist: How did that make you feel?",
    "Client: Helpless. Utterly helpless. I should have done something, said something. But I just stood there, frozen. What kind of father am I? What kind of man?",
    "Therapist: It's common to feel that way. How do you think this relates to your current symptoms?",
    "Client: I... I suppose it's why I can't stand conflict now. Even a raised voice makes me panic. And the guilt... it eats at me. Maybe that's why I've been so down lately. I failed them both that night.",
    "Therapist: You're making important connections. What else?",
    "Client: I've been avoiding my son, you know. He's tried to reconnect, but I... I can't face him. Every time I see him, I'm back in that moment. It's easier to be alone.",
    "Therapist: How has that isolation affected you?",
    "Client: It's... lonely. Very lonely. Especially since my wife passed. But it feels safer, somehow. No risk of disappointing anyone else.",
    "Therapist: I hear you. What do you think about challenging that belief?",
    "Client: Challenge it? I... I'm not sure. The thought of facing my son, it makes my heart race. But... I miss him. And my grandchildren. Maybe... maybe it's time to try?",
    "Therapist: That's brave of you to consider. How might you start?",
    "Client: Perhaps... a phone call? Just to hear his voice. Baby steps, right?",
    "Therapist: Excellent idea. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... lighter, somehow. Like I've set down a heavy bag I've been carrying. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Very normal. What's your takeaway from today?",
    "Client: That maybe... maybe I'm not as helpless now as I was then. That I can choose to act differently. It's terrifying, but also... hopeful? Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: It makes perfect sense. Well done today.",
    "Client: Thank you, doctor. I... I think I'm ready to go home now. Same time next week?",
    "Therapist: Yes, see you then. Take care, Mr. Singh."
