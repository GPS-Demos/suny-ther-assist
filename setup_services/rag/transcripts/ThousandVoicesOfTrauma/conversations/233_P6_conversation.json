    "Therapist: Alright, John, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: I think so, yeah. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the hospital scene.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm there. The antiseptic smell is so strong. I can see Sarah lying in the bed, tubes everywhere. The beeping of the machines is constant, almost deafening. Her skin looks so pale, almost translucent. I... I can't believe this is happening.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: It's about a 6. My heart's racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: The doctor comes in. His face is grim. I know it's bad news before he even speaks. Sarah's hand feels so cold in mine. I'm trying to be strong, but I feel like I'm crumbling inside. The doctor's words are a blur... \"terminal\"... \"days left\"... I can't process it.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to an 8. My chest feels tight. I... I'm having trouble breathing.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: (takes several deep breaths) The worst part is seeing the hope fade from Sarah's eyes. She was always so full of life, and now... God, I feel so helpless. I should be doing something, anything! But there's nothing I can do. Nothing.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: Still an 8. My hands are shaking. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The next few days are a blur. Family coming and going, hushed conversations in the hallway. Sarah's getting weaker. I'm trying to memorize every detail of her face, her voice. I don't want to forget anything. The night she... when she... (voice breaks) I was holding her hand. She looked at me, smiled, and then... she was gone. Just like that. I couldn't believe it. I kept waiting for her to take another breath.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: (voice shaky) It's a 9. I feel like I can't breathe. My chest hurts.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. You're safe here, John.",
    "Client: (takes several deep breaths) I... I remember the silence. The machines stopped beeping. It was so quiet. I didn't know what to do. I just sat there, holding her hand, willing her to come back. But she didn't. She was gone, and I was alone.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down a bit. Maybe a 7. I feel drained.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're doing great. Let's continue for a few more minutes.",

    "Therapist: What's your final SUDS rating?",

    "Therapist: Absolutely. You've done well today, John. Let's end here and discuss what you experienced."
