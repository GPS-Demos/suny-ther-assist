    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's always intense reliving that moment. The lights, the sirens, the shouting... it all comes rushing back. I can still feel my heart racing, just like it did that night.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you this time?",
    "Client: The helplessness. I keep thinking about how powerless I felt watching them rough up that young man. As a doctor, I'm used to being in control, helping people. But there... I couldn't do anything. I just froze.",
    "Therapist: How did that helplessness manifest physically?",
    "Client: My hands were trembling. I remember clenching my fists so tight my nails dug into my palms. And my chest... it felt so tight, like I couldn't breathe properly. I wanted to speak up, to do something, but... I was terrified.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts were going through your mind?",
    "Client: I kept thinking, \"This isn't right. Someone needs to stop this.\" But then... then I'd think, \"What if they turn on me next?\" It's... it's embarrassing to admit that. I'm supposed to be brave, to help others. But I just stood there.",
    "Therapist: How does that connect to your everyday life now?",
    "Client: I... I guess I'm always on edge now. Whenever I see a police car or hear sirens, I tense up. It's affecting my work too. I'm second-guessing myself more, afraid of making mistakes. It's like... like I've lost faith in my ability to handle crises.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How else has this impacted you?",
    "Client: I've been having trouble sleeping. Nightmares, you know? And during the day, I'm... I'm just exhausted. My husband says I'm more irritable lately. I snap at little things. It's... it's not like me.",
    "Therapist: What's been most challenging for you?",
    "Client: The guilt, I think. I keep replaying that night, thinking of all the things I could've done differently. Maybe if I'd spoken up... But then I remember how scared I was, and I feel ashamed. I'm a professional, for goodness sake. I should've been stronger.",
    "Therapist: How do you think this exposure is helping?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. Really hard. But... I think it's forcing me to confront those feelings, you know? The fear, the guilt... I can't just push them away anymore. And maybe... maybe that's the first step to dealing with them?",
    "Therapist: That's a great observation. What else?",
    "Client: I'm starting to see... it wasn't my fault. I mean, I still feel guilty, but... rationally, I know I didn't cause that situation. I was just... caught in it. That's new for me, being able to separate my emotions from the facts.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How can you apply this moving forward?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to be kinder to myself. Maybe... maybe I can use these techniques when I start feeling anxious at work or when I hear sirens. And... and maybe I can start talking to my husband more about this. He wants to help, I've just been... pushing him away.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Anything else?",
    "Client: I... I think I want to look into advocacy groups. For police reform, you know? I feel like... like maybe I can channel this experience into something positive. Help prevent others from going through what I did. Is that... is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How does that idea make you feel?",
    "Client: It makes me feel... hopeful, I guess. Like maybe some good can come out of this after all. And... and maybe it'll help me feel less powerless. Like I'm taking back some control.",
    "Therapist: That's fantastic progress, Sarah. What's your takeaway today?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm stronger than I thought. This isn't easy, but I'm doing it. And... and maybe I don't have to be perfect. Maybe it's okay to be scared sometimes, as long as I don't let it control me. I'm... I'm actually kind of proud of myself right now.",
    "Therapist: You should be. Ready to wrap up?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Thank you... this was tough, but... but I feel like I'm finally moving forward. Same time next week?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Take care, Sarah."
