    "Therapist: Welcome back, James. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Thompson. I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been thinking a lot about our last session and the idea of this imaginal exposure thing. It's been making me pretty anxious, to be honest.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... I've spent so much time trying not to think about what happened. The idea of purposely reliving it feels terrifying. I'm worried I'll fall apart or get stuck in those memories. And... I'm not sure I'm ready to face it all again.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Imaginal exposure can be challenging, but it's a crucial step in healing.",
    "Client: I get that, but how does reliving the trauma actually help? Won't it just make things worse? I mean, I've been having nightmares and flashbacks already. This feels like I'm voluntarily putting myself through that.",
    "Therapist: By facing the memory, we can process it and reduce its power over you.",
    "Client: I see... I guess that makes sense. But what if I can't handle it? What if I completely break down during the session?",
    "Therapist: I'll be here to support you throughout. We'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: Okay... that's somewhat reassuring. Can you tell me more about what exactly we'll be doing? Like, what should I expect during the session?",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit the memory gradually. You'll describe it in detail while staying present.",
    "Client: In detail? That sounds intense. I'm not sure I remember everything clearly. Some parts are vivid, but others are hazy. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll work with what you remember. There's no pressure to recall everything.",
    "Client: Alright. And you mentioned staying present... what do you mean by that exactly?",
    "Therapist: We'll use grounding techniques to keep you connected to the present moment.",
    "Client: Grounding techniques? Like what we practiced before with the deep breathing and focusing on objects in the room?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. Those techniques will help you stay anchored during the exercise.",
    "Client: Okay, that helps. I'm still nervous, but I think I understand better now. How long will the exposure part last?",
    "Therapist: We'll start with about 30 minutes, adjusting as needed. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's longer than I expected. But I guess it's necessary, right? I'm worried about how I'll feel afterwards. Will I be okay to go home on my own?",
    "Therapist: Your safety is paramount. We'll debrief and ensure you're stable before leaving.",
    "Client: That's good to know. I appreciate your thoroughness, Dr. Thompson. I think... I think I'm ready to give this a try. It won't be easy, but if it can help me move past this trauma and start feeling more like myself again, it's worth it.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable, James. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do it. I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Just... please bear with me if I struggle or need to take breaks.",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll take it step by step. You're in control here."
