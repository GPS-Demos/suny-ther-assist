    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. Today we'll continue with our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day in the hospital...",
    "Client: Okay... I'm there. The bright lights, the beeping machines... I can smell the antiseptic.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's happening?",
    "Client: I'm lying on the bed, waiting for the results. My heart is racing. The doctor walks in with a clipboard, and I can tell by his face it's not good news.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, about a 6. I'm feeling anxious, but it's manageable.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue with what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The doctor starts talking, but I can barely hear him over the pounding in my ears. \"Tumor,\" \"aggressive,\" \"immediate treatment\"... The words float around me, but they don't make sense. I feel like I'm underwater.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling physically right now?",
    "Client: My palms are sweaty, and there's a tightness in my chest. It's hard to breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to an 8. I feel overwhelmed, just like I did that day.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: I start crying, and the doctor looks uncomfortable. He hands me some tissues, but I can't stop. I'm thinking about my life, my future... everything feels like it's slipping away. I want to run, but I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: A nurse comes in and starts explaining treatment options, but I can't focus. I nod, pretending to understand, but inside I'm screaming. I feel so alone, so scared.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm right back there, helpless and terrified.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Remember, this is a memory. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *takes a shaky breath* Okay... I'm trying.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I leave the hospital in a daze. The sun is too bright, people are too loud. I get to my car and just sit there, unable to move. I can't stop thinking about how my life has changed in an instant. How am I going to tell my family? My friends?",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel a heaviness in my chest. Like I can't get enough air. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's still at a 9. I feel like I'm reliving it all over again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I start the car, but I can't remember how to drive. Everything feels foreign. I manage to call my sister, but I can barely speak through the tears. She says she's coming, but I feel so alone waiting for her.",
    "Therapist: And now? How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm starting to feel a little calmer. My breathing is slowing down. It's like... I'm coming out of it.",
    "Therapist: That's good. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 7. I still feel shaky, but not as overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. Let's start to bring you back to the present...",
    "Client: *takes a deep breath* Okay. I'm... I'm here.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, but... okay. It's over. I'm safe.",
