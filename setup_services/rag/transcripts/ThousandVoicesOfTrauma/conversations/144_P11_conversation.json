    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Lee?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving those moments in the refugee camp... it's bringing up a lot of emotions I've tried to bury for years.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The constant feeling of uncertainty. Not knowing if we'd ever leave, if we'd have enough food for the next day. I remember the pit in my stomach, the anxiety that never seemed to go away. It's like I can feel it again now, you know?",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to experience that anxiety now?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. My heart's racing a bit, and I feel tense all over. But it's different somehow. Like, I'm here in this safe room, but part of me is still back there.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. How does it compare to your day-to-day anxiety?",
    "Client: I... I guess it's similar, but more focused? Usually, I'm anxious about everything and nothing at the same time. But right now, I can pinpoint exactly where it's coming from. It's almost... I don't know, manageable in a way?",
    "Therapist: That's an interesting observation. What do you make of that?",
    "Client: Well, maybe... maybe it means I can learn to handle it better? If I can understand where it's coming from, I might be able to address it more directly. It's still scary, but not as overwhelming as I thought it would be.",
    "Therapist: That's a valuable insight. How might this help with your recovery goals?",
    "Client: I suppose... if I can face these memories and work through them, maybe the constant background anxiety might lessen? It's like, by confronting the source, I'm taking some power back. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How do you feel about continuing this process?",
    "Client: It's tough, no doubt about it. But... I think I'm starting to see the value. Each time we do this, it gets a little easier. I'm scared, but I'm also... hopeful? That's not something I've felt in a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What's giving you that hope?",
    "Client: I guess... it's the fact that I'm actually doing something about it. For years, I've just been trying to ignore everything, push it all down. But now, I'm facing it head-on. It's terrifying, but also empowering in a way.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does this connect to your depression?",
    "Client: Hmm... I think... maybe a lot of my depression comes from feeling helpless, like I have no control over my life or my emotions. But this process, as difficult as it is, is showing me that I can take action. I can face these memories and work through them. It's hard work, but it's... it's mine, you know? It's something I'm doing for myself.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent connection. What's your takeaway from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I'm stronger than I thought. These memories are painful, but I can face them. And maybe, just maybe, by facing them, I can start to move forward. It's a long road ahead, but for the first time in years, I feel like I'm actually on that road, not just stuck in place.",
    "Therapist: That's a profound insight. How will you carry this forward?",
    "Client: I'm going to try to remind myself of this feeling when things get tough. That I can face my fears, that I'm not helpless. And maybe... maybe I'll try to be a bit kinder to myself. Recognize that what I went through was really hard, and it's okay that it's taking time to work through it.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: I... I just want to say thank you. This isn't easy, but I feel like I'm finally making progress. It means a lot to have someone guiding me through this process.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your courage is commendable. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm exhausted, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've done something important. I'm looking forward to our next session, even if it's going to be challenging.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. Take care, and I'll see you next time."
