    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Can you describe the scene of your imprisonment?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back there. It's dark, and I can feel the cold concrete floor beneath me. The cell is small, maybe 6 by 8 feet. There's a tiny window high up on the wall, but it barely lets any light in. I can hear the distant sound of metal doors clanging shut and muffled voices.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: I'm sitting in the corner, my back against the wall. My wrists are sore from the handcuffs they used earlier. The air is damp and has a musty smell. I'm trying to stay calm, but I can feel my heart racing. I keep thinking about my family, wondering if they know where I am or if they're worried.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: I... I'm starting to panic a little. The walls feel like they're closing in. I can hear footsteps approaching, and I'm terrified of what might happen next. My mouth is dry, and I'm finding it hard to breathe. I want to scream, but I know I can't draw attention to myself.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... The footsteps pass by. I feel a moment of relief, but it's quickly replaced by a deep sense of despair. I don't know how long I'll be here or what's going to happen to me. I feel so helpless and alone. I keep replaying the moment they took me, wondering if there was something I could have done differently.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Time seems to stand still in here. I try to count the seconds, but I lose track. My stomach is growling \u2013 I can't remember the last time I ate. The hunger is almost a welcome distraction from the fear. I hear rats scurrying somewhere in the darkness, and I curl up tighter, trying to make myself as small as possible.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling overwhelmed. My chest feels tight, and my hands are shaking. It's like I'm right back there, and part of me wants to stop, to push these memories away. But I also know I need to face this. It's just... it's so hard.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I remember trying to stay strong, to not let them see how scared I was. But in the darkness of that cell, I broke down. I cried silently, my whole body shaking with sobs. I thought about my wife, my children, wondering if I'd ever see them again. The uncertainty was almost worse than the confinement itself.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: I started to lose track of time. Days and nights blurred together. The only markers were the meager meals they'd slide through a slot in the door. I tried to keep my mind active, to not lose hope. I'd recite poems I remembered, count backwards from 1000, anything to keep from spiraling into despair. But it was so hard. The isolation was crushing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How does your body feel as you recall this?",
    "Client: My muscles are tense, especially in my shoulders and jaw. I can feel a knot in my stomach. My breathing is shallow, and I have this urge to look over my shoulder, even though I know I'm not there anymore. It's like my body is stuck in that state of constant vigilance.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I know, but it's hard to shake off. I remember one night \u2013 or maybe it was day, I couldn't tell \u2013 when I heard screams from somewhere in the building. It was terrifying. I didn't know if they were coming for me next, what they might do. I pressed myself into the corner, trying to become invisible. The fear was so intense, I thought I might pass out.",
    "Therapist: You're very courageous. Continue.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's difficult, but I'll try. The worst part was the uncertainty. Not knowing when or if I'd be released, what was happening to my family, or even why I was there. I started to doubt everything \u2013 my memories, my sanity. I'd have conversations with myself just to hear a voice. The silence was deafening.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this remarkably well.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It helps to talk about it, even though it's painful. I remember the day they finally released me. The sudden light was blinding, and I could barely walk. The relief was overwhelming, but so was the fear \u2013 fear that it wasn't real, that they'd take me back. It took me a long time to believe I was truly free.",
    "Therapist: That must have been intense. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, but also relieved in a way. Talking about it is hard, but it's like releasing a pressure valve. I still feel some of the fear and anxiety, but it's not as overwhelming as when we started. It's strange \u2013 I feel both drained and somehow lighter.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this in such detail. It's always been this dark cloud hanging over me, something I tried to push away. But facing it like this, it's difficult, but I think it's helping. I feel like I'm starting to regain some control over these memories.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's end here for today.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm glad we did this, even though it was tough. I feel like I've taken a step forward. Thank you for guiding me through it and for your support. I know we have more work to do, but I feel a bit more hopeful now.",
    "Therapist: You've made significant progress. We'll continue next session."
