    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. The memory of the airplane crash feels so vivid now. I can still hear the screams and feel the panic in my chest. It's like I was right back there, you know?",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The smell. God, the smell of fuel and smoke. It's like it's stuck in my nose even now. And the chaos. Everyone was pushing and shoving, trying to get out. I remember thinking, \"This is it. I'm going to die here.\"",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. My heart was racing, and I felt that same helplessness. But... I don't know. It's different now. I'm here, safe, talking about it. It's still awful, but I'm not trapped in that moment anymore.",
    "Therapist: I see. What's different now?",
    "Client: Well, I'm able to talk about it without completely falling apart. That's new. And I can recognize that it's a memory, not happening right now. It's progress, I guess, but it still hurts.",
    "Therapist: That is progress. How does this connect to your day-to-day life?",
    "Client: I've been avoiding anything related to air travel. Even seeing planes in the sky makes me anxious. But going through this memory... maybe it's helping me face it? I'm not sure.",
    "Therapist: Mm. How so?",
    "Client: Well, I used to shut down completely when I thought about the crash. Now, it's still painful, but I can talk about it. Maybe... maybe I can start thinking about flying again someday. Not today, but... someday.",
    "Therapist: That's a big step. What's helping you move forward?",
    "Client: This therapy, I suppose. And my partner's support. They've been so patient. I want to be able to travel with them again without this fear controlling me. It's motivating.",
    "Therapist: I see. How are you coping with the emotions now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a struggle. Sometimes I turn to alcohol to numb the fear and memories. I know it's not healthy, but it feels like the only way to quiet my mind sometimes.",
    "Therapist: Mm. How does that impact your recovery?",
    "Client: I... I guess it's holding me back. The drinking helps in the moment, but then I feel worse afterward. Guilty. And it doesn't really solve anything. The fear and memories are still there when I sober up.",
    "Therapist: What might help instead?",
    "Client: I don't know. Maybe... talking about it more? Like we're doing now. Or finding some way to relax that doesn't involve alcohol. It's hard though. The urge to drink is so strong sometimes.",
    "Therapist: Understandable. What else have you noticed?",
    "Client: I've been having fewer nightmares lately. They're still there, but not every night like before. And when I do have them, I can sometimes remind myself that I'm safe now. It's a small thing, but it feels important.",
    "Therapist: It is important. How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Hopeful, I guess. Like maybe I'm not going to be stuck in this fear forever. But also scared. What if I can't keep making progress? What if I slip back?",
    "Therapist: Valid concerns. What helps you stay motivated?",
    "Client: The thought of getting my life back. Being able to travel, to not flinch every time I hear a loud noise. And honestly, proving to myself that I can overcome this. I want to be stronger than my fear.",
    "Therapist: That's powerful. What's your next step?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to work on finding alternatives to drinking when I'm stressed. Maybe try some of those breathing exercises we talked about? And... maybe consider talking to someone about the substance use. It's hard to admit, but I think I need help with that too.",
    "Therapist: That's insightful. How can I support you?",
    "Client: Just... keep doing this, I guess. Helping me face these memories and make sense of them. And maybe some more concrete strategies for managing anxiety? I want to feel more in control.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Anything else you want to discuss?",
    "Client: I... I'm curious about how long this process might take. I know everyone's different, but... I guess I'm looking for some hope. Some light at the end of the tunnel, you know?",
    "Therapist: Understandable. How do you feel about the progress so far?",
    "Client: It's... it's encouraging. Scary, but encouraging. Each session feels like a small step forward. I just hope I can keep this momentum going. I want to get better, not just for me, but for my partner too. They've been so supportive through all of this.",
    "Therapist: That's great. What's your takeaway from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's that I'm stronger than I thought. Revisiting that memory was terrifying, but I did it. And I'm still here, still fighting. Maybe that means I can face other fears too. It's a small thing, but it feels like a big realization.",
    "Therapist: Excellent insight. How will you carry this forward?",
    "Client: I want to try applying this strength to other areas. Maybe... maybe I can start looking at pictures of airplanes without panicking. Or talk to my partner more about the crash instead of avoiding the topic. Small steps, but in the right direction.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a solid plan. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. This was... intense, but good. Thank you for guiding me through this. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've put down a bit of the weight I've been carrying. I'm nervous about what comes next, but I'm ready to keep working on this.",
    "Therapist: You've done well today. Take care, and we'll continue next time."
