    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you take me through the day you learned about your loved one's severe illness?",
    "Client: Okay... I remember it was a Tuesday morning. I was in my dorm room, getting ready for class. My phone rang, and it was my mom. Her voice sounded... different. Shaky. She said, \"Honey, I need you to sit down.\" I felt this sudden pit in my stomach. I knew something was wrong.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: She told me that Dad had been diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. I... I couldn't breathe. The room started spinning. I kept asking her if she was sure, if maybe there was a mistake. But she just kept crying. I felt like I was going to throw up.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I remember sliding down the wall, sitting on the floor. My roommate came in and saw me. He asked what was wrong, but I couldn't speak. I just handed him the phone. I could hear my mom still talking, but it was like I was underwater. Everything was muffled.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What happened next?",
    "Client: I... I started sobbing. Uncontrollably. My roommate was trying to comfort me, but I pushed him away. I felt like I couldn't breathe. Like the walls were closing in. I ran out of the room, down the hallway. I ended up in the stairwell, just sitting there, crying.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: I don't know how long I sat there. It felt like hours. People would walk by, ask if I was okay, but I couldn't respond. I just kept thinking about my dad. How he'd always been so strong, so healthy. How could this happen? It wasn't fair.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Continue.",
    "Client: I finally called my girlfriend. She came and found me in the stairwell. She held me while I cried. I told her what happened, and she just listened. She didn't try to fix it or say it would be okay. She just... was there.",
    "Therapist: That must have been comforting. How did you feel then?",
    "Client: I felt... lost. Scared. Angry. I kept thinking about all the things my dad might miss. My graduation, my wedding someday. It hit me that he might not be there for any of it. And I felt so guilty for being away at school, for not being there with him.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those feelings. You're doing well expressing them.",
    "Client: I remember my girlfriend suggesting we go back to my room. I didn't want to, but I knew I couldn't stay in the stairwell forever. When we got there, my roommate had packed a bag for me. He'd already looked up flights home. I felt grateful, but also... numb. Like I was watching everything happen to someone else.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory very well. How did the rest of the day unfold?",
    "Client: It's all a blur, really. I remember calling my academic advisor, explaining the situation. She was understanding, said she'd talk to my professors. I booked a flight for that evening. My girlfriend helped me pack, made sure I had everything. I couldn't think straight.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: The drive to the airport was silent. My girlfriend came with me, held my hand the whole way. At the security checkpoint, I broke down again. I didn't want to leave her, didn't want to face what was waiting for me at home. But I knew I had to go.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The flight was torture. Five hours of sitting there, surrounded by people who had no idea my world had just fallen apart. I kept checking my phone, hoping for some message saying it was all a mistake. But there was nothing. Just supportive messages from friends who'd heard the news.",
    "Therapist: You're being very courageous. What happened when you landed?",
    "Client: My mom and sister were waiting at the airport. They both looked... broken. We hugged and cried right there in the middle of the terminal. People were staring, but I didn't care. It finally felt real, seeing their faces. That's when I knew... our lives would never be the same.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. You've done an incredible job reliving this difficult memory.",
    "Client: It's... it's still so hard to talk about. Even now, I can feel that same panic, that same disbelief. I keep thinking about how quickly everything changed. One phone call, and suddenly our whole family was different.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable strength today. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. Sad. But also, maybe a little relieved? It's like... I've been carrying this memory around, trying not to think about it. But talking about it, as hard as it was, feels like I'm not holding it all in anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a very insightful observation. You've made great progress today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I didn't think I could do this. Relive that day. But you're right, I do feel a bit stronger now. Like maybe I can face these memories without falling apart completely.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. You've shown incredible resilience.",
    "Client: I just... I miss him so much. Even though he's still here, it feels like I've already lost him. Every day, I wake up dreading the phone call that... that he's gone. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. You're coping admirably.",
    "Client: I guess I am. It's just... hard to see it sometimes. But talking about it like this, it helps me realize how far I've come. That first day was so overwhelming, but I got through it. Maybe I can get through whatever comes next too.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful perspective. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I am. A little bit, at least. It's still a struggle every day, but maybe it's okay to acknowledge that I'm trying my best. That we all are.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent way to look at it. How are you feeling as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... tired, but somehow lighter. Like I've set down a heavy backpack I've been carrying. I know I'll have to pick it up again, but maybe now I know I can carry it. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. You've done tremendous work today. We'll end here."
