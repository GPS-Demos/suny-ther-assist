    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. That hostage situation... it brought back so many memories. I felt like I was right back there, you know? My heart was racing, and I could feel the sweat on my palms. It's strange how vivid it all becomes.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The fear. It was overwhelming. I remember thinking about my family, wondering if I'd ever see them again. And the helplessness... God, the helplessness. It reminded me of when I was a kid, you know? That same feeling of having no control.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... tough. Really tough. But also, I don't know, maybe a little liberating? Like, I survived it once, and I survived telling it again. It's still painful, but maybe not as scary as I thought it would be.",
    "Therapist: That's a valuable insight. How does this connect to your day-to-day experiences?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... I've been avoiding anything that reminds me of that day. Even small things, like crowded spaces or loud noises. But going through it again, it's like... maybe I don't need to be so afraid all the time? I mean, it's still hard, but...",
    "Therapist: It sounds like you're noticing some changes. Can you elaborate?",
    "Client: Yeah, I... I think I'm starting to see that my reactions now might be connected to what happened then. Like, when I get irritable with my wife or kids, it's not really about them. It's this... constant state of alertness I'm in. Always waiting for something bad to happen.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that realization?",
    "Client: It's... eye-opening, I suppose. And a bit sad, honestly. I've been carrying this weight for so long, and it's affected my family too. But maybe... maybe there's hope? If I can understand it better, maybe I can start to change it?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful reflection. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I think... I want to keep going with this. It's hard, but I feel like I'm finally starting to understand myself better. And maybe, just maybe, I can start to let go of some of this fear. I want to be present for my family, you know? Not always stuck in the past.",
    "Therapist: That's a great goal. How can we support that in our sessions?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to keep facing these memories. As difficult as it is, I can see how it's helping. And maybe we could work on some strategies for when I feel overwhelmed in daily life? I want to be able to recognize when I'm reacting to old fears and... I don't know, have some tools to cope with that.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll focus on that. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... okay. Better than I expected, actually. It's like a weight has been lifted, even if it's just a little bit. I know we have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like there might be light at the end of this tunnel.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What would you like to remember from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... that I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. And that facing these memories, as hard as it is, is helping me understand myself better. Oh, and that my reactions now are often connected to what happened then. That's a big one for me.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: I'm... cautiously optimistic. It's not easy, but I can see the value in it. I want to keep going. For myself, and for my family. They deserve the best version of me, and I think this might be the way to get there.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: No, I think... I think that's enough for today. It's a lot to process, you know? But thank you. I know I don't always say it, but I appreciate your guidance through this. It means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue next week. Take care.",
    "Client: Thank you. I will. See you next week."
