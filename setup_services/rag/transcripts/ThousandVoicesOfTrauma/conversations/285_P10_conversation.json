    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about the car accident, and my stomach's already in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess so. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in my car. It's a sunny afternoon, and I'm driving home from work. The radio's playing some pop song, and I'm tapping my fingers on the steering wheel. Everything seems normal, but there's this weird feeling in my gut, like something's off.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm approaching an intersection. The light's green, so I'm not slowing down. Then... oh God... I see this blur from the right. It's a red truck, and it's not stopping. My heart starts racing, and I... I can't...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. Take a deep breath. Where are you on the SUDS scale?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 7? It's getting intense.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Right, okay. So, this truck is barreling towards me. I try to swerve, but it's too late. There's this deafening crash, and my world just... explodes. Glass is flying everywhere. The airbag slams into my face, and I taste blood. Everything's spinning, and I can't... I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. My hands are shaking. I... I feel trapped. The car's crumpled around me, and I can smell gasoline. I'm terrified it's going to explode.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm trying to move, but my leg is pinned. There's so much pain. I hear people shouting outside, but it sounds far away, like I'm underwater. I'm... I'm scared I'm going to die here.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: I know it is. You're very brave. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay. I'm... I'm still in the car. My vision's blurry, but I can see smoke. Someone's at my window, telling me help is coming. I want to respond, but I can't find my voice. I just keep thinking about my wife, wondering if I'll ever see her again.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The smell. It's overwhelming - burnt rubber, gasoline, and something metallic. Probably blood. I hear sirens in the distance, getting closer. My whole body's shaking now, and I feel... I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm struggling. My heart's pounding, and I feel like I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: Let's take a moment. Focus on your breathing. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: *breathes slowly* Okay... okay, I think I'm okay to continue.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: The firefighters arrive. They're using some kind of tool to cut through the car. The noise is terrible - screeching metal, voices shouting. I'm fading in and out of consciousness. Every time I open my eyes, there's more chaos.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I... I keep wondering if this is it. If this is how I die. I'm angry at the other driver, scared for myself, worried about my family. It's all jumbled up.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to process. How's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's still high... maybe a 7 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: They finally get me out of the car. The sunlight is blinding. I'm on a stretcher, being lifted into an ambulance. The paramedics are talking, but I can't focus on what they're saying. Everything hurts. I'm... I'm terrified.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your surroundings?",
    "Client: It's chaotic. There are flashing lights everywhere. I catch glimpses of other cars, bystanders. Someone's crying. I... I realize it might be me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens in the ambulance?",
    "Client: They're hooking me up to machines. I hear beeping, feel needles in my arm. The paramedic is asking me questions, but I'm struggling to answer. My mouth is dry, and I taste blood. I'm shivering, even though it's warm.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, recalling this?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. My palms are sweating, and my stomach's in knots.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Okay. In the ambulance, I keep fading in and out. Every time I open my eyes, there's a moment of panic before I remember where I am. The pain is... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking about my wife. Will I see her again? What if I'm paralyzed? What if I can't work? It's like my whole future is suddenly uncertain.",
    "Therapist: Those are understandable concerns. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe a 6?",
    "Therapist: Good. You're doing great. What happens when you reach the hospital?",
    "Client: It's a blur of activity. I'm wheeled into the ER, surrounded by doctors and nurses. They're cutting off my clothes, shining lights in my eyes. I hear them talking about internal bleeding, possible head trauma. I'm... I'm terrified.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: Pain. So much pain. My whole body feels broken. I'm cold, shaking. I can't stop the tears. I want to ask what's happening, but I can't find my voice.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: They're moving me again. More lights, more voices. Someone mentions surgery. I'm trying to stay awake, but it's getting harder. I... I think I'm going under anesthesia. Everything's fading...",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's tough. My heart's racing, and I feel a bit dizzy.",
    "Therapist: Let's pause for a moment. Take some deep breaths.",
    "Client: *breathes slowly* Okay... I think I'm ready to continue.",
    "Therapist: Alright. What's the next thing you remember?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm waking up in a hospital room. Everything's hazy. I hear the steady beep of machines. My body feels heavy, like it's not my own. I try to move, but it hurts too much.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm confused. Scared. Did I survive? How bad is it? I want to call out, but my throat's so dry. I manage to turn my head, and I see my wife. She's asleep in a chair next to the bed. I feel... relief, but also guilt. What have I put her through?",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around a 5, I think. Talking about seeing my wife... it helps.",
    "Therapist: That's good. What happens next?",
    "Client: A nurse comes in. She sees I'm awake and starts checking my vitals. She's explaining things, but I'm struggling to focus. I catch words like \"lucky\" and \"recovery.\" My wife wakes up, and she's crying, holding my hand.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm overwhelmed. Grateful to be alive, but also scared about what's ahead. The pain is intense, but having my wife there... it grounds me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. How are you feeling now, talking about this?",
    "Client: It's... it's still hard. But I feel like I can breathe a bit easier. Like maybe I can get through this.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. What do you notice in the room right now?",
    "Client: I... I can feel the chair under me. I hear the hum of the air conditioning. I can smell your coffee.",
    "Therapist: Good. You've done incredibly well today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted, but... also kind of relieved? Like I've let go of something heavy.",
    "Therapist: That's often how people feel after these sessions. You've shown a lot of courage. Is there anything else you want to share before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm okay. This was tough, but... I think it helped. Thank you.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, John. You've made significant progress today. Let's end here and discuss how you're feeling overall."
