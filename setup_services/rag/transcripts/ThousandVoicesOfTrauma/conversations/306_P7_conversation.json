    "Therapist: Welcome, Amir. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit anxious, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about the cyber bullying incident, and it's making me nervous.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Thanks. I guess I should start talking about what happened, right?",
    "Therapist: Whenever you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... It was about six months ago. I had just started a new job, and I was excited to connect with my colleagues on social media. One day, I noticed some comments on my posts that were... not very nice. At first, I tried to ignore them, thinking it was just harmless teasing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: But it got worse. They started making memes with my profile picture, mocking my accent, my clothes, even my name. It felt like suddenly everyone at work was in on this joke, and I was the punchline. I remember sitting at my desk, seeing notification after notification, each one a new insult or cruel joke.",
    "Therapist: That must have been very difficult. Keep going.",
    "Client: It was. I felt so alone and exposed. I couldn't concentrate on my work. Every time I heard laughter in the office, I was sure they were laughing at me. I started having trouble sleeping, constantly checking my phone, afraid of what new humiliation I might find.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Amir. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: I... I'm sorry, this is harder than I thought. My heart is racing just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I remember one day, I overheard two colleagues talking about a particularly nasty post about me. They were laughing, saying how \"that Middle Eastern guy can't take a joke.\" It hit me then how much my background played into their bullying. I felt so... othered. Like I didn't belong.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. Keep going.",
    "Client: I started isolating myself. I stopped going to team lunches, avoided the break room. I even considered quitting my job. The worst part was, I felt like I couldn't tell anyone. I was ashamed, you know? A grown man being bullied online... it felt pathetic.",
    "Therapist: It's not pathetic at all. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: Thanks. I... I think what hurt the most was feeling like I was that neglected child again. Like no one cared enough to step in, to say something. It brought back all those feelings of being invisible, unwanted.",
    "Therapist: I understand. You're doing an excellent job expressing this.",
    "Client: It's hard not to feel angry now, thinking about it. Angry at them, but also angry at myself for not standing up to them. I keep wondering if I had just confronted them, maybe it would have stopped.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. Continue.",
    "Client: I finally broke down and told my roommate what was happening. He was furious on my behalf and helped me document everything. We reported it to HR, and eventually, the bullying stopped. But the damage was done. I still struggle with trusting colleagues, always wondering if they're laughing at me behind my back.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Drained, but... also a bit relieved. I've never really talked about it in this much detail before. It's still painful, but maybe a little less so now that I've shared it.",
    "Therapist: You've done remarkably well, Amir. We'll end here for today."
