    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. My heart is still racing a bit. It's like I'm back there, you know? The memory feels so fresh now. I can still hear the screeching of tires, the sound of metal crunching. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What emotions are coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: Fear, definitely fear. But also... anger? I'm angry that this happened to me. And there's this... this deep sadness. I lost so much that day. My sense of safety, my confidence. It's like the world became a different place after that accident.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How does that anger and sadness feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a heaviness in my chest. My shoulders feel tense, and there's this knot in my stomach. I feel... I feel like I can't catch my breath sometimes. It's as if my body is still bracing for impact, even though it happened years ago.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why me?\" Why did this have to happen to me? And then I feel guilty for thinking that because I survived, and others... others didn't. I think about how different my life would be if I had just left the house five minutes later that day. It's... it's exhausting, this constant replaying of events.",
    "Therapist: How does sharing these thoughts make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a bit relieving. I've kept these thoughts bottled up for so long. I was afraid that if I started talking about it, I'd fall apart completely. But now, it's like... like I'm releasing some of the pressure. It still hurts, but it's a different kind of hurt. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much this accident has affected every part of my life. My relationships, my work, even how I see myself. It's like there's a before and after, and I'm still trying to bridge that gap. I want to feel whole again, but I'm not sure how to get there.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How does it feel to recognize that impact?",
    "Client: It's... it's bittersweet, I suppose. On one hand, it's painful to see how much I've struggled. But on the other, it helps me understand why I've been feeling the way I have. It's like... like I'm finally acknowledging the full extent of what happened to me.",
    "Therapist: Mm. What do you think this realization means for your recovery?",
    "Client: I... I think it means I need to be more patient with myself. I've been so frustrated with my progress, or lack thereof. But now I see that what I went through was truly life-changing. Maybe... maybe it's okay that it's taking time to heal. Perhaps I need to be kinder to myself in this process.",
    "Therapist: That's a compassionate perspective. How does that feel?",
    "Client: It feels... liberating, in a way. Like I'm giving myself permission to heal at my own pace. But it's also scary. I've been so hard on myself for so long, I'm not sure I know how to be gentle. It's going to take some practice, I think.",
    "Therapist: What might that practice look like for you?",
    "Client: I... I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it means taking more breaks when I'm feeling overwhelmed. Or talking to my family about what I'm going through instead of trying to handle it all on my own. Perhaps it's about acknowledging my small victories instead of always focusing on how far I still have to go.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like valuable ideas. What else comes to mind?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to work on accepting that I'm not the same person I was before the accident. For so long, I've been trying to get back to who I was. But maybe... maybe that's not possible. Maybe I need to focus on who I am now, and who I want to become.",
    "Therapist: How does that shift in perspective feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's both scary and exciting. Scary because it means letting go of this image I've been holding onto. But exciting because... well, because it opens up possibilities. If I'm not trying to be my old self, maybe I can be something... someone... even better.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... hopeful, I think. For the first time in a long while. It's like... like I can see a path forward. It's still hazy, and I know it won't be easy, but it's there. And that... that means everything.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. How are you feeling about our session today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm grateful. This was hard, reliving that memory. But I feel like I've made some real progress. Like I understand myself a bit better now. It's exhausting, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've done some important work today.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad you found it helpful. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I don't think so. I feel... I feel drained, but in a good way. Like I've released something that's been weighing on me. I know we still have a lot of work to do, but for now, I think I just need to sit with these realizations for a while.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Let's end here for today."
