    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Patel?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. It's strange, reliving that moment in the hospital. The beeping machines, the smell of disinfectant... it all came rushing back. I could almost feel the cold metal of the bed rails under my fingers.",
    "Therapist: What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The helplessness. I felt so vulnerable, lying there, not understanding what the doctors were saying. It reminded me of how I feel now, with all this technology. I don't understand it, and it makes me feel... lost.",
    "Therapist: How does that connect to your current experiences?",
    "Client: Well, it's... it's like the cyber bullying. I don't understand how it works, but I know it's hurting me. My grandchildren tried to explain Facebook, but it's all so confusing. And then these nasty messages started appearing. I feel as helpless as I did in that hospital bed.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful connection. How did sharing this memory impact you?",
    "Client: It was... difficult. My heart was racing, just like it does when I see a new message online. But... there's also a sense of relief. Like I'm not alone with this memory anymore.",
    "Therapist: What emotions came up for you?",
    "Client: Fear, definitely. Anger too. I'm angry that I feel so powerless, both then and now. And... shame. I feel like I should be able to handle this better, at my age.",
    "Therapist: How do these emotions relate to your everyday life?",
    "Client: They're... they're always there, lurking. The fear makes me avoid my computer. The anger makes me snap at my husband. And the shame... it keeps me from reaching out for help.",
    "Therapist: What did you learn about yourself today?",
    "Client: I... I think I realized how much that hospital experience affected me. It's not just about the cyber bullying. It's about feeling out of control, feeling like I don't belong in this modern world.",
    "Therapist: How might this insight help you moving forward?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I can be a bit kinder to myself. Recognize that it's okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes. And perhaps... perhaps I can ask for help more often, without feeling ashamed.",
    "Therapist: That's a valuable takeaway. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's hard, no doubt about it. But... I think it's helping. I want to understand myself better, to not let these fears control me. If this can help me face that computer without panic, then... then it's worth it.",
    "Therapist: What support do you need for our next session?",
    "Client: I... I think I might need to bring my husband next time. He's been so patient, but I haven't really explained what I'm going through. Maybe if he understands, it'll be easier for both of us.",
    "Therapist: That's a great idea. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm starting to see a way forward. It's like... like I'm finally starting to make sense of the jumbled mess in my head.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work, Mrs. Patel. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, I'll be here. Thank you again, doctor."
