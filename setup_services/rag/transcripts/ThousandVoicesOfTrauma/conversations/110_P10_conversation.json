    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is dreading it. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. How would you rate your distress from 0 to 100?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 60 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I guess so. Yeah, let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day at work.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm at my desk. It's just a normal Tuesday morning. I can smell the coffee from the break room. My coworker, Jake, is laughing about something across the room. I'm working on a report, feeling a bit stressed about the deadline.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's this... rumbling. At first, I think it's a truck outside, but it keeps getting louder. The floor starts to shake. I hear someone yell, \"Earthquake!\" and then... oh god... (voice trembles)",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Stay with it. What do you see?",
    "Client: Everything's moving. My computer monitor falls off the desk. I can hear glass breaking somewhere. People are screaming. I'm frozen... I can't move. I'm so scared.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I feel like I can't breathe. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What's happening now?",
    "Client: The shaking is getting worse. I finally snap out of it and try to get under my desk, but I slip and hit my head on the corner. It hurts so bad. I can taste blood in my mouth.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm going to die. I can't see Jake anymore. Where is he? The ceiling tiles are falling. There's so much dust, I can barely see. I'm coughing. I'm terrified.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 85. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: I know it's difficult. You're very brave. Take another deep breath and continue.",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) The shaking finally stops. It feels like it lasted forever, but I think it was only a minute or two. I crawl out from under the desk. The office is destroyed. I can hear people crying and calling for help.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I'm stumbling around, calling out for Jake. My head is throbbing. I see blood on my hand when I touch it. I find Jake... he's... he's pinned under a fallen bookcase. He's not moving.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel helpless. Guilty. Why him and not me? I'm trying to lift the bookcase, but it's too heavy. I'm yelling for help, but everyone seems too shocked to respond.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Keep going.",
    "Client: Someone finally comes to help. We manage to lift the bookcase off Jake. He's breathing, but barely. His leg looks... wrong. I'm holding his hand, telling him it'll be okay, but I don't know if it will be.",
    "Therapist: What happens after that?",
    "Client: It's all a blur. The paramedics arrive. They take Jake away. I'm sitting on the curb outside, wrapped in a shock blanket. My boss is trying to talk to me, but I can't focus on what he's saying. I keep seeing Jake's face, hearing the sound of things crashing around us.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, in your body?",
    "Client: I feel nauseous. My hands won't stop shaking. I can't stop crying.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're safe here in the present.",
    "Client: (takes several deep breaths) Okay... I'm... I'm here.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's still pretty high... maybe 80.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing really well. Can you continue?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. After a while, they tell us to go home. But I can't drive. My coworker, Lisa, offers to take me. The whole way home, I'm just... numb. I keep seeing flashes of Jake, of the ceiling falling. I can still feel the ground shaking.",
    "Therapist: What happens when you get home?",
    "Client: My husband is there. He looks so worried. I just... I collapse into his arms. I can't stop sobbing. I feel so guilty for being okay when Jake was hurt so badly. I keep thinking I should have done something sooner, should have helped him faster.",
    "Therapist: Those are common thoughts after a traumatic event. How does your body feel as you remember this?",
    "Client: Tense. So tense. My shoulders are up to my ears. My jaw hurts from clenching it.",
    "Therapist: Try to relax those muscles. You're safe now. What happens next?",
    "Client: The next few days are a blur. I can't sleep. Every little sound makes me jump. I keep having nightmares about being trapped under rubble. I can't bring myself to go back to work. Every time I think about it, I start panicking.",
    "Therapist: How does that fear manifest in your body?",
    "Client: My chest gets tight. It's hard to breathe. My palms get sweaty. Sometimes I feel like I'm going to throw up.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Sarah. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe 70?",
    "Therapist: That's good. Can you tell me more about the days following the earthquake?",
    "Client: I barely leave the house. I'm constantly checking the news for aftershocks. I feel so useless, so weak. My husband tries to help, but I push him away. I can't stop thinking about Jake, wondering if he's okay. But I'm too scared to call the hospital and find out.",
    "Therapist: What do you think that fear is about?",
    "Client: I... I guess I'm afraid it'll be bad news. That he didn't make it, or that he's permanently injured. And that it's somehow my fault for not helping him sooner.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does carrying that guilt feel?",
    "Client: Heavy. So heavy. It's like this weight on my chest that never goes away.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I feel... angry. At myself, at the world. Why did this have to happen? Why couldn't I do more? I keep replaying that moment over and over, thinking of what I could have done differently.",
    "Therapist: That's a natural response. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. Emotionally exhausted. But... also a little lighter? Like talking about it has released some of the pressure.",
    "Therapist: That's good. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 55, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's take a few deep breaths together.",
    "Client: (breathes deeply) Okay. I... I think I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: You did really well today, Sarah. How are you feeling about the session?",
    "Client: It was hard. Really hard. But... I think it helped? I feel like I understand my reactions a bit better now.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. We'll continue to work through this. Remember, healing takes time.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I'm ready to try going back to work soon. Maybe not full time yet, but... it's a start.",
    "Therapist: That's a big step. We'll talk more about that in our next session. For now, remember to use the coping strategies we've discussed.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you for helping me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Sarah. You've shown incredible strength today. We'll end here for now. Take care of yourself this week."
