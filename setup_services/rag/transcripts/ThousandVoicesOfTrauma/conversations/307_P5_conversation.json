    "Therapist: Welcome back, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit anxious, to be honest. I know we've been working towards this imaginal exposure session, and while I understand its importance, I can't help but feel nervous about revisiting those memories of being imprisoned.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... I've spent so long trying to push those memories away. The thought of deliberately bringing them to the surface is frightening. I worry about losing control or getting overwhelmed by the emotions. And part of me wonders if it's really necessary to go through all of that again.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How can I help?",
    "Client: I guess I just need some reassurance. Can you explain again why we're doing this and what exactly it will involve? I want to be prepared, but I'm also scared of what might come up.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Imaginal exposure helps process trauma memories. We'll go slowly, and I'll guide you. Thoughts?",
    "Client: That makes sense, I suppose. But what if I panic or can't handle it? I've had anxiety attacks before when thinking about my time in prison, and I'm worried that might happen again. Will you be able to help me if things get too intense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll take breaks if needed. You're in control. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's somewhat comforting. I appreciate knowing I can stop if it becomes too much. I guess I'm also wondering about the after-effects. Will I be okay to drive home after the session? Should I plan for some downtime afterward?",
    "Therapist: Good questions. Plan for rest after. Any other concerns?",
    "Client: I'm worried about how this might affect my sleep. Nightmares have been an issue for me, especially when I think about the neglect and isolation I experienced. Will this make them worse? And how long will it take before I start seeing improvements in my PTSD symptoms?",
    "Therapist: Nightmares may temporarily increase. We'll monitor and address this. Progress varies, but many see improvements soon.",
    "Client: Okay, that's helpful to know. I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be. It's strange, feeling scared but also hopeful. Part of me knows this could really help, even if it's difficult. Can you walk me through exactly what we'll be doing in today's session?",
    "Therapist: We'll start with relaxation, then gradually revisit the memory. You'll describe it aloud. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm nervous, but I trust you, and I'm committed to this process. I know it won't be easy, but if it can help me move past this trauma and reduce my anxiety, it'll be worth it. Okay, let's do this. Where should we start?",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Let's begin with deep breathing. Close your eyes when ready."
