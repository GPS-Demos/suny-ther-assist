    "Therapist: Welcome back, John. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares lately about the home invasion, and I'm not sure I'm ready to talk about it in detail.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Can you tell me what you know about it?",
    "Client: Not much, to be honest. I know it involves talking about the trauma, but that's about it. It sounds pretty scary, actually. I'm worried it might make things worse.",
    "Therapist: That's a common concern. Let me explain the process and its benefits.",
    "Client: Okay, I'm listening. But I have to admit, my heart's already racing just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Imaginal exposure helps by processing the memory. It may be uncomfortable initially but reduces symptoms over time.",
    "Client: That makes sense, I suppose. But what if I can't handle it? What if I completely fall apart during the session?",
    "Therapist: I'll be here to support you throughout. We can pause anytime you need. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It's reassuring to know you'll be here. I'm still scared, but I think I'm willing to give it a try. Can you tell me more about what exactly we'll be doing?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the home invasion in detail, in the present tense. I'll guide you through it.",
    "Client: In the present tense? That sounds intense. Will I have to close my eyes? I'm not sure I can do that without panicking.",
    "Therapist: Closing your eyes is optional. The goal is to engage with the memory fully. What concerns you most?",
    "Client: I think what scares me the most is feeling like I'm back there, helpless and terrified. I've spent so long trying to avoid thinking about it. What if I can't pull myself out of that feeling?",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are normal. We'll work through them together. Your safety here is my priority.",
    "Client: Okay, I appreciate that. I guess I'm also worried about how this might affect me afterwards. Will I be able to function normally after the session?",
    "Therapist: It's common to feel drained after. We'll discuss coping strategies for post-session care. Any other concerns?",
    "Client: I'm wondering about the long-term effects. How many sessions of this will I need to do? And how will I know if it's working?",
    "Therapist: The number of sessions varies. We'll monitor your progress regularly. Any improvements you've noticed so far?",
    "Client: Well, I have been sleeping a bit better since we started therapy, and I've managed to go grocery shopping without having a panic attack. I suppose that's progress, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Those are significant improvements. Imaginal exposure aims to build on that progress.",
    "Client: That's encouraging to hear. I'm still nervous, but I think I'm ready to give this a try. Can you walk me through exactly what you want me to do?",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your courage. We'll start slowly, focusing on one part of the memory. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do this. I trust you, and I really want to get better. I'm tired of living in fear all the time.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is admirable. Let's start. Remember, we can pause anytime. Begin when you're ready."
