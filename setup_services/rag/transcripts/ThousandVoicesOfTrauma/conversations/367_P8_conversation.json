    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart's still racing, and I feel... I feel like I'm back there, you know? Back in that house, with the silence and the emptiness. It's like I can still smell the musty air and feel the cold seeping through my clothes.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: (exhales slowly) It's... it's this deep sadness, I think. And anger. I'm angry at my parents for not being there, for always being too busy or too caught up in their own lives to notice me. I remember sitting in my room for hours, just waiting for someone to come and check on me, to ask how my day was. But no one ever did.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like a knot in my stomach, tight and hot. My jaw is clenched, and I... I want to scream or throw something. But at the same time, I feel so small and helpless, like that little girl who couldn't understand why her parents didn't love her enough to pay attention.",
    "Therapist: And what thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"What did I do wrong?\" Even now, at 54, I still wonder if there was something I could have done differently to make them care. And then I feel guilty for being angry at them. They weren't abusive, they just... weren't there. And then I think about my own kids, and I worry that I've done the same thing to them without realizing it.",
    "Therapist: How does that connect to your recent divorce?",
    "Client: Oh, God... (voice breaks) It's like history repeating itself, isn't it? I chose a partner who couldn't really be there for me emotionally. And now I'm alone again, just like when I was a child. It's this cycle of abandonment, and I don't know how to break it.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I need to feel seen. To know that someone understands and cares. That I'm not invisible or unworthy of love. I've spent so much of my life trying to be perfect, to be worthy of attention and affection. But it never seems to be enough.",
    "Therapist: You are seen. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: There's this... heaviness in my chest. Like I'm carrying all these years of loneliness and disappointment. But there's also a tiny spark of... I don't know, maybe hope? Like maybe by facing this, by really looking at it, I can start to change things. I don't want to keep living in fear of being abandoned.",
    "Therapist: How does that spark of hope feel?",
    "Client: It's small, but it's there. Like a warm little glow in the middle of all this darkness. It makes me think that maybe, just maybe, I can learn to love myself even if others couldn't. That I can be the person who shows up for myself, who checks in and cares.",
    "Therapist: Mm. What would that look like?",
    "Client: I... I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it means being kinder to myself, not always expecting perfection. Maybe it means reaching out to friends more, building my own support system. And with my kids... (pauses) I think I need to make sure they know how much I love them, how important they are to me. I don't want them to ever feel the way I did.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now compared to when we started?",
    "Client: It's... it's strange. I still feel raw and vulnerable, but there's also this sense of... I don't know, maybe clarity? Like I'm seeing these patterns in my life for the first time. It hurts, but it also feels like maybe this is the first step towards something better. I'm exhausted, but I also feel like I've accomplished something important.",
    "Therapist: What's one thing you want to remember from this session?",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) I think... I want to remember that it's okay to feel angry about what happened to me. That my feelings are valid, and that recognizing them doesn't make me a bad person. And that maybe, just maybe, I can start to heal that little girl who felt so alone. It's not going to be easy, but I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. How would you like to close our session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to take a moment to just breathe and ground myself. Maybe we could do a quick relaxation exercise? I feel like I need to center myself before I go back out into the world after all of this.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's do that."
