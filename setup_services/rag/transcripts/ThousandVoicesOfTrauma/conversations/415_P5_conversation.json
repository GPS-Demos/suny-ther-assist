    "Therapist: Mrs. Patel, today we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. I've been dreading this part. The idea of reliving that time when I was so ill... it's frightening. I remember feeling so helpless, like my body was betraying me. And the way my family reacted... it was as if I was already gone. Do we really have to do this?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. Can you tell me more about your hesitations?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... I've spent so long trying to forget about that time. The hospital stays, the treatments, the pain... And the emotional toll it took on me. My children were so young then, and I felt like I was failing them by being sick. I'm worried that if I revisit those memories, I'll fall back into that dark place. I've worked hard to move past it.",
    "Therapist: I understand. How do you think facing these memories might help?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe it could help me process what happened? Sometimes I still have nightmares about being in the hospital, feeling trapped and alone. And there are days when I avoid anything that reminds me of that time. It's exhausting, always trying to push those thoughts away. Perhaps confronting them might give me some peace?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. Shall we discuss what to expect during the exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I'd like to know what I'm getting into. Will it be very intense? I'm worried about becoming overwhelmed. You see, at my age, strong emotions can be quite taxing. And living with my elderly parents, I try to maintain a calm demeanor for their sake. I don't want to upset them if I become too distressed.",
    "Therapist: I'll guide you through it gently. We can pause anytime. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's somewhat reassuring. I appreciate your patience with me. It's not easy opening up about these things. Growing up, we were taught to keep our problems to ourselves. But I've learned that sometimes, sharing the burden can make it lighter. I just hope I can get through this without breaking down completely.",
    "Therapist: Your strength is admirable. Remember, this process aims to help you heal.",
    "Client: Thank you for saying that. It means a lot to hear it. I've always tried to be strong, especially after my husband passed away. But sometimes I wonder if I'm strong enough for this. The depression makes everything harder. Some days, just getting out of bed feels like a monumental task. But I'm here, aren't I? That must count for something.",
    "Therapist: It absolutely does. Your presence shows incredible courage. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm ready. Or as ready as I'll ever be. Just promise me you'll be here with me through it all? I know it's your job, but having your support means everything right now. It reminds me of when my mother would hold my hand during thunderstorms when I was a child. I could use that comfort now."
