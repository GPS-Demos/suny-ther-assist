    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares lately about that incident with the police. It's making me jumpy and irritable.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's discuss our plan for today.",
    "Client: Alright. What exactly are we going to do? You mentioned something about imaginal exposure last time, but I'm not sure I fully grasp what that means.",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit your traumatic experience through guided imagination. How does that sound?",
    "Client: Honestly? It sounds terrifying. I've been trying so hard to avoid thinking about it. Won't this make things worse?",
    "Therapist: It's a common concern. However, this process can help reduce PTSD symptoms. Shall I explain more?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I want to understand why we're doing this if it's going to be so difficult.",
    "Therapist: By facing the memory in a safe environment, we can process it more effectively. This can lessen its impact over time.",
    "Client: I see. But what if I panic? Or can't handle it? I'm worried I might fall apart completely.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace, and I'll be here to support you throughout. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It's a little reassuring, I suppose. But I'm still scared. What exactly will happen during this... imaginal exposure?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the event in detail, in the present tense. I'll guide you through it. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: That sounds intense. Will I have to describe everything? Even the parts that are really hard to talk about?",
    "Therapist: Yes, but remember, you're in control. We can pause anytime. Your safety is our priority.",
    "Client: Okay. I appreciate that. I'm still nervous, but I trust you. I want to get better, to stop feeling so haunted by this. How long will this process take?",
    "Therapist: It varies for each person. We'll work at your pace. Your courage is admirable. Any other questions?",
    "Client: I think I understand better now. Thank you for explaining. I'm scared, but I'm also... hopeful? Maybe this will help me move forward. I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: Your readiness is a big step. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do this. I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Thank you for being here with me through this."
