    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. The memory of that day in the office, when my boss berated me in front of everyone... it's so vivid now. I can almost smell the stale coffee and feel the scratchy fabric of that awful office chair.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: Shame. Definitely shame. I feel so small, so... insignificant. Like I'm back there, shrinking into myself, wishing I could disappear. It's not just about that one incident, you know? It's like it confirms every negative thought I've ever had about myself.",
    "Therapist: How does that shame feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's heavy. Like a weight pressing down on my chest. My shoulders are tense, and I notice I'm clenching my jaw. There's this knot in my stomach that won't go away. It's almost like my body is trying to curl in on itself, to protect me somehow.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are accompanying these physical sensations?",
    "Client: I keep hearing my boss's words echoing in my head. \"Useless,\" \"incompetent,\" \"waste of space.\" But... but it's not just his voice anymore. It's like those words have become my own inner critic. I'm questioning every decision I've ever made, wondering if I've been fooling myself all along. Maybe I don't deserve success or happiness.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts relate to your past experiences?",
    "Client: (long pause) It... it reminds me of my childhood. My parents were always so busy, so distracted. I felt invisible most of the time. When they did pay attention, it was often to criticize. This feeling at work, it's like I'm that small child again, desperately seeking approval but never quite measuring up.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about that connection?",
    "Client: I... wow. I've never really thought about it like that before. It's like I'm carrying this... this template of unworthiness with me everywhere I go. At work, in my relationships... I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop, for someone to realize I'm not good enough.",
    "Therapist: How does recognizing this pattern make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of things. There's sadness, definitely. Grief for that child who never felt truly seen or valued. But there's also... I don't know, maybe a glimmer of hope? Like, if I can see this pattern, maybe I can start to change it. It's not just about that one incident at work anymore. It's about a lifetime of feeling inadequate.",
    "Therapist: What's that glimmer of hope telling you?",
    "Client: That maybe... maybe I'm not actually inadequate. That perhaps these feelings aren't facts. It's hard to believe, but... what if my boss's words say more about him than they do about me? What if my parents' neglect wasn't because I was unlovable, but because they had their own issues? It's a scary thought, in a way. It's almost easier to believe I'm the problem than to accept that sometimes bad things just happen.",
    "Therapist: How does entertaining that possibility feel?",
    "Client: Uncomfortable. Really uncomfortable. But also... freeing? Like I'm standing on the edge of something big. If I'm not inherently flawed, then... then I have choices. I can learn to see myself differently. I can set boundaries. I can... I can heal. It's terrifying and exciting all at once.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you consider these new possibilities?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel a bit lightheaded, actually. Like the world has shifted slightly on its axis. There's a part of me that wants to cling to the old beliefs - they're familiar, at least. But there's another part that's eager to explore this new perspective. I'm realizing how much energy I've spent trying to prove my worth, always on guard against criticism. What if I could redirect that energy towards growth and self-compassion instead?",
    "Therapist: How might your life look different if you embraced that change?",
    "Client: (deep breath) I think... I think I'd be kinder to myself, for starters. Maybe I'd take more risks at work, share my ideas without constantly second-guessing myself. In my relationships, I might be more open, more vulnerable. Instead of always trying to be what I think others want me to be, I could focus on figuring out who I actually am and what I want. It's... it's both exciting and overwhelming to consider.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you could take in that direction?",
    "Client: I... I think I could start by challenging my inner critic. When I hear those negative thoughts, instead of just accepting them, I could pause and ask myself if they're really true. Maybe even try to respond with kindness, the way I would to a friend. It sounds simple, but I know it won't be easy. Still, it feels like a place to start.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about this insight?",
    "Client: I feel... cautiously optimistic. There's still a lot of work to do, and I know there will be setbacks. But for the first time in a long time, I feel like there's a way forward. Like maybe I'm not doomed to always feel this way. It's scary, but it's also... empowering. I'm grateful for this session. It's given me a lot to think about.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to remember from today's session?",
    "Client: I want to remember that my worth isn't determined by one person's opinion or one bad experience. That these feelings of inadequacy have roots, but they don't have to define my future. And that healing is possible, even if it's challenging. I want to hold onto that glimmer of hope we talked about. It feels fragile right now, but I think it could grow stronger with time and practice.",
    "Therapist: How do you want to care for yourself after this intense session?",
    "Client: I think I need some quiet time to process everything we've discussed. Maybe I'll take a walk in the park near my house. Being in nature always helps me feel grounded. And I might journal a bit, try to capture some of these insights before they slip away. I know it's important not to push myself too hard after these sessions, so I'll try to be gentle with myself for the rest of the day.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful plan. We'll end here for today."
