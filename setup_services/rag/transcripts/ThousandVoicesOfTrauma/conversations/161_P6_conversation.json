    "Therapist: Welcome back. Today, we'll continue our work on the car accident trauma. Are you ready to begin the imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control. Let's start with your baseline SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10. My stomach feels a bit tight, but I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day. Describe what you see and feel.",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in my car, driving home from work. It's raining heavily, and I can barely see through the windshield. The wipers are going frantically, but it's not helping much. I'm gripping the steering wheel tightly, my knuckles turning white. I can feel my heart starting to race...",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe a 6? My palms are getting sweaty, and I can feel my breathing getting faster.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: Suddenly, I see headlights coming towards me. They're... they're in my lane! I try to swerve, but the road is so slippery. I can hear the screeching of tires, my own scream... Oh god, the impact. It's like time slows down. The airbag deploys, and there's this deafening crunch of metal...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. My chest feels so tight, and I'm shaking. I can almost smell the burnt rubber and feel the pain all over again.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep going if you can.",
    "Client: After the crash, everything's quiet except for the rain and my own ragged breathing. I'm disoriented, and there's a ringing in my ears. I taste blood in my mouth. I'm trying to move, but my seatbelt is jammed. I'm panicking, thinking the car might catch fire...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I... I'm at a 9. My heart is pounding so hard, and I feel dizzy. It's like I'm right back there, trapped in the car.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here with me, safe in my office.",
    "Client: Right... right. I'm trying to focus on that. Um, in the memory, I hear sirens in the distance. Someone's at my window, asking if I'm okay. But I can't respond. I'm just... frozen. The rain is still pouring in through the shattered window...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still a 9. I feel so helpless and scared, just like I did then.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're processing a difficult memory. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The paramedics arrive. They're talking to me, but their voices sound muffled. I feel them cutting away my seatbelt, carefully moving me onto a backboard. The rain is hitting my face as they take me out of the car. I'm shivering, both from cold and shock...",
    "Therapist: How about now? What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down a bit. Maybe a 7? I'm still shaky, but I can feel myself here in the room more.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're doing excellent work. Keep going.",
    "Client: In the ambulance, everything's a blur of lights and voices. I keep thinking about the other driver, wondering if they're okay. The guilt is overwhelming, even though I know it wasn't my fault. At the hospital, there are so many tests, so many questions. I feel lost and alone...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating at this point?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6 now. I'm feeling drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved? Like I've faced something I've been avoiding for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. You've shown great courage today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's... it's hard, but I think it's helping. I feel like I can talk about it now without completely falling apart.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm back down to about a 4. I feel exhausted, but also... lighter somehow. Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for too long.",
    "Therapist: You've done remarkable work today. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves before we end."
