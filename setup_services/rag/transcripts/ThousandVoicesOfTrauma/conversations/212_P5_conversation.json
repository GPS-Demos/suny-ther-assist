    "Therapist: Welcome, Priya. Today we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of reliving those moments of being imprisoned... it's scary. I'm not sure I'm ready for it.",
    "Therapist: Your apprehension is completely normal. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried that revisiting those memories will be too overwhelming. What if I can't handle it? What if it makes my anxiety worse? I've worked so hard to keep those memories at bay, and now you're asking me to bring them to the surface. It feels counterintuitive.",
    "Therapist: I understand. How do you think this might help?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe it could help me process what happened? But I'm still scared. It's like I've built this wall around those memories, and now we're about to tear it down. What if I can't rebuild it?",
    "Therapist: That's a valid concern. Let me explain how this works and why it's beneficial.",
    "Client: Okay, I'm listening. But please understand, this is really hard for me. Being neglected and then imprisoned... it's not something I talk about. My family doesn't even know the full extent of what happened.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your openness. The goal is to reduce the power these memories hold over you.",
    "Client: Reduce their power? That sounds... hopeful, I guess. But how exactly does this work? What am I supposed to do?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the traumatic event in detail. I'll guide you through it.",
    "Client: In detail? Oh god, that sounds terrifying. Will I have to close my eyes? What if I start panicking? What if I can't stop crying? I'm already feeling my heart race just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. You can stop anytime. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's a little reassuring. But still, I'm scared. What if I get stuck in those memories and can't get out? What if I have nightmares after this? I already struggle with sleep due to my anxiety.",
    "Therapist: Those are common worries. We'll work through this together. You're very brave for trying.",
    "Client: Thank you for saying that. I don't feel brave at all right now. I feel like I want to run away. But I know I need to do this if I want to get better. It's just... it's hard to face it. The neglect, the imprisonment, it all feels so shameful.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. This process can be challenging, but it's a step towards healing.",
    "Client: I hope you're right. I really want to believe that this will help. Can you tell me more about what to expect during the session? How long will it last? What should I do if I start feeling overwhelmed?"
