    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're in control here. Can you describe the scene when you first heard about the incident of police brutality?",
    "Client: Okay... I was at home, sitting on the couch watching TV. My phone buzzed with a news alert. I picked it up and... (voice trembles) I saw the headline: \"Unarmed Black Man Killed by Police.\" My heart just... it dropped. I felt this cold sensation wash over me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I couldn't believe it. Another one. It felt like a punch to the gut. I started scrolling through the article, and there was a video. I hesitated, but I pressed play. The footage was grainy, but I could see a man on the ground, surrounded by officers. He wasn't moving, and they were still... (pauses, takes a deep breath) They were still on top of him.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel emotional. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I felt sick. Angry. Scared. It could have been me, you know? Or my brother, my friends. I couldn't stop watching the video, over and over. My partner came in and asked what was wrong, but I couldn't speak. I just handed them the phone.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I felt so helpless. Like, what could I do? It was happening again, and nothing seemed to change. I started thinking about my own experiences with the police, times I've been pulled over for no reason. The fear, the anxiety... it all came flooding back. I couldn't sleep that night. I kept seeing that man's face, imagining his family getting the news. It was overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: The next day, I couldn't focus at work. I kept checking my phone for updates, reading comments online. Some people were justifying it, and that made me even angrier. I felt this mix of rage and despair. I wanted to do something, anything, but I also felt paralyzed. It brought back memories of when I lost my cousin to gun violence. That same feeling of loss, of injustice. I felt like I was grieving not just for this man, but for all of us, for our community.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have these strong emotions. You're processing a lot.",
    "Client: Yeah, it's... it's a lot. I started having nightmares. In them, I'm the one on the ground, or sometimes it's my little brother. I wake up in a cold sweat, heart racing. During the day, I'd find myself zoning out, replaying the video in my head. It affected my relationship too. I was irritable, distant. My partner tried to understand, but how could they really know what it feels like?",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength by sharing this. Keep going.",
    "Client: I started going to protests. It felt good to do something, to be around others who understood. But it was also draining. Every chant, every sign reminded me of all the lives lost. I'd come home exhausted, both physically and emotionally. Sometimes I'd break down crying in the shower, where no one could see or hear me. I felt like I had to be strong for everyone else, but inside, I was crumbling.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel vulnerable. You're processing trauma.",
    "Client: I know, but it's hard. I started withdrawing from friends, especially those who didn't seem to care or understand. I'd see posts on social media about trivial things, and I'd get so angry. How could life just go on for everyone else? I felt isolated, like I was carrying this huge weight that no one else could see. The depression started creeping in, making it hard to get out of bed some days. I'd question everything - my career, my place in society, whether things would ever change. It was... it is... exhausting.",
    "Therapist: You're navigating complex emotions. That takes courage.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's just... it never really goes away, you know? Even now, months later, I'll see a police car and feel my heart rate spike. I'll hear about another incident and it all comes rushing back. I try to stay informed, to be an advocate, but sometimes it feels like too much. I worry about the future, about having kids someday and how to protect them in a world that seems so hostile. It's a constant battle between wanting to fight for change and wanting to protect myself from more pain.",
    "Therapist: Your resilience is admirable. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, honestly. Talking about it brings it all back. But also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like sharing the burden helps somehow. It's still there, still heavy, but maybe not crushing me as much. I just wish... I wish things were different. That we didn't have to live with this fear, this anger, this constant vigilance. But I know wishing won't change anything. We have to keep pushing, keep fighting for justice. It's just... it's a lot to carry.",
