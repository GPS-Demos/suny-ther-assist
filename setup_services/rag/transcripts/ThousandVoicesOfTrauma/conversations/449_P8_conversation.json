    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken up, to be honest. It's like I was right back there, you know? My heart's still racing a bit, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's strange because I know I'm safe here, but my body doesn't seem to believe it yet.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: Well, I keep replaying the moment when I heard the glass break downstairs. It's like... it's like time stood still, you know? I remember thinking, \"This can't be happening. Not to me.\" And then there was this flood of panic. I felt so helpless, so vulnerable. It's hard to shake that feeling, even now.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does that helplessness feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a heaviness, I suppose. Especially in my limbs. Like I'm weighed down, almost paralyzed. And there's this constant knot in my stomach. It's funny, I've dealt with chronic pain for years, but this feels different. It's like my body is on high alert, even though the danger has long passed.",
    "Therapist: And how do these sensations compare to when it first happened?",
    "Client: They're not as intense now, but they're eerily similar. It's like... like my body remembers even when my mind tries to forget. Back then, I couldn't sleep for weeks. Every little noise would startle me. Now, it's more manageable, but still... still there, you know?",
    "Therapist: What else comes up for you as you reflect on this?",
    "Client: I... I find myself getting angry. Not just at the intruders, but at myself. I keep thinking I should have done something differently. Maybe if I had better security, or if I hadn't been living alone... It's irrational, I know, but I can't help but feel like I failed to protect myself somehow.",
    "Therapist: Hmm. How does that anger feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's hot. Like a fire in my chest. But it's also exhausting. I'm tired of feeling this way, of second-guessing every decision I've made. And yet, I can't seem to let it go. It's like this anger has become a part of me, you know?",
    "Therapist: I understand. What do you notice about how you're coping now?",
    "Client: Well, I suppose I'm doing better than I was immediately after it happened. I can talk about it now without completely falling apart. But... but I still feel on edge a lot of the time. It's like I'm constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop. And that's... that's no way to live, is it? I want to feel safe again, to be able to relax in my own home without this constant fear hanging over me.",
    "Therapist: Mm. How do you see your progress in therapy affecting this?",
    "Client: I... I think it's helping. Slowly, but surely. These exercises, as difficult as they are, they're forcing me to confront these memories instead of just trying to push them away. And I'm starting to see that I'm stronger than I thought. I survived that night, and I'm surviving now. It's just... it's a long road, you know? Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever fully feel like myself again.",
    "Therapist: What gives you hope in your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I guess... I guess it's the small victories. Like being able to sleep through the night without waking up in a panic. Or inviting a friend over without obsessively checking the locks. And... and talking about it here, in therapy. Even though it's hard, I can feel myself processing it bit by bit. It's like... like I'm slowly reclaiming pieces of myself that I thought I'd lost that night.",
    "Therapist: That's powerful. How does it feel to recognize that strength?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of emotions, really. There's a sense of pride, I suppose. Like I'm finally giving myself credit for how far I've come. But there's also a sadness. A mourning for the person I was before all this happened. And yet, there's also a glimmer of hope. Hope that maybe, just maybe, I can come out of this stronger than I was before. It's... it's complicated, but it feels important. Like I'm finally starting to see a way forward.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. What would you like to focus on next?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to work more on feeling safe in my home again. It's still a struggle, especially at night. Maybe we could explore some strategies for that? I'm tired of feeling like a prisoner in my own space, you know? I want to reclaim it, to make it feel like mine again. Is that... is that something we could work on?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's explore that next session.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I appreciate your guidance through all of this. It's not easy, but I'm starting to believe that maybe, just maybe, I can get through this. It's a long journey, but I'm... I'm committed to seeing it through. I want my life back, you know? And for the first time in a while, I feel like that might actually be possible.",
    "Therapist: That's a great place to end for today. Take care."
