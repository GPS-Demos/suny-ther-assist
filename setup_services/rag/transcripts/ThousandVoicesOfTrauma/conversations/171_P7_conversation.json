    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the hostage situation?",
    "Client: Okay... I was at the bank, just a regular day. I was waiting in line when suddenly these men burst in with guns. They were shouting, telling everyone to get down. I froze. I couldn't move. My heart was racing so fast...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: They made us all lie face down on the floor. I could hear people crying, whimpering. The robbers were yelling at the tellers, demanding money. I was so scared. I kept thinking they might shoot us at any moment.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I... I remember the cold floor against my cheek. The smell of fear and sweat. Someone near me was praying softly. I wanted to reach out, to hold someone's hand, but I was too afraid to move.",
    "Therapist: That's good. What happened next?",
    "Client: One of the robbers started getting agitated. He was screaming at a teller who was taking too long. I heard a gunshot and I thought... I thought he'd killed her. People started screaming. I was shaking so hard...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: I... I can't... It's too much...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay... The police arrived. There was shouting, more gunshots. I thought we were all going to die. I couldn't see what was happening, but I could hear everything. It felt like hours...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: Finally, it got quiet. Then I heard police officers telling us it was over, that we were safe. When I looked up, I saw blood on the floor. One of the robbers was dead. I felt... relieved, but also horrified. I couldn't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. Scared. But also... I don't know. Maybe a little stronger? Like I survived telling it again.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've shown great courage.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to talk about, but... maybe it's getting a little easier? I don't know. I still have nightmares sometimes.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I guess so. It's just... sometimes I feel like I'll never be the same. Like that day changed everything. I'm always looking over my shoulder now, always expecting the worst.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Keep working through them.",
    "Client: I'm trying. It's just... it's hard. Sometimes I feel so angry. At the robbers, at the world... even at myself for not being able to just \"get over it,\" you know?",
    "Therapist: Anger is a normal response. You're processing it well.",
    "Client: Maybe. I just wish I could forget it all sometimes. But then I feel guilty for wanting to forget, because... I don't know. It feels like that would be wrong somehow.",

    "Therapist: That's great progress. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired. Really tired. But also... maybe a little lighter? Like I've let go of something heavy. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's a common experience. You've done well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I'm ready to stop for now. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've made excellent progress today."
