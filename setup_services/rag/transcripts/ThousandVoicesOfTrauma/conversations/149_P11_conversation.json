    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Singh?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's not easy revisiting those memories of my ex-wife's physical abuse during our divorce. My hands are still trembling a little.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you about this experience?",
    "Client: The vivid details, I suppose. I could almost feel her hands on me again, you know? The way she'd grab my arm so tightly, leaving bruises. And the look in her eyes... it was like she didn't even see me as a person anymore. Just... just an object to hurt.",
    "Therapist: Hmm. How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. I felt a mix of emotions. Anger, definitely. Sadness too. But also, strangely, a sense of... I don't know, maybe empowerment? Like I'm finally facing this head-on instead of trying to bury it.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. Can you elaborate on that feeling of empowerment?",
    "Client: Well, for years I've tried to pretend it never happened. I'm a successful professional, you know? I didn't want to admit I'd been... abused. But going through this memory, painful as it is, makes me feel like I'm taking control back. I'm not letting it define me in secret anymore.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your PTSD symptoms?",
    "Client: I... I think it explains a lot. The nightmares, the constant tension, always being on guard. Even though I'm long divorced, part of me was still living in that moment, wasn't it? Always waiting for the next attack.",
    "Therapist: That's a valuable connection. How do you see this affecting your recovery?",
    "Client: I think... I think it gives me hope, actually. If I can face this memory and come out the other side, maybe I can start to let my guard down in daily life too. Maybe I can start to trust again, even consider a new relationship someday.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive outlook. What was the most challenging part of today's session?",
    "Client: The shame, I think. Even now, there's this voice in my head saying I should have been stronger, that I shouldn't have let it happen. It's hard to shake that feeling.",
    "Therapist: That's a common reaction. How might you respond to that voice now?",
    "Client: I... I guess I'd say that I did the best I could in an impossible situation. Nobody deserves abuse, regardless of their gender or strength. I was a victim, but that doesn't define who I am now.",
    "Therapist: Well said. How do you feel about continuing with these exposures?",
    "Client: It's tough, but... I think it's helping. Each time, it gets a little easier to face. I'm starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel, so to speak.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe we could work on my fear of intimacy? I think it's tied to the abuse, and it's holding me back from forming new relationships.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a good plan. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: No, I think that's enough for today. Thank you for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone listen without judgment.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Remember to practice your coping strategies this week.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again, doctor. See you next week.",
    "Therapist: Take care, Mr. Singh. See you then."
