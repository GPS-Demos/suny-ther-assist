    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Johnson. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit apprehensive, to be honest. I know we're going to be talking about the plane crash again, and it's just... it's still so vivid in my mind.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Yes, let's... let's get started.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) I'm... I'm at the airport. It's busy, people rushing everywhere. The smell of coffee and pastries from the nearby caf\u00e9... I can almost taste it. My husband and I, we're waiting to board our flight to Fiji. It was supposed to be our second honeymoon, you know? (voice wavers) God, I wish we'd never gone...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: We... we board the plane. I remember feeling a bit uneasy. The weather report mentioned storms, but the airline assured us it was safe to fly. I take my seat by the window, my husband next to me. He's excited, talking about the resort, but I can't shake this feeling of dread.",
    "Therapist: How high is your distress right now, on a scale of 0 to 100?",
    "Client: About... about 40, I'd say.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue. What happens as the plane takes off?",
    "Client: The takeoff is... it's rough. There's turbulence almost immediately. I grip the armrests so hard my knuckles turn white. My heart's racing. The plane's shaking, and I can hear the rain pelting against the windows. It's so loud...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember to breathe. What do you notice around you?",
    "Client: People are looking nervous. A baby starts crying a few rows back. The flight attendants are trying to look calm, but I can see the worry in their eyes. Suddenly, there's a loud bang, and the plane drops. Oh God, I can feel it in my stomach, that awful falling sensation...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 70. (voice shaking) I don't know if I can do this...",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a deep breath. Can you continue?",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) Y-yes. The oxygen masks drop down. There's panic, people screaming. My husband, he's trying to calm me down, but I can see the fear in his eyes. The plane's tilting, and I can see the ocean through the window. It's getting closer and closer...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: There's another bang, louder this time. The plane shudders violently. I can smell smoke. Oh God, I think... I think the engine's on fire. People are praying, crying. I'm frozen, I can't move. My husband grabs my hand. He's saying something, but I can't hear him over the noise...",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My... my heart feels like it's going to burst out of my chest. I'm shaking uncontrollably. I can taste bile in my throat. The plane's losing altitude fast. We're going to crash. We're going to die. I can't breathe... I can't...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's 90. (sobbing) I don't want to die...",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Can you stay with the memory?",
    "Client: (nods, still crying) The impact... it's deafening. Metal tearing, people screaming. My body slams forward, but the seatbelt holds me back. There's water, so much water pouring in. The plane's breaking apart. My husband... oh God, my husband! He's not moving. There's blood...",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What do you see, hear, feel?",
    "Client: Cold... the water's so cold. It's dark, and I can taste salt. People are struggling to get out. I'm trying to unbuckle my seatbelt, but my hands are shaking so much. I can hear muffled screams, the creaking of metal. The plane's sinking. I... I finally get free, but my husband... (sobbing) I can't leave him...",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. How high is your distress now?",
    "Client: It's... it's 100. I can't... I can't do this anymore...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here, you're safe. Can you feel the chair beneath you?",
    "Client: (takes a shuddering breath) Y-yes... I can feel it.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep breathing. Can you continue?",
    "Client: (nods slowly) I... I manage to unbuckle my husband's seatbelt. The water's rising fast. I'm pulling him, trying to swim to the surface. My lungs are burning. I can see light above... we're so close. But he's so heavy... I can't... I can't hold on...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Guilt. Overwhelming guilt. I... I let go. (crying) I let him go. I swim to the surface alone. When I break through, I can see debris everywhere. People floating, some moving, some... some not. The plane's gone. My husband's gone. I'm alive, but I wish I wasn't.",
    "Therapist: You're incredibly brave for sharing this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Exhausted. But also... I don't know. Maybe a little lighter? Is that wrong?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a normal response. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 60, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You've done excellent work today. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you tell me five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: (looks around) I see... the clock on the wall, your degrees hanging up, the plant in the corner, the box of tissues, and... and my hands, still shaking a little.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, four things you can touch?",
    "Client: The armrest of the chair, my wedding ring, the fabric of my shirt, and... the coolness of the air from the vent.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Three things you can hear?",
    "Client: The ticking of the clock, the hum of the air conditioner, and... my own breathing, it's calmer now.",
    "Therapist: Very good. Two things you can smell?",
    "Client: The faint scent of your coffee and... is that lavender? From the diffuser maybe?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it is. And finally, one thing you can taste?",
    "Client: The lingering mint from the gum I was chewing earlier.",
    "Therapist: Wonderful job. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... more present. More here. The memories are still there, but they feel... less overwhelming somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. You've shown incredible strength today. How would you like to spend the rest of our session?",
    "Client: Could we... could we just talk about some coping strategies? For when the memories get too intense at home?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's discuss some techniques you can use..."
