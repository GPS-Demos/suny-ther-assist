    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the scene?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm at home. It's evening, and I can hear my partner in the kitchen. There's tension in the air, like a storm about to break. I'm sitting on the couch, trying to focus on the TV, but my heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: Suddenly, I hear a crash from the kitchen. My partner storms into the living room, face contorted with anger. I feel my body freeze, my breath catching in my throat. They start yelling about dinner being late, but I know it's not really about that. It never is.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I can't breathe. My partner is getting closer, gesticulating wildly. I want to run, but I'm rooted to the spot. Their words blur together, but the tone cuts like a knife. I feel so small, so helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I manage to stammer out an apology, but it only seems to fuel their rage. They grab a vase from the side table and hurl it against the wall. The sound of shattering glass makes me flinch. I can feel tears welling up in my eyes, but I don't dare let them fall.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I... I can't. This is too much. I remember feeling so trapped, so scared. Like I was suffocating under the weight of their anger. I wanted to disappear, to become invisible.",
    "Therapist: I understand it's difficult. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: (Taking a deep breath) Okay... I force myself to look at them, to meet their eyes. There's a moment where I see something flicker there - shame, maybe? But it's quickly replaced by more anger. They start pacing, muttering under their breath. I'm still frozen, waiting for the next outburst.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The pacing stops abruptly. They turn to me and say, \"This is your fault. You make me like this.\" Those words... they cut deeper than any physical blow could. I feel a mix of fear, shame, and anger bubbling up inside me. But I can't express it. I just sit there, taking it all in, hating myself for not being stronger.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The rest of the evening is a blur of more yelling, more accusations. I remember feeling so drained, so hollow. When they finally storm out of the house, slamming the door behind them, I break down. I cry until I have no tears left, feeling utterly alone and worthless.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I spent the night on that couch, too afraid to move, too ashamed to call anyone. I kept replaying their words in my head, wondering what I could have done differently. The worst part was... I believed them. I truly thought it was all my fault.",
    "Therapist: You've shown tremendous courage. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Reliving that moment is exhausting. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, relief? Like I've finally let out something I've been holding onto for so long. It still hurts, but maybe not as sharply as before.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You've done well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It's still hard, and I feel shaky, but... I think I'm starting to see that it wasn't my fault. That I didn't deserve that treatment.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. How do you feel physically?",
    "Client: My heart is still racing a bit, and I feel tense all over. But I'm starting to calm down. The room feels more... present now. Like I'm coming back to the here and now.",
    "Therapist: Take a few deep breaths. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Takes several deep breaths) That helps. I feel more grounded now. It's strange, but talking about it... it makes it feel less overwhelming. Like I'm taking back some control.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Well done today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I didn't think I could do this, but... I'm glad I did. It's hard, but I think it's helping. I just hope it gets easier with time.",
    "Therapist: It often does. We'll end here for today. You've shown great strength."
