    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your current SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10. My stomach feels a little tight.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and describe the airplane crash scene.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm sitting in my seat, feeling the plane vibrate. The captain's voice comes on, sounding worried. He says we're experiencing turbulence, but something feels off. The plane starts shaking more violently, and I can hear people gasping and murmuring. My heart is racing, and I'm gripping the armrests so tightly my knuckles are white.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My palms are getting sweaty, and my breathing is faster. The memory feels so vivid. I'd say my SUDS is now a 6.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: The shaking gets worse, and suddenly there's a loud bang. The oxygen masks drop down, and people start screaming. I'm fumbling with my mask, my hands shaking so badly I can barely get it on. The plane is tilting to one side, and I can see the ground through the window, getting closer and closer. I'm terrified, thinking this is it, I'm going to die.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. My heart is pounding so hard, and I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Yeah, I know. It just feels so real. The plane is diving now, and I can hear the engines screaming. People are praying, crying, some are even passing out. I'm frozen in my seat, unable to move or think. The ground is coming up so fast, and I close my eyes, bracing for impact.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I... I'm shaking. My SUDS is a 9. It's almost too much.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: Okay... *deep breath* The plane hits the ground with a deafening crash. There's a moment of complete chaos - metal tearing, glass shattering, people screaming. I'm thrown forward, my seatbelt cutting into me. Then everything goes quiet, and I realize I'm alive. I'm in shock, surrounded by debris and injured passengers. The smell of fuel and smoke is overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still a 9. My heart is racing, and I feel dizzy.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: I unbuckle my seatbelt with shaking hands and look around. Some people are moving, others are... not. I can hear distant sirens. I'm in pain, but I know I need to get out. I stumble towards a gap in the plane's body, my legs barely supporting me. As I crawl out onto the ground, I see the full extent of the crash. It's... it's horrifying.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm starting to calm down a bit. My SUDS is dropping to about a 7. I feel exhausted.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Thanks. As I sit on the grass, watching emergency vehicles arrive, I'm overwhelmed with relief and guilt. I survived, but so many others didn't. I can't stop shaking, and I'm crying uncontrollably. It's like all the emotions I couldn't feel during the crash are hitting me at once.",
    "Therapist: What's your current SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5 now. I feel drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger?",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How do you feel about ending here?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think that's good. I'm tired, but I feel like I've accomplished something.",
    "Therapist: You have. You did excellent work today."
