    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is dreading it. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 6 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we're here to process your experience. Begin when you're ready.",
    "Client: Alright... *deep breath* It was supposed to be a normal day. I was at work, in my office on the 23rd floor. The weather had been strange all morning, but I didn't think much of it. Then... then the building started to shake. At first, I thought it was just a tremor, you know? But it kept getting stronger.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see... papers flying off my desk. My coffee mug falls and shatters. The windows are rattling so hard I think they might break. And I can hear people starting to scream in the hallway.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe an 8?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I freeze for a second. My mind goes blank. Then survival instinct kicks in, and I dive under my desk. The shaking is so violent now, I can barely hold on. I'm terrified the ceiling might collapse.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I can feel it pounding in my chest. My palms are sweaty, and I'm gripping the desk leg so hard my knuckles are white. I... I think I'm hyperventilating.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *inhales shakily* Okay... The shaking seems to go on forever. I can hear things crashing all around me. Glass breaking, metal groaning. And the screams... God, the screams are the worst part. I want to help, but I'm too scared to move.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: Finally, the shaking starts to subside. But I'm too afraid to come out from under the desk. What if there's an aftershock? What if the building's unstable? I... I can smell dust and something electrical burning. My ears are ringing.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Carlos. Remember, you survived this.",
    "Client: *nods* Okay... I slowly crawl out from under the desk. The office is a disaster. Everything's knocked over, there's broken glass everywhere. I can hear car alarms going off outside, and sirens in the distance. I... I stumble to the window, and what I see... it's like a war zone.",
    "Therapist: Describe what you see.",
    "Client: The streets are chaos. There are cracks in the pavement, overturned cars. I can see a building a few blocks away that's partially collapsed. There's dust and smoke everywhere. People are running, crying. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I need to get out. But I'm on the 23rd floor. The elevators aren't safe, so I head for the stairs. The stairwell is packed with people, all trying to get down. It's hot, stuffy. I can smell fear and sweat.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel?",
    "Client: My legs are shaky. I'm dizzy from the adrenaline. My throat is dry, and I realize I'm incredibly thirsty. But mostly, I just feel this overwhelming urge to get out, to be on solid ground.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: Still at a 9. It's not getting any easier.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The descent feels like it takes forever. People are pushing, shoving. Someone falls, and I help them up. Finally, we reach the ground floor. As we spill out onto the street, I'm hit by the full scale of the destruction. The noise is deafening - sirens, people shouting, the rumble of buildings settling.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I start walking. I don't even know where I'm going at first. I just need to get away from the tall buildings. My phone isn't working, and I'm desperate to contact my wife, to know if she's okay. I see people helping each other, and others just standing there, shell-shocked.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Scared. Overwhelmed. But also... grateful to be alive. It's a strange mix of emotions. I keep expecting another quake to hit. Every little vibration, every loud noise makes me jump.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down a bit. Maybe an 8?",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue.",
    "Client: I walk for what feels like hours. The city is unrecognizable. There's debris everywhere, broken water mains flooding the streets. I pass by a park that's been turned into a makeshift triage center. The sight of the injured... it's hard to process.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I... I feel guilty. I'm relatively unharmed, while so many others are hurt. And I can't stop thinking about my wife. What if something happened to her? What if our apartment collapsed? The uncertainty is killing me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those thoughts. What happens next?",
    "Client: I finally make it to our neighborhood. It's not as bad here, but there's still damage. Our building is still standing, thank God. As I approach, I see her - my wife. She's outside with our neighbors, looking worried. When she sees me, she runs to me, and we just hold each other and cry.",
    "Therapist: How does that moment feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's relief like I've never felt before. But also, the reality of what we've just been through hits me all at once. I start shaking uncontrollably. My wife is saying something, but I can barely hear her. It's like I'm underwater.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down. Maybe a 7 now?",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: We go into our apartment. It's a mess, but structurally okay. We turn on the radio for news. The reports start coming in about the magnitude, the damage, the casualties. It's... it's overwhelming. We spend the night huddled together, jumping at every aftershock.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel in those moments?",
    "Client: Vulnerable. Scared. But also... connected. To my wife, to our neighbors. There's this sense that we've all been through something profound together. It's terrifying, but also... unifying, in a way.",
    "Therapist: What happens in the days that follow?",
    "Client: It's... it's a blur. No power, limited water. We help our neighbors clear debris. The city slowly starts to come back to life, but nothing feels normal. I have nightmares about being trapped, about the ground opening up and swallowing me. During the day, I'm constantly on edge, always looking for the nearest exit, always prepared to duck and cover.",
    "Therapist: How does this experience change you?",
    "Client: It... it makes me realize how fragile everything is. How quickly life can change. I appreciate the small things more - a hot shower, a home-cooked meal. But I also feel... I don't know, more anxious? Like I'm always waiting for the next disaster.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 5, I think. Talking about it... it's hard, but it helps.",
    "Therapist: You've done very well, Carlos. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Drained. But also... a little lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying around.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after processing trauma. Let's take a few deep breaths together to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: *breathes deeply* Okay... yeah, that helps.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength today. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm good. This was tough, but... I'm glad we did it. I feel like I understand my reactions better now, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. We'll continue to work through this in our future sessions. For now, let's focus on some self-care strategies for the rest of your day."
