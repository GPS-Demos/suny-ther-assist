    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is spinning. The memory of that earthquake was so vivid. I could almost feel the ground shaking beneath me again. My heart is still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, definitely fear. But also... a weird sense of relief? Like, I survived it once, so maybe I can face it again. It's confusing.",
    "Therapist: Hmm. Can you tell me more about that mix of fear and relief?",
    "Client: Well, the fear is... it's visceral. I remember the sound of things falling, people screaming. But the relief... I guess it's because I'm here, safe, talking about it. It's like my body is realizing that the danger has passed, even if my mind is still caught up in it.",
    "Therapist: I see. What physical sensations are you noticing?",
    "Client: My hands are shaky. And there's this tightness in my chest, like I can't get a full breath. But it's easing up a bit now. I also feel... warm? Like my face is flushed.",
    "Therapist: How do these sensations compare to when you actually experienced the earthquake?",
    "Client: They're similar, but... less intense? During the actual quake, I felt completely frozen. Now, it's like my body wants to move, to do something. It's uncomfortable, but not paralyzing like before.",
    "Therapist: Interesting. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how unprepared I was. And... guilt. There was this little girl I saw crying, and I didn't help her. I just ran. I've never told anyone that before.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. How does it feel to express that thought out loud?",
    "Client: It's... heavy. But also, kind of freeing? I've carried that secret for so long. I know logically that I was just trying to survive, but emotionally... it's hard to reconcile.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How does this memory connect to your experiences with bullying?",
    "Client: Oh wow, I hadn't even thought of that. But... yeah, there's a connection. In both situations, I felt powerless. With the bullying, I couldn't defend myself. During the earthquake, I couldn't control anything. And in both cases, I felt like I should have done more.",
    "Therapist: I see. What's coming up for you as you make that connection?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a revelation. I've always been so hard on myself for not standing up to the bullies, and for not helping during the quake. But maybe... maybe I was just doing my best in impossible situations? I don't know. It's a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. How does this insight affect how you view yourself?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. Part of me wants to be kinder to myself. But there's still this voice saying I should have been stronger, braver. It's like I'm at war with myself.",
    "Therapist: Hmm. What would you say to a friend who had these experiences?",
    "Client: I... I'd probably tell them they did their best. That surviving is enough sometimes. Oh... I see what you're getting at. It's easier to be compassionate to others than to myself, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: Indeed. How might you start showing yourself that same compassion?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe I could start by acknowledging that I was just a kid when the bullying happened. And during the earthquake, I was in shock. No one can be prepared for something like that. It's not fair to expect perfection from myself in those moments.",
    "Therapist: That's a great start. How does it feel to think about it that way?",
    "Client: It feels... lighter? Like I'm putting down a weight I've been carrying for years. But also a bit scary. If I'm not beating myself up, what do I do with all those feelings?",
    "Therapist: What do you think those feelings might need?",
    "Client: Maybe... acceptance? And time to process? I've spent so long trying to push them away or overcome them. Maybe I just need to sit with them for a while.",
    "Therapist: That's very insightful. How can you create space for that?",
    "Client: I could try journaling, maybe? Or talking to my partner about it. I've always kept these feelings so private. Opening up might help.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like good ideas. How are you feeling now compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but in a good way? Like after a hard workout. My mind feels clearer, even though we've dug up a lot of difficult stuff. And I feel... I don't know, maybe a tiny bit stronger? Like I can face these memories without being completely overwhelmed by them.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. What's one thing you'd like to remember from today's session?",
    "Client: That it's okay to be kind to myself. That surviving was enough. And that maybe, by accepting these experiences instead of fighting them, I can start to heal.",
    "Therapist: Wonderful. Let's wrap up here. Take care of yourself this week.",
    "Client: Thank you. This was hard, but... I think it was really important. I'll see you next time."
