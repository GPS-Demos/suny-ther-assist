    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Can you describe the cyberbullying incident?",
    "Client: Okay, I'll try. It started when I posted a photo of my artwork on social media. I was proud of it, you know? But then the comments started coming in. At first, they were just critical, but then they got really nasty. People were saying things like, \"This is garbage,\" and \"You should be ashamed to call yourself an artist.\"",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: It felt like a punch to the gut. I've always been sensitive about my art, and suddenly it felt like everyone was attacking me. The comments kept coming, and some people even started sending me private messages. They were mocking me, telling me to give up, saying I had no talent. I couldn't understand why they were being so cruel.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I started to doubt myself. I mean, maybe they were right? Maybe I was deluding myself thinking I had any artistic ability. I couldn't sleep at night, constantly checking my phone, seeing if there were more comments. It was like I was addicted to the pain, you know? I kept reading them over and over, each one cutting deeper.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Continue.",
    "Client: I started to withdraw from my friends and family. I was too ashamed to tell them what was happening. I felt so alone, like I was trapped in this bubble of hate and criticism. I stopped creating art altogether. Every time I picked up a brush, I'd hear those voices in my head telling me I was worthless.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: The worst part was feeling like I had no control. These were strangers on the internet, but they had so much power over me. I started having panic attacks, my heart racing every time my phone buzzed. I was constantly on edge, feeling like the next attack could come at any moment. It was exhausting, and I felt so helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Keep going.",
    "Client: I started to have dark thoughts. Not... not suicidal, but just wishing I could disappear. I fantasized about deleting all my social media, changing my name, moving to a new city where no one knew me. I felt like I couldn't face the world anymore. The emotional toll was just... overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job describing this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard to talk about. My heart is racing a bit, and I feel a knot in my stomach. But at the same time, there's a part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe a little relieved? Like I'm finally letting this out instead of keeping it bottled up inside.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: Thanks. I guess what hurts the most is how it changed me. I used to be so open and trusting, you know? I loved sharing my art and connecting with people. But now, I'm always second-guessing myself, always waiting for the other shoe to drop. It's like there's this constant fear hanging over me, even when I'm not online.",
    "Therapist: You're showing remarkable insight. Let's continue.",
    "Client: I've tried to move past it, but it's like the experience has left this... this scar on my psyche. I find myself being overly cautious about everything I say or do online. I'm constantly worried about offending someone or attracting negative attention. It's exhausting, always being on guard like that. And the worst part is, I know it's affecting my creativity. I'm so scared of criticism now that I rarely share my work anymore.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever feel truly comfortable expressing myself again. Will I always carry this fear with me? It's frustrating because I know, logically, that those people who attacked me were probably dealing with their own issues. But emotionally, it's so hard to shake off the impact of their words. It's like they're still echoing in my head, even after all this time.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an incredible job processing this. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, I guess. But also, there's a sense of... I don't know, maybe relief? Like I'm finally confronting this head-on instead of trying to push it away. It's still painful to think about, but talking about it like this... it feels like I'm taking some of the power back from those bullies. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're making great progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think... I think I'm starting to see that while their words hurt me, they don't define me. My art, my creativity - that comes from within me, not from their opinions. It's still scary to think about putting myself out there again, but maybe... maybe it's time to start reclaiming that part of myself. I miss creating without fear, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you feel about ending here for today?",
    "Client: I think that's a good idea. This has been intense, but in a good way. I feel like I've taken a step forward, even if it's a small one. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know there's still a lot to work on, but for the first time in a while, I feel a glimmer of hope that I can move past this and maybe even start creating again.",
