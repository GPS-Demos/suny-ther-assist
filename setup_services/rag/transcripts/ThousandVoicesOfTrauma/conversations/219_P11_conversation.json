    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, John?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is still trying to process everything. The memories felt so vivid, you know? I could almost smell the musty air in that room where they kept us. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Understandable. What stood out most?",
    "Client: The fear. God, the constant fear. I remember huddling in the corner with the other kids, never knowing when someone would come for us. We were always on edge, always waiting for the worst.",
    "Therapist: Mm. How does that connect to your life now?",
    "Client: I guess... I'm still always waiting for the other shoe to drop. Even in my business, when things are going well, I can't relax. It's like I'm still that scared kid, you know?",
    "Therapist: That makes sense. How did it feel to revisit today?",
    "Client: Honestly? Terrifying. But... also different. Like, I'm not that helpless child anymore. I survived. I'm here, talking about it. That's... that's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What else did you notice?",
    "Client: I felt anger this time. Not just fear. Anger at the traffickers, at the system that failed us. Is that... is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. How does that anger feel?",
    "Client: It feels... powerful, actually. Like maybe I'm not just a victim anymore. But it's also scary. I've spent so long trying not to feel anything.",
    "Therapist: Understandable. How might this shift help you?",
    "Client: I don't know. Maybe... maybe it means I can start standing up for myself more? In my business, in relationships. I've always been so afraid of conflict, of rocking the boat.",
    "Therapist: That's insightful. What else?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about the other kids. I wonder if they're okay, if they made it out. It's hard not to feel guilty that I survived and they might not have.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with those feelings?",
    "Client: I try to remind myself that it wasn't my fault. That I was just a kid too. But it's hard. Sometimes I think about trying to find them, but I'm scared of what I might discover.",
    "Therapist: That's a common struggle. How else has this affected you?",
    "Client: It's made relationships really difficult. I have a hard time trusting people, opening up. That's probably why I'm still single. It's easier to be alone than to risk being hurt again.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does that isolation impact you?",
    "Client: It's... lonely. But safe, you know? Except, going through this therapy, I'm starting to wonder if it's really keeping me safe or just... stuck.",
    "Therapist: Interesting observation. What do you think?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe it's time to take some risks. Not big ones, but... maybe try to connect with people more. It's scary, but staying isolated isn't really living, is it?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: Nervous. Excited. A little sick to my stomach, honestly. But also... hopeful? Like maybe there's a chance for something different.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What's your next step?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I'll try joining that business networking group I've been avoiding. Start small, you know? And keep working on processing these memories. It's hard, but I can see how it's helping.",
    "Therapist: Excellent plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, but... okay. Better than I expected, actually. Like maybe I can handle this after all. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Great work today, John."
