    "Therapist: Alright, Mr. Patel, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I understand why we're doing this.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's begin. Close your eyes and recall the medical trauma we discussed.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in the hospital room. The fluorescent lights are so bright, and there's that antiseptic smell. I can hear the beeping of machines...",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: It's about a 4 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The doctor comes in. He's not looking at me, just at his clipboard. He starts talking about my test results, using all these medical terms I don't understand. My heart is racing...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: My palms are sweaty. I'm gripping the sheets tightly. The doctor's voice sounds muffled, like I'm underwater. I feel so alone and scared.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. I'm starting to feel really anxious.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The doctor finally looks at me and says, \"We need to operate immediately.\" I feel like the room is spinning. I try to ask questions, but my mouth is so dry. I'm thinking about my late wife, wishing she was here...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. I'm having trouble breathing. It's like I'm back there again.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. This is really intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it if you can.",
    "Client: I nod at the doctor, but inside I'm screaming. I want to run away, but I can't move. A nurse comes in and starts prepping me for surgery. I feel so powerless, like I have no control over what's happening to my body.",
    "Therapist: How are your feelings changing?",
    "Client: I'm angry now. Why didn't they explain things better? Why didn't they give me time to process? My heart is pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Still an 8. Maybe even a 9. I feel overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep breathing.",

    "Therapist: That's common. How does the memory continue?",
    "Client: They put the mask on my face. I take deep breaths, and everything starts to fade. The last thing I remember is thinking about my wife, hoping she's watching over me...",
    "Therapist: And now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm back here. In your office. My heart is still racing, but I feel... I don't know, relieved maybe?",
    "Therapist: That's great. Final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5 now. I feel drained, but also like I've accomplished something.",
    "Therapist: You have. You did excellent work today, Mr. Patel."
