    "Therapist: Welcome back, Amir. Today we'll be doing an imaginal exposure exercise focusing on your experience with cyber bullying. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm a bit nervous, but I understand why we're doing this.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember, you're in control. Let's start. Close your eyes and describe the memory.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm sitting in my room, scrolling through social media. Suddenly, I see a post about me. Someone's shared an embarrassing photo from a party. The comments are brutal. People I thought were friends are laughing at me, calling me names...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably about a 5 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: My heart's racing. I feel hot, like my face is burning. I can't believe this is happening. I want to disappear. The notifications keep coming, each one a new insult. I feel so alone, so exposed...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up... maybe a 7.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I try to defend myself in the comments, but it only makes things worse. They twist my words, make fun of me more. I'm shaking now, I feel sick to my stomach. I want to throw my phone, but I can't stop reading. It's like a car crash...",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: I know. You're very brave. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I start crying. I feel so helpless. I think about how my parents never taught me how to handle this, how to stand up for myself. They were always too busy... I feel like a child again, lost and scared.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS?",
    "Client: Still an 8... maybe edging towards 9.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it.",
    "Client: I... I shut off my phone finally. But I can't escape the thoughts. What if everyone at work sees this? What if I lose my job? My reputation? I feel like I can't breathe... like the walls are closing in...",
    "Therapist: And now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (inhales deeply) I... I remember feeling so angry at myself for letting this affect me so much. But also angry at the world, at the people who did this. I wanted to disappear, to never face anyone again...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down a bit. Maybe a 7 again.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Can you describe what's changing?",
    "Client: I... I'm starting to remember that this isn't happening right now. That I survived it. My breathing is slowing down a little. I still feel shaky, but... but I'm here, in this room with you. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. You're doing very well.",
    "Client: Thank you... I... I didn't realize how much this still affected me. But talking through it... it's hard, but I feel like I'm facing it head-on for the first time.",
    "Therapist: That's exactly right. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5 again. I feel drained, but... but also a bit stronger.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredible work today, Amir. How about we start wrapping up?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. I'm exhausted, but... but I'm glad we did this.",
    "Therapist: I'm proud of you. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end."
