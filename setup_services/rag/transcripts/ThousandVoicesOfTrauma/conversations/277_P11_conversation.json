    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving that earthquake at work... it's like I was right back there, you know? I could feel the ground shaking, hear the screams of my coworkers. It's... it's a lot.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. I remember being frozen, unable to move as everything around me was falling apart. And the guilt... God, the guilt of not being able to help my colleagues who were trapped. It's... it's suffocating.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... difficult. Really difficult. My heart was racing, and I felt like I couldn't breathe at times. But... but I also felt a strange sense of... I don't know, maybe control? Like, I'm here now, safe, and I can talk about it without being in immediate danger. It's weird.",
    "Therapist: That's an interesting observation. Can you tell me more?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... even though I was reliving it, part of me knew it wasn't happening right now. I could feel my body reacting, but my mind was... I don't know, more aware? It's hard to explain. But it felt different from my usual flashbacks or nightmares.",
    "Therapist: How does this experience relate to your PTSD symptoms?",
    "Client: I think... I think it shows me that maybe I'm not as powerless as I thought. Like, usually when I have flashbacks, they completely take over. But this time, even though it was intense, I felt like I had a bit more... control? Maybe that's not the right word, but... yeah.",
    "Therapist: That's a valuable insight. How might this help your recovery?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe it means I can start facing these memories without completely falling apart? It's still scary, and I'm not sure I want to do it again, but... I don't know, maybe there's hope? That sounds cheesy, doesn't it?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. What you're feeling is valid.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's just... it's been so hard, you know? Losing my job because I couldn't handle being in that building anymore, feeling like I'm going crazy with these memories and nightmares. But today... today felt different. Like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What do you think helped?",
    "Client: I think... having you here, knowing I was safe. And maybe... maybe just facing it head-on instead of trying to avoid it all the time? It's exhausting, always running from these memories. Today was hard, but... I feel like I accomplished something. Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. How do you feel about continuing this process?",
    "Client: Scared, honestly. But also... kind of determined? Like, if I could get through today, maybe I can get through the next session too. And the one after that. It's terrifying, but... I want my life back, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a courageous attitude. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I guess. For being here, for guiding me through this. I know we have a long way to go, but... for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can do this. It's a small step, but... it feels important.",
    "Therapist: It is important. You've done great work today."
