    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Lee. How are you feeling about our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I'm... well, to be honest, I'm a bit on edge. This whole process of revisiting the airplane crash feels daunting. I've spent years trying to push those memories away.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to help you process this. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Though my hands are already getting clammy just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. We'll go at your pace. Start when you're ready, and describe the scene as if it's happening now.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm... I'm boarding the plane. It's a small regional jet, maybe 50 seats. The smell of jet fuel is strong, and I can hear the whine of the engines starting up. I... I take my seat by the window. My palms are sweating as I buckle the seatbelt.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably a 4 or 5. The takeoff always made me nervous, even before... before the crash.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: We're taxiing now. The plane jolts as we start moving. I can see other planes through the window, and airport workers scurrying about. My heart's beating faster. We... we're lining up on the runway now.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm gripping the armrests tightly. My mouth is dry. The engines are getting louder, and I can feel the vibration through the floor. We're... we're accelerating now. The force is pushing me back into my seat.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: We're lifting off. I always hated this part. The ground is falling away, and I can see the city getting smaller. Everything looks so fragile from up here. We're... we're climbing higher. The plane banks to the left, and I can see the wing dipping. Oh god...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What's happening now?",
    "Client: There's... there's a sudden jolt. The plane shakes violently. People are gasping. The oxygen masks drop down. I'm... I'm fumbling with mine, trying to get it on. My hands are shaking so much.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe higher. I can hear the engines sputtering. The plane is pitching downward. People are screaming. I... I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here with me. You're safe. Take a moment to ground yourself.",
    "Client: Right, right... I'm... I'm here. But in my mind, I'm still on that plane. It's... it's nosediving. The ground is coming up so fast. I can see trees, buildings getting closer. The flight attendants are yelling instructions, but I can barely hear them over the roar of the wind and the screaming passengers.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: We... we hit the ground. There's a deafening crash. Metal tearing, glass shattering. I'm thrown forward, my seatbelt cutting into me. Everything goes dark for a moment. When I come to, there's smoke everywhere. People are moaning, crying. I can smell fuel and... and blood.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My heart's pounding. It feels so real, like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: Take a few deep breaths. Remember, you're safe here. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. Maybe even a 10. I... I need a moment.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take your time. Focus on your breathing.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... okay. I'm... I'm unbuckling my seatbelt. It's stuck at first, but I manage to get it off. There's chaos all around me. People are trying to get out. The emergency exits are jammed. I can hear sirens in the distance.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm... I'm helping the person next to me. They're hurt, bleeding from their head. We're moving towards the front of the plane. The smoke is getting thicker. I'm coughing, my eyes are stinging. We finally reach a gap in the fuselage. I can see daylight.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling as you see the daylight?",
    "Client: Relief... but also terror. We're not safe yet. I'm helping people out. My hands are cut from the sharp metal edges. I can hear the fire crackling, getting closer. The heat is intense.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm outside now. The grass is wet under my feet. I can see the full extent of the crash. The plane is broken in half, smoke billowing from it. There are people scattered all around, some moving, some... some not moving at all.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Overwhelmed. Shocked. I... I can't believe I survived. There's a ringing in my ears. My whole body aches. I'm... I'm sitting on the ground, watching as emergency vehicles arrive. It's... it's surreal.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe an 8. I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a moment to ground yourself again.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* I'm... I'm watching the paramedics and firefighters work. They're rushing around, helping people. I'm... I'm in a daze. Someone puts a blanket around my shoulders. I hadn't even realized I was cold.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking at this moment?",
    "Client: I... I can't believe it's real. Part of me thinks it must be a nightmare. But the pain, the smells, the sounds... they're too vivid. I'm... I'm wondering about the other passengers. How many survived? I feel guilty for being okay when others... others might not have made it.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those feelings. Continue with what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: I'm... I'm being led to an ambulance. They're checking me over. I can hear helicopters overhead. News vans are arriving. It's... it's all a blur. I keep replaying the crash in my mind, wondering if I could have done anything differently.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you survived a traumatic event. Your reactions are normal. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Physically and emotionally drained. The adrenaline is wearing off, and I'm starting to feel the pain more acutely. My ribs hurt when I breathe deeply.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe a 6 or 7. I'm... I'm in the hospital now. They're running tests, taking X-rays. I can hear other survivors in nearby beds. Some are crying, some are on the phone with loved ones.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Take a few deep breaths.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... I'm... I'm here. In your office. But it still feels so vivid.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've done excellent work today. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. Shaky. But also... I don't know. There's a sense of relief, I guess. Like I've faced something I've been avoiding for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. What's your SUDS level as we end this session?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about a 4 now. I'm still a bit on edge, but I feel more... more in control, I suppose.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's take a few moments to debrief and discuss some coping strategies for the rest of your day.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I didn't think I could do this, but I'm glad I did.",
    "Therapist: You showed great courage today. We'll continue to work through this in our future sessions."
