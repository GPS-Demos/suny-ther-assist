    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and describe the home invasion, starting from the moment you first sensed something was wrong.",
    "Client: Okay... I was in my bedroom, studying late at night. It was around 2 AM, and I heard a strange noise downstairs. At first, I thought it might be my parents, but then I remembered they were out of town. My heart started racing...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably about a 4. I'm feeling a bit anxious just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: I got up to check, and as I opened my bedroom door, I heard footsteps coming up the stairs. I froze, panic rising in my chest. I could hear my own heartbeat, it was so loud. I wanted to run, but I couldn't move...",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's going up. Maybe a 6? My palms are getting sweaty just talking about it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The footsteps got closer, and I saw a shadow at the top of the stairs. I tried to scream, but no sound came out. It was like I was paralyzed with fear. Then I saw him - a man in a black mask, holding something... I think it was a crowbar. I felt so helpless, so vulnerable...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating at this moment?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. I feel like I can't breathe properly. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What happened next?",
    "Client: He saw me and started coming towards me. I finally found my voice and screamed. I ran back into my room, slammed the door, and locked it. I could hear him trying to break it down. I was shaking so badly, I could barely dial 911...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I... I'm at a 9. This is really hard. I can almost feel the fear and panic all over again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here now, safe. Keep going.",
    "Client: The police arrived quickly, but those minutes felt like hours. I could hear sirens, shouting, and then... silence. A policewoman knocked on my door, telling me it was safe to come out. But I couldn't move. I was crying uncontrollably...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7? I feel drained, but also relieved, like I'm reliving the moment when I realized I was safe.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing the memory. How did it end?",
    "Client: The police took my statement. They caught the intruder trying to escape through the backyard. I spent the rest of the night at a friend's house. I couldn't be alone. For weeks after, I jumped at every little noise...",
    "Therapist: And your current SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5 now. I feel exhausted, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I survived telling the story again.",
    "Therapist: You did great. Let's take a moment to breathe and ground ourselves."
