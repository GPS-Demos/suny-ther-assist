    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I'm right back there, you know? I can feel the cold sweat on my skin, just like that night. The sound of glass breaking... it's so vivid in my mind. I keep seeing shadows moving in the darkness of my living room.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... anger? Yeah, I'm angry. Angry that this happened to me, that someone invaded my home, my safe space. I feel violated, you know? And helpless. I couldn't do anything to stop it. I just froze.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like a knot in my stomach. My jaw is clenched, and my fists are balled up. I want to hit something, but I also feel this heaviness in my chest. It's hard to breathe sometimes when I think about it.",
    "Therapist: And the fear?",
    "Client: The fear is... it's everywhere. My throat feels tight, and there's this constant tension in my shoulders. I'm always on edge, always waiting for something bad to happen. Even now, sitting here, I keep glancing at the door, half-expecting someone to burst in.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why me?\" And then I feel guilty for even asking that because it could happen to anyone, right? But then I wonder if I did something to deserve this. Did I forget to lock a window? Should I have installed better security? It's this constant cycle of self-blame and then trying to rationalize it.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts affect you day-to-day?",
    "Client: They're... they're exhausting. I'm always checking and double-checking locks. I can't sleep through the night anymore. Every little noise wakes me up. I've lost my job because I couldn't concentrate at work. I feel like I'm not the same person anymore. It's like the old me died that night, and I don't know who I am now.",
    "Therapist: What do you miss most about your old self?",
    "Client: I miss feeling safe. I miss being able to relax in my own home. I miss not jumping at every shadow or sound. I miss being able to trust people. I used to be outgoing, you know? Now I barely leave the house. I miss my independence. Living with my family again at 54... it's not what I imagined for myself.",
    "Therapist: How has your family responded to these changes?",
    "Client: They try to understand, but... I don't think they really get it. They keep telling me to \"get over it\" or \"move on.\" My ex-wife... she's been surprisingly supportive, but I can see the pity in her eyes. My kids, they walk on eggshells around me. It's like they don't know how to talk to me anymore. I feel like I'm letting everyone down.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to tell them if you could?",
    "Client: I... I'd want them to know that I'm trying. That I hate being this way. That I want to be the person I was before, but I don't know how. I'd tell them that their support means everything to me, even when I don't show it. And I'd ask for their patience. This isn't something I can just snap out of.",
    "Therapist: How does sharing that make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a relief, actually. I've been holding so much in. But it's also scary. Admitting all this makes it real, you know? It's like... if I say it out loud, then I have to face it. And facing it means dealing with all these emotions I've been trying to avoid.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you could take towards healing?",
    "Client: I... I guess I could try talking to my family more. Maybe explain what I'm going through instead of shutting them out. And... maybe I could try going for a walk around the block. During the day, when there are people around. Baby steps, right?",
    "Therapist: How does that idea sit with you?",
    "Client: It's terrifying, to be honest. But also... there's a tiny part of me that feels hopeful. Like maybe, just maybe, I can start to reclaim some of my life. It won't be easy, and I'm scared I'll fail. But I'm also tired of living like this. I want to feel like myself again, even if it's a new version of myself.",
    "Therapist: What support do you need to take that step?",
    "Client: I... I think I need someone to hold me accountable. Maybe check in with me, encourage me. And I need to know it's okay if I can't do it right away. That it's okay to have setbacks. I guess I need permission to be kind to myself, as strange as that sounds.",
    "Therapist: How can we work together to provide that support?",
    "Client: Maybe we could set small, weekly goals? And discuss strategies for when I feel overwhelmed or want to back out? I think knowing I'll be coming back here to talk about my progress might help motivate me. And... maybe some techniques for managing anxiety when I'm out in public?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Shall we start now?",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, I think I'm ready. It's scary, but... I want my life back. I want to feel strong again. I know it won't happen overnight, but I'm willing to try. Thank you for... for listening, for understanding. It means more than you know.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Let's take the first step together."
