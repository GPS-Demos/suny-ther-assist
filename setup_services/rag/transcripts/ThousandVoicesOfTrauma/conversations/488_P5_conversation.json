    "Therapist: Hello, Mr. Ahmadi. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Ah, good afternoon, Dr. Thompson. I'm... well, I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. This whole imaginal exposure thing you mentioned last time has been on my mind all week. I've been through some rough patches in my life, you know, with the divorce and all, but thinking about reliving that earthquake... it's different.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: It's just... I've spent years trying to forget that day. The ground shaking, buildings crumbling, the screams... I'm worried that bringing it all back will undo the progress I've made. Plus, with everything else going on in my life - trying to keep my business afloat, dealing with my new living situation - I'm not sure I can handle it.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How do you think this might help?",
    "Client: Well, you've explained that it could help reduce my PTSD symptoms. I suppose I'm hoping it might make the nightmares less frequent, or help me feel more in control when I'm in tall buildings. But I'm skeptical. How can reliving a traumatic event possibly be beneficial?",
    "Therapist: It's about processing the memory. Shall we discuss the process?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I need to understand what I'm getting into here. Will it be like hypnosis? Or will I just be talking about what happened? And how long will it take? I have a business meeting later today, and I'm worried I'll be too shaken up to attend.",
    "Therapist: It's not hypnosis. We'll go through the memory together, step-by-step. It typically takes about 45 minutes.",
    "Client: Forty-five minutes? That seems like an eternity when you're talking about the worst day of your life. But I suppose it's not as long as I feared. Will you be guiding me through it the whole time? I'm not sure I can do this on my own.",
    "Therapist: Yes, I'll be here throughout. We can pause if needed. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's somewhat reassuring. I appreciate your support, Dr. Thompson. I guess knowing you're here with me makes it a bit less daunting. But I'm still concerned about how I'll feel afterwards. Will I be able to function normally? I don't want to be a mess when I leave here.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel emotional. We'll debrief afterwards and ensure you're stable before leaving.",
    "Client: Okay, that makes sense. I'm glad we'll have time to decompress. I have to admit, even though I'm anxious, there's a part of me that's... I don't know, maybe hopeful? If this could help me move past what happened, it might be worth the discomfort. Do you really think this can make a difference?",
    "Therapist: Many find it helpful. Your courage is commendable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Alright, Dr. Thompson. I trust you, and I'm willing to give this a try. I've faced challenges before - starting over after my divorce, adapting to shared living in my 60s. I suppose this is just another hurdle to overcome. Let's do it. Where do we start?",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes. Imagine the day of the earthquake. What do you see?",
    "Client: (Closes eyes, breathing becomes slightly irregular) I... I see the office. My old office, before the quake destroyed it. The sunlight is streaming through the windows. It was such a beautiful day, you know? No one could have predicted... (voice trails off) I can see my desk, the family photo I kept there. My computer screen shows the time: 11:23 AM. That's when it started."
