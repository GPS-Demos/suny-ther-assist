    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Take a deep breath and start describing the home invasion.",
    "Client: Okay... I was in my living room, watching TV late at night. I heard a noise at the back door, like someone was trying to force it open. My heart started racing immediately.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: I froze for a moment, not sure if I was imagining things. Then I heard it again, louder this time. I got up and slowly walked towards the kitchen, where the back door is. My hands were shaking.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling.",
    "Client: As I got closer, I saw the door handle jiggling. I panicked and looked around for something to defend myself with. I grabbed a kitchen knife from the counter. I was terrified, my palms were sweaty, and I could hear my own heartbeat pounding in my ears.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Keep going.",
    "Client: Suddenly, the door burst open. Two men rushed in, both wearing dark clothes and masks. One of them saw me and shouted, \"He's here!\" I was paralyzed with fear. I couldn't move, couldn't scream. The knife felt useless in my hand.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The first man grabbed me, and I finally snapped out of it. I tried to fight back, swinging the knife wildly. I think I managed to cut him, because he yelled in pain. But then the second man hit me hard in the stomach. I doubled over, dropping the knife.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: They pushed me to the ground. One of them held me down while the other started ransacking the place. I could hear drawers being opened, things being thrown around. I felt so helpless, so violated. I kept thinking, \"This is it. They're going to kill me.\"",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. You're safe now.",
    "Client: The one holding me down kept asking where I kept my valuables. His breath smelled of alcohol, and he was pressing his knee into my back. It hurt so much. I told them where my wallet was, hoping they'd just take it and leave.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: They found my wallet and some other electronics. Then they started arguing about whether to tie me up or not. I was silently praying they wouldn't. Suddenly, we heard police sirens in the distance. They panicked and ran out the back door, leaving me on the floor.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel shaken. Reliving it brings back all those feelings of fear and helplessness. But also... I feel a bit proud that I managed to fight back, even if it didn't do much.",
    "Therapist: That's completely understandable. You showed courage.",
    "Client: After they left, I just lay there for a while, afraid to move. When I finally got up, I locked all the doors and windows, then called the police. I was shaking so badly I could barely dial the number.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have felt that way. You're strong for sharing this.",
    "Client: The police came, took my statement, and looked for evidence. But the intruders were never caught. For weeks after, I couldn't sleep properly. Every little noise made me jump. I kept replaying the incident in my mind, wondering if I could have done something differently.",

    "Client: Thank you. I think I need a moment. This session was intense, but I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: Take all the time you need. You did very well today."
