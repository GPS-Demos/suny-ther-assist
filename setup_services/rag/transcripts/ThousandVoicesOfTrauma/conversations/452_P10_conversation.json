    "Therapist: Welcome, Maia. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: Um, honestly? I'm a bit on edge. It's like there's this nervous energy buzzing through me. I keep telling myself it's important, but... yeah, it's not easy.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a quick grounding exercise. Can you name five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: Okay... I see the blue painting on the wall, your desk lamp, the potted plant in the corner, the bookshelf, and the clock ticking away.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, let's begin. Close your eyes and take us back to the day of the cyclone. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I'm in my dorm room. The wind is howling outside, and the rain is pelting against the window so hard I think it might shatter. The power's already gone out, and I'm trying to pack a bag in the dark. My hands are shaking...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: It's about a 6, I think.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: The emergency sirens start blaring. It's so loud, it makes my heart race even faster. I can hear people shouting in the hallway. I grab my backpack and open the door. The corridor is chaos \u2013 students running, some crying. I feel like I can't breathe...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Maia. You're safe here. What do you do in that moment?",
    "Client: I... I freeze for a second. Then I see my friend Lani. She grabs my arm and yells, \"We need to get to the shelter!\" We start running down the stairs. The building is shaking, and I can hear this awful creaking noise...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's up to an 8. My heart's pounding just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Remember, you're here in my office. You're safe. Take another deep breath. What happens as you're running?",
    "Client: We make it outside, and it's... it's like stepping into another world. The rain is so heavy it feels like needles on my skin. The wind is roaring, and I can barely see. Trees are bending like they're made of rubber. We're fighting against the wind to move forward...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm terrified. My legs feel weak, and I'm gripping Lani's hand so tight. I keep thinking, \"We're not going to make it.\" I can hear things crashing around us \u2013 metal, glass, I don't know what...",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Maia. Remember, you survived this. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. It feels so real.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. You're here, you're safe. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: Okay... We're stumbling through the campus. The rain is so heavy I can barely breathe. Suddenly, there's this deafening crack. I look up and see... oh god... a massive tree is falling towards us. Lani screams and pulls me. We dive out of the way, and I feel the ground shake as it crashes down. My heart's in my throat...",
    "Therapist: You're safe, Maia. It's just a memory. What's happening in your body right now?",
    "Client: My... my hands are clammy. I feel like I can't catch my breath. It's like I'm back there...",
    "Therapist: Focus on my voice. You're here in the present. What do you do next in the memory?",
    "Client: We... we keep running. The shelter feels so far away. I slip on the wet grass and fall hard. My knee's bleeding, but the adrenaline is so high I barely feel it. Lani helps me up, and we press on. The wind is so strong it feels like it might lift us off our feet...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: Still a 9. It's so intense.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're handling this well. What happens as you get closer to the shelter?",
    "Client: We finally see the building. There's a crowd of people fighting to get inside. The noise is overwhelming \u2013 the wind, the rain, people shouting. We push our way through. I'm soaked to the bone and shivering. As we get to the door, I hear this horrible groaning sound...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I look back and see the science building's roof peeling off. It's like watching it in slow motion. Pieces of metal and debris are flying through the air. Someone behind us screams, and then we're shoved inside the shelter...",
    "Therapist: You made it to safety. How does that feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of relief and terror. My legs give out, and I sink to the floor. Lani's hugging me, and we're both sobbing. The noise outside is deafening, and the building feels like it's shaking. I'm safe, but I don't feel safe...",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling in trauma. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to an 8, I think. My heart's still racing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Can you describe what you see inside the shelter?",
    "Client: It's packed with people. Some are crying, others look shell-shocked. The emergency lights cast this eerie glow. I can see people I know \u2013 classmates, professors \u2013 but everyone looks different, haunted. The air feels thick and humid, and there's this smell of wet clothes and fear...",
    "Therapist: How long do you stay in the shelter?",
    "Client: It feels like forever. Hours pass, and the storm keeps raging. People are huddled in groups, some praying, others just staring blankly. I keep thinking about my family, wondering if they're okay. The not knowing is torture...",
    "Therapist: That uncertainty must have been very difficult. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's hovering around a 7. Talking about it... it helps, somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing the memory. What happens next?",
    "Client: Eventually, the noise outside starts to die down. It's been maybe 12 hours? Time felt weird. Someone with a megaphone tells us the worst has passed, but we need to stay put. I'm exhausted, but too wired to sleep. I keep replaying everything in my mind...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Maia. How does your body feel as you remember this?",
    "Client: I'm tense. My shoulders are up to my ears, and my jaw hurts from clenching it. But... it's not as overwhelming as before.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. What happens when you're finally able to leave the shelter?",
    "Client: It's... it's like stepping onto another planet. The campus is unrecognizable. Trees are down everywhere, buildings are damaged. The air is thick with this hazy dust. People are wandering around in shock. I see my dorm in the distance \u2013 part of the roof is gone. That's when it really hits me \u2013 everything has changed...",
    "Therapist: That must have been overwhelming. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6. Remembering is hard, but... I feel like I can handle it better now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. How do you feel about your actions during the cyclone?",
    "Client: I... I guess I'm proud I kept moving. I didn't freeze up completely. But there's this guilt too \u2013 why did I survive when others didn't? It doesn't seem fair...",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are common in survivors. Remember, you did the best you could in an impossible situation. What happened in the days following?",
    "Client: It was chaos. No power, limited water. We all pitched in to help with cleanup, but the scale of destruction was overwhelming. I couldn't reach my family for days \u2013 the networks were down. When I finally got through, I broke down crying...",
    "Therapist: That relief must have been intense. How did this experience change you?",
    "Client: It... it made me realize how fragile everything is. I have nightmares still, and loud noises make me jumpy. But it also showed me how strong people can be. The way everyone came together to help each other... it was beautiful in a way.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible resilience. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 4. Talking about it... it helps make it feel less overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. As we wrap up, what's one thing you've learned about yourself through this experience?",
    "Client: I guess... I'm stronger than I thought. And that it's okay to need help. Going through something like that, you can't do it alone.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. You've done amazing work today, Maia. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm tired, but... lighter somehow. Like I've put down a heavy backpack I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's a great metaphor. Let's end with a grounding exercise. Can you tell me three things you're looking forward to this week?",
    "Client: Sure. I'm having dinner with Lani tomorrow. I'm starting a new art class on Thursday. And... I'm actually looking forward to our next session. It's hard, but it helps.",
    "Therapist: Those sound wonderful. You should be very proud of yourself, Maia. We'll pick up here next time."
