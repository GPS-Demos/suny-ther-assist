    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the combat experience you mentioned?",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. It was a hot day in Afghanistan. Our convoy was moving through a small village. The air was thick with dust, and I remember feeling tense, scanning every window and rooftop for potential threats. Suddenly, there was a deafening explosion. The Humvee in front of us erupted in flames.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Everything happened so fast. I heard screaming and gunfire. I tried to radio for help, but my hands were shaking. I saw my friend, Jake, stumble out of the burning vehicle. He was on fire... Oh God, I can still hear his screams.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel upset. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can continue. This is too much.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're handling this bravely.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Okay... I ran towards Jake, trying to help him. The heat was intense, and I could smell burning flesh. I managed to tackle him and roll him on the ground to put out the flames, but he was badly burned. His skin was... it was...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: His skin was charred and peeling. I tried to comfort him, but he was in so much pain. I felt so helpless. The gunfire was getting closer, and I knew we had to move. I picked Jake up, ignoring the searing pain in my hands from his burns. I started running towards cover, praying we'd make it.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Continue.",
    "Client: As I ran, I felt a sharp pain in my leg. I'd been hit. I stumbled but kept going. I couldn't let Jake down. We finally reached a partially collapsed building. I dragged us both inside, my leg leaving a trail of blood. I could hear the battle raging outside, but all I could focus on was Jake's labored breathing.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... overwhelmed. My heart is racing, and I can almost smell the smoke and blood. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little proud? I didn't abandon Jake, even when I was hurt.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have mixed emotions. You're processing this well.",
    "Client: Thank you. It helps to talk about it, even though it's hard. We stayed in that building for what felt like hours. Jake's condition was deteriorating, and I was losing blood. I kept talking to him, trying to keep him conscious. I told him about my plans for when we got home, about the girl I had a crush on back at base. Anything to keep him fighting.",
    "Therapist: You're showing remarkable resilience. Keep going.",
    "Client: Finally, we heard friendly voices. Our squad had fought off the attackers and was searching for survivors. When they found us, Jake was barely breathing, and I was on the verge of passing out. The relief I felt when I saw our medic... it was indescribable. They got us out of there and to a field hospital.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel now, having shared this memory?",
    "Client: It's... intense. I feel drained, but also like a weight has been lifted. I've never talked about this in so much detail before. It's painful, but I think it's helping me process what happened.",
    "Therapist: You've done exceptionally well today. How would you like to conclude?",
    "Client: I think I need a moment to collect myself. Could we maybe sit in silence for a bit? Then perhaps we could talk about some grounding techniques I could use when these memories come up outside of our sessions.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take that moment now."
