    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Singh?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. It's like I was right back there in that cell. The darkness, the cold... it's all so vivid. My heart is still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: It's a mix of emotions. There's fear, definitely. But also... anger. I keep thinking about how young I was when it happened. I was just a child, for heaven's sake. I didn't deserve that. No child does.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. Can you tell me more about that anger?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a fire in my chest. I'm angry at the people who locked me up, but I'm also angry at myself for not being able to stop it. I know that's not rational, I was just a kid, but... I can't help feeling like I should have done something, anything.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice in your body as you connect with that anger?",
    "Client: My fists are clenched. I didn't even realize until you asked. And my jaw feels tight. It's like my whole body is tense, ready to... I don't know, fight or run, I suppose.",
    "Therapist: And what thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep hearing the sound of the cell door slamming shut. It echoes in my head. And I'm thinking... I'm thinking about how that moment changed everything. How it's affected my whole life, even now. I'm 60 years old, and I still wake up sometimes thinking I'm back there.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to share that?",
    "Client: It's... it's both terrifying and liberating. I've kept this bottled up for so long. Talking about it... it's like I'm finally acknowledging that it really happened. That it wasn't just a bad dream.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I feel... vulnerable. Like I've peeled back a layer of armor I've been wearing for decades. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe relief? Like I'm not carrying this secret alone anymore.",
    "Therapist: Mm. How does that relief feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a weight has been lifted. My shoulders feel less tense. I can breathe a bit easier. It's strange, I didn't realize how much energy it took to keep all of this locked away.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you notice that change?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... hopeful, I think. For the first time in a long while. Like maybe I can actually move past this. It's scary, but... it's also exciting. I've spent so much of my life trying to forget, and now I'm wondering what it might be like to actually heal.",
    "Therapist: Can you say more about that hope?",
    "Client: It's like... like seeing a glimmer of light at the end of a very long, dark tunnel. I've always defined myself by this trauma, you know? It's been the lens through which I've viewed everything. But now, I'm starting to imagine a future where it doesn't control me anymore. Where I can be... just me. Not a victim, not a survivor, just... me.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to imagine that future?",
    "Client: It's overwhelming, to be honest. Part of me is excited, but another part is terrified. What if I can't do it? What if I'm too broken? And... and there's guilt too. Like, who am I if I'm not defined by this trauma? It's been a part of me for so long.",
    "Therapist: What do you think about that guilt?",
    "Client: I... I hadn't really thought about it before. But I guess... I guess I feel like I owe it to that little boy I was to keep remembering, to keep hurting. As if moving on would be betraying him somehow. But saying it out loud... it sounds a bit silly, doesn't it?",
    "Therapist: How does it sound to you?",
    "Client: It sounds... it sounds like I've been punishing myself for something that wasn't my fault. Like I've been carrying this burden out of some misplaced sense of loyalty to my younger self. But maybe... maybe the best way to honor that little boy is to heal. To give him the peace and safety he never had back then.",
    "Therapist: What feelings come up as you say that?",
    "Client: I feel... sad. Profoundly sad for that little boy. But also... determined. Like I want to fight for him, for me. And there's a flicker of something else... maybe pride? Pride that I've survived, that I'm here, that I'm finally facing this.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel now?",
    "Client: It's... it's different. I feel drained, but not in a bad way. Like after a good cry. My muscles are relaxed. I feel... present. Grounded. Like I'm fully here in this room for the first time since we started.",
    "Therapist: What's it like to notice that change?",
    "Client: It's... it's remarkable, really. I've spent so much of my life feeling disconnected, like I was watching everything from behind a pane of glass. But right now, I feel... real. Solid. It's scary, but it's also... freeing.",
    "Therapist: As we wrap up, what's one thing you'd like to remember from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's that feeling of hope. The idea that healing is possible. That I can honor my past without being trapped by it. It feels like... like I've taken the first step on a new journey. It's daunting, but... I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing, Mr. Singh. We'll pick up here next time."
