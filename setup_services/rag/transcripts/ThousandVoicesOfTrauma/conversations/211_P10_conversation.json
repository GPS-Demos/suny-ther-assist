    "Therapist: Welcome, Amir. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to dive into some heavy stuff today, and I'm not sure if I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. How would you rate your distress from 0 to 100?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 60? My heart's racing a bit just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Can you describe where you were when this experience began?",
    "Client: Yeah... I was at home. It was late, maybe 11 PM? I remember hearing a loud bang at the door. I... I froze.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see... I see the door shaking. There are shadows moving outside the window. I hear shouting, but it's muffled. My hands are trembling as I reach for my phone.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: The door... it just explodes open. There's wood splinters everywhere. I see... I see men in uniforms. They're yelling, but I can't understand what they're saying. Everything's a blur.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's higher. Maybe 75?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Can you tell me what you're feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. My palms are sweaty. I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Let's take a moment. Focus on your breath. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... okay. I'm... I'm still here.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: They're grabbing me. Rough hands, so many of them. I'm being dragged out of my home. I... I try to ask what's happening, but no one's listening. They're speaking to each other in a language I don't understand.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: It's dark outside. There's a van... a big, black van. The streetlights make everything look surreal. My neighbors... I see some of them peeking out their windows. No one's helping. Why isn't anyone helping?",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Abandoned. Scared. I... I feel so alone.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are valid. Remember, you're here now, you're safe. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: They're shoving me into the van. It's cold, metal floors. The doors slam shut, and it's pitch black. I can't see anything. I... I can smell something metallic. Maybe blood? I don't know. I'm terrified.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's pretty high. Maybe 85?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Remember, you're in control here. We can pause if you need to.",
    "Client: No, I... I want to continue. The van starts moving. I'm being thrown around. My wrists hurt from the handcuffs. I keep asking what's happening, but no one answers. It feels like we're driving for hours.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I can hear muffled voices from the front of the van. Sometimes they laugh. It makes me feel... small. Powerless. I'm trying to figure out what I did wrong, but I can't think of anything.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: Tense. Every muscle is tight. My jaw hurts from clenching it. I feel nauseous, like I might throw up.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. Ground yourself in the present.",
    "Client: *exhales slowly* Okay... I'm here. I'm safe now. But back then... I wasn't.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You're safe now. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The van stops. I hear doors opening, people moving. Suddenly, I'm being pulled out. The light is blinding after being in the dark for so long. I... I see a building. It's gray, imposing. There are high walls with barbed wire.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking this must be a mistake. That they'll realize they have the wrong person. But another part of me is... is terrified that this is it. That I'll disappear and no one will ever know what happened to me.",
    "Therapist: Those are intense thoughts. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 80?",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Remember, you're in control. What happens next?",
    "Client: They're marching me towards the building. I... I try to look around, to see if there's anyone who might help. But it's just guards and high walls. I feel so small, so insignificant.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What do you notice about the environment?",
    "Client: It's hot. The sun is beating down. I can smell... diesel fumes, sweat. There's a metallic taste in my mouth. Fear, I guess. As we get closer to the building, I can hear... sounds. Muffled shouts, clanging metal.",
    "Therapist: How does your body react to these sensations?",
    "Client: I... I feel like I'm going to collapse. My legs are shaking. My heart is pounding so hard I think it might burst out of my chest. I... I want to run, but I know I can't.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... We're inside now. It's cooler, but... oppressive. The air feels heavy. They're taking me down a long corridor. The floors are concrete, the walls are bare. It echoes... every sound seems amplified.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind at this point?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking about my family. Will they know what happened to me? Will anyone look for me? I... I feel so alone, so cut off from everything I know.",
    "Therapist: Those are natural thoughts in such a situation. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 85 again?",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Remember, you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: They stop me in front of a door. It's heavy, metal. One of the guards opens it, and... and they push me inside. It's a cell. Small, maybe 6 by 8 feet. There's a small window, but it's too high to see out of. Just a sliver of light.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about the cell?",
    "Client: It's... it's bare. There's a thin mattress on a metal frame. A toilet in the corner. The walls... they're covered in scratches. Names, dates, tally marks. I... I feel sick looking at them.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: Heavy. Like... like gravity is pulling me down. My legs give out, and I sink to the floor. I... I can't stop shaking. I feel cold, even though it's not really cold in here.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember to breathe. What happens next?",
    "Client: The door... it slams shut. The sound echoes, and then... silence. Complete silence. I... I've never heard silence like that before. It's deafening. I... I start to cry. Quietly at first, then... then I can't stop. I'm sobbing, but trying to muffle it. I don't want them to hear me.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly overwhelming. How are you feeling right now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I feel a tightness in my chest. My hands are clammy. I... I can almost smell that cell again.",
    "Therapist: Let's take a moment. Focus on your surroundings here. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see the office. The painting on the wall. The plant in the corner. I... I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe 70?",
    "Therapist: That's good. You've done really well today. How do you feel about stopping here?",
    "Client: I... I think that's good. It's... it's a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength today, Amir. We'll work on processing this experience further in our next sessions. For now, let's focus on some grounding techniques before you leave.",
    "Client: Okay... thank you. I... I didn't think I could do this, but... but I did.",
    "Therapist: Yes, you did. And that's a significant step in your healing journey. Let's start with some deep breathing exercises..."
