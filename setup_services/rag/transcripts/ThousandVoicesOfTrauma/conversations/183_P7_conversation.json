    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the memory we've been working on?",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. It was when I was 12 years old. My family and I were visiting relatives in our home country. One night, there was a loud banging on the door. Armed men burst in, shouting and pointing guns at us. They accused my father of being a political dissident. I remember feeling frozen with fear as they dragged him away. My mother was screaming, and my younger siblings were crying. I felt so helpless...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: They pushed us into a van and took us to a detention center. It was dark, cold, and smelled of sweat and fear. We were separated from my father. I could hear people crying and shouting from other cells. I held onto my little sister, trying to comfort her, but I was terrified myself. I kept thinking, \"What if they kill us? What if I never see my father again?\"",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) The guards would come by periodically, banging on the cell doors and shouting threats. Sometimes they'd take someone away, and we'd hear screams echoing through the halls. I remember feeling like my chest was going to explode from fear and anxiety. I couldn't eat or sleep properly. The days blurred together, and I lost track of time.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: After what felt like an eternity, but was probably about two weeks, they suddenly released us. They never explained why we were detained or why they let us go. We were reunited with my father, who looked like he'd aged years in that short time. He had bruises and cuts all over his body. I felt a mix of relief and anger... and guilt for not being able to protect him or my family.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: (starting to cry) We left the country soon after that. But the fear never really went away. I still have nightmares about that place, about the guards coming to take us away again. I feel so ashamed that I couldn't do anything to help my family. I was just a child, but I still feel like I should have done something...",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. You were a child in a terrifying situation.",
    "Client: (crying harder) But I can't shake this feeling of guilt and helplessness. Every time I think about it, it's like I'm right back there in that cell, hearing those screams, smelling that awful smell... I feel like that scared little girl all over again.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (taking a shaky breath) It's just... it's affected everything in my life. I have trouble trusting people, especially authority figures. I'm always on edge, waiting for something bad to happen. And I feel like I can never truly relax or feel safe. It's exhausting living like this, always looking over my shoulder, always prepared for the worst.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. You've shown incredible strength.",
    "Client: Thank you... it helps to hear that. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever be able to move past this. Will I always carry this fear and pain with me? I want to be able to live a normal life, to trust people, to feel safe. But it feels so impossible sometimes.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. Each session is a step forward.",
    "Client: I hope you're right. It's just... when I think about that time, it's like all the progress I've made disappears. I can still hear my mother's screams, feel the cold concrete floor of the cell, smell the fear and desperation in the air. It's like my body forgets that I'm safe now, that it's in the past.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Your body is remembering, but you're safe now.",
    "Client: I know that logically, but it's so hard to convince my emotions of that. Sometimes I feel angry at myself for not being able to \"get over it.\" I mean, it was over 30 years ago. Why does it still have such a hold on me? Why can't I just move on?",
    "Therapist: Healing takes time. Be patient with yourself.",
    "Client: I'm trying. It's just... it's affected so many areas of my life. My relationships, my work, even my health. I have trouble sleeping, I get these awful headaches, and sometimes I have panic attacks that come out of nowhere. It's like my body is still living in that constant state of fear and alertness.",
    "Therapist: You're recognizing these effects. That's important progress.",
    "Client: I suppose you're right. It's just frustrating sometimes. I want to be able to enjoy life without this constant shadow hanging over me. I want to be able to form close relationships without fear of abandonment or betrayal. I want to be able to trust that the world isn't always out to get me.",
    "Therapist: Those are good goals. We'll work towards them together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your support and patience. It's not easy talking about this, but I know it's necessary if I want to heal. Sometimes I wonder what my life would have been like if this hadn't happened. Would I be a different person? Would I be happier, more carefree?",
    "Therapist: It's natural to wonder. Focus on the present and future.",
    "Client: You're right. I can't change the past, but I can work on how I deal with it now. It's just... sometimes the memories feel so vivid, so overwhelming. Like when I smell something that reminds me of that cell, or hear a loud noise that sounds like those guards banging on the doors. It's like I'm instantly transported back there.",
    "Therapist: Those are triggers. We'll work on managing them.",
    "Client: I hope so. I want to be able to live in the present, not constantly be dragged back into the past. I want to be able to enjoy life without this constant fear and anxiety. I want to be able to trust people and form meaningful relationships. I know it won't be easy, but I'm willing to do the work.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is admirable. Let's end here for today.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you for listening and for your support. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't judge me for still struggling with this after all these years. I feel drained, but also a bit lighter after talking about it. Same time next week?",
    "Therapist: Yes, same time next week. Take care of yourself."
