    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Susan?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving that moment when I saw my ex-husband hit our daughter... it's bringing up so much. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sound. I can still hear the sharp crack of his hand across her face. It's like it's echoing in my ears even now. And the look in my daughter's eyes... the shock, the pain. I felt so helpless, you know? Like I should have done something sooner, should have seen it coming.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. Scary, but also... I don't know, maybe a little empowering? I mean, I'm here, talking about it. That's something I couldn't have done before. But there's still this overwhelming guilt. I keep thinking, \"Why didn't I leave earlier? Why did I let it get that far?\"",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. How does this connect to your daily life now?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... I'm always on edge, you know? Always waiting for the other shoe to drop. Even now, living with my sister, I find myself flinching at loud noises or sudden movements. And relationships? Forget about it. The thought of trusting someone again... it terrifies me.",
    "Therapist: I hear you. What insights have you gained from this experience?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm starting to see that it wasn't my fault. I mean, logically, I knew that, but feeling it is different. And maybe... maybe I'm stronger than I thought. I got us out eventually. We survived. That counts for something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How do you see this affecting your recovery journey?",
    "Client: It's hard, but... I think it's helping. Facing these memories, as painful as they are, it's like... it's taking away some of their power, you know? And talking about it here, it makes me feel less alone. Less... broken, I guess.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. What's been most challenging?",
    "Client: The nightmares. They've been worse since we started these sessions. It's like my brain is trying to process everything at once. And... um... I've been having urges to drink again. I haven't, but... it's been close a couple times.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that. How are you managing those urges?",
    "Client: I've been trying those grounding techniques we talked about. Sometimes they help. And I've been going to more meetings. It's... it's a day-by-day thing, you know? But I'm trying. I really am.",
    "Therapist: Your effort is commendable. What's giving you hope right now?",
    "Client: My daughter, mostly. She's doing so well in college now. And... maybe this sounds silly, but... me. I'm starting to believe that maybe I can get through this, that maybe I deserve a life without fear. It's a new feeling, but... I like it.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful. How do you want to build on this in our next sessions?",
    "Client: I think... I want to work more on self-forgiveness. And maybe... maybe start thinking about what a healthy relationship might look like for me in the future. Not that I'm ready for one, but... just the idea that it might be possible someday. Is that... is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Those are great goals. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired. Really tired. But also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've put down a bit of the weight I've been carrying. It's exhausting, but... I think it's good. I think I'm on the right path. At least, I hope I am.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Susan. What would you like to focus on this week?",
    "Client: I think I want to try journaling about the positive changes I've noticed. And maybe... maybe reach out to my sponsor a bit more. Just to stay accountable, you know?",
    "Therapist: Excellent plan. Anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: No, I think... I think that's all for today. Thank you. Really. I know I say it every time, but... this means a lot. It's hard, but... I think it's helping. I really do.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Susan. I'll see you next week."
