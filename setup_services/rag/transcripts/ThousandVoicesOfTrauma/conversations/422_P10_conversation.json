    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. Part of me wants to dive in, but another part is screaming to run away. It's like my mind is at war with itself.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Yeah, I think so. Let's do this before I change my mind.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm standing outside this old warehouse. It's dusk, and the air feels heavy. There's a weird energy, you know? Like electricity in the air. I can smell incense... and something else. Something metallic.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear chanting from inside. It's low at first, but it's getting louder. My heart's starting to race. I... I don't want to go in, but my feet are moving forward anyway. It's like I'm not in control of my own body.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your distress level right now, 0 to 100?",
    "Client: Uh... maybe a 40? It's climbing though.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Keep going. What do you see as you enter?",
    "Client: Oh God... (voice trembling) There's a circle of people in dark robes. They're... they're surrounding something. Someone. I can't... I can't see clearly. The chanting is so loud now, it's pounding in my head.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Breathing heavily) They part slightly, and I can see... oh no. No, no, no. There's a young woman on the floor. She's... she's not moving. There's blood. So much blood.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, John. You're here in the office with me. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 75. Maybe 80. I feel sick.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Can you describe what you're feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My stomach's in knots. I'm sweating. I want to run, but I'm frozen in place. Just like I was then.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next in the memory?",
    "Client: The leader, he... he turns to me. His eyes are wild. He's holding a knife, dripping with blood. He says, \"You're one of us now. There's no turning back.\" I... I can't breathe. I can't...",
    "Therapist: John, take a slow, deep breath. You're safe here. What do you see around you in this room?",
    "Client: (Gasping) I... I see the bookshelf. Your desk. The... the plant in the corner.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, can you continue? What happened after the leader spoke to you?",
    "Client: I... I wanted to scream, to run, but I couldn't move. The others, they started coming towards me. Their hands... their hands were reaching out, trying to grab me. I could smell the blood. It was overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's at 90. Maybe higher. I feel like I'm going to pass out.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well, John. Remember, you survived this. You're here now, safe. Can you tell me what you did next?",
    "Client: I... I finally found my voice. I screamed. I pushed past them and ran. I ran so hard, so fast. I could hear them behind me, their footsteps echoing. But I didn't stop. I couldn't stop.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You got out. You're safe now. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Breathing deeply) Yeah... yeah, I did get out. But the guilt... the guilt of leaving that woman there...",
    "Therapist: We'll work through that guilt. For now, focus on the fact that you survived. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. But I feel... I don't know. Maybe a little lighter? Like I've let something out that's been trapped inside for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's coming down. Maybe... 65?",
    "Therapist: That's good. Can you tell me more about what happened after you ran out?",
    "Client: I just kept running. I didn't know where I was going. It was dark, and I was disoriented. I remember stumbling, falling. My hands were scraped from hitting the pavement. But I got up and kept going.",
    "Therapist: You showed incredible strength. What were you thinking during this?",
    "Client: I... I kept thinking they were right behind me. That they'd catch me and drag me back. I was terrified of what they'd do to me if they caught me. But mostly... mostly I kept seeing that woman's face. I felt like I'd abandoned her.",
    "Therapist: It's important to remember you were in survival mode. How long did you run?",
    "Client: It felt like hours, but it was probably only about 20 minutes. I ended up in a busy area with streetlights and people. I... I collapsed on a bench, gasping for air.",
    "Therapist: What did you do then?",
    "Client: I... I couldn't think straight. I was in shock, I guess. A couple stopped and asked if I was okay. I must have looked a mess. They called the police.",
    "Therapist: That must have been overwhelming. How are you feeling now, recounting this?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. But I feel like I'm starting to process it differently. Like I'm watching it happen to someone else, almost.",
    "Therapist: That's a good sign. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's down to about 50 now. Still there, but... manageable.",
    "Therapist: You're doing excellent work, John. Can you tell me about what happened when the police arrived?",
    "Client: They... they took my statement. I was still shaking, could barely get the words out. They wanted me to go to the hospital, but I refused. I just wanted to go home.",
    "Therapist: How did you feel about talking to the police?",
    "Client: Scared. Confused. Part of me was relieved, like maybe they could do something. But another part... another part was terrified that the cult would find out I'd talked.",
    "Therapist: That's a very normal reaction. What happened next?",
    "Client: They... they took me home. My wife was frantic. I couldn't tell her everything. I was too ashamed, too scared. I just said I'd been mugged.",
    "Therapist: How did keeping that secret affect you?",
    "Client: It ate at me. Still does. I've never told anyone the full story until now. It's like... like I've been carrying this massive weight all these years.",
    "Therapist: You're incredibly brave for sharing this, John. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Drained. But also... I don't know. Maybe a little hopeful? Like maybe I can start to move past this.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive outlook. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 30. I feel... wrung out, but calmer.",
    "Therapist: You've done remarkable work today, John. How do you feel about ending the session here?",
    "Client: I think... I think that's good. I feel like I've climbed a mountain or something.",
    "Therapist: That's an apt description. You've shown incredible courage. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we wrap up.",
    "Client: (Deep breaths) Okay. Yeah. I... thank you. This was hard, but... I think it was important.",
    "Therapist: It absolutely was. We'll continue to work through this in our future sessions. For now, be kind to yourself. You've done something very difficult and very brave today.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you... really. I feel like I've taken a first step towards... I don't know. Healing, maybe?",
    "Therapist: That's exactly what this is. We'll pick up here next time. Take care, John.",
    "Client: Thank you. I will. See you next week."
