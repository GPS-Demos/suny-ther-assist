    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's always hard to go back to that moment, you know? Reliving the violence I witnessed, it's... it's overwhelming. I can still hear the shouting, the sound of glass breaking. My heart is racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you this time?",
    "Client: The fear. It was so palpable. I remember feeling frozen, unable to move or speak. And the helplessness... God, the helplessness was crushing. I wanted to do something, anything, but I couldn't. I just stood there, watching it all unfold.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How does it feel to talk about it now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard, but different. I'm not as paralyzed as I was then. I can feel my body tensing up, but I'm here, you know? I'm present. It's like... I'm observing the memory rather than being trapped in it. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How does this relate to your day-to-day experiences?",
    "Client: Well, I've noticed that I'm less jumpy lately. Like, when I hear a loud noise, I don't immediately go into panic mode. I still feel anxious, but it's... manageable? I think going through these sessions is helping me separate the past from the present.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Sarah. What else have you noticed?",
    "Client: I... I've been able to talk about it a bit with my husband. Not in detail, but just acknowledging that it happened. Before, I couldn't even mention it without breaking down. Now, it's still painful, but I can say the words without feeling like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: How has that affected your relationship?",
    "Client: It's been... good, actually. I think he understands me better now. He's been really supportive, giving me space when I need it but also being there when I want to talk. I feel less alone in this, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful. What's been challenging lately?",
    "Client: The nightmares are still pretty bad. I wake up in cold sweats, heart pounding. And sometimes, during the day, I'll see something that reminds me of the incident and I'll just... freeze up. It's like my mind goes blank and I can't think or move.",
    "Therapist: How do you handle those moments?",
    "Client: I've been trying those grounding techniques we talked about. Sometimes I count things I can see or touch. Other times I focus on my breathing. It helps, but... it's still hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work, Sarah. What's your takeaway from today?",
    "Client: I think... I'm stronger than I thought. Going through that memory again was tough, but I did it. And I'm here, talking about it. That's... that's something, right? I mean, a few months ago, I couldn't even imagine doing this.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm scared, but I want to keep going. I want my life back, you know? I want to feel safe again, to enjoy things without constantly looking over my shoulder. So yeah, I'm in. It's hard, but I think it's worth it.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is commendable. Shall we schedule our next session?",
    "Client: Yes, please. Same time next week? And... thank you. For everything. I know I have a long way to go, but I feel like I'm finally moving forward instead of being stuck in that moment.",
    "Therapist: You're very welcome, Sarah. I'll see you next week."
