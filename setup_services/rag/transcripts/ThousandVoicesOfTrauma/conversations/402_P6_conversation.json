    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Take a deep breath and begin when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm at the office. It's a typical Tuesday morning. I'm walking towards the break room to get some coffee. Suddenly, I hear a loud crash behind me. I spin around and see that the heavy filing cabinet has toppled over. Papers are everywhere. My coworker, Ali, is on the ground. He's not moving. I... I freeze. I can't breathe. My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um... probably a 6. My palms are getting sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Keep going.",
    "Client: I snap out of it and rush over to Ali. There's blood... so much blood. His head is bleeding. I'm panicking, shouting for help. My voice sounds strange, like it's not even mine. People are running in, someone's calling an ambulance. I can't stop staring at Ali. His eyes are open, but he's not responding. I keep thinking, \"Is he dead? Did I just watch someone die?\"",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. My chest feels tight. I can almost smell the metallic scent of blood.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I know. It just feels so real. The paramedics arrive. They're working on Ali, asking questions. I can barely speak. I keep replaying the sound of the crash in my head. Over and over. Someone guides me away, sits me down. I'm shaking uncontrollably. I can't stop thinking that if I had been a few steps back, it could have been me under that cabinet.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's still an 8. Maybe even a 9 now. My hands are trembling.",
    "Therapist: That's a challenging moment. You're handling it bravely.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's... it's hard. I remember sitting there for what felt like hours. People kept asking if I was okay, but I couldn't answer. I just kept seeing Ali's face, the blood. I felt so helpless, so useless. Why couldn't I do more? Why did I freeze?",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... maybe a 7? I'm feeling a bit calmer, but still really upset.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. Keep going.",
    "Client: Eventually, someone tells me Ali's been taken to the hospital. He's alive, but in critical condition. I feel this wave of relief, but also guilt. Why am I relieved when he's so badly hurt? The office is in chaos. People are crying, talking in hushed voices. I just sit there, numb. I can't process what happened. It all feels like a horrible nightmare.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6 now. I'm feeling drained, but less panicky.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: I think I can keep going. It's tough, but... I want to work through this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Take your time.",
    "Client: The rest of the day is a blur. I remember being sent home early. I couldn't drive - my hands were shaking too much. A coworker gave me a ride. At home, I just sat on my bed, staring at the wall. I kept replaying the scene in my head. The crash, the blood, Ali's unresponsive face. I felt so alone, so scared. I couldn't sleep that night. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the accident.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 5. I'm feeling sad, but less anxious.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing it well.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's still hard, but talking about it... it helps. I've never really told anyone all the details before. It's like... like I'm finally letting it out.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel now that we're nearing the end of the exercise?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. My SUDS is probably a 4 now. I feel drained, but also... lighter? Like I've released some of the weight I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. You did very well today."
