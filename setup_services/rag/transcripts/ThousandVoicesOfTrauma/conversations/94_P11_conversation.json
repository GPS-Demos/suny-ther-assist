    "Therapist: How are you feeling after today's imaginal exposure, Mrs. Thompson?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. Reliving that moment when the police officer approached me during the protest... it brought back so many emotions. I can still hear the shouting, feel the tension in the air. It's like I was right back there, you know?",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The fear. It was overwhelming. I remember thinking, \"This isn't right. I'm just an old lady standing here peacefully.\" But when I saw that officer coming towards me with such aggression... I felt so helpless, so vulnerable. It's silly, isn't it? At my age, feeling like a scared little girl.",
    "Therapist: It's not silly at all. How did reliving it feel today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. But different, somehow. I noticed I could breathe through it better this time. I kept reminding myself I was here, in your office, safe. It still hurt, but... I felt stronger, if that makes sense?",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What else did you notice?",
    "Client: Well, I realized how much anger I still carry. Not just at that officer, but at the whole system. I've always prided myself on being a law-abiding citizen, you know? But that day... it shattered something in me. My trust, I suppose. And reliving it, I felt that anger bubbling up again.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger connect to your daily life now?",
    "Client: Oh, it's there all the time. I get so tense when I see police cars now. I avoid going to town events or anywhere there might be crowds. It's like I'm always on edge, waiting for something bad to happen. But today, talking through it... I realized how much that fear is controlling me.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. What do you think about that?",
    "Client: Well, it makes me sad. And frustrated. I don't want to live like this, always afraid. I want to enjoy my retirement, spend time with my grandkids without constantly looking over my shoulder. But it's hard to let go of that fear, you know?",
    "Therapist: Understandable. How might you work on that?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe I could start small? Like, going for walks in the park again, even if there are more people around. Or attending a community meeting. Baby steps, right?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: It's tough, I won't lie. These sessions drain me. But... I also feel like I'm making progress. Slow progress, but still. And I want to get better, I really do. For myself, for my family. So yes, I want to keep going. It's worth it, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is commendable. What else is on your mind?",
    "Client: I've been thinking... maybe I could use this experience somehow. Turn it into something positive? I've always been passionate about civil rights, and now I have this... firsthand experience. Maybe I could speak to young people, share my story. Help them understand the importance of peaceful protest, and also the trauma that can come from police brutality. Do you think that's a crazy idea?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. How might that help you?",
    "Client: I think... it might help me feel less powerless. Like I'm taking control of my narrative, you know? Instead of being a victim, I'd be... I don't know, a survivor? An educator? It's scary to think about, but also... exciting. Like maybe some good could come from all this pain.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful perspective shift. How does it feel?",
    "Client: It feels... hopeful. For the first time in a long while, I feel hopeful. Like maybe I can move past this, not just for myself but for others too. Is that... is that normal? To feel almost... grateful for such a terrible experience?",
    "Therapist: It's a common part of healing. What else?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm starting to forgive myself too. For a long time, I felt ashamed. Like maybe I did something to provoke that officer, or I should have been stronger, fought back somehow. But now I'm realizing... I did the best I could in that moment. And that's okay. I survived, and now I'm here, working on getting better. That's something to be proud of, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How does that realization affect you?",
    "Client: It's like... a weight lifting off my shoulders. I've been carrying so much guilt, so much self-doubt. But talking through it, reliving it in a safe space... it's helping me see things more clearly. I'm not saying I'm over it, not by a long shot. But I feel like I'm on the right path. And that feels... really good.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful progress. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm tired, but... a good kind of tired, you know? Like I've done something important. Thank you, doctor. I know I have a long way to go, but I'm feeling more optimistic than I have in a long time. Same time next week?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Take care, Mrs. Thompson."
