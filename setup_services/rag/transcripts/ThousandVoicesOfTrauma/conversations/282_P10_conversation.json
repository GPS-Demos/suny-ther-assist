    "Therapist: Welcome, Raj. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a part of me that wants to get this over with, but another part that's dreading it. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: Uh, I'd say about a 40. It's not terrible, but definitely uncomfortable.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we're here to process this together. Are you ready to begin the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Yes, let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see the prison gates. They're massive, intimidating. The guard is escorting me through, and I can hear the heavy clang as they shut behind me. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... God, I feel so small. Like I'm being swallowed up. My heart is racing, and I can feel sweat forming on my forehead. It's like all the air has been sucked out of my lungs.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: They're taking my belongings. My watch, my wallet, even my shoelaces. It's humiliating. I keep thinking, \"This can't be happening. Not to me.\" But it is. I'm... I'm shaking.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 65. This is harder than I thought it would be.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Raj. Take a deep breath. What happens next?",
    "Client: They're... they're leading me to the cell block. The noise is deafening. Other inmates are shouting, some are laughing. I can smell... it's a mix of disinfectant and something else, something unpleasant. I feel like I might be sick.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The cell... it's so small. Just a bunk, a toilet, and a tiny desk. The door slams shut, and I... I break down. I'm sobbing, but trying to be quiet. I don't want anyone to hear me. I keep thinking about my family, my job, everything I've lost. It's... it's crushing me.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind at this moment?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking, \"This is it. This is the end of everything.\" My career, my reputation, my relationships... they're all gone. I feel so ashamed, so... worthless. I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 80 now. This is really intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember to breathe.",
    "Client: I... I can hear my cellmate coming in. He's huge, covered in tattoos. I'm terrified. I try to make myself as small as possible, but he notices me. He... he asks what I'm in for. I can barely speak. My voice is trembling when I answer. I'm sure he can see how scared I am.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's tense. Every muscle is tight. My stomach is churning, and I feel light-headed. I keep clenching and unclenching my fists, trying to... to ground myself somehow.",
    "Therapist: Keep going, Raj. You're doing great.",
    "Client: The first night is... it's hell. I can't sleep. Every sound makes me jump. I keep thinking someone's going to come for me. The bed is hard, the pillow is thin, and I'm cold. So cold. I pull the blanket tighter, but it doesn't help. I... I start crying again, silently. I'm thinking about my ex-wife, my kids. Will they ever forgive me? Will I ever see them again?",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still around 80. Maybe even 85. This is really difficult.",
    "Therapist: You're handling it well. Take a deep breath and continue.",
    "Client: The next morning, it's... it's surreal. The routine starts. Wake-up call, breakfast, yard time. I'm... I'm in a daze. I can't believe this is my life now. In the yard, I stay close to the wall, trying to be invisible. But I can feel eyes on me. I'm fresh meat, and they know it.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. But also numb. It's like I'm watching myself from outside my body. I keep thinking, \"This isn't me. This can't be happening to me.\" But it is. It's real, and I can't escape it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Raj. Stay with it.",
    "Client: I... I make it through the first week somehow. But each day feels like an eternity. The monotony is... it's suffocating. Same routine, same faces, same fears. I start to lose track of time. Is it Tuesday? Friday? Does it even matter anymore?",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind during these days?",
    "Client: I... I keep replaying the events that led me here. The mistakes, the choices. I feel so much regret, so much anger at myself. But also... also this deep, overwhelming sadness. I've lost everything. My life as I knew it is over.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 75 now. It's not as intense, but it's... it's a constant ache.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I start to notice changes in myself. I'm becoming harder, more guarded. I don't make eye contact anymore. I've learned to keep to myself, to be invisible. But inside, I'm... I'm dying. Every day feels like a battle just to keep going.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's devastating. I don't recognize myself anymore. I look in the mirror and I see a stranger. A broken, hollow version of who I used to be. I... I start to have thoughts... dark thoughts. About ending it all.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing that, Raj. Remember, you're safe now. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 90 now. Talking about those thoughts... it's really hard.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing well.",
    "Client: I... I manage to push those thoughts away. I start focusing on my family, on the hope of seeing them again. It's the only thing that keeps me going. I start counting days, then weeks, then months. Time moves so slowly, but... but it does move.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with the passing time?",
    "Client: I... I start reading. Anything I can get my hands on. It's an escape. For a few hours each day, I can forget where I am. I also start exercising in my cell. Push-ups, sit-ups, anything to keep my body and mind occupied.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive coping strategy. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling a bit calmer. Talking about how I coped... it's less intense than remembering the early days. My SUDS is probably around 70 now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's continue.",
    "Client: As time goes on, I... I start to adapt. Not in a good way, but... I learn the unwritten rules. How to avoid trouble, how to blend in. I make a few acquaintances, not friends, but people I can talk to. It makes the days a little more bearable.",
    "Therapist: How does this adaptation affect you?",
    "Client: It's... it's a double-edged sword. On one hand, I feel safer, more in control. But on the other... I feel like I'm losing myself. Like I'm becoming institutionalized. It scares me.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 65. Talking about the later part of my time there... it's not as intense as the beginning.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Raj. Let's start to wrap up the exposure. Can you tell me about your last day there?",
    "Client: The last day... it's surreal. I wake up and for a moment, I forget I'm leaving. Then it hits me, and I... I feel this rush of emotions. Relief, excitement, but also... fear. Fear of the outside world, of how much has changed.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. How did you feel as you were leaving?",
    "Client: As I'm walking out, I... I feel like I'm in a dream. The same gates that seemed so intimidating when I came in now look... different. Like a barrier between my old life and my new one. I'm given back my belongings, and putting on my own clothes feels strange. As I step outside, the sunlight is... it's overwhelming. I have to shield my eyes. The world seems so big, so loud. I... I feel lost.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Raj. You've done incredibly well. What's your final SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 50 now. Talking about leaving... it's a mix of emotions. Relief, but also anxiety about what comes next.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant improvement. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained, honestly. But also... I feel like I've faced something I've been avoiding for a long time. It's painful, but... but maybe necessary.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great courage today, Raj. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay... thank you. I... I think I need that.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's start with some deep breathing exercises..."
