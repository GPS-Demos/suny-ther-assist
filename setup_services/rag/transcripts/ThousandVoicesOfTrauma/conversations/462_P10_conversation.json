    "Therapist: Welcome, Arjun. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. Talking about my experiences in the cult always brings up a lot of mixed emotions. Part of me wants to get it out, but another part just wants to run away and forget it all.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, okay. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Close your eyes and take us back to a significant moment in the cult. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see the main hall of our compound. It's dimly lit, with candles everywhere. The air is thick with incense, and I can hear soft chanting in the background. I'm sitting cross-legged on the floor, surrounded by other members. Our leader, Guru Prakash, is at the front, perched on his ornate chair.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's happening?",
    "Client: Guru Prakash is speaking, his voice low and hypnotic. He's talking about sacrifice, about letting go of our earthly attachments. I... I feel a knot forming in my stomach. I know what's coming.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: Um, about a 6... maybe 7.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: He's... he's asking for volunteers. People who are ready to prove their devotion. My palms are sweaty, and I'm trying not to make eye contact. But then I hear my name. \"Arjun,\" he says, \"You've been with us for two years now. Are you ready to show your commitment?\"",
    "Therapist: What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I stand up. My legs feel like jelly. Everyone's eyes are on me, and I can feel their expectation. Guru Prakash is smiling, but it doesn't reach his eyes. They're cold, calculating. I walk to the front, each step feeling like a mile.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Terrified. Confused. Part of me still wants to please him, to be the perfect devotee. But another part is screaming to run. My SUDS is... probably an 8 now.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: Guru Prakash hands me a small knife. He says, \"To truly let go, we must be willing to sacrifice what we hold dear.\" He... he points to my long hair. I've been growing it out since I joined the cult. It's... it's part of my identity now.",
    "Therapist: And then?",
    "Client: I... I take the knife. My hand is shaking. I can hear murmurs of encouragement from the crowd. \"Do it, Arjun,\" they say. \"Show your faith.\" I grab a fistful of my hair, and... and I start cutting. It's jagged, uneven. Chunks of hair fall to the floor. I can feel tears running down my face, but I don't stop.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I... I hate this. I hate that I'm doing this to myself. But I also feel... proud? Like I'm proving something. It's so messed up. I finish cutting, and there's a pile of hair at my feet. Guru Prakash is beaming, telling everyone how brave I am. But I just feel... empty.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. God, I can still feel the weight of that moment.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Arjun. Take a few deep breaths.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... okay. After the cutting, Guru Prakash embraces me. He tells me I'm special, that I'm destined for great things in the group. Part of me feels elated at his praise, but there's this growing pit in my stomach. Like I've crossed a line I can't uncross.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: Tense. My shoulders are hunched, and my jaw is clenched. I can feel a headache coming on. It's like... like my body knows something's wrong, even if my mind is still buying into it all.",
    "Therapist: Stay present with those sensations. What happens after the ceremony?",
    "Client: I... I go back to my room. It's tiny, barely bigger than a closet. I catch a glimpse of myself in the small mirror on the wall. My hair... it's a mess. Uneven, choppy. I barely recognize myself. And that's when it hits me - that was the point. To make me lose myself, to reshape me into what they wanted.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization make you feel?",
    "Client: Angry. So, so angry. At Guru Prakash, at the cult, but mostly at myself. How could I let this happen? I was a successful businessman before this. I had a life, friends, family. And now... now I'm this shell of a person, willing to mutilate myself for some twisted sense of belonging.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still at 9. My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Focus on your breathing.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... okay. I'm sitting on my bed now, running my hands through what's left of my hair. And I start to cry. Not the quiet tears from before, but deep, body-wracking sobs. I'm mourning... mourning the person I used to be, the life I left behind.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. It's okay to let it out.",
    "Client: I... I cry for what feels like hours. My throat is raw, my eyes are swollen. And in the middle of it all, there's a knock at the door. It's one of the other members, checking on me. She tells me how proud everyone is, how I've set an example. And I... I smile and thank her. But inside, something's shifted. A small part of me has woken up, and it's screaming that this isn't right.",
    "Therapist: What do you do with that realization?",
    "Client: I... I push it down. I'm not ready to face it yet. Instead, I throw myself even deeper into the cult's teachings. I volunteer for every task, attend every session. I'm trying to drown out that voice of doubt with busywork and devotion. But it's always there, in the back of my mind, growing louder each day.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained. My SUDS is down to about a 7. Reliving this... it's exhausting. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, clarity maybe? Like I'm seeing things from a new perspective.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress, Arjun. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: Okay... *deep breath* I'm here. I'm safe. This is in the past.",
    "Therapist: Well done. Can you tell me one thing you've learned from this experience?",
    "Client: I... I think I've realized how gradual the process of losing yourself can be. It wasn't one big moment, but a series of small compromises. And how even in the darkest times, there was still a part of me fighting to get out.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How do you feel about ending the exposure here?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think that's good. It's a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: You did incredibly well today, Arjun. Let's take a few minutes to decompress before we wrap up.",
    "Client: Thank you. This... this wasn't easy, but I think it was important.",
    "Therapist: It absolutely was. We'll continue working through this in our future sessions."
