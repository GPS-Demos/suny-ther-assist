    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving that home invasion... it brings back so many memories I've tried to forget. My heart's still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The fear. The absolute terror of realizing someone was in our home. I keep thinking about how helpless I felt, unable to protect my wife. She was so scared, and I... I couldn't do anything.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... difficult. Very difficult. But, um, maybe not as bad as I thought it would be? I mean, it was still awful, but I didn't feel like I was completely losing control like I feared I might.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant observation. What do you make of that?",
    "Client: Well, I suppose it means I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. It's just... it's hard to shake the feeling of vulnerability, you know? Even now, living with my daughter and her family, I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night, convinced I hear someone breaking in.",
    "Therapist: How does that relate to your PTSD symptoms?",
    "Client: I guess it's all connected, isn't it? The nightmares, the constant vigilance, the anxiety... it all stems from that one night. But going through it again in my mind, it's like... I'm starting to see it as a memory rather than an ongoing threat.",
    "Therapist: That's an important distinction. How might this shift impact your daily life?",
    "Client: I... I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I could start feeling safer? Perhaps I won't need to check the locks so many times before bed. It's exhausting, you know, being on high alert all the time. My family, they try to understand, but I know it worries them.",
    "Therapist: What strategies have you found helpful during this process?",
    "Client: The breathing exercises we've practiced have been surprisingly effective. And, um, reminding myself that I'm here now, safe, not back in that moment. It's hard, but it helps ground me.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent tools. How do you feel about continuing with the exposures?",
    "Client: It's scary, I won't lie. But I think... I think it's helping. I want to feel normal again, to enjoy time with my grandkids without constantly looking over my shoulder. So, yes, I want to keep going.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is commendable. Any final thoughts on today's session?",
    "Client: I'm grateful, actually. For the first time in a long while, I feel like there might be a light at the end of this very dark tunnel. It's not easy, but... I'm starting to believe I can get through this.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. We'll continue working together towards your recovery.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I appreciate your guidance through this. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't judge. I know I'm not an easy patient, especially given our age difference, but you've been incredibly patient and supportive.",
    "Therapist: Your progress is a testament to your strength. Shall we schedule our next session?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I'm nervous but... also a bit hopeful. That's new for me. Let's keep moving forward."
