    "Therapist: Good morning, Mrs. Chen. How are you feeling today as we prepare for our imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: Good morning, Doctor. I... I'm feeling a bit uneasy, to be honest. My hands are a bit shaky, and my heart's beating faster than usual. But I suppose that's to be expected, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: That's perfectly normal. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's... let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm at the bank. It's a Tuesday afternoon, and I've just finished my shift at the library. The air conditioning is on full blast, and I can feel goosebumps on my arms. There's a faint smell of cleaning solution in the air. I'm standing in line, waiting to deposit my paycheck.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud bang. At first, I think someone's dropped something heavy, but then I hear screaming. Three men in black masks burst through the door, waving guns. One of them shouts, \"Everybody down!\" My legs feel weak, and I collapse to the floor.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'd say... about 60.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The men are yelling at the tellers, demanding money. I can hear a child crying somewhere behind me. I want to turn and look, but I'm too afraid to move. My heart is pounding so hard I can feel it in my throat.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking, \"This can't be happening. Not here, not to me.\" I'm worried about my husband. We were supposed to meet for dinner later. What if I never see him again? Oh God, the thought makes me feel sick.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember to breathe. What do you notice around you?",
    "Client: The floor... it's cold against my cheek. I can smell the dust and feel tiny grit under my fingers. Someone near me is whimpering softly. I want to reach out, to offer comfort, but I'm paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's higher. Maybe 75?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel the chair beneath you.",
    "Client: *takes a deep breath* Okay... okay. I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: One of the men is getting agitated. He's shouting at a teller, saying she's too slow. He fires a shot into the ceiling, and I flinch. Plaster dust rains down, and I can taste it in my mouth. The child starts wailing louder.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My muscles are so tense they're aching. My mouth is dry, and I feel like I can't swallow. There's a ringing in my ears from the gunshot.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What happens next?",
    "Client: Sirens. I hear sirens in the distance, getting closer. The robbers start panicking. One of them grabs a young woman and drags her to her feet. He's using her as a shield, pressing his gun to her head. She's sobbing, begging him not to hurt her.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling seeing this?",
    "Client: Terrified. Helpless. I want to do something, but I know if I move, I might get shot. The guilt... it's overwhelming. I should do something, shouldn't I?",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're not responsible for the actions of the robbers. How high is your distress now?",
    "Client: It's... it's pretty high. Maybe 85?",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: *takes several deep breaths* Okay... I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The police are outside now. I can hear them on megaphones, telling the robbers to surrender. The man holding the woman is shouting back, making demands. The other two are arguing about what to do. One of them wants to give up, but the leader is adamant about fighting.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind at this point?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm praying. Silently begging for this to end, for everyone to be safe. I'm thinking about my family, wondering if I'll ever see them again. The fear is... it's suffocating.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud crash. The police have broken through a window. Everything happens so fast. There's shouting, more gunshots. I curl into a ball, trying to make myself as small as possible. Someone falls near me \u2013 I don't know if it's a robber or a hostage.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling physically right now?",
    "Client: I'm shaking uncontrollably. My teeth are chattering. I can feel my heart racing, and I'm struggling to breathe. The adrenaline... it's making me feel nauseous.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: It's... it's chaos. People are screaming, running. Someone trips over me as they're trying to escape. I can smell gunpowder and... and blood. I'm too scared to open my eyes. Then suddenly, someone's touching me. I flinch, but it's a police officer. He's telling me it's over, that I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: And how do you feel in that moment?",
    "Client: Relief... overwhelming relief. But also disbelief. I can't stop shaking. The officer helps me up, but my legs are so weak. As he leads me out, I see... I see bodies on the floor. I don't know if they're dead or just injured. I feel... I feel numb.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 80? But it feels different now. Like... like I'm starting to come down from it.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you tell me five things you see in this room right now?",
    "Client: *opens eyes* Um... I see the painting on the wall, the plant in the corner, your desk, the bookshelf, and the clock.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, four things you can touch?",
    "Client: The armrest of the chair, my necklace, the fabric of my pants, and... and my wedding ring.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Three things you can hear?",
    "Client: The ticking of the clock, a car passing outside, and the hum of the air conditioner.",
    "Therapist: Great. Two things you can smell?",
    "Client: Your coffee and... is that lavender? From the diffuser?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it is. And finally, one thing you can taste?",
    "Client: The mint from the tea you offered me earlier.",
    "Therapist: Wonderful job, Mrs. Chen. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling more present. My heart rate is slowing down. I still feel a bit shaky, but... but I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: You did an incredible job today. How do you feel about the session?",
    "Client: It was... it was intense. Harder than I expected. But... but I also feel like I've accomplished something. Like maybe... maybe I'm starting to take back control.",
    "Therapist: That's a great perspective. You showed immense courage today. How would you rate your distress now?",
    "Client: It's lower now. Maybe... maybe a 40?",
    "Therapist: That's a significant improvement. Well done. Let's take a few minutes to discuss what you experienced and how you can use these techniques at home.",
    "Client: Okay. I... I think I'm ready for that. Thank you, Doctor. For helping me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Mrs. Chen. Remember, you're the one doing the hard work here. I'm just guiding you. Shall we continue?",
    "Client: Yes, let's continue. I'm... I'm feeling more prepared now."
