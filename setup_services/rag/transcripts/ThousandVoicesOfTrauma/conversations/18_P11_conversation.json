    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. That memory of the domestic violence incident... it felt so real, like I was right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sounds, I think. The shouting, the breaking glass... it was like I could hear it all again. And the fear. God, the fear was so intense. It reminded me of being in combat, you know? That same feeling of not knowing if you're going to make it out alive.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was tough. Really tough. But... I don't know, maybe a little different than before? Like, I could see it happening, but I also knew I was here, safe in this room. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Can you say more about that?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... I was there, but I wasn't. I could feel my body tensing up, my breath getting short, but I could also feel the chair I was sitting in, hear your voice guiding me. It's weird, but it felt like I had a foot in both worlds.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful observation. How does this relate to your everyday experiences?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe it's showing me that my flashbacks aren't reality? Like, they're memories, not current threats. I've been having such a hard time with that, especially since retiring. The depression doesn't help either. Sometimes it feels like I'm still in danger all the time.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. How might this help moving forward?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I can try to remember that feeling of being in two places when I have flashbacks at home? Like, notice the memory but also ground myself in the present? I don't know if I can do it, but it seems worth a try.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent strategy. How else has this impacted you?",
    "Client: It's made me realize how much this has affected my relationship with my partner. They've been so patient, but I know my reactions have been hard on them. Maybe... maybe I can talk to them about this, explain what I'm going through better?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive step. What else?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'm starting to see that facing these memories isn't going to break me. It's hard, really hard, but I'm still here. I'm still fighting. And that feels... I don't know, empowering, I guess?",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength today. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: Scared, honestly. But also... determined? Like, I've made it this far, I want to see where this can go. I want my life back, you know? I want to feel safe in my own home, in my own skin. I'm tired of letting these experiences control me.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful motivation. What's your biggest takeaway today?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's that I'm stronger than I thought. That I can face these memories and survive. And maybe, just maybe, I can learn to live with them without letting them dominate my life. It's a long road ahead, but for the first time in a while, I feel like there might be light at the end of the tunnel.",
    "Therapist: That's an incredible insight. How do you want to build on this?",
    "Client: I want to keep pushing forward. Maybe... maybe we can work on some more grounding techniques? And I think I want to try talking to my partner about all this. They've been so supportive, but I've been shutting them out. It's time I let them in a bit, you know?",
    "Therapist: Those sound like excellent goals. Anything else you want to address?",
    "Client: I... I just want to say thank you. This isn't easy, and there are times I want to give up. But you're helping me see that there's hope. That I'm not broken beyond repair. And that... that means more than I can say.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired. Really tired. But also... lighter? Like I've set down a heavy load, even if just for a moment. I know we have a long way to go, but for the first time in a long time, I feel like I might actually be able to get there."
