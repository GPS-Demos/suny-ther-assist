    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your current SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that moment.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) I'm there. It's a hot day in Baghdad. I can feel the sun beating down on my helmet. The air smells like dust and diesel. We're on patrol, walking down a narrow street lined with mud-brick buildings. Everything seems quiet, but there's this tension in the air. I can hear my own heartbeat...",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's climbing... maybe a 6.",
    "Therapist: Keep going. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's shouting. A crowd forms ahead of us. I can see people arguing with local police. The officers look agitated, raising their batons. My squad leader tells us to move in, to try and de-escalate. As we get closer, I can see the fear in people's eyes. They're backing away from the police, hands raised. Then... (voice trembles) I hear a crack. Someone screams. It all happens so fast...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: (Breathing heavily) It's... it's an 8 now. My heart's racing.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep breathing. What happens next?",
    "Client: The crowd surges. People are running, pushing past us. I see a man fall, blood on his face. The local police are swinging their batons indiscriminately. I freeze. I should do something, but I can't move. My training... it's all gone. I'm just... watching.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Overwhelmed. Guilty. My chest feels tight. I can barely breathe.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. (Voice breaking) I can't... I can't do this.",
    "Therapist: You can. You're safe here. Keep breathing.",

    "Therapist: Your SUDS now?",
    "Client: (Sobbing) It's... it's a 10. I can't... I couldn't help him.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it. What do you see?",
    "Client: (Through tears) Blood. So much blood. The boy's not moving. I want to go to him, but I can't leave my position. The crowd is thinning now. Some of our medics are moving in. I feel... I feel useless. Angry. Why didn't we stop this sooner?",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe an 8.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're processing this. What happens next?",
    "Client: The situation starts to calm down. We're securing the area, but the damage is done. I can see bodies being covered. The local police are gone. We're left to deal with the aftermath. I feel... numb. Like I'm watching it all happen from outside my body.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6 now. I just feel... empty.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. How does your body feel?",
    "Client: Heavy. My arms and legs feel like lead. My throat is tight.",
    "Therapist: Keep breathing. You're doing well. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... how did we let this happen? We were supposed to protect these people. I feel like I failed them.",

    "Client: It's holding steady at 6. I'm... I'm starting to come back to the present.",
    "Therapist: Good. Take a few more deep breaths. You've done great work today.",
    "Client: (Exhales deeply) Thank you. It's... it's still hard to talk about.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, but... maybe a little lighter? Like I've let some of it out.",
