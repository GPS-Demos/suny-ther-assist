    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Can you describe the memory we're focusing on today?",
    "Client: Okay... It's about a month ago. I was walking home from the grocery store, and I saw a police officer confronting a young Latino man. It... it reminded me of my own experiences with neglect and discrimination. I felt so helpless...",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Let's continue. What happened next?",
    "Client: The officer was yelling at the man, demanding ID. I could see the fear in the young man's eyes. It brought back memories of when I was a kid, feeling invisible and unimportant. My heart started racing...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My palms are sweaty, and I'm feeling tense. Maybe a 6 out of 10 now.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The young man was fumbling for his wallet, and the officer got more aggressive. I wanted to step in, but I was frozen. I... I felt so ashamed for not helping. It was like all those times when no one stood up for me as a child...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Probably an 8. I can feel my chest tightening.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Inhales deeply) The officer pushed the man against the wall. I heard him cry out in pain. I... I couldn't take it anymore. I started walking towards them, my legs shaking...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm really anxious. My heart's pounding. It's a 9 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: I called out to the officer, asking if everything was okay. He turned and glared at me. I felt so small, like I did when my parents would ignore me. But I stood my ground...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually gone down a bit. Maybe a 7? I feel proud that I did something.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this well.",
    "Client: The officer told me to mind my own business, but I stayed nearby. Eventually, he let the young man go. As the man walked away, he gave me a grateful look. I felt... I felt like I had finally done something right.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm calmer. Maybe a 5? I still feel shaky, but there's a sense of relief.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've done great work today.",
    "Client: Thanks... I never realized how much that incident affected me. It brought up so many old feelings, but... I also feel stronger for having stood up.",
    "Therapist: You showed courage. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I'm down to a 3, I think. Tired, but... okay.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's end here for today."
