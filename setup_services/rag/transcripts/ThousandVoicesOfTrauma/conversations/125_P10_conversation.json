    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we've talked about this, but actually diving into it feels daunting. My stomach's in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm at the airport. It's bustling, people rushing everywhere. The smell of coffee and pastries from the nearby caf\u00e9... I'm standing in line at the check-in counter, clutching my ticket.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, about a 4, I'd say.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: I'm boarding the plane now. The narrow aisle, the overhead compartments... I find my seat by the window. 21A. I always choose the window seat, you know? I... I liked watching the clouds. The seat feels stiff, and the armrest is cool to the touch.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm excited for my vacation. But there's this nagging feeling... like something's off. I can't shake it.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's creeping up... maybe a 6?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The plane starts to move. That familiar rumble... God, I used to love that sound. Now it... it makes me want to scream. We're taking off, and I'm gripping the armrests so tight my knuckles are white.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Right, breathing... Okay. We're in the air now. The seatbelt sign goes off, and people start moving around. I'm trying to relax, leafing through the in-flight magazine, but my hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: There's... there's a sudden jolt. Like we hit something. People gasp. I look out the window, and... oh god, the wing... the wing is...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it, Sarah. You're doing great. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe 9. I can't... I can't breathe...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Feel your feet on the floor. You're here, you're safe.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm... I'm here. The plane... it's shaking violently now. Oxygen masks drop down. There's screaming, so much screaming. I'm fumbling with my mask, my hands won't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The plane is nosediving. I can see the ground getting closer through the window. Oh god, we're going to crash. We're going to die. I can't... I can't do this...",
    "Therapist: You can do this, Sarah. You're safe here. What's happening now?",
    "Client: I... I close my eyes. I'm thinking about my family, my husband. The impact... it's... it's deafening. Metal tearing, people screaming. Then... silence. Just for a moment. When I open my eyes, everything's sideways. Smoke... there's smoke everywhere.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 10. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you survived this. You're here now.",
    "Client: Right... I... I unbuckle my seatbelt. It's hard to move. There's debris everywhere. I can hear groaning, crying. I'm... I'm crawling towards the emergency exit. My leg hurts... I think it's broken.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I manage to open the exit door. The sudden rush of fresh air... it's overwhelming. I can see grass, trees. We're in a field. I... I slide down the emergency slide. It's chaos on the ground. People running, crying, calling for help.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in shock. Disbelief. How did I survive this? I'm looking back at the plane... or what's left of it. It's... it's horrifying. I feel guilty... why did I survive when others didn't?",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: Emergency services start arriving. Sirens, flashing lights... it's all a blur. Someone wraps a blanket around me, leads me to an ambulance. I'm answering questions, but I feel disconnected... like I'm watching it all happen to someone else.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7?",
    "Therapist: Good. You're doing really well. Can you describe what you're feeling physically?",
    "Client: My whole body is shaking. My heart is racing. I feel nauseous, and my leg is throbbing with pain. But mostly... I just feel numb.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What happens as time passes?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm at the hospital now. It's a whirlwind of tests, X-rays, questions. My husband arrives. When I see him, it all hits me at once. I break down sobbing. The reality of what happened... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's a natural reaction. How are you feeling now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Physically and emotionally drained. But there's also this intense feeling of gratitude... and guilt. Why did I survive when others didn't?",
    "Therapist: Those are common feelings after such an event. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 5 now. I feel drained, but... I made it through.",
    "Therapist: You did incredibly well, Sarah. How are you feeling about the exercise?",
    "Client: It was... intense. Harder than I expected. But... I feel like I faced it. Like maybe I can start to process it now.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves. Can you name five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: Um... I see the bookshelf, the plant in the corner, your desk, the painting on the wall, and the box of tissues.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, four things you can touch?",
    "Client: The armrest of the chair, my sweater, my hair, and... the smooth surface of my wedding ring.",
    "Therapist: Great. Three things you can hear?",
    "Client: The ticking of the clock, a car passing outside, and... my own breathing.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Two things you can smell?",
    "Client: The faint scent of your coffee and... is that lavender? From the diffuser maybe?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it is. And finally, one thing you can taste?",
    "Client: The mint from the gum I was chewing earlier.",
    "Therapist: Well done, Sarah. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... more present. More grounded. It's like... I can separate myself from the memory now. It's still there, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's fantastic progress. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 2, I think. I feel... tired, but calm.",
    "Therapist: That's normal after such an intense session. How do you feel about what we accomplished today?",
    "Client: I... I'm proud of myself, actually. I didn't think I could face it like that. It was hard, really hard, but... I did it. And I feel like... maybe I can start to move forward now.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You showed incredible strength today. Remember, healing is a process, and you've taken a significant step. How do you feel about continuing this work in our next session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm nervous about it, but also... determined? I want to get better. I want to be able to fly again someday, to not let this control my life.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude, Sarah. We'll continue to work towards that goal. For now, what will you do to take care of yourself for the rest of the day?",
    "Client: I think I'll take a long bath when I get home. Maybe call my sister... she's been really supportive. And just... try to relax. Maybe watch a comforting movie with my husband.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like excellent self-care strategies. Remember to be gentle with yourself. You've done challenging work today. Do you have any questions before we wrap up?",
    "Client: No, I... I think I'm okay. Thank you for guiding me through this. It means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Sarah. I'm here to support you. We'll pick this up next week. Take care, and remember to use your coping strategies if you need them.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again. See you next week.",
    "Therapist: See you next week, Sarah. Take care."
