    "Therapist: Alright, Mr. Thompson, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the day you witnessed the violence.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm back there. It's a sunny afternoon, and I'm walking to the grocery store. The streets are busy, people rushing about their day. Then I hear shouting...",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, about a 4, I'd say.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue, please.",
    "Client: The shouting gets louder. I see two men arguing near a parked car. One of them is waving his arms wildly, his face red with anger. The other looks scared, backing away slowly. My heart starts racing...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. I can feel my palms getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Keep going.",
    "Client: Suddenly, the angry man pulls out a knife. Everything seems to slow down. I want to yell, to do something, but I'm frozen in place. The scared man tries to run, but he trips and falls...",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: (voice shaking) It's... it's an 8 now. I feel like I'm right there again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: (nods) The man with the knife lunges forward. There's so much blood... I hear screaming, but I'm not sure if it's the victim or bystanders. I feel sick to my stomach...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I can barely breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Mr. Thompson. You're safe here in my office.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) I... I see people running towards the scene. Someone's calling for an ambulance. The attacker is running away, and I... I just stand there, useless...",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: Still a 9. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The police arrive, then the ambulance. There's so much commotion. I give a statement, but I feel numb. I can't stop seeing the blood, hearing the screams...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down a bit. Maybe a 7?",
    "Therapist: That's good. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Drained. Guilty. I keep thinking I should have done something.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are normal. Remember, you weren't responsible.",
    "Client: I know, but... it's hard. I see that man's face in my nightmares sometimes.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: Back to a 6 now. I feel... sad. Overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. You've done well today, Mr. Thompson.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's... it's tough to revisit, but I think it helps.",
    "Therapist: It does. How about we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. I'm feeling quite tired now.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember to use your coping strategies. We'll discuss this more next session."
