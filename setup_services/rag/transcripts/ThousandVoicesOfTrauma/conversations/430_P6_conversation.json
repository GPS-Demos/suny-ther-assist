    "Therapist: Alright, Mr. Patel, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I understand why we're doing this.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that memory.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm there. I'm in the dark room, hiding under the bed. I can hear footsteps outside.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: It's about a 4... no, maybe a 5 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The footsteps are getting closer. I'm trying not to breathe too loudly. My heart is pounding so hard, I'm afraid they'll hear it. I can smell the musty carpet and... and something else. It's the scent of the man who brought us here.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Maybe a 7 now. My palms are sweating, and I feel like I can't swallow.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Stay with it if you can.",
    "Client: The door opens. I can see his shoes. They're black and shiny. I'm praying he doesn't look under the bed. I'm so scared, I think I might wet myself. I want to run, but I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel like I'm there again. My chest is so tight.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a deep breath. Can you continue?",
    "Client: I... I'll try. He's walking around the room. I can hear him muttering something. Then... then he kneels down. I can see his face now. He's looking right at me, smiling. It's not a kind smile. I want to scream, but no sound comes out.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's still a 9. My whole body is shaking. I feel so helpless, so small.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Remember, you survived this.",
    "Client: He... he reaches under the bed. I feel his hand on my arm, pulling me out. I'm crying silently. I know what's coming next, and I can't stop it. I feel so ashamed, so dirty.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 10. I can't... I can't do this anymore. Can we stop?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take a break. You've shown immense courage.",
    "Client: I... I didn't think it would be this intense. It felt so real.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: A bit shaky. My heart's still racing, but... I feel like I've faced something I've been running from for years.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. Let's do some grounding exercises.",
    "Client: Okay... I think that would help. Thank you for being here with me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your strength is admirable. Shall we begin the grounding?"
