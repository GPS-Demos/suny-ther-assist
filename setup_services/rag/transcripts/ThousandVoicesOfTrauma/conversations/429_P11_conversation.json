    "Therapist: How are you feeling after today's imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not really sure. It's all kind of a blur. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of drained. But also... maybe a little relieved? It's hard to put into words.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you about the experience?",
    "Client: Well, um, I think what really hit me was how vivid the smells were. I could practically taste the dust and gunpowder in the air. It brought me right back there, you know? And the sounds... the constant ringing in my ears after the explosion. I haven't thought about that in years, but it was so clear today.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How did it feel to revisit those sensations?",
    "Client: Honestly? Terrifying at first. I felt like I couldn't breathe, like I was right back in that moment of panic. But then... it started to shift. As I kept talking, it was like I could see it from a different perspective. I realized I'm not there anymore. I'm here, I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How does that realization impact you?",
    "Client: It's... liberating, I guess? Like, maybe I don't have to be controlled by these memories anymore. But it's also confusing. I've spent so long trying to avoid thinking about it, and now I'm voluntarily putting myself through it again. It feels counterintuitive.",
    "Therapist: Many find that paradox challenging. How do you think this relates to your recovery goals?",
    "Client: I suppose... it's about facing my fears head-on, right? I've been running from these memories for so long, and it's affected everything - my sleep, my relationships, my work. If I can learn to process them without falling apart, maybe I can start to reclaim those parts of my life.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent connection. What else did you notice during the exposure?",
    "Client: I... I realized how much anger I've been carrying. Not just about what happened, but about how it's affected my life since. I'm angry that I can't just 'get over it,' you know? And I think... I think I'm angry at myself for not being able to save everyone that day.",
    "Therapist: That's a heavy burden. How does acknowledging that anger feel?",
    "Client: It's... overwhelming. But also kind of a relief? Like, I've been pushing it down for so long, and now it's out in the open. I don't know what to do with it, though.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. We'll work on that together. What else came up for you?",
    "Client: I... I thought about my kids. How I've been distant, trying to protect them from seeing me like this. But maybe I've been pushing them away instead. I want to be present for them, you know? To be the mom they deserve.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful motivation. How might today's session help with that goal?",
    "Client: I think... maybe if I can learn to face these memories without falling apart, I won't be so afraid of my own reactions. I might be able to be more open, more present with them. It's scary, but... I want that so badly.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's tough, really tough. But for the first time in a long time, I feel like there might be light at the end of the tunnel. I'm willing to keep going if it means I can get my life back.",
    "Therapist: That's great. What would you like to focus on before our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I want to try being more present with my family. Maybe start with small moments, like dinner time or bedtime stories. And... maybe I could try some of those breathing exercises when I feel overwhelmed?",
    "Therapist: Excellent plan. How else can I support you?",
    "Client: Just... knowing you're here, that I'm not alone in this. It means more than I can say. Thank you.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. I'm here with you every step of the way."
