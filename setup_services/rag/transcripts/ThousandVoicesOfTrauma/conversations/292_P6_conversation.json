    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm walking home from the library. It's late, maybe around 10 PM. The streets are quiet, and I can hear my footsteps echoing. Suddenly, I hear shouting from an alley nearby. My heart starts racing...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably a 4 out of 10. I'm tense, but manageable.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue.",
    "Client: I... I peek into the alley. There are two men arguing. One of them pulls out a knife. I freeze, unable to move. The man with the knife lunges forward, and I see blood... Oh god, there's so much blood. I can't breathe...",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: Seven... maybe eight. My hands are shaking, and I feel dizzy.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with it.",
    "Client: The victim falls to the ground, clutching his stomach. The attacker runs past me, and I catch a glimpse of his face. He looks... scared? Angry? I don't know. I can smell the metallic scent of blood. My legs feel weak...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: Nine. It's... it's really intense. I feel like I'm back there.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: I finally snap out of it and call 911. My voice is shaking so much, I can barely speak. The operator keeps asking me questions, but I can't focus. All I can see is the man on the ground, his life slipping away. I feel so helpless...",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: Still at nine. My heart is pounding, and I feel nauseous.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here with me, not there.",
    "Client: The ambulance arrives, but it feels like it took forever. The paramedics rush to help the man. There's so much commotion, but I feel like I'm watching it all through a fog. A police officer approaches me, asking questions. I can barely form words...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone down a bit. Maybe a seven? I'm still shaky, but talking about it is helping somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Keep going.",
    "Client: I give my statement to the police. They tell me the victim will likely survive. I should feel relieved, but I just feel... numb. I can't stop replaying the scene in my head. The knife, the blood, the look on the attacker's face...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: Back up to eight. I feel so guilty. Could I have done something to stop it?",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. You did what you could.",
    "Client: I know, but... I can't shake this feeling. For weeks after, I couldn't sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that alley. I stopped walking alone at night. I jumped at every loud noise. I felt... broken.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: Six now. Talking about it... it's hard, but it's like releasing pressure.",
    "Therapist: You're doing exceptionally well. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... lighter? Like I've shared some of the weight I've been carrying. My heart's still racing a bit, but I feel more... present.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's take a deep breath together."
