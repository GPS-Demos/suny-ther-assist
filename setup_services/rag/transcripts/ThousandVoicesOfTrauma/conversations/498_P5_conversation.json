    "Therapist: Hello, how are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi, doc. I'm... I'm not sure. A bit nervous, I guess. I know we talked about trying something new this session, but I'm not entirely sure what to expect.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We'll be doing imaginal exposure. Are you familiar with it?",
    "Client: Not really. I mean, I've heard the term, but I don't know what it involves. Is it... is it going to be intense?",
    "Therapist: It can be challenging, but it's a crucial step in addressing your PTSD symptoms. Shall I explain more?",
    "Client: Yeah, please do. I want to understand what I'm getting into here. I've been living with my parents since... well, since everything happened, and they're worried about me too. They keep asking if therapy is helping, and I want to be able to tell them something positive.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your openness. Imaginal exposure involves revisiting your trauma memory in a safe environment. How does that sound?",
    "Client: Revisiting the memory? I... I don't know if I can do that. I've spent so much time trying to forget. The idea of purposely thinking about it... it's scary.",
    "Therapist: Your fear is valid. Remember, you're in control. We'll go at your pace. Any concerns?",
    "Client: Yeah, a few. What if I can't handle it? What if I break down or... I don't know, what if it makes things worse instead of better?",
    "Therapist: Those are common worries. We'll take breaks if needed, and I'll guide you throughout. It's about processing, not reliving.",
    "Client: Okay... I think I understand. But why do we need to do this? Can't we just... talk about coping strategies or something?",
    "Therapist: Great question. Exposure helps reduce PTSD symptoms by processing the memory. It can lessen its power over you.",
    "Client: I see. That makes sense, I guess. It's just... it's hard, you know? I've never really talked about what happened in detail before. Not even to my parents. They know the basics, but... I've kept a lot inside.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Remember, you're not alone in this process. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. Yes. I'm scared, but I want to get better. I want to be able to move out on my own again, maybe start dating. I feel like I've been stuck since it happened. So if this can help... I'm willing to try.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. We'll start slowly. If you need to pause, just say so. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Okay. Yeah, let's do this. I trust you, doc. And... thank you. For being here with me through this. It means a lot."
