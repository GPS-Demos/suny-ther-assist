    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. I can feel my heart pounding in my chest, and my hands are kinda clammy. It's weird, you know? Reliving that moment of being cyber bullied... it brought back all these emotions I thought I'd buried.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: Shame, mostly. And anger. Like, I'm furious at those people who posted those horrible things about me online, but I'm also... I don't know, embarrassed? Like maybe I deserved it somehow. It's stupid, I know, but that's how I feel. And there's this overwhelming sense of helplessness, like I'm that scared kid again, watching my whole world fall apart because of some pixels on a screen.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings connect to your past experiences?",
    "Client: I guess... it reminds me of how I felt growing up. My parents were always too busy with their own lives to really pay attention to me. When the cyber bullying started, it was like... confirmation that I wasn't worth anyone's time or care. Like, even strangers on the internet thought I was worthless. And just like with my parents, I felt powerless to change anything.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you experiencing as you talk about this?",
    "Client: My throat feels tight, like I'm trying not to cry. There's this heaviness in my chest, and my stomach is in knots. I can feel tension in my shoulders, like I'm bracing for another attack. It's... it's exhausting, honestly. Reliving this stuff takes so much out of me.",
    "Therapist: How do these sensations compare to when the bullying was happening?",
    "Client: It's... it's eerily similar, actually. Back then, I'd spend hours hunched over my computer, refreshing pages, waiting for the next cruel comment. My body would be tense, my heart racing. I'd feel sick to my stomach, dreading what I might see next. The difference is, back then, those feelings lasted for months. Now, they're intense, but I know they'll pass. That's... that's progress, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... I'm thinking about how much time I wasted worrying about what those bullies thought of me. How I let their words define me for so long. But I'm also thinking about how far I've come. Like, yeah, talking about this still hurts, but I'm doing it. I'm facing it. And that's... that's kind of empowering, in a way. It's like, they don't have power over me anymore. I'm taking it back.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of things. There's pride, definitely. Like, I'm proud of myself for doing this work, for not letting those experiences define me forever. But there's also sadness, you know? Sadness for that younger version of me who didn't know how to cope, who felt so alone. And there's hope too. Hope that I can keep growing, keep healing. It's like... for the first time in a long time, I can see a future where this stuff doesn't consume me.",
    "Therapist: What do you think has contributed to this shift in perspective?",
    "Client: I think... I think a big part of it is just time and distance from the events. But also, these therapy sessions have been huge. Learning about trauma, understanding how it affects the brain and body... it's helped me make sense of my experiences. And talking about it, facing it head-on like we're doing now... it's scary, but it's also liberating. It's like, the more I talk about it, the less power it has over me.",
    "Therapist: How does this progress relate to your broader recovery journey?",
    "Client: It feels like... like I'm finally starting to piece myself back together. For so long, I felt fragmented, like parts of me were stuck in the past while other parts were desperately trying to move forward. But now, it's like I'm integrating all these pieces of myself. The scared kid, the angry teenager, the hopeful adult... they're all part of me, and I'm learning to accept and even appreciate all of them. It's not always easy, and some days are harder than others, but overall, I feel like I'm on the right path.",
    "Therapist: What's one thing you'd like to remember from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I want to remember this feeling of empowerment. The realization that I'm not just a victim of my past, but an active participant in my healing. It's like... yeah, bad things happened to me, but I'm not defined by them. I'm defined by how I choose to move forward, how I choose to heal. And today, I chose to face a really difficult memory head-on. That's something to be proud of, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How would you like to care for yourself after this intense session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need some quiet time to process everything. Maybe I'll go for a walk in the park near my apartment. Being in nature always helps ground me. And then maybe I'll call my girlfriend later. She's been really supportive throughout this whole process, and talking to her always helps me feel more centered. Yeah, that sounds like a good plan.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like excellent self-care. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I don't think so. This session was... intense, but in a good way, I think. I feel drained, but also... lighter? Like I've put down a heavy burden I've been carrying for a long time. Thank you for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone who really listens and understands.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. I'm proud of the work you've done today. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
