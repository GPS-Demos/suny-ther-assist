    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and describe the accident. Remember to stay present in the memory. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm closing my eyes. I'm... I'm in my car. It's a sunny day, but I can barely see. The SUDS... it's about a 4 right now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue.",
    "Client: I'm driving down the highway. Everything seems normal, but then... oh God, I see a truck swerving into my lane. It's happening so fast. My heart is racing. I'm gripping the steering wheel so tight. I can hear the screeching of tires. The SUDS is climbing... it's a 6 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The truck is getting closer. I can see the driver's face now. He looks panicked. I'm trying to swerve, but there's nowhere to go. The guardrail is on my right. I'm trapped. My body is tensing up. I can feel sweat on my forehead. The SUDS... it's an 8 now.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: The impact... it's deafening. Metal crunching, glass shattering. My body jerks violently. I feel a sharp pain in my chest. Everything's spinning. I can smell gasoline and burning rubber. I'm... I'm terrified. SUDS is at a 9.",
    "Therapist: Breathe. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I'm trying to move, but I can't. My legs are pinned. I hear people shouting, sirens in the distance. The pain is overwhelming. I'm thinking about my wife, wondering if I'll see her again. It's... it's too much. SUDS is 10. Can we stop?",
    "Therapist: Let's pause. Take deep breaths.",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) That was intense. I haven't relived it like that before. My heart's still pounding.",
    "Therapist: You did well. How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down. Maybe a 7? I feel shaky, but I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. What do you need?",
    "Client: Just... just give me a moment. (pause) I didn't realize how vivid the memories still were. The sounds, the smells... it was like being there again.",
    "Therapist: That's common. You're processing it.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess so. It's strange, but I feel... I don't know, maybe a bit lighter? Like I've released something. The SUDS is down to a 5 now.",
    "Therapist: Good. What stood out most?",
    "Client: The fear. The helplessness. But also... I survived. I'm here. That feels important somehow.",
    "Therapist: It is. Ready to continue?",
    "Client: I think so. Yeah, let's keep going. I'm at a 4 now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes again..."
