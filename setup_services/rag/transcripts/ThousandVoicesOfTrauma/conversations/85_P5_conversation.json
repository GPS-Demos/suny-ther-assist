    "Therapist: Hello, Mrs. Johnson. Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of reliving that traumatic experience in the hospital... it's making my stomach churn. Can you tell me more about what to expect?",
    "Therapist: Of course. It's natural to feel anxious. Imaginal exposure helps process traumatic memories. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about becoming overwhelmed. What if I can't handle it? And... I'm scared that talking about it will make everything worse. I've been trying so hard to keep it all together, especially at home and work. I don't want to fall apart.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace, and I'll support you throughout. How else can I help you feel more comfortable?",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I guess I'm wondering, will this really help? I mean, I've been avoiding thinking about that day for so long. It's hard to believe that deliberately focusing on it could be beneficial. And... I'm a bit embarrassed. I feel like I should be over this by now.",
    "Therapist: It's a common misconception. Avoidance often prolongs healing. This process aims to reduce PTSD symptoms. Your feelings are normal and valid.",
    "Client: That makes sense, I suppose. It's just... every time I think about that day, I can feel my heart racing and it's like I'm right back there. The smell of the hospital, the beeping machines, the doctors rushing around... it's all so vivid. I'm afraid of getting stuck in that moment.",
    "Therapist: I understand. We'll work together to process these memories safely. Your bravery is commendable. Shall we discuss some coping strategies?",
    "Client: Yes, please. That would be helpful. I've been trying deep breathing exercises at home, but sometimes they're not enough. And... I'm worried about how this might affect my relationship with my husband. He's been so supportive, but I don't want him to see me struggling even more.",
    "Therapist: Coping strategies are crucial. We'll enhance your toolkit. Regarding your husband, would you like to discuss involving him in your healing process?",
    "Client: I hadn't thought about that. Maybe it would be good to talk to him about this. He's always asking how he can help. I just... I don't want to burden him. But I suppose if he understands what I'm going through with this therapy, it might make things easier at home. What do you think?",
    "Therapist: Including supportive family can be beneficial. It's your choice. How about we brainstorm ways to communicate your needs to him?",
    "Client: That sounds like a good idea. I think it would help me feel more supported overall. I'm still nervous about the exposure itself, but knowing I have support both here and at home makes it seem a bit less daunting. Can you walk me through exactly what we'll be doing in these sessions?",
    "Therapist: Certainly. We'll revisit the traumatic memory gradually, processing emotions as they arise. I'll guide you throughout. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It sounds challenging, but I think I'm ready to try. I'm tired of feeling controlled by this trauma. I want to be able to think about that day without feeling paralyzed by fear. I want to be able to go to routine doctor's appointments without having a panic attack. If this can help me do that, then I'm willing to give it a shot.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is admirable. We'll take it step by step. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we begin?",
    "Client: I don't think so. I feel a bit more prepared now. Thank you for explaining everything and listening to my concerns. I'm still nervous, but I also feel a glimmer of hope. Is it okay if we start slowly?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll move at your pace. Your comfort and safety are paramount. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I am. Let's do this."
