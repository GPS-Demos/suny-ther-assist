    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not really sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also kind of blank at the same time. My heart is still pounding a bit. That memory of the breakup, it just... it brought up so much.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Shame, I think. Yeah, definitely shame. It's this overwhelming feeling that I wasn't good enough, that I'm somehow fundamentally flawed. When I replay that moment of her telling me it was over, I can feel my face getting hot, just like it did then. It's like I'm reliving that humiliation all over again.",
    "Therapist: How does that shame feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's heavy. Like there's this weight pressing down on my chest. My shoulders feel tense, and there's this knot in my stomach. It's almost like I want to curl up into a ball and disappear. And my throat feels tight, like I'm trying to hold back tears.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are accompanying these physical sensations?",
    "Client: I keep hearing her words in my head, \"I just don't love you anymore.\" And then my mind starts spinning with all these self-critical thoughts. \"Of course she doesn't love you, who would?\" \"You're not worthy of love.\" It's like... it's like all those bullies from school were right about me all along. I feel so small and insignificant.",
    "Therapist: How does this experience compare to when it first happened?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense, but different. Back then, I was in shock. I couldn't process it. Now, it's like I'm feeling everything I couldn't feel then. The pain is sharper, more defined. But there's also... I don't know, maybe a tiny bit of distance? Like, I can recognize that I'm remembering, not reliving. It's subtle, though.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about that distance?",
    "Client: Well, it's... it's like I can see the memory more clearly now. I can pick out details I didn't notice before. The look on her face, the tone of her voice. And I'm aware of my reactions in a way I wasn't then. It's still painful, but it's like I'm observing it from slightly outside myself, if that makes sense?",
    "Therapist: How does that feel, to have that perspective?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. Part of me feels a bit more in control, like I'm not completely at the mercy of the memory. But it also makes me sad, realizing how much that moment has affected me. And there's this weird mix of vulnerability and strength. Like, I'm facing this thing that terrifies me, and it hurts, but I'm still here, you know?",
    "Therapist: What does that strength feel like?",
    "Client: It's... it's subtle. Like a tiny spark in my chest. It doesn't take away the pain or the shame, but it's... it's something new. Something that wasn't there before. It's almost like a whisper saying, \"You can handle this.\" And that's... that's kind of surprising to me, actually.",
    "Therapist: How does this experience relate to your broader journey?",
    "Client: I... I think it's showing me how much I've been carrying around. All this pain and shame from the breakup, it's been coloring everything. My studies, my relationships, even how I see myself. But going through this exercise, as hard as it is, it's like... it's like I'm starting to see the edges of it, you know? Like maybe it doesn't have to define everything about me.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you say that?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of hope and fear, I guess. Hope that maybe I can work through this, that I'm not permanently broken. But also fear, because facing all of this is so overwhelming. And there's a part of me that's scared to let go of the pain, as weird as that sounds. It's been a part of me for so long.",
    "Therapist: How does that fear manifest?",
    "Client: It's like... it's like a tightness in my chest. A voice in my head saying, \"Don't get your hopes up.\" I'm worried that if I start to believe things can get better, I'll just be setting myself up for more disappointment. And there's this... this almost comfort in the familiar pain. At least I know what to expect with it, you know?",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to let go of some of that pain?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to say it would be freeing, but it's also terrifying. It's like... it's like the pain has been a shield in a way. If I let it go, I might have to face the possibility of getting hurt again. But at the same time, holding onto it is... it's exhausting. It's keeping me from fully living my life.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... it's a lot to take in. There's a sadness there, realizing how much I've been holding myself back. But there's also... I don't know, maybe a tiny bit of excitement? Like, maybe there's more out there for me than I've been allowing myself to see. It's scary, but also... maybe a little bit exciting?",
    "Therapist: What do you need right now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I think I need a minute to just breathe. To sit with all of these feelings without trying to change them or push them away. And maybe... maybe to remind myself that it's okay to feel all of this. That I'm not weak for struggling with it. Yeah, I think that's what I need right now.",
    "Therapist: Take all the time you need. How about we practice some grounding?",
    "Client: Yeah, that... that sounds good. I can feel myself getting a bit overwhelmed. Grounding would help. Can we do that breathing exercise we've done before?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's begin with a deep breath...",
    "Client: *takes a deep breath* Okay... I'm ready. You know, it's strange. Even just deciding to do this grounding exercise, I can feel some of the tension starting to ease a little. Like I'm giving myself permission to step back from the intensity for a moment.",
    "Therapist: What are you noticing in your body now?",
    "Client: My breathing is slowing down. The knot in my stomach is still there, but it's not as tight. I'm becoming more aware of the chair supporting me, the temperature of the room. It's like... like I'm coming back to the present moment, bit by bit.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling after this exercise?",
    "Client: I feel... calmer. Not completely relaxed, but more centered. The memory and all the emotions it brought up are still there, but they don't feel as overwhelming. It's like... like I've created a little bit of space between myself and the intensity of it all. And that space... it feels valuable, you know?",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on for the rest of our session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to explore that little spark of strength I mentioned earlier. It feels important, like maybe it could be something to build on. Is that... is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's start by..."
