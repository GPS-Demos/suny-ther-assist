    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Lee. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... a bit apprehensive, to be honest. I know we've been working towards this, but actually facing those memories... it's daunting.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Yes, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day at work. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in the office. It's early morning, around 8:30. The fluorescent lights are harsh, and there's a faint smell of coffee in the air. I'm at my desk, organizing files for the morning meeting.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear footsteps approaching. It's... it's Mr. Johnson, my supervisor. He's walking towards me with that look on his face. You know, the one that always makes my stomach churn.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My heart's starting to race a bit. I can feel my palms getting clammy.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 40?",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath and continue. What does Mr. Johnson do?",
    "Client: He... he stops at my desk and looms over me. God, he's so tall. He says, \"Lee, where's the Henderson report? I needed it an hour ago.\" His voice is loud, angry. I can see a vein pulsing in his forehead.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm panicking. I know I finished that report yesterday. Where is it? Did I save it? Oh god, he's going to yell at me again. I can't handle this. I... I want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's higher. Maybe 60?",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I stammer out, \"I-I'm sorry, Mr. Johnson. I completed it yesterday. Let me find it for you.\" My hands are shaking as I try to navigate through my computer files. He's just standing there, tapping his foot impatiently.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: Tense. So tense. My shoulders are up to my ears, and I can feel a knot forming in my stomach. I'm sweating now, and I'm sure my face is red.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I can't find the file. It's not where I saved it. Mr. Johnson sighs loudly and says, \"This is exactly why we can't trust you with important projects, Lee. You're incompetent.\" His words... they cut deep. I feel so small, so... worthless.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly painful. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 75, I think.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. Remember, you're here in the office with me, safe.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... okay. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens after Mr. Johnson says those words?",
    "Client: I... I'm fighting back tears. I don't want to cry in front of him. I manage to say, \"I'll find it, sir. I promise.\" But he's already walking away, shaking his head. I can hear him muttering, \"Useless...\"",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Humiliated. Angry. But mostly... mostly just scared. Scared that he's right, that I am incompetent.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid feelings. Remember, his words reflect on him, not you. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I sit there for a moment, trying to compose myself. My colleague, Sarah, comes over. She looks concerned. \"Are you okay?\" she asks. I just nod, not trusting my voice.",
    "Therapist: How does Sarah's presence affect you?",
    "Client: It's... it's a small comfort. But I also feel ashamed that she witnessed it. I don't want pity.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's hovering around 70.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I turn back to my computer. I'm determined to find that file. My hands are still shaking, but I start methodically going through every folder. And then... there it is. It was in a different directory. I must have misclicked when saving it.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel when you find the file?",
    "Client: Relieved, but... but also angry. At myself for the mistake, at Mr. Johnson for his reaction. I... I want to march into his office and show him, prove I'm not incompetent. But I'm too scared.",
    "Therapist: What do you do instead?",
    "Client: I... I email him the report. My finger hovers over the send button for a moment. Part of me wants to add a note, explaining or apologizing. But I don't. I just send it.",
    "Therapist: How does that decision make you feel?",
    "Client: Conflicted. I wish I had the courage to stand up for myself. But I also know any explanation would fall on deaf ears with him.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 60.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens for the rest of the day?",
    "Client: I... I try to focus on my work, but I can't. Every time I hear footsteps, I tense up, thinking it's Mr. Johnson coming back. I keep replaying the incident in my mind, thinking of all the things I should have said or done.",
    "Therapist: How does this affect your interactions with others?",
    "Client: I... I withdraw. When Sarah asks if I want to grab lunch, I decline. I don't want to talk about what happened. I spend my lunch break at my desk, picking at a salad I don't really taste.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind during this time?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm questioning everything. My abilities, my place in the company. I've worked here for 15 years, but in moments like these, I feel like I don't belong. Like I'm an imposter.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really challenging. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's hovering around 65.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great. What happens at the end of the day?",
    "Client: I... I stay late. Later than usual. I want to make sure everything is perfect before I leave. I don't want to give Mr. Johnson any more reasons to criticize me. It's dark outside when I finally pack up to go home.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel as you're leaving?",
    "Client: Exhausted. Drained. But also... also a bit proud that I made it through the day. That I didn't break down completely.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant accomplishment. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 50.",
    "Therapist: You've done an excellent job working through this memory. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. But also... I don't know. There's a sense of relief, I guess. Like I've faced something I've been avoiding for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after these exercises. You've shown great courage today. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you... I think I needed this more than I realized.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Remember, healing is a process, and you're making great progress. We'll continue to work on this in our future sessions."
