    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's always hard to go back there, you know? Reliving that moment when Tom told me he wanted a divorce... it still feels so raw. My hands are actually trembling a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you this time?",
    "Client: (deep breath) I think... the look in his eyes. I've never seen him so cold before. It was like looking at a stranger. And the way my chest tightened, it felt like I couldn't breathe. I remember thinking, \"This can't be happening. We were supposed to grow old together.\"",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. But different from before. I noticed that while the pain was still there, it didn't completely overwhelm me like it used to. There was a moment where I could step back and observe my younger self, if that makes sense? It's like I could see how devastated I was, but also recognize that I've come a long way since then.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant observation. How does this relate to your recovery journey?",
    "Client: Well, I suppose it shows progress, doesn't it? I mean, I'm still hurting, but I'm not drowning in it anymore. It's like... the pain from the divorce is intertwining with the old wounds from being bullied in school. Both experiences left me feeling so... worthless. But now, I can see that I'm more than what happened to me. It's a strange mix of sadness and... hope, I guess?",
    "Therapist: You're showing remarkable insight. How does this affect your daily life now?",
    "Client: (pauses) You know, I think it's helping me be kinder to myself. I've always been so hard on myself, always pushing through the pain in my body and in my heart. But now, I'm learning it's okay to acknowledge when things hurt. It doesn't make me weak. If anything, it's making me stronger because I'm not running from it anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's been most challenging?",
    "Client: Hmm... I think it's the unpredictability. Some days, I feel like I can conquer the world, and other days, a small reminder can send me spiraling. It's frustrating, especially with the chronic pain flare-ups. But I'm trying to be patient with myself. It's just... it's a lot, you know?",
    "Therapist: It is. How are you coping with these fluctuations?",
    "Client: I've been using those grounding techniques we talked about. When I feel overwhelmed, I try to focus on my surroundings, name five things I can see, that sort of thing. It helps bring me back to the present. And I've started journaling, which is... well, it's bringing up a lot, but I think it's helping me process things.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. What else have you noticed?",
    "Client: I've been more open with my current partner about my past. It's scary, but it feels good to be vulnerable. And you know what? He's been incredibly supportive. It's making me realize that not everyone will hurt me like Tom did, or like those bullies in school. There are good people out there.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. How does this affect your view of relationships?",
    "Client: (thoughtful pause) I think... I'm starting to believe that I deserve good things. That I'm worthy of love and respect. It's still hard sometimes, especially on bad pain days, but I'm working on it. I'm learning that my past doesn't define my future.",
    "Therapist: You've made remarkable progress. What's your focus moving forward?",
    "Client: I want to keep working on self-compassion. And maybe... maybe start thinking about ways to use my experiences to help others. I've been considering volunteering at a support group for divorce survivors. Is that... do you think that's a good idea?",
    "Therapist: It could be. How do you feel about that possibility?",
    "Client: Excited, but nervous. Part of me worries it might be too much, but another part feels like it could be really healing. To turn my pain into something positive, you know? To show others that there's life after divorce, after trauma. That you can rebuild yourself.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful goal. Shall we discuss this more next time?",
    "Client: Yes, I'd like that. Thank you for today. It was tough, but... I feel lighter somehow. Like I'm one step closer to being whole again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work, Sarah. See you next week."
