    "Therapist: Good morning, Mrs. Lee. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Good morning, Dr. Thompson. I'm... I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been thinking about this session all week, and I'm not sure what to expect.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's talk about today's plan.",
    "Client: Okay... I appreciate that. I've been trying to prepare myself mentally, but it's been difficult. Every time I think about discussing the home invasion, my heart starts racing, and I feel like I can't breathe. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it's common. Today, we'll do imaginal exposure. Are you familiar with it?",
    "Client: I've heard the term, but I'm not entirely sure what it entails. Could you explain it to me? I want to be prepared for what's coming.",
    "Therapist: Of course. It involves revisiting the trauma memory in a safe environment.",
    "Client: Revisit the memory? I... I don't know if I can do that. Just thinking about it makes me feel panicked. What if I can't handle it? What if I break down completely?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace and I'll support you throughout.",
    "Client: I appreciate that, Dr. Thompson. It's just... ever since that night, I've been trying so hard to avoid thinking about it. The idea of deliberately bringing it up feels counterintuitive. How will this help me?",
    "Therapist: By facing the memory, we can process it and reduce its power over you.",
    "Client: I see. That makes sense, but it's still scary. Will we be doing this for the entire session? And what exactly will I need to do?",
    "Therapist: We'll spend about 30-45 minutes on it. You'll describe the event in detail.",
    "Client: Describe it in detail? Oh my... That sounds intense. I'm worried I might get overwhelmed or have a panic attack. What happens if I can't continue?",
    "Therapist: We can pause anytime. Your safety and comfort are priorities.",
    "Client: That's reassuring to hear. I trust you, Dr. Thompson, but I'm still anxious. How will you help me if I start to panic during the exercise?",
    "Therapist: I'll guide you through grounding techniques if needed. Your progress is impressive.",
    "Client: Thank you, that means a lot. I've been working hard, but sometimes it feels like I'm not making any progress at all. This home invasion has affected every aspect of my life. My husband has been so patient, but I know it's been hard on him too.",
    "Therapist: Your efforts are evident. This exercise will help address your PTSD symptoms.",
    "Client: I hope so. I'm tired of feeling this way - always on edge, unable to sleep, jumping at every little noise. If this can help, I'm willing to try. But... what if I can't remember all the details?",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Share what you can remember. There's no pressure to recall everything.",
    "Client: Alright, I'll do my best. I'm still nervous, but I'm also feeling a bit more hopeful now. Is there anything else I should know before we start?",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Your courage is admirable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Thompson. Your support means so much to me. I think... I think I'm ready. Let's do this."
