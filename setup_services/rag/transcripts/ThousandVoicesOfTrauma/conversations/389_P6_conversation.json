    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's begin when you're comfortable.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in my dorm room. It's late afternoon, and I can hear the wind picking up outside. The news said a hurricane was coming, but I didn't think it would be that bad. I'm trying to study for my exam, but I keep getting distracted by the sound of tree branches scraping against my window.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 3. I'm a little tense, but not too bad yet.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue.",
    "Client: The wind is getting stronger, and I can hear things hitting the building. I'm starting to feel really scared. My roommate isn't here, and I don't know what to do. I try calling my parents, but the cell service is cutting out. My heart is racing, and I'm shaking a little.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. I can feel my palms getting sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The lights start flickering, and then suddenly everything goes dark. I can hear glass breaking somewhere in the building, and people are screaming. I'm frozen in place, huddled on my bed. The noise is deafening - wind howling, things crashing. I feel so alone and helpless. My mind keeps flashing back to... to when I was abused. That same feeling of being trapped, of having no control. I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe even a 9. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Remember, this is just a memory.",
    "Client: I know, I know. It just feels so real. The storm rages on for what feels like hours. I'm crying, praying for it to stop. When it finally does, the silence is almost worse. I'm too scared to move or check for damage. I feel so vulnerable, like anything could happen at any moment. It's bringing up all these feelings from the abuse - the fear, the helplessness, the shame.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now? SUDS?",
    "Client: Still pretty high, maybe a 7. My heart is pounding, but I'm starting to feel a little more grounded.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're doing great. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: As the sun starts to come up, I finally get the courage to look outside. The campus is devastated. Trees are down everywhere, buildings are damaged. But people are starting to come out, checking on each other. I see my neighbor and we hug, both of us crying with relief. It's over, but I feel changed. Like I've been reminded of how fragile everything is, how quickly life can turn upside down. Just like when... when the abuse happened.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's come down to about a 5. I feel drained, but also a little proud that I made it through.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You've shown great strength.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's still hard to talk about, but I think it's getting a little easier each time.",
    "Therapist: That's the goal. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but okay. It's like I've run an emotional marathon.",
    "Therapist: That's a good way to put it. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end."
