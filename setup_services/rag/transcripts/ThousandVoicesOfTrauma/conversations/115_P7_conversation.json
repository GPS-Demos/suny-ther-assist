    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Take a deep breath. We'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm back in Afghanistan. It's hot, dusty. The air feels thick. We're on patrol, moving through a small village. Everything seems quiet, but there's this tension... like something's not right.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that feeling.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's an explosion. It's so loud, my ears are ringing. I can't hear anything clearly. There's dust and smoke everywhere. I'm disoriented, but I know we're under attack.",
    "Therapist: Keep going. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I see my buddy, Tom. He's down. There's blood... so much blood. I'm trying to get to him, but the gunfire is intense. I can hear screaming, but it sounds distant, like I'm underwater.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Continue.",
    "Client: I finally reach Tom. His leg... it's gone. I'm applying a tourniquet, my hands are shaking. I'm yelling for a medic, but I don't know if anyone can hear me over the chaos.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: I'm dragging Tom behind some cover. My heart is pounding so hard I can feel it in my throat. I'm terrified, but I can't show it. I have to keep him alive. I keep talking to him, telling him he'll be okay, but his eyes are glassy, unfocused.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: The firefight seems to last forever. I can smell the gunpowder, the blood, the sweat. It's overwhelming. I'm trying to stay focused, to keep Tom alive, but part of me is frozen in fear.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Finally, the medics arrive. They take over, and I'm just standing there, covered in Tom's blood. I feel... numb. Like I'm watching everything happen from outside my body. The adrenaline is wearing off, and I'm starting to shake uncontrollably.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You're doing great.",
    "Client: As they're evacuating Tom, I realize... I realize I might never see him again. And I feel this crushing guilt. Why him and not me? I should have been more alert, maybe I could have prevented this...",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. These thoughts are common.",
    "Client: I'm sitting on the ground now, my back against a wall. The fight's over, but I can still hear ringing in my ears. Someone's talking to me, asking if I'm okay, but I can't respond. I'm just... empty.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Talking about it brings everything back so vividly. But... I also feel a little lighter, like I've released some of the weight I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive sign. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm taking deep breaths. I can feel the chair beneath me, see the office around us. I'm here, not there.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. You've shown incredible strength today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard, but I think it's helping. I've never really talked about this in such detail before.",
    "Therapist: That's a big step. How about we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. I'm feeling pretty exhausted.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember to use your coping strategies we discussed.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you for guiding me through this. It means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue next session. Take care."
