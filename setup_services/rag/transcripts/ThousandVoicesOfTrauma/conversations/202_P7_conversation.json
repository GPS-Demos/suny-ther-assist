    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the airplane crash scene?",
    "Client: Okay... I was sitting in my seat, looking out the window. The flight had just taken off, and everything seemed normal. Then suddenly, there was this loud noise, like an explosion. The plane started shaking violently. I could hear people screaming...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The oxygen masks dropped down, and I fumbled to put mine on. My hands were shaking so much. I could smell something burning. The plane was tilting to one side, and I felt like I was going to fall out of my seat. I... I couldn't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: It's hard... I remember looking out the window again, and all I could see was the ground getting closer and closer. People were crying and praying. I thought... I thought I was going to die. I closed my eyes and gripped the armrests so tightly my knuckles turned white.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Continue.",
    "Client: The impact was... it was brutal. There was a deafening crash, and I felt my body being thrown forward. The lights went out, and everything went dark. I could taste blood in my mouth. The air was filled with dust and smoke. I couldn't see anything, but I could hear people moaning and crying for help.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How were you feeling at that moment?",
    "Client: I was... I was terrified. My heart was racing so fast I thought it might burst. I felt this overwhelming panic, like I couldn't move or think clearly. I was in pain, but the adrenaline was so high I couldn't tell where I was hurt. I just knew I had to get out.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I unbuckled my seatbelt with shaking hands and tried to stand up, but I stumbled. The plane was at an angle, and there was debris everywhere. I could hear the crackling of fire somewhere. I started crawling towards where I thought the exit was, bumping into seats and people along the way.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep describing what happened.",
    "Client: As I moved, I could hear people calling for help. Some were trapped in their seats, others were unconscious. I wanted to help them, but I was so scared... I just kept moving. The smoke was getting thicker, and it was getting harder to breathe. My eyes were stinging, and I was coughing uncontrollably.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel conflicted. You're handling this memory well.",
    "Client: I finally reached what I thought was an exit, but it was jammed. I started panicking even more, thinking I was trapped. Then I heard someone shouting, guiding survivors to another exit. I followed the voice, stumbling and crawling over seats and luggage. When I finally got out, the bright sunlight was blinding. I collapsed on the ground, gasping for air.",
    "Therapist: You made it through. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Reliving that moment is exhausting. But also... I feel a bit relieved. Like I've let out something that's been bottled up inside me for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. You've done really well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to talk about, but I think it's getting a little easier each time. I just wish... I wish I could have done more to help others.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to feel that way. We'll work through those feelings.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. Sometimes I still have nightmares about the crash. The sounds, the smells... they all come rushing back. But talking about it like this, it feels like I'm starting to process it better.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a mix of emotions. There's still some anxiety, but also a sense of... I don't know, maybe accomplishment? Like I've faced something I've been avoiding for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. We'll end here for today."
