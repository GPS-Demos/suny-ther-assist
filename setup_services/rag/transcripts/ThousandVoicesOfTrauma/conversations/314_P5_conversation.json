    "Therapist: Welcome, Amira. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit anxious, to be honest. I've been thinking about our session all week, and I'm not sure what to expect. The idea of revisiting my trauma... it's making me nervous.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you familiar with it?",
    "Client: Not really. I mean, I've heard the term, but I'm not sure what it entails. Can you explain it to me?",
    "Therapist: Of course. It involves recounting your traumatic experience in detail. This helps process the memory.",
    "Client: That sounds... intense. I'm not sure if I'm ready for that. What if I can't handle it? What if it makes things worse?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace and I'll support you throughout.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. But I'm still worried. I've spent so long trying to avoid thinking about what happened. The idea of deliberately focusing on it is scary. How do you know this won't set me back?",
    "Therapist: Research shows it helps reduce PTSD symptoms over time. It's challenging but effective.",
    "Client: I see. I trust you, but it's still intimidating. Can you tell me more about what exactly we'll be doing? What should I expect?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the event in present tense, as if it's happening now. I'll guide you through it.",
    "Client: Present tense? That sounds... intense. Will I have to close my eyes? I'm not sure I'll be comfortable doing that.",
    "Therapist: Eyes open or closed - whatever feels comfortable. Your safety is our priority.",
    "Client: Okay, that's good to know. I think I'd prefer to keep my eyes open, at least to start. How long will this process take? And what happens if I get overwhelmed?",
    "Therapist: We'll do about 30-45 minutes. If overwhelmed, we can pause or stop anytime.",
    "Client: Alright, that's reassuring. I'm still nervous, but I think I understand better now. Is there anything I should do to prepare myself before we start?",
    "Therapist: Just be open and honest. Remember, you're safe here. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm scared, but I know this is important for my healing. Can we start slowly? And... thank you for being so patient with all my questions.",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll start slow. Your courage is admirable. Shall we begin?"
