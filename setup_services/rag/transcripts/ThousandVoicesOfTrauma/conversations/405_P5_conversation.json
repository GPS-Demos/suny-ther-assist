    "Therapist: Hello Maria, how are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Rodriguez. I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having trouble sleeping lately, thinking about those awful messages I keep getting online.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you familiar with it?",
    "Client: Not really. It sounds a bit scary, to be honest. What exactly does it involve?",
    "Therapist: It's a technique where you'll revisit your cyber bullying experiences in a safe environment. How does that sound?",
    "Client: Oh... I'm not sure I want to do that. Just thinking about those messages makes me feel sick to my stomach. Why do we need to go back to that?",
    "Therapist: I know it's difficult. This process helps reduce the power those memories have over you. What concerns you most?",
    "Client: I'm worried I'll fall apart if I talk about it. I've been trying so hard to avoid thinking about those horrible comments. What if I can't handle it?",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. We'll go at your pace, and I'll be here to support you throughout. How can I help you feel more comfortable?",
    "Client: I appreciate that, Dr. Rodriguez. Maybe... could you explain more about what will happen during the session? And how long will it last? I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll spend about 30-45 minutes on the exposure. You'll describe your experience in detail, in the present tense. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's a long time to talk about something so painful. I'm not sure I can do it. What if I start crying and can't stop? Or what if I get too angry? I don't want to lose control.",
    "Therapist: Those reactions are normal and expected. We can take breaks if needed. Your bravery in facing this is admirable. What else can I clarify?",
    "Client: Thank you for saying that. I guess I'm just scared of reliving those feelings of helplessness and shame. Will this really help me feel better in the long run?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it can significantly reduce your PTSD symptoms over time. Your courage in this process is the first step towards healing. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. But please, if it gets too much, can we stop? I'm still not entirely sure about this, but I trust you, Dr. Rodriguez. I just hope it helps me move past this nightmare I've been living in.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We can pause anytime. Your well-being is my priority. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: I guess so. Here goes nothing... where should I begin?"
