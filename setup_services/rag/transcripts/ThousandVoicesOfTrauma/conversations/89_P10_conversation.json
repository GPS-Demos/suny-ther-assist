    "Therapist: Welcome, Ahmad. How are you feeling about our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. My hands are a bit clammy. I know we've been working up to this, but now that we're here, I'm not sure I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Can you rate your distress on the SUDS scale?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 6 out of 10. My heart's beating pretty fast.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Let's start with some deep breaths. When you're ready, begin describing the scene.",
    "Client: Alright... *deep breath* I'm in Fallujah. It's 2004, and the air is thick with dust and smoke. The heat is oppressive, even though it's early morning. I can hear distant explosions and sporadic gunfire. My unit is moving through a narrow street, buildings looming on either side. The tension is palpable; every shadow could hide an enemy.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay in the moment. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: I see my squad members, their faces grimy and alert. The buildings are mostly tan, some with bullet holes or partially collapsed. There's debris everywhere - broken concrete, twisted metal. A mangy dog darts across the street ahead of us. I grip my rifle tighter, scanning the windows above.",
    "Therapist: How's your anxiety level now?",
    "Client: It's creeping up... maybe a 7. My palms are sweating, just like they did then.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Take a deep breath and continue.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a deafening explosion to our right. A cloud of dust and shrapnel erupts from a nearby building. I'm knocked off my feet, my ears ringing. There's shouting, but it sounds muffled. I... I can taste blood in my mouth.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I'm scrambling to my feet. My training kicks in, and I'm moving towards cover. But then I see him - Private Johnson. He's down, not moving. There's so much blood... *voice breaks* I can't... I can't leave him there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Ahmad. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe what you're feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... terrified. Angry. There's this overwhelming urge to run, but also to help Johnson. My heart is pounding so hard I think it might burst. I feel frozen, like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe with me. In... and out. Where are you now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm here. In your office. But it feels so real... *deep breath* Okay. I'm crawling towards Johnson. The gunfire is intensifying. I can hear someone screaming for a medic. The smell of gunpowder and blood is overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I reach Johnson. His chest is... it's a mess. I start applying pressure, yelling for help. My hands are slippery with his blood. I'm trying to drag him behind a burned-out car for cover, but he's so heavy. I can hear bullets whizzing past us.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My SUDS is probably an 8 or 9. It's hard to breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Ahmad. Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel the chair beneath you.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... okay. I'm here. But I can still smell the blood...",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Can you continue?",
    "Client: Yeah... I manage to get Johnson behind the car. The medic finally reaches us, but I can tell from his face... it's bad. I'm still holding pressure, my arms aching. Johnson's eyes are open, but they're... vacant. I'm talking to him, telling him to hang on, but I think... I think he's already gone.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: Helpless. Furious. I want to scream, to hit something. But I can't. I have to stay focused. The firefight is still going on around us. I can hear my sergeant shouting orders, but it all seems far away. All I can see is Johnson's face.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: The medic... he's shaking his head. He closes Johnson's eyes. I... I can't let go. My hands are still on his chest, even though I know it's useless. Someone's pulling at me, telling me we need to move. But I can't... I can't leave him.",
    "Therapist: What happens then?",
    "Client: I... I finally let go. My hands are shaking so badly I can barely hold my rifle. We're retreating, dragging Johnson's body with us. I'm on autopilot, covering our withdrawal. But inside, I feel... hollow. Empty. Like something vital has been ripped out of me.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. My SUDS is probably back down to a 7, but I feel... heavy. Like I'm carrying all that weight again.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've done very well. Let's take a few deep breaths together.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* It's... it's still so vivid. Even after all these years.",
    "Therapist: That's why we're working through this. How do you feel about what you've shared?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. But also... I don't know. There's a small part of me that feels... relieved? Like I've been carrying this alone for so long, and now... now someone else knows.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. How would you rate your distress now?",
    "Client: Maybe a 6? I'm still shaky, but it's... it's manageable.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great courage today. How about we end here and discuss what you've experienced?",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, that sounds good. I... thank you. For listening. For not... judging.",
    "Therapist: Of course. That's why I'm here. Let's talk about some coping strategies for the rest of your day.",
    "Client: Okay. I... I think I need that. It's like I'm still half there, you know? I can still hear the gunfire, smell the dust...",
    "Therapist: That's normal after an intense session. Let's focus on grounding techniques.",
    "Client: Alright. I'm... I'm ready. Just... give me a minute to collect myself.",
    "Therapist: Take all the time you need. We'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay. I'm here. Present. It's... it's getting easier to remember that.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's start with a simple grounding exercise..."
