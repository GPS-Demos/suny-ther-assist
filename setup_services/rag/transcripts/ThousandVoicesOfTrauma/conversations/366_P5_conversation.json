    "Therapist: Hello, Mr. Johnson. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hello, Dr. Smith. I'm... I'm alright, I suppose. A bit on edge, to be honest. The weather forecast mentioned a storm coming, and that's got me a bit rattled.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Imaginal exposure? That sounds... intense. What exactly does that involve? I'm not sure I'm ready to relive everything that happened during the tornado.",
    "Therapist: It's a gradual process. We'll start slow. Can you share your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about losing control. What if I panic? Or what if it brings back all those terrible memories and I can't handle it? I've been trying so hard to keep it together, especially for my family.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's... reassuring. I appreciate that. But what exactly will we be doing? I mean, how does this imaginal exposure work?",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit the memory gradually. You'll describe it aloud. I'll guide you through.",
    "Client: Describe it aloud? That's... that's a lot. I haven't really talked about it in detail before. I'm not sure I can do that without breaking down.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel emotional. That's part of healing. Shall we start?",
    "Client: I... I guess so. But what if I can't continue? Or if it becomes too overwhelming? I don't want to disappoint you or waste our session time.",
    "Therapist: You can stop anytime. Your well-being comes first. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: Okay, I think I'm ready. But can we start with something small? Maybe just describing the day before the tornado hit? I'm not sure I can jump right into the worst parts yet.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's start there. Take a deep breath and begin when ready.",
    "Client: Alright. Well, it was a Tuesday. I remember because I had just gotten back from a business trip the night before. The weather was beautiful that morning - sunny, not too hot. It felt like any other day. I had no idea what was coming...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How are you feeling as you recall this?",
    "Client: It's... strange. I feel a bit of tension in my chest, thinking about how normal everything seemed. There's a sadness too, knowing what was about to happen. But talking about that day itself isn't as hard as I thought it would be.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Would you like to continue or pause here?",
    "Client: I think I can continue a bit more. Is that okay? I'm surprised, but talking about it is actually making me feel a little better. Like I'm finally acknowledging what happened instead of trying to push it away.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Please continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay. So, as the day went on, the weather started to change. The sky got darker, and there was this... stillness in the air. I remember thinking it felt eerie, but I didn't want to worry my family. I just kept telling myself it was probably nothing...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's pause here. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I think. My heart's beating a bit faster, and I feel a little shaky. But it's not as overwhelming as I feared. Is this... is this normal? Am I doing this right?",
    "Therapist: You're doing perfectly. Your reactions are normal. Shall we stop here today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that might be good. This wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, but I feel drained. Can we pick up from here next time?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You've shown great courage today. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Smith. I appreciate your guidance and patience. I think... I think I might be ready to go a bit further next time. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. We'll continue at your pace. Any questions before we end?",
    "Client: Just one - is it normal to feel both relieved and anxious after doing this? I'm glad I started, but I'm also nervous about continuing.",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's very common. It's part of the healing process.",
    "Client: Okay, that's reassuring. Thank you again, Dr. Smith. I'll see you next week.",
    "Therapist: Take care, Mr. Johnson. Remember to use your coping strategies if needed."
