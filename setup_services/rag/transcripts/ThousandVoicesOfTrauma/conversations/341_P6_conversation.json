    "Therapist: Alright, let's begin the imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that hospital room. Describe what you see and feel.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm there. The room is so white, it's almost blinding. The antiseptic smell is overwhelming. I see my grandmother lying in the bed, tubes everywhere. Her breathing is labored, and the machines are beeping steadily. I... I feel my heart racing.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 6. It's... it's uncomfortable, but I can handle it.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm standing by her bedside, holding her hand. It feels so frail, like it might break if I squeeze too hard. The doctor comes in, his face grim. He starts talking, but I can barely hear him over the pounding in my ears. I know what he's going to say, but I'm not ready to hear it.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My palms are sweating, and I feel a lump in my throat. The room seems to be closing in on me. It's... it's getting harder to breathe.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to an 8 now. This is really tough.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with it.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) The doctor says there's nothing more they can do. I feel like I'm going to be sick. I look at my grandmother, and her eyes are open, but they're... they're not focusing on anything. I want to run, but I can't leave her. I... I don't know what to do.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I can feel tears running down my face. My chest is so tight.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) Her breathing is getting slower. I'm holding her hand tighter now, willing her to stay. But I can feel her slipping away. The beeping on the machine is getting farther apart. And then... and then it stops. There's just this long, continuous tone. I... I can't...",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: (voice breaking) It's a 10. I can't... I can't do this.",
    "Therapist: You can. You're doing it right now. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: (crying) The doctor turns off the machine. The silence is deafening. I'm still holding her hand, but it's... it's getting colder. I can't believe she's gone. I feel so helpless, so alone. I... I failed her.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. My whole body is shaking. I feel drained, but also... lighter? Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 7. I didn't expect that.",
