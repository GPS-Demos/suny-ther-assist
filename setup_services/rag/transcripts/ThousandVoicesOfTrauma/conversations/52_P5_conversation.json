    "Therapist: Mr. Singh, today we'll be starting imaginal exposure. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so, but I'm not entirely sure what that means. Could you explain it a bit more? I'm feeling a bit anxious about what to expect.",
    "Therapist: Of course. It's a technique to process traumatic memories. We'll revisit your experiences gradually.",
    "Client: Revisit my experiences? You mean... talk about what happened in the cult? I've tried so hard to forget all of that. The thought of bringing it up again makes me feel quite uneasy. Will this really help?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it can be challenging, but it's effective for reducing PTSD symptoms. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: To be honest, I'm terrified. I've spent years trying to push those memories away. The idea of deliberately bringing them back... it's overwhelming. What if I can't handle it? What if it makes things worse?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace, and I'll support you throughout. Can you share more about your worries?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about losing control. When I think about those times, I sometimes feel like I'm right back there. The fear, the helplessness... it all comes rushing back. And at my age, I'm not sure if I have the strength to face it all again. What if I have a breakdown or something?",
    "Therapist: I understand. We'll take it slowly, and you're in control. We can stop anytime. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's somewhat reassuring. But I'm still nervous. Can you tell me more about what exactly we'll be doing? Will I need to close my eyes and relive everything? And how long will this take?",
    "Therapist: We'll start with a specific memory. You'll describe it in detail, present tense. It usually lasts about 30-45 minutes.",
    "Client: That sounds like a long time to be immersed in those memories. I'm not sure I can do it for that long. And present tense? You mean like it's happening right now? That seems... intense. What if I get too emotional or can't continue?",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel emotional. We can take breaks if needed. Your safety is my priority. What else is on your mind?",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I guess I'm wondering about the long-term effects. Will this really help me move past the trauma, or will it just stir everything up again? And what about confidentiality? Some of what happened in the cult... well, it's not something I want getting out.",
    "Therapist: This process aims to reduce the power of traumatic memories. Everything shared here is confidential. How do you feel about starting?",
    "Client: I'm still apprehensive, but I trust you. I've carried this burden for so long, and if there's a chance this could help... I suppose I'm willing to try. Can we start with something small today? Just to get a feel for it?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll start small and build gradually. Your courage is admirable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm ready. Thank you for being so patient with me. It means a lot to have someone listening and understanding after all these years. Let's give it a try.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Let's start by focusing on a less distressing memory. Can you think of one to begin with?"
