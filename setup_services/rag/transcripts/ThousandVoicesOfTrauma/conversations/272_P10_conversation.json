    "Therapist: Welcome, Amira. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit anxious, to be honest. I know we've been working towards this, but now that we're here, my heart's racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with some deep breaths.",
    "Client: *takes a deep breath* Okay... I'm trying to calm down.",
    "Therapist: Good. On a scale of 0-100, what's your distress level right now?",
    "Client: Um... probably around 60.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe where you are in your memory?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm 12 years old. We're in the compound. It's early morning, and I can smell breakfast cooking. The air is thick with incense, and I can hear chanting from the main hall.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see... I see the long tables in the dining area. They're worn wood, scratched from years of use. There are flowers on each table - white lilies. They're supposed to represent purity, but they always made me feel uneasy.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: The bell rings. It's time for morning prayers. I... I don't want to go. My stomach is in knots. I know what's coming.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe 75?",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Amira. Take a deep breath. Can you tell me more about what's happening?",
    "Client: I... I line up with the other children. We're all in white robes. They're scratchy and too big on me. We file into the main hall. The smell of incense is overpowering now. I feel dizzy.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The leader... he's at the front. His eyes are so intense. He starts speaking, but I can barely focus on the words. My heart is pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here in the room with me. You're safe.",
    "Client: *voice shaking* He's... he's calling children up to the front. One by one. I'm praying he doesn't call my name. Please, not today. Not me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it, Amira. What's happening in your body right now?",
    "Client: My hands are sweating. I feel like I can't breathe. It's like the air is too thick.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe with me. In... and out.",
    "Client: *takes a shaky breath* Okay... okay.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. Maybe 85.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Can you continue?",
    "Client: *nods* He... he calls my name. My legs feel like lead as I walk to the front. Everyone's eyes are on me. I feel so exposed, so vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Amira. What happens next?",
    "Client: He puts his hand on my head. It's heavy, and I want to shrink away. He starts speaking in tongues, getting louder and louder. The room is spinning.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Terrified. Confused. I... I wet myself. I'm so ashamed, but I can't move.",
    "Therapist: It's okay, Amira. You're doing great. Take a breath.",
    "Client: *breathes deeply* The shame... it's overwhelming. I can feel everyone's eyes on me. The wet robe clinging to my legs.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. What happens after that?",
    "Client: They... they take me away to get cleaned up. An older woman, she's kind but firm. She tells me it's a sign of spiritual cleansing. But I know... I know it's just fear.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm angry. So angry. At them, at myself for being scared.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel angry. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 80.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Can you tell me more about what happens next?",
    "Client: They... they bring me back to the hall. Everyone's still there. The leader, he says it's a blessing. That I've been touched by the spirit. But I feel dirty, ashamed.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What do you notice in your body?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. I feel like I can't get enough air. My hands are clenched so tight they hurt.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're here, you're safe.",
    "Client: *takes a deep breath* It's... it's hard to stay here.",
    "Therapist: I know. You're doing incredibly well. What happens after you return to the hall?",
    "Client: The rest of the day... it's a blur. People keep coming up to me, touching me, saying I'm blessed. But I feel... I feel violated. Like something's been taken from me.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful feeling. How old do you feel right now?",
    "Client: I... I feel small. Like I'm still that 12-year-old girl.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here with me. You're safe. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe 70?",
    "Therapist: That's good. Can you tell me about the end of that day?",
    "Client: I... I remember lying in bed that night. The dormitory is quiet, but I can't sleep. I keep replaying everything in my mind. I feel so alone.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I want my mom. But she's not here. She sent me here, thinking it was best for me. I feel... abandoned.",
    "Therapist: That's a heavy feeling. How does your body feel as you remember this?",
    "Client: Heavy. Like there's a weight on my chest. My eyes are burning with tears I'm trying not to shed.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to cry if you need to, Amira. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *voice breaks* I... I miss home. I miss my old life. I don't understand why this is happening to me.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid feelings. What do you wish you could do in that moment?",
    "Client: I... I wish I could run away. Just pack a bag and leave in the middle of the night. But I'm so scared of what would happen if they caught me.",
    "Therapist: That fear is understandable. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 65 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Can you stay with that memory a bit longer?",
    "Client: *nods* I... I remember deciding that night that I had to be stronger. That I couldn't let them see me cry or be afraid again. It was like... like a part of me hardened.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant moment. How do you feel about that decision now?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. Part of me is proud that I found that strength. But another part... another part wishes I didn't have to. That someone had protected me instead.",
    "Therapist: Those are complex feelings. It's okay to hold both.",
    "Client: *sighs* It's exhausting... carrying all of this.",
    "Therapist: I can imagine. You're showing incredible strength. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. But also... I don't know. Maybe a little lighter?",
    "Therapist: That's good. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 50, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Amira. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Can you tell me three things you see in this room?",
    "Client: I see... the blue painting on the wall. The plant in the corner. And... and your kind face.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, take a deep breath. How do you feel being back in the present moment?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also... I don't know. Like I've let go of something heavy.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after these sessions. You've done incredibly well today, Amira.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's... it's still hard to talk about these things.",
    "Therapist: I understand. You've shown great courage. How are you feeling about ending our session for today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. A bit shaky, but I think I'll be alright.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember to use your coping strategies if you need them. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up?",
    "Client: No, I... I think I'm okay. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Amira. You did the hard work. I'm here to support you. Let's end with some grounding exercises before you leave."
