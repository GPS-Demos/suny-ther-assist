    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Tom?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. That memory... it's so vivid, you know? I can still smell the musty air in that basement where they kept us. It's like I was right back there.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The fear. God, the fear was overwhelming. I remember feeling so small, so helpless. There was this constant knot in my stomach, wondering what would happen next. And the shame... I felt like it was my fault somehow, even though I was just a kid.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to share that now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. But also, I don't know, maybe a little liberating? Like, I've carried this secret for so long, and now it's out there. It's terrifying, but also... maybe it's the first step to not letting it control me anymore?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight, Tom.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess it is. You know, I've always had trouble trusting people, especially in my work. I'm always on edge, waiting for someone to betray me or hurt me. I think... I think that comes from this. From feeling so betrayed and vulnerable as a child.",
    "Therapist: How do you see that affecting your life now?",
    "Client: It's everywhere, really. In my marriage, I struggle to open up to my wife fully. At work, I'm always second-guessing my colleagues' intentions. It's exhausting, living like that. Always on guard, you know?",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to let your guard down?",
    "Client: Honestly? It's scary to even think about. But... maybe it would mean feeling more connected. To my wife, to my kids, to my friends. Maybe I wouldn't feel so... alone all the time.",
    "Therapist: That sounds meaningful. How else has this affected you?",
    "Client: I have these nightmares. They're not always about what happened, but they have the same feeling. That sense of being trapped, helpless. I wake up in a cold sweat, and it takes hours to calm down. My wife, she tries to understand, but how can she? I've never told her the full story.",
    "Therapist: What's holding you back from sharing with her?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm afraid she'll see me differently. As damaged goods, you know? And part of me feels like if I say it out loud to her, it becomes more real. Like I can't pretend it didn't happen anymore.",
    "Therapist: How might sharing change things?",
    "Client: I don't know. Maybe... maybe it would bring us closer? She's always saying I keep her at arm's length. And maybe... maybe it would be a relief. To not carry this alone anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a courageous thought, Tom.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess it is. You know, going through this memory today... it was horrible. But I also feel like... like maybe I'm stronger than I thought. I survived that. I'm here, talking about it. That's something, right?",
    "Therapist: It certainly is. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: It's tough, really tough. But I think... I think I need to. If I want to get better, to really live and not just survive, I need to face this. It's like you said in our first session - the only way out is through.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad you remember that. What's your takeaway today?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's that I'm not that helpless kid anymore. I have choices now. I can choose to face this, to work through it. And maybe, just maybe, I can choose to let people in, to trust again. It's scary as hell, but... I think it might be worth it.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization, Tom.",
    "Client: Yeah, it is. I'm... I'm actually feeling a bit lighter. Is that weird? After going through such a heavy memory?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. Can you explain more?",
    "Client: It's like... by facing it, I'm taking some of its power away. It's still there, still painful, but it doesn't feel like this overwhelming, suffocating thing anymore. It's just... a part of my story. A horrible part, but not the whole story.",
    "Therapist: That's an important distinction. How will you care for yourself now?",
    "Client: I think I'll go for a long walk when I get home. Clear my head a bit. And... and maybe I'll try to have dinner with my family tonight. Actually be present, you know? Not just physically there, but really there. It's a small step, but it's something.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan, Tom.",
    "Client: Thanks. I... I appreciate your guidance through this. It's not easy, but I think... I think it's worth it. I'm starting to see a glimmer of hope, you know? Like maybe I can actually get past this, not just cope with it.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant shift. We'll explore more next time.",
    "Client: Okay. Yeah, I... I'm actually looking forward to it. In a terrified sort of way, if that makes sense. But I'm ready to keep going. Thanks again, doc.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Tom. Take care."
