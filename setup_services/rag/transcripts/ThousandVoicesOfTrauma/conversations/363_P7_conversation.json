    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Can you take me through your experience of medical imprisonment?",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. It was about two years ago. I was admitted to the hospital for what was supposed to be a routine procedure. But something went wrong. I woke up in the ICU, connected to all these machines. I couldn't move, couldn't speak. It felt like I was trapped in my own body.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The doctors and nurses were always around, but I felt so alone. I couldn't communicate. I wanted to scream, to tell them I was awake, but nothing came out. The beeping of the machines was constant, driving me crazy. I felt like a prisoner in my own body, in that sterile, cold room.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) It was terrifying. I didn't know if I'd ever be able to move or speak again. Days blended together. I could hear my family visiting, crying, talking about me like I wasn't there. I wanted to reach out, to comfort them, but I couldn't. I felt so helpless, so... trapped.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. It's okay to feel these emotions.",
    "Client: (taking a deep breath) The worst part was the nights. When everything was quiet, and I was left alone with my thoughts. I'd replay every moment leading up to the surgery, wondering what went wrong, if it was my fault somehow. The darkness felt suffocating, like it was closing in on me.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. Keep going.",
    "Client: I started to lose hope. I thought maybe this was my life now, forever trapped in this body, in this room. The doctors would come in, discuss my case, but I couldn't understand most of it. I felt like I was fading away, like the person I used to be was disappearing.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Remember, you're here now, you're safe.",
    "Client: (voice breaking) I missed my family, my work, my life. I wanted to hug my children, to tell my husband I loved him. But I was just... there. Existing. Not living. It felt like a nightmare I couldn't wake up from.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel emotional. You're doing an amazing job.",
    "Client: After what felt like an eternity, I started to regain some movement. It was small at first - just a twitch of a finger. But it gave me hope. The recovery was slow, painful. Every small victory felt monumental. But the fear... the fear of being trapped again, it never really left me.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: (wiping tears) It's hard to talk about, but... I feel a bit lighter. Like I'm finally acknowledging what happened instead of trying to bury it. It still scares me, but maybe a little less now.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I didn't think I could talk about it like this. It's still vivid in my mind, but sharing it... it helps somehow. Makes it feel less overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You've made significant progress. How would you like to end our session?",
    "Client: I think I need a few minutes to just... be. To remind myself that I'm here, I'm okay now. Maybe we could sit quietly for a bit?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take that time.",
    "Client: (sighs) Thank you. I feel more centered now. It's still hard, but I think I can face the rest of my day.",
    "Therapist: You've done wonderful work. We'll continue next session."
