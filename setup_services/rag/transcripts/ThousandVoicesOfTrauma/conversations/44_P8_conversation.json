    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Maria?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. It's like my mind is racing, but also kind of foggy? I can still see those messages on my screen, all those horrible comments. My heart's beating really fast, and my hands feel clammy. It's almost like I'm back there, you know? Reading those messages for the first time all over again.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Shame. Definitely shame. It's like this heavy weight in my chest. I keep thinking about how stupid I was to post those pictures, to trust those people. And then there's this anger too, bubbling up. Why did they do that to me? I didn't deserve it. But then the shame comes back, telling me maybe I did deserve it.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How do those feelings of shame and anger show up in your body?",
    "Client: The shame... it's like I want to curl up into a ball and disappear. My shoulders are hunched, and I feel small. But the anger, that's different. It's hot, like fire in my stomach. My jaw is clenched, and I want to lash out, you know? It's confusing to feel both at the same time.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep hearing their words in my head. \"Slut,\" \"attention-seeker,\" \"you asked for it.\" And then I start thinking, maybe they're right? Maybe I am all those things. But then another part of me is screaming that it's not true, that I was just a kid trying to fit in. I didn't know any better. It's like there's a war in my head between these two sides.",
    "Therapist: How does this experience compare to when it first happened?",
    "Client: It's... it's not as overwhelming now. Back then, I couldn't function. I stopped going to school, I couldn't eat or sleep. Now, it still hurts, but I can kind of... step back a little? Like, I can recognize that I'm having these feelings, but they don't completely take over. Is that... is that progress?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What else do you notice about how you're coping now?",
    "Client: Well, I'm here, talking about it. That's huge. Before, I couldn't even say the words out loud. And I'm starting to see that maybe... maybe it wasn't all my fault? That's still really hard to believe, but there's a tiny part of me that's starting to question those mean voices in my head.",
    "Therapist: That's significant. How does it feel to share this experience?",
    "Client: It's scary, but also... kind of liberating? Like, every time I talk about it, it loses a little bit of its power over me. And talking to you, knowing you're not judging me... it helps. It makes me feel less alone, less like there's something fundamentally wrong with me.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad you feel that way. What do you think you need right now?",
    "Client: I think... I need to be kind to myself. That's so hard, though. Part of me still wants to punish myself, you know? But I'm trying to remember what we've talked about before, about self-compassion. Maybe I could try some of those breathing exercises we practiced? And... I think I need to remind myself that I'm safe now. Those messages can't hurt me anymore.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like great ideas. How can we support that self-compassion?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe we could work on some of those positive affirmations? The ones that challenge those mean thoughts? And I think I want to try reaching out to my support group again. I've been avoiding them lately, but I know they understand what I'm going through.",
    "Therapist: Excellent suggestions. Is there anything else you'd like to explore about this experience?",
    "Client: I... I think I want to talk more about how this has affected my relationships. Like, I struggle to trust people now, especially online. And intimacy? That's terrifying. But I want to work on it. I don't want this experience to define me forever, you know? I want to be able to connect with people again, to feel safe sharing myself with others.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful goal. How do you feel about working towards that?",
    "Client: It's scary, but... I feel ready. Or at least, more ready than I've ever been. I'm tired of letting this control my life. I want to take my power back. I know it won't be easy, but being here, talking about it like this... it gives me hope. Like maybe, just maybe, I can heal from this and have the life I want.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful, Maria. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. This was intense, but... good. Thank you for listening and for helping me through this. I feel... lighter, somehow. Like I've put down a heavy backpack I've been carrying for years. I know I'll probably have to pick it up again, but now I know I can put it down sometimes too. That means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. How about we end with a grounding exercise?",
    "Client: That sounds perfect. I'm ready."
