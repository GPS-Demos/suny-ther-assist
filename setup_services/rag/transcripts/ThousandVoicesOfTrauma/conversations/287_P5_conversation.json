    "Therapist: Welcome, John. Today we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of reliving that earthquake... it's terrifying. I've spent so much time trying to forget it all.",
    "Therapist: Your apprehension is understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about losing control. What if I completely break down? Or what if it makes my drinking worse? I've been doing better lately, but this feels like it could push me over the edge.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How can I support you during this process?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe just reassure me that I'm safe? And maybe we could have a plan in place if things get too overwhelming? I don't want to feel trapped in the memory.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll go at your pace and can stop anytime. What else might help you feel more comfortable?",
    "Client: Could we maybe have some water nearby? And... this might sound silly, but could I hold onto something? Like a stress ball or something? Just to remind me I'm here and not back there.",
    "Therapist: Of course. I'll get those for you now. (Pause) Here you are. Now, let's discuss what to expect.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm listening. But I'm still pretty nervous about this whole thing.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. We'll start slowly, focusing on details. How does that sound?",
    "Client: I guess that's okay. But what if I can't remember everything? Or what if I remember too much?",
    "Therapist: Both are normal. We'll work with whatever comes up. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. Just promise me you'll be here the whole time, okay? I don't want to face this alone.",
    "Therapist: I promise. You're brave for doing this. Shall we start?",
    "Client: Alright. Let's do it. I just hope this really helps in the long run. It's hard to imagine how reliving this could possibly make things better.",
    "Therapist: It's a proven method. Remember, you're in control. Let's begin..."
