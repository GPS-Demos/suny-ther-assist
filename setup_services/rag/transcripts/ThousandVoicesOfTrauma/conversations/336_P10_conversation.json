    "Therapist: Welcome, James. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... a bit on edge, to be honest. We're diving into some heavy stuff today, and I'm not sure how I'll handle it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day with the cult. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm standing outside this old warehouse. It's dusk, and there's a chill in the air. I can smell something burning, like incense maybe. There are people milling about, all dressed in these dark robes. My heart's racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's happening now?",
    "Client: Someone's approaching me. It's... it's Mark, the guy who invited me. He's smiling, but it doesn't reach his eyes. He's saying, \"Welcome, brother. Are you ready to ascend?\" I feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling?",
    "Client: Um, probably around 60.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: Mark's leading me inside. It's... it's dark, lit only by candles. The air is thick with incense smoke. People are chanting something I can't understand. I... I want to leave, but I'm afraid of what they'll do if I try.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. I can hardly breathe. My palms are sweaty, and I'm shaking a little. God, it's like I'm right back there...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, James. Remember, you're here in my office, safe.",
    "Client: Right, right. Okay. So, we're moving deeper into the warehouse. There's a large circle of people, and in the center... oh god, there's an altar. There's someone lying on it, and they're not moving. I... I think I'm going to be sick.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 80.",
    "Therapist: That's intense. Do you need a break, or can you continue?",
    "Client: No, I... I can keep going. I need to face this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. What's happening now?",
    "Client: The chanting is getting louder. Someone's handing me a robe, telling me to put it on. I... I do it, because I'm terrified of what might happen if I don't. The fabric feels rough against my skin. I can smell... blood. There's blood on the altar.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're doing well.",
    "Client: They're... they're calling me forward. Mark's got his hand on my back, pushing me towards the altar. I feel like I'm going to pass out. I can't believe this is happening. I... I want to run, but my feet won't move.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about my family. About how I might never see them again. About how stupid I was to come here. I'm... I'm praying, I think. Begging for someone to help me.",
    "Therapist: And how does your body feel?",
    "Client: It's like I'm not even in my body anymore. Everything feels numb, except for this overwhelming sense of dread. My heart's pounding so hard I think it might burst out of my chest.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, James. Stay with it.",
    "Client: I'm at the altar now. The person on it... it's a woman. She's pale, so pale. I think... I think she might be dead. They're handing me a knife. Mark's whispering in my ear, \"This is your ascension, brother. Take her life force into you.\"",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's 95. I can barely...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, James. Remember, you're here with me. You're safe.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm... I'm holding the knife. My hands are shaking so badly I can barely grip it. Everyone's watching me, expectant. I... I can't do it. I can't. I drop the knife and it clatters to the floor. Everything goes silent.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: Mark's face... it changes. He looks furious. He grabs my arm, his fingers digging in so hard it hurts. He's hissing at me, \"You fool. You've ruined everything.\" The others are closing in around me. I... I panic. I shove Mark as hard as I can and run.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Pure terror. Adrenaline's coursing through me. I'm pushing people out of the way, stumbling over my own feet. I can hear them behind me, shouting. I'm... I'm praying I can remember the way out.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm at the door. My hands are fumbling with the latch. I can hear them getting closer. Finally, it opens and I burst out into the night air. I'm running, running as fast as I can. My lungs are burning. I don't know where I'm going, I just know I have to get away.",
    "Therapist: And now?",
    "Client: I... I keep running until I can't anymore. I collapse in some alley, gasping for air. I'm shaking all over. I can't believe what just happened. I... I start sobbing. I've never been so scared in my life.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. But also... relieved. Like I've dodged a bullet. I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well, James. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 70 now. Still high, but... better.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you name five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: Um... your desk, the bookshelf, the plant in the corner, the clock on the wall, and... the painting behind you.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Now, how are you feeling?",
    "Client: Better. Still shaky, but... better. It's like a weight's been lifted, you know? Like I've finally faced this thing that's been haunting me.",
    "Therapist: That's exactly what you've done, James. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: Thanks. I... I never thought I'd be able to talk about this. It's been eating me up inside for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's what we're here for. How do you feel about continuing to work through this in our future sessions?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'm ready. It's not going to be easy, but I want to move past this. I don't want it to control me anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude, James. We'll take it one step at a time.",
    "Client: Yeah. One step at a time. I... I think I can do that.",
    "Therapist: I believe you can. You've shown incredible strength today. Let's end our session here and discuss how you're feeling overall.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm... I'm tired, but I feel lighter somehow. Like I've started to let go of something I've been carrying for too long.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after these sessions. Remember to be kind to yourself this week.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you... for helping me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, James. I'll see you next week."
