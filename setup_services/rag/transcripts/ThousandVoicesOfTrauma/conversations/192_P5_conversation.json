    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. My back's been acting up again, which hasn't been great. And to be honest, I'm a bit nervous about what we're doing today. You mentioned something about imaginal exposure last time?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's right. How much do you know about it?",
    "Client: Not much, really. Just that it involves talking about the trauma? Which, honestly, makes me pretty anxious.",
    "Therapist: Understandable. Let me explain briefly.",
    "Client: Okay, I'm listening.",
    "Therapist: Imaginal exposure helps process traumatic memories. You'll recount your experience in detail.",
    "Client: Recount it? Like, everything? I'm not sure I can do that. It's... it's still so vivid, you know? Especially with everything going on back home. The news, the images... it all just brings me back.",
    "Therapist: I understand your hesitation. We'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's just... since losing my brother in that conflict, and then having to flee... it's all so overwhelming. Sometimes I feel like I'm still there, you know? Like I can still hear the bombs, smell the smoke. And then I feel guilty for being here, safe, while others...",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. This exercise can help process those emotions.",
    "Client: I hope so. I really do. Because right now, it feels like I'm stuck. Like I can't move forward. Even here, with my partner, in this new life we're trying to build... it's like there's this constant shadow.",
    "Therapist: That's exactly what we're aiming to address. Are you ready to try?",
    "Client: I... I think so. But what if I panic? Or if it becomes too much?",
    "Therapist: We can pause anytime. I'll be here to support you throughout.",
    "Client: Okay. That helps. And you really think this will help with the nightmares? The flashbacks?",
    "Therapist: Yes, over time, it can significantly reduce those symptoms.",
    "Client: Alright. I trust you. And I guess... I need to do this. For me, for my partner, for the life we're trying to build here. It's just... it's hard, you know?",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yeah. Yeah, let's do this. I'm as ready as I'll ever be, I suppose. Where do we start?",
    "Therapist: Start by closing your eyes. Take a deep breath. When you're ready, describe the day.",
    "Client: Okay. Here goes..."
