    "Therapist: Good morning, Mr. Patel. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure exercise today?",
    "Client: Good morning, Dr. Chen. Yes, I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with your current SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10. My stomach feels a bit tight, but I'm managing.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Let's begin. Close your eyes and recall the memory we discussed.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Alright. I'm back in our living room. My wife, Priya, is standing there, holding divorce papers. Her face is cold, distant. I can feel my heart starting to race...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's happening now?",
    "Client: She's saying she can't do this anymore. That I've been emotionally absent for years. I... I feel like I can't breathe. My chest is so tight.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 7. I feel like I'm reliving it all over again.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) I'm trying to speak, but no words come out. Priya's voice is getting louder, angrier. She's listing all the times I've let her down, all the important moments I missed because of work. I feel so small, so... worthless.",
    "Therapist: What physical sensations are you experiencing?",
    "Client: My palms are sweating. I feel dizzy, like the room is spinning. There's this crushing weight on my chest.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe even a 9. I don't know if I can keep going.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: (takes several deep breaths) Okay. Okay. Priya's throwing the papers at me now. They're scattered all over the floor. I'm on my knees, trying to gather them up. I can hear her crying in the background. I want to comfort her, but I don't know how.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Helpless. Completely and utterly helpless. And ashamed. I've failed as a husband, as a partner. I've let down the one person who's stood by me all these years.",
    "Therapist: Your current SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Still high. About an 8. But... it's not getting worse.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm looking up at Priya now. Her eyes are red, puffy. She's not angry anymore, just... sad. Disappointed. I think that's worse than the anger. I'm trying to say something, anything to make it better, but the words won't come.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel right now?",
    "Client: Heavy. So heavy. Like I'm made of lead. My throat is tight, like I'm choking on all the things I should have said years ago.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down a bit. Maybe a 7 now.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: Priya's sitting on the couch now. She looks exhausted. I'm still on the floor, surrounded by these papers that represent the end of our life together. I finally manage to speak. I'm apologizing, promising to do better, to be better. But I can see in her eyes that it's too late.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are you experiencing?",
    "Client: Regret. So much regret. And a deep, aching sadness. It's like... like watching a part of myself die.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually coming down. Maybe a 6? I feel drained, but... less overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. How do you want to conclude this memory?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm ready to open my eyes now. The memory... it's still there, but it feels less intense.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a few deep breaths and open your eyes when ready.",
    "Client: (opens eyes, exhales deeply) That was... intense. But I made it through.",
    "Therapist: You did very well. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... lighter somehow. Like I've released something.",
    "Therapist: That's common. Final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 now. Similar to when we started.",
    "Therapist: Excellent progress. Let's take a moment to process this."
