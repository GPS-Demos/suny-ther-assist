    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's strange, you know? I haven't thought about that dog attack in years, but going through it just now... it's like I was right back there in that moment. I can still hear the growling, feel the fear in my chest. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. I was just a little girl, maybe 6 or 7, and I remember feeling so small and powerless. The neighbor's German Shepherd was huge, at least in my memory. I can still see its teeth, hear my own screams. I... I thought I was going to die.",
    "Therapist: How does recalling that feel now?",
    "Client: It's... uncomfortable. My heart's racing a bit. But, you know, it's different too. I'm here, safe. I'm not that little girl anymore. It's like... I'm observing it from a distance, if that makes sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. How does this connect to your current experiences?",
    "Client: Well, I've always been nervous around dogs since then. But I think it goes deeper. That feeling of helplessness... I've carried it with me. It's probably why I get so anxious in crowds or unfamiliar situations. I'm always on guard, waiting for something bad to happen.",
    "Therapist: I see. What's it like recognizing that connection?",
    "Client: It's... eye-opening, really. I never realized how much that one incident shaped me. It explains a lot about my anxiety, my need for control. Even my depression... maybe it's tied to feeling powerless in my life.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. How might this awareness help you?",
    "Client: I think... maybe it'll help me be kinder to myself? Understanding where these feelings come from, it makes them feel less... overwhelming, I guess. Like maybe I can start to challenge them a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's a great perspective. What's next for you in this process?",
    "Client: I want to keep working on this. It's hard, reliving these memories, but I can see how it might help. Maybe... maybe I can start to let go of some of this fear I've been carrying. I'm not that helpless little girl anymore. I've survived a lot since then.",
    "Therapist: You have. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: I'm... cautiously optimistic? It's scary, but I think it's worth it. I want to feel more in control of my life, not controlled by my past. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Your courage is admirable.",
    "Client: Thank you. It means a lot to hear that. I've spent so long feeling weak because of my anxiety and depression. But facing this... it takes strength, doesn't it? I'm starting to see that now.",
    "Therapist: It certainly does. What's one thing you'll take from today?",
    "Client: I think... the realization that I'm not alone in this. Talking through it with you, it helps me see it from a different perspective. And knowing that there's a reason for how I feel... it's validating. I'm not just 'being silly' or 'overreacting' like I've told myself for years.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How will you support yourself between sessions?",
    "Client: I think I'll try some of those breathing exercises we talked about. And maybe... maybe I'll talk to my daughter about this. She's always asking me to visit more, but I get anxious about leaving the house. If she understands why, maybe she can help me work through it.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great plan. Anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: No, I think that's all for today. It's been... intense, but good. Thank you for your patience and understanding. I'm looking forward to our next session, even if it's a bit scary.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next time."
