    "Therapist: Hello Sarah, how are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Johnson. I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been thinking about it all week, and I'm not sure I'm ready for this.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... the idea of reliving that accident, it's terrifying. I've spent so much time trying to forget it, and now you're asking me to remember every detail? I'm worried I'll fall apart or have a panic attack right here in your office. And what if I can't stop thinking about it afterwards? I already have trouble sleeping, and I'm afraid this will make it worse.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. Let's address them together.",
    "Client: Okay... I appreciate that. It's just, ever since that pile-up on the highway, I've been a mess. I can't drive without my heart racing, I avoid freeways altogether, and I have nightmares about twisted metal and screaming. I'm not sure how reliving it is supposed to help.",
    "Therapist: The exposure helps process the memory. How do you feel about trying?",
    "Client: I... I guess I'm willing to try. But can you explain more about how this is supposed to work? And what exactly will we be doing?",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit the memory safely. I'll guide you throughout. Ready to hear more?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. Please go on.",
    "Therapist: You'll describe the event in present tense. I'll be here to support you.",
    "Client: Present tense? So, like I'm there again? That sounds intense. How long will we do this for? And what if I get overwhelmed?",
    "Therapist: We'll start with 20 minutes. You can pause anytime. Your safety is priority.",
    "Client: Okay, that's somewhat reassuring. I appreciate that you're not just throwing me into the deep end. Can you tell me what I might experience during this? I want to be prepared.",
    "Therapist: You may feel anxious, but it typically decreases. Your reactions are normal and safe.",
    "Client: I see. And after we're done, what then? Will I be okay to drive home, or should I arrange for someone to pick me up?",
    "Therapist: You'll likely feel tired. We'll debrief and ensure you're grounded before leaving.",
    "Client: Alright. I'm still nervous, but I think I understand better now. You really think this will help with my PTSD symptoms?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it's proven effective. Your courage in facing this is commendable.",
    "Client: Thank you, that means a lot. I've been struggling for so long, and I'm ready for things to change. I just hope I can get through this without completely breaking down.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel emotional. We'll go at your pace.",
    "Client: Okay. I think... I think I'm ready to try. Can we start with something small, though? Maybe just describing the weather that day or something?",
    "Therapist: That's a great idea. We'll start there and progress gradually.",
    "Client: Alright. I can do this. It's just... it's been almost two years, but it feels like yesterday. Every time I close my eyes, I can still hear the screeching tires and shattering glass. But I'm here, and I'm going to try.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is inspiring. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do it. I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Thank you for being here with me through this."
