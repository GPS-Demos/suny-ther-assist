    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is buzzing, you know? My heart's still racing a bit. I can feel this tightness in my chest, and my hands are kinda clammy. It's weird because I'm sitting here safe in your office, but my body feels like it's still back there, in that moment.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: It's a jumble, honestly. Part of me is relieved it's over, but another part is still stuck in that memory. I keep seeing flashes of those nasty comments on my social media, and it's like I can hear their laughter echoing in my head. It's making me feel small and exposed all over again.",
    "Therapist: I see. What emotions are coming up for you?",
    "Client: Shame, definitely shame. And anger too. I'm angry at those bullies, but I'm also angry at myself for letting it affect me so much. There's this voice in my head saying, \"You should be over this by now. It's just words on a screen.\" But it doesn't feel that way. It feels like they reached through the screen and tore a piece of me away.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really intense. How does your body feel as you're describing this?",
    "Client: My shoulders are super tense, like they're up by my ears. And my stomach feels kind of sick, like I might throw up. It's similar to how I felt during the earthquake actually. That same kind of helplessness and fear.",
    "Therapist: I'm hearing a connection between these experiences. Can you say more about that?",
    "Client: Yeah, I... I guess I never really thought about it before, but there are similarities. With the earthquake, I had no control over what was happening. The ground was moving, things were falling, and I couldn't do anything to stop it. With the cyberbullying, it felt the same way. The comments kept coming, spreading, and I couldn't make it stop. I felt powerless in both situations.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How does recognizing that connection impact you?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually kind of a relief, in a weird way? Like, maybe I'm not overreacting to the cyberbullying. If my body and mind are responding to it the same way they did to a literal natural disaster, then maybe it really was that traumatic for me. It makes me feel less weak, I guess.",
    "Therapist: Mm. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much I've been avoiding anything that reminds me of either experience. I haven't been on social media in months, and I get really anxious when my phone buzzes with notifications. And ever since the earthquake, I've been hyper-aware of any little shake or tremor. It's exhausting always being on guard like that.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about that avoidance now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired of it. It's like I've been letting these experiences control my life. I want to take that power back, you know? But the thought of facing it all head-on is terrifying. What if I can't handle it? What if I fall apart?",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to you if you could face it?",
    "Client: God, it would mean everything. To be able to use social media without panicking, to not flinch every time the ground shakes a little. To feel like me again, not this anxious, traumatized version of myself. I want that so badly, but it feels impossible right now.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about the progress you've made so far?",
    "Client: I... I guess I haven't really thought about progress. It's been such a struggle just to get through each day. But now that you mention it, I am here, talking about it. A few months ago, I couldn't even say the word 'cyberbullying' without having a panic attack. So maybe... maybe I am making progress? It's hard to see when you're in the middle of it.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you recognize that?",
    "Client: A mix of things. There's a little spark of hope, like maybe I can get through this. But there's also fear. What if this is as good as it gets? What if I never fully recover? And then there's this weird sense of grief. Like, I'm mourning the person I was before all this happened. I want to be that carefree student again, you know?",
    "Therapist: How might you comfort that grieving part of yourself?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. I guess I'd tell myself that it's okay to feel this way. That healing isn't linear, and it's okay to have setbacks. Maybe I'd remind myself of the strength it took to survive both the earthquake and the cyberbullying. That I'm still here, still fighting. And that the old me isn't gone, just... changed. Evolving.",
    "Therapist: That's very insightful. How do you feel now, compared to when we started?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but in a good way? Like I've released some of the pressure that's been building up inside me. My body feels a bit more relaxed, and my mind feels clearer. There's still anxiety there, but it's not as overwhelming. It's like I can see a path forward now, even if it's a long and winding one.",
    "Therapist: What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to work on some coping strategies for when I feel triggered. And maybe start talking about how I can slowly face some of the things I've been avoiding. I'm not ready to jump back into social media or anything, but maybe we could start small? I don't know, it's scary to think about, but I also feel ready to try.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling about ending our session today?",
    "Client: I'm okay. A bit raw, but in a healing kind of way, if that makes sense? Like when you clean out a wound. It stings, but you know it's necessary for healing. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know we have a long way to go, but I feel like I understand myself a bit better now.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Take care of yourself this week, and I'll see you next time.",
    "Client: Thank you. I will. See you next week."
