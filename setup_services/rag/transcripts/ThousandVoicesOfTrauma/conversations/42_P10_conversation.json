    "Therapist: Welcome, Amina. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to dive into some difficult stuff today, and I can already feel my heart racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to work through this together. Can you tell me your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 5... maybe 6 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Let's start with some deep breaths. Ready?",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Yeah, okay. I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day when the cyber bullying started. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see my computer screen. I've just logged into my business's social media account. Everything seems normal at first, but then... oh god, there are so many notifications. Comments, messages, all of them... they're horrible.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: My stomach is in knots. I feel... exposed. Vulnerable. Like everyone can see me, but they're all laughing and pointing. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Amina. What happens next?",
    "Client: I start reading the comments. They're calling me a fraud, saying my business is a scam. Someone's posted personal information about me. I... I can't breathe. It feels like the walls are closing in.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe with me. In... and out. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: (Breathing heavily) It's... it's an 8. Maybe higher.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep going. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I try to delete the comments, but they keep coming. Faster than I can handle. My phone starts buzzing with notifications too. It's everywhere. I can't escape it.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... 'Why me? What did I do to deserve this?' I feel so alone. My husband is away on a business trip, and I'm just sitting here, watching my life fall apart on a screen.",
    "Therapist: You're not alone now. I'm here with you. What do you want to do in that moment?",
    "Client: I want to disappear. I want to shut everything off and hide. But I can't. This is my business, my livelihood. I have to do something, but I don't know what.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as this is happening?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking. I feel nauseous. There's this pressure in my chest, like I can't get enough air. And my head... it's pounding. Everything is so loud, even though it's just... pixels on a screen.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Amina. Stay with it. What happens as time passes?",
    "Client: I... I try to respond to some comments. To defend myself. But it only makes things worse. They twist my words, mock me. I feel so powerless. Hours pass, and I'm still glued to the screen, watching this nightmare unfold.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. God, it feels so real. Like it's happening all over again.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Amina. Take a deep breath. What do you notice around you in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I can hear the clock ticking. The room is getting dark. I've been sitting here for hours, and I haven't moved. My back hurts. My eyes are burning from staring at the screen.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay present. What happens next?",
    "Client: I finally... I finally close the laptop. But I can still hear the notifications on my phone. I turn it off too. The silence is... it's deafening. I feel hollow. Empty.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with that feeling?",
    "Client: I... I curl up on the couch. I'm crying, but it's silent. I feel... I feel broken. Like everything I've worked for is crumbling. I don't know how I'll face anyone again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Amina. Stay with those feelings. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... 'Is this the end of my business? Will I ever recover from this?' I'm scared to check my emails, scared to turn on my phone. I feel so isolated, so exposed.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. An 8, I think. My heart is racing just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. Remember, you're here now, safe in this room.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay. I'm... I'm trying.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, as you're on the couch, what do you wish you could do?",
    "Client: I wish... I wish I could make it all disappear. I wish I could call someone, but I'm too ashamed. I feel like I've let everyone down. My family, my clients... myself.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. How does your body respond to that shame?",
    "Client: My shoulders are hunched. I feel small, like I'm trying to disappear into the couch. My stomach is in knots. I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Amina. What happens as the night goes on?",
    "Client: I... I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see those comments. I keep imagining what people are saying about me. The silence in the house is suffocating. I've never felt so alone.",
    "Therapist: How do you get through the night?",
    "Client: I... I don't really. I drift in and out of sleep, but it's fitful. Every time I wake up, for a split second, I hope it was all a bad dream. But then reality crashes back in.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe a 7? I'm exhausted just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. What do you see in this room right now?",
    "Client: I see... I see the painting on your wall. The soft light from the lamp. My hands... they're shaking a little.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, let's go back. It's the next morning. What happens?",
    "Client: I... I have to face it. I turn on my phone, and it's worse. The messages have spread. People I thought were friends are sharing the posts, adding their own comments. I feel... I feel betrayed.",
    "Therapist: How do you handle that betrayal?",
    "Client: I... I don't know how to handle it. I want to lash out, to defend myself. But I'm paralyzed. Every word I say could be used against me. I feel trapped in my own home, in my own skin.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I finally call my husband. I'm crying so hard I can barely speak. He's worried, confused. I try to explain, but it all comes out jumbled. I feel like I'm drowning in words, in accusations.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to reach out for help?",
    "Client: It's... it's a relief, but also terrifying. I'm scared he'll be ashamed of me, that he'll believe what they're saying. But I need someone. I can't face this alone anymore.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 6. Talking about reaching out... it helps a little.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Let's take a deep breath together. What happens after you talk to your husband?",
    "Client: He... he tells me to step away from the computer, from my phone. He says he's coming home early. I feel guilty for disrupting his trip, but so grateful. I'm not alone anymore.",
    "Therapist: How does your body respond to that support?",
    "Client: I... I feel some of the tension leave my shoulders. My breathing gets a little easier. But I'm still shaky, still scared.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What do you do while waiting for your husband?",
    "Client: I... I force myself to eat something. I hadn't realized how long it had been. I take a shower, trying to wash away the feeling of being watched, judged. But it clings to me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Amina. How do you feel now, remembering all of this?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. My heart is still racing a bit. But it feels different, talking about it here. Like... like I'm looking at it from the outside.",
    "Therapist: That's good. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 5, I think. It still hurts, but it's not overwhelming me like before.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well today, Amina. Let's take a few more deep breaths together before we end the session.",
    "Client: (Takes deep breaths) Thank you. It's... it's hard, but I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength today. How are you feeling about ending our session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired, but in a good way? Like I've worked through something. It's still there, but it feels... manageable.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later. We'll continue working through this in our next session.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you. I... I think I can face the rest of the day now.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today, Amina. Take care of yourself, and I'll see you next time."
