    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I'm right back there in that conference room, you know? I can almost smell the stale coffee and feel the tension in the air. It's strange how vivid it all becomes.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Anger, I think. No, wait... it's more like a mix of anger and helplessness. I'm furious at how they treated me, but at the same time, I feel so... small. Like I'm that scared little girl again, unable to stand up for myself. It's frustrating because I'm a successful professional now, but in that moment, I feel powerless all over again.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does that powerlessness manifest in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a heaviness in my chest. My shoulders feel tense, and there's this knot in my stomach. I notice I'm clenching my fists too. It's as if my body's getting ready for a fight, but there's nowhere to direct that energy. I just feel... stuck.",
    "Therapist: And what thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep hearing their words... \"You'll never amount to anything,\" \"Why don't you just quit?\" It's like a broken record. And then I start thinking, \"Maybe they were right. Maybe I don't belong here.\" But then another part of me gets angry and wants to prove them wrong. It's this constant back-and-forth in my head.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts relate to your experiences now?",
    "Client: Well, I've achieved a lot in my career, but I still struggle with imposter syndrome sometimes. When I'm about to give a presentation or lead a meeting, those old doubts creep in. I worry that someone will suddenly stand up and expose me as a fraud. It's exhausting, always feeling like I have to prove myself.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about the intensity of these feelings?",
    "Client: It's... it's not as overwhelming as it used to be. I mean, during the exercise, it felt really intense. But now, talking about it, I can feel it starting to subside a bit. It's like... I can separate myself from the memory more easily. I'm here, in this room with you, not back there. That's... that's progress, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How does recognizing that progress feel?",
    "Client: It feels... good. Empowering, actually. Like I'm taking back control. I mean, those memories are still painful, but they don't have the same grip on me. I'm starting to see them as just that - memories. Not my current reality. It's like I can observe them without getting completely sucked in.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant shift. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm realizing that... those bullies, they were probably dealing with their own insecurities. It doesn't excuse their behavior, but it helps me see it differently. I'm also proud of how far I've come despite all that. I didn't let them stop me. I pushed through and built a career I'm proud of. That takes strength, doesn't it?",
    "Therapist: Indeed it does. How does acknowledging that strength impact you?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually quite emotional. I'm tearing up a bit. I don't think I've ever really given myself credit for that before. I've always focused on what I could have done differently, how I could have stood up to them. But you're right, I did show strength by not giving up. That feels... really important to recognize.",
    "Therapist: What do you want to remember from this realization?",
    "Client: I want to remember that I'm resilient. That even when I feel powerless, I have inner strength. I've overcome so much, and I can face whatever comes my way. I also want to remember that those bullies' words don't define me. My actions, my achievements, my kindness - that's what defines me. And maybe... maybe I can use my experience to help others who are going through similar situations.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful perspective. How might this change things for you?",
    "Client: I think... I think it might help me be kinder to myself. Maybe I won't be so hard on myself when I make mistakes or feel uncertain. And in meetings or presentations, instead of worrying about being \"exposed,\" I can remind myself of how far I've come. It's like... I'm rewriting the narrative. I'm not a victim anymore; I'm a survivor, a thriver even.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to claim that identity?",
    "Client: It feels... liberating. Like a weight's been lifted. I'm sitting up straighter now, did you notice? (laughs softly) It's like my body's responding to this new way of thinking. I feel... stronger. More grounded. Like I can face anything. It's not that the pain is gone, but it doesn't define me anymore. I define me.",
    "Therapist: That's a profound shift. What's next for you in this journey?",
    "Client: I think... I want to explore ways to use my experience to help others. Maybe mentoring young professionals or speaking about workplace bullying. And personally, I want to keep working on internalizing this new perspective. It's one thing to say it, but really believing it... that's the next step. But I feel hopeful, you know? Like I'm finally breaking free from those old chains.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a meaningful path forward. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... lighter. More at peace. There's still a bit of residual tension from the exercise, but overall, I feel... hopeful. Empowered. Like I've reclaimed a part of myself that I thought was lost. It's a good feeling. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know we still have work to do, but I feel like I've made a real breakthrough today.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredible work today. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to delve deeper into strategies for maintaining this new perspective, especially when I'm in triggering situations at work. And maybe we could explore more about how I can use my experience to help others. I'm feeling motivated to turn this painful experience into something positive, you know? Is that something we could work on?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll pick up there next time. How would you like to close today?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to take a moment to just sit with this new feeling. To really let it sink in. Is it okay if we just sit in silence for a minute? I want to remember this moment, this feeling of empowerment and hope. It feels important.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's do that.",
    "Client: Thank you. I feel ready to face the world now. Same time next week?",
    "Therapist: Yes, I'll see you then. Take care."
