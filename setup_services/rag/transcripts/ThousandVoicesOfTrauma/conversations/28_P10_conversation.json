    "Therapist: Welcome, Amir. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is dreading it. It's been years since I've really thought about the divorce, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start slowly. Can you close your eyes and bring yourself back to that time?",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm closing my eyes. I can see our old apartment. It's... it's a sunny day, but it feels cold somehow.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's happening?",
    "Client: I'm sitting at the kitchen table. My hands are shaking a bit. I'm waiting for Sarah to come home. I know... I know this is the day I'm going to tell her I want a divorce.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My stomach is in knots. I feel like I might throw up. My palms are sweaty, and I keep wiping them on my pants.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'd say... maybe a 60? It's uncomfortable, but I can handle it.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: I hear her key in the lock. My heart starts racing. She walks in, and she looks... happy. God, that makes it worse. She starts talking about her day, but I can barely focus on her words. I'm just thinking, \"How do I do this? How do I break her heart?\"",
    "Therapist: Stay present in that moment. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I interrupt her. I say, \"Sarah, we need to talk.\" Her face changes immediately. She knows something's wrong. I gesture for her to sit down, but she doesn't. She just stands there, looking at me with these wide, scared eyes.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's climbing. Maybe 75 now. This is... this is harder than I thought it would be.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Amir. Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: (Inhales deeply) Okay... okay. I start talking. I tell her that I've been unhappy for a long time. That I don't think we're right for each other anymore. Her face... it just crumples. She starts crying, asking why, what she did wrong. And I feel like the worst person in the world.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm thinking, \"Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I should just take it all back.\" But I know I can't. I know this is what I need to do. But seeing her in pain... it's killing me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Amir. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's pretty high now. Maybe 85? My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. Remember, you're just observing these memories.",
    "Client: (Breathes deeply) Sarah's yelling now. She's saying I'm a coward, that I never really loved her. Each word feels like a punch to the gut. I want to defend myself, but I know it'll only make things worse. So I just sit there, taking it.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice in your body as this is happening?",
    "Client: I feel... small. Like I'm shrinking into the chair. My shoulders are hunched, and I can't look her in the eye. I'm gripping the edge of the table so hard my knuckles are white.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: She storms out of the room. I hear her in the bedroom, slamming drawers, throwing things into a suitcase. I should go after her, but I'm frozen. I can't move. I just sit there, listening to the sounds of our marriage ending.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Guilty. So incredibly guilty. And scared. What if I'm making the biggest mistake of my life?",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's pretty high. Maybe 90? I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Let's take a moment. Focus on your breathing. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: (Breathes slowly) Okay... okay. I'm... I'm still in the kitchen. Sarah comes back out with her suitcase. Her face is red and puffy from crying. She looks at me one last time and says, \"I hope you're happy now.\" Then she's gone. The door slams shut, and I'm alone.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Empty. Just... completely empty. Like someone's hollowed me out. I should feel relieved, but I don't. I just feel... numb.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I don't do anything. I just sit there for hours. The sun goes down, and I'm still at the kitchen table. I can't bring myself to move. It's like... if I stay still, maybe it won't be real.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually going down a bit. Maybe 75? The numbness is setting in.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Amir. Can you describe the apartment around you?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mess. There are pictures of us on the walls that I can't look at. Her coffee mug is still on the counter from this morning. Everything looks the same, but it all feels different now. Like I'm in a stranger's home.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... \"What now?\" I've been with Sarah for so long, I don't know how to be alone. I'm wondering if I'll ever find someone else, if I even want to. And then I feel guilty for thinking about that already.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those thoughts. How are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: Exhausted. My body feels heavy, like I've run a marathon. My eyes are burning from holding back tears. I realize I haven't eaten all day, but I'm not hungry.",
    "Therapist: What do you do as the night goes on?",
    "Client: I finally get up from the table. My joints are stiff. I wander around the apartment, touching things that remind me of Sarah. Her books, her favorite blanket on the couch. I end up in the bedroom, staring at her empty side of the closet.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... fluctuating. Sometimes it spikes to 80 or 85, then drops back down to 60. It's like waves of emotion.",
    "Therapist: That's very common. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: I lie down on the bed, on her side. I can smell her perfume on the pillow. That's when I finally break down. I start sobbing, really ugly crying. I can't remember the last time I cried like that.",
    "Therapist: Allow yourself to feel those emotions. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm thinking about all the things we'll never do together. The future we planned that's gone now. I'm wondering if I made the right choice, if I should call her and beg her to come back. But then I remember why I wanted the divorce in the first place.",
    "Therapist: What were those reasons?",
    "Client: We'd grown apart. We wanted different things. I felt... stifled, like I couldn't be myself anymore. But in this moment, all I can think about is the good times.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. How long do you stay like that?",
    "Client: I don't know. Hours, maybe. I eventually fall into a restless sleep. When I wake up, it's morning, and for a split second, I forget. Then it all comes crashing back.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel in that moment of realization?",
    "Client: Like I've been punched in the gut. The pain is fresh all over again. But there's also... a tiny bit of relief. Like a weight has been lifted, even though I'm sad.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually lower. Maybe 50? I'm sad, but I also feel... I don't know, like I can breathe a little easier.",
    "Therapist: That's good, Amir. You're processing these emotions well. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I force myself to get up. I take a shower, make some coffee. Everything feels surreal, like I'm moving underwater. But I'm doing it. I'm functioning.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Surprised, I guess. I thought I'd be completely broken, but I'm not. I'm hurting, but I'm... okay. I'm going to be okay.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, but... hopeful, maybe? My distress level is probably around 40 now. It still hurts, but it feels manageable.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well, Amir. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Take a few deep breaths.",
    "Client: (Breathes deeply) Thank you. That was... intense. But I feel like I understand that time better now.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great courage today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... lighter, somehow. Like I've put down a heavy load I've been carrying for years.",
    "Therapist: That's often how people feel after processing difficult memories. We'll end here for today. Well done, Amir."
