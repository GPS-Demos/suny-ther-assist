    "Therapist: Welcome, Amir. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to be talking about my uncle's illness, and it's just... it's a lot.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to work through this together. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in the hospital. The corridors are so white, so sterile. The smell of disinfectant is overwhelming. I can hear the beeping of machines in the distance. My hands are shaking as I walk towards my uncle's room.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 6.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I reach his room. The door is slightly ajar. I can hear my aunt crying softly inside. My heart is racing. I push the door open, and... oh god.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it, Amir. You're doing well.",
    "Client: He looks so small in that bed. All these tubes and wires... His skin is so pale, almost yellow. His eyes are closed, and his breathing is labored. I... I can't believe this is my uncle. He was always so strong, so full of life.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: I feel... helpless. Scared. Angry. Why him? Why is this happening? My aunt looks up at me, her eyes red and puffy. She tries to smile, but it's more of a grimace. I want to comfort her, but I don't know how.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to an 8.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Amir. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... I... I walk closer to the bed. The machines are so loud in here. Beep, beep, beep. It's like they're counting down. I reach out and touch his hand. It's cold. So cold. I remember all the times he held my hand when I was little, teaching me to write in Arabic. Now... now I'm holding his, and he doesn't even know I'm here.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Amir. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I sit down in the chair next to the bed. The doctor comes in. He's talking, but I can barely hear him over the pounding in my ears. Words like \"advanced stage\" and \"limited options\" float around. My aunt is sobbing now. I should comfort her, but I'm frozen. I can't move. I can't speak. I just stare at my uncle's face, willing him to open his eyes.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking this isn't real. It can't be real. Just last month we were celebrating Eid together. He was laughing, telling jokes. How can he be... how can he be dying? It's not fair. He's only 45. He has two kids. They need him. We all need him.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath, Amir. Feel your feet on the ground. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... The doctor leaves. It's just us now. The beeping of the machines, my aunt's quiet sobs, and my uncle's labored breathing. I'm holding his hand tighter now, as if I can keep him here by sheer force of will. I start talking to him, telling him about my classes, about the family, anything to fill the silence. I don't know if he can hear me, but I hope... I hope he knows we're here.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel like I'm drowning. Like there's this weight on my chest and I can't breathe. But I have to be strong. For my aunt, for my cousins. I can't break down. Not here, not now.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed, Amir. These are difficult emotions.",
    "Client: Yeah... I... I spend hours in that room. People come and go. Family members, friends. They all look shocked, devastated. My cousins arrive. They're so young. They don't really understand what's happening. I watch as they climb onto the bed, cuddling up to their dad. It's... it's heartbreaking.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's still... still at a 9. Maybe even a 10. I feel like I'm reliving it all over again.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe, Amir. You're safe here in the present.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Right... As night falls, the room gets quieter. The visiting hours are over, but they let us stay. My aunt is asleep in a chair. My cousins are curled up on a small sofa. I'm still sitting there, holding his hand. The machines keep beeping. I'm so tired, but I can't sleep. I'm afraid... I'm afraid if I close my eyes, he'll be gone when I open them.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Amir. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: I... I must have dozed off at some point. Because suddenly, I'm jolted awake by a change in the beeping. It's faster, more urgent. My aunt is already on her feet, calling for a nurse. Everything happens so fast after that. Doctors and nurses rush in. They're shouting orders, moving around the bed. I'm pushed to the side, watching helplessly as they work on my uncle. It's like a scene from a movie, but it's real. Too real.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. My heart is racing. I can't breathe. I want to do something, anything, but I'm useless. All I can do is watch and pray. Please, please don't let him die. Not like this. Not now.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's off the charts. A 10. Maybe even higher if that's possible.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment, Amir. Breathe deeply. Feel the ground beneath you.",
    "Client: *deep, shaky breath* Okay... The doctors are still working. It feels like hours, but it's probably only minutes. And then... and then they stop. One of them looks at the clock and says something. I can't hear it over the ringing in my ears, but I know. I know what it means. My aunt collapses to the floor, wailing. I'm still frozen, staring at my uncle's face. He looks... peaceful. Like he's just sleeping. But he's not. He's gone. He's really gone.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well, Amir. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... numb. Like this isn't real. Like I'm watching it happen to someone else. But at the same time, there's this pain in my chest. It's like something's been ripped out of me.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction to such a traumatic event. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I don't really remember much after that. It's all a blur. I remember hugging my aunt, both of us crying. I remember having to tell my cousins when they woke up. Their faces... I'll never forget their faces when they realized their dad was gone. It was like watching their world shatter.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe an 8 now. Talking about it... it hurts, but it's also like... like I'm letting some of the pressure out.",
    "Therapist: That's good, Amir. You're processing these emotions. Keep going.",
    "Client: The next few days were a whirlwind. Planning the funeral, dealing with paperwork, trying to support my aunt and cousins. I felt like I was on autopilot. I couldn't let myself break down. I had to be strong for everyone else. But at night, when I was alone... that's when it would hit me. The grief, the anger, the guilt.",
    "Therapist: Guilt? Can you elaborate on that?",
    "Client: I... I kept thinking about all the times I could have visited him more. All the phone calls I didn't make because I was too busy with school. What if I had noticed something was wrong earlier? Could we have caught the illness sooner? It's... it's irrational, I know, but I can't help it.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are common, Amir. How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around a 7 now. Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also kind of... relieving?",
    "Therapist: That's often the case. Expressing these feelings can help process them. What else do you remember?",
    "Client: The funeral was... it was beautiful, in a sad way. So many people came. I didn't realize how many lives my uncle had touched. People kept telling stories about him, how he'd helped them, made them laugh. It made me proud to be his nephew, but it also made the loss feel even greater.",
    "Therapist: How did you cope in the weeks following?",
    "Client: It was... it was tough. I threw myself into my studies, trying to distract myself. But everything reminded me of him. A song on the radio, a joke someone told, even certain foods. It was like... like there was this hole in my life that I didn't know how to fill.",
    "Therapist: That's a very normal part of grief. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 6, I think. Talking about it... it still hurts, but it's not as overwhelming as before.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Amir. How do you feel the loss has affected you long-term?",
    "Client: It's... it's changed me. I think I've become more aware of how fragile life is. I try to spend more time with my family now, to tell them I love them more often. But I also struggle sometimes. There are days when the grief hits me out of nowhere, and it's like I'm back in that hospital room.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience with grief. It comes in waves. How do you handle those moments?",
    "Client: I... I try to let myself feel it. I used to try to push it away, but that just made it worse. Now, I let myself cry if I need to. I talk to my parents or friends about it. Sometimes I look at old photos or videos of my uncle. It hurts, but it also helps me feel connected to him.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a healthy approach. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 5 now. I feel... drained, but also kind of... lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying around.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress, Amir. How do you feel about the session overall?",
    "Client: It was... it was tough. Really tough. But also... I don't know, cathartic? Like I've finally been able to really talk about it, to process it. I didn't realize how much I'd been holding in.",
    "Therapist: That's often the case with these sessions. You've done incredibly well today, Amir.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I understand now why we do this. It's painful, but it's also... healing, in a way.",
    "Therapist: Exactly. We'll end here for today. Remember to practice self-care this week.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you... really. This... this helped more than I expected.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Amir. We'll continue working through this in our next session."
