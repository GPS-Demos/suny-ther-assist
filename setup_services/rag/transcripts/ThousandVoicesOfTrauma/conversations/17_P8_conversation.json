    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is buzzing, you know? My heart is still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. The memory of that accident, it just... it felt so real again. I could almost smell the burning rubber and hear the screeching tires. It's like I was right back there on that road.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: God, so many. I keep thinking about how close I came to... to not making it. And then I feel guilty because I did survive, and others didn't. It's like, why me? Why did I get to walk away when that family in the other car... I just can't shake the image of their crumpled vehicle. And then I start thinking about my own family, and how I haven't really told them much about what happened that day. I feel like I'm carrying this huge secret.",
    "Therapist: How does carrying that affect you?",
    "Client: It's... it's exhausting. Like I'm constantly on guard, you know? I'm afraid if I let my guard down, all these emotions will just come flooding out and I won't be able to stop them. And then there's this voice in my head that keeps saying I should be over it by now. It's been months, right? But every time I get behind the wheel, I feel this surge of panic. My palms get sweaty, my vision narrows... it's like I'm right back in that moment before impact.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice in your body as you describe this?",
    "Client: Um... my shoulders are really tense. I just realized I'm kind of hunched over. And there's this knot in my stomach that wasn't there before. It's like my whole body is bracing for something bad to happen. I can feel my heart speeding up again, and my breathing is getting shallow. It's... it's uncomfortable. I don't like feeling this way.",
    "Therapist: That sounds challenging. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to ground myself a bit. Can we do that breathing exercise again? The one where we count? I feel like I'm starting to spiral a bit, and I don't want to lose control here. It's just... talking about it makes it all feel so fresh again. Like it just happened yesterday instead of months ago. And then I start questioning everything. Was there something I could have done differently? Should I have seen it coming? It's like my brain won't shut off.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take a moment to breathe together.",
    "Client: *Takes a deep breath* Okay... that helps a little. It's just... it's frustrating, you know? I came here as a refugee, thinking I was finally safe. And then this happens. It's like... can I ever really feel secure? I keep having these nightmares where I'm back in my home country, but the car accident is happening there. It's all mixed up in my head.",
    "Therapist: How do these mixed experiences impact you?",
    "Client: It's... it's confusing. Sometimes I feel like I don't know where I belong anymore. Like, I'm grateful to be here, away from the dangers back home. But then this accident happens, and it's like... nowhere is really safe, you know? And that scares me. I find myself pulling away from people, even though I know that's not healthy. It's just... easier sometimes to be alone than to try to explain all of this mess in my head.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to share this with others?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me thinks it might be a relief, you know? To not have to carry it all by myself. But then I worry... what if they don't understand? What if they think I'm weak or crazy? Or worse, what if they start treating me differently? Like I'm fragile or something. I don't want pity. I just... I want to feel normal again. But I don't even know what normal is supposed to feel like anymore.",
    "Therapist: How does that uncertainty affect your day-to-day life?",
    "Client: It's... it's exhausting. Every decision feels like this huge thing. Like, should I go out with friends or stay in? What if something happens? What if I have a panic attack in public? And then there's the guilt. I feel guilty for being afraid when I know there are people back home dealing with so much worse. It's like I don't have the right to be struggling this much, you know? But I can't seem to shake it. And then I get angry at myself for not being able to just... get over it. It's this constant cycle of fear, guilt, and anger. And it's affecting everything - my studies, my relationships, even just... enjoying life. I feel like I'm stuck in this gray area where nothing feels quite right.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly challenging. What helps you cope?",
    "Client: I... I've been trying to find little things that ground me. Like, I've started keeping this smooth stone in my pocket. When I feel myself starting to spiral, I touch it, focus on how it feels. It helps bring me back to the present sometimes. And... I've been writing. Not about the accident directly, but just... stuff. How I'm feeling, memories from back home, dreams for the future. It helps get some of the noise out of my head, you know? And... this might sound silly, but I've been listening to a lot of music from my home country. It's... comforting, I guess. Reminds me of who I am, where I came from. It's like... a piece of home I can carry with me.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like powerful coping strategies. How do they make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of things. Sometimes it makes me feel stronger, like I'm taking control back bit by bit. Other times, it makes me sad, thinking about everything I've lost and everything that's changed. But overall, I think it helps. It's like... it's acknowledging that all of this is real, that it happened, but also that I'm still here, still moving forward somehow. Even on the days when it doesn't feel like it. And being here, talking about it... as hard as it is, I think it's helping too. It's like... shining a light on all these dark corners in my mind. It's scary, but... maybe it's necessary? I don't know. I just know I don't want to feel like this forever.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's it like to share that?",
    "Client: It's... it's kind of liberating, actually. Like, saying it out loud makes it more real, but also more manageable somehow? I've been carrying all of this around in my head for so long, it's almost a relief to let some of it out. And... I don't know, maybe it's silly, but just having someone listen without judging... it means a lot. It makes me feel less alone in all of this. Like, maybe there's hope that I can work through this, you know? That maybe one day, the accident won't be the first thing I think about when I wake up, or the last thing on my mind before I go to sleep. That maybe I can find a way to honor what happened without letting it control my life. It's... it's a small thing, but it feels important.",
    "Therapist: It is important. How would you like to end our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to do that grounding exercise we sometimes do at the end? The one where we name things we can see, hear, and feel? It helps me leave feeling a bit more... centered, I guess. And maybe... could we set a small goal for the week? Something manageable? I've been thinking about maybe reaching out to a friend I've been avoiding. Just a text or something. I'm not sure if I'm ready, but... maybe it's a step in the right direction? I don't know. What do you think?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great plan. Shall we begin the grounding exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I'm ready."
