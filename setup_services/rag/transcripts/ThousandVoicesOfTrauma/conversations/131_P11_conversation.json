    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. Going through that memory of the earthquake again was intense. I could almost feel the ground moving beneath me, you know? And the sounds... the crashing and the screams. It's like I was right back there.",
    "Therapist: That sounds overwhelming. What stood out most?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. Watching buildings collapse and not being able to do anything. There was this moment when I saw a child crying, looking for their parents, and I just... froze. I wanted to help, but I couldn't move. I feel so guilty about that.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt affect you now?",
    "Client: It's... it's always there, in the background. Like, I'll be going about my day, and suddenly I'll remember that child's face, and it just hits me. I start wondering if I could have done more, if they're okay now. It makes it hard to focus on my studies sometimes.",
    "Therapist: I see. How did it feel to share that today?",
    "Client: It was hard, really hard. But also... I don't know, maybe a little relieving? Like, I've been carrying this around for so long, and now it's out there. It doesn't make it go away, but it feels less... heavy, I guess.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. What else did you notice?",
    "Client: I realized how much this experience has affected my relationships. I've been pushing people away, afraid of getting close. It's like I'm always waiting for another disaster to happen. But going through this memory today, I felt... less alone? Like, even though you weren't there, just having someone listen made a difference.",
    "Therapist: How might this insight impact your goals?",
    "Client: I... I think I want to work on opening up more. Maybe try reconnecting with some friends. It's scary, but I'm tired of feeling isolated. And I want to find a way to give back, maybe volunteer with disaster relief or something. It might help with the guilt.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: A bit drained, honestly. But also... I don't know, hopeful? Like maybe I can actually move past this. It's still scary, and I know we have more work to do, but for the first time in a while, I feel like there might be a light at the end of the tunnel.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I think... I want to try some of those grounding techniques we talked about when the memories get overwhelming. And maybe... maybe I'll reach out to my old roommate this week. We used to be close, and I've been avoiding her calls. It's a small step, but it feels important.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How can I support you until next time?",
    "Client: Just... knowing you're here helps. And maybe we could go over those breathing exercises again? I tried them on my own, but I'm not sure I'm doing them right. They seem to help when I'm feeling anxious, though.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's review those now. Ready?",
    "Client: Yeah, I'm ready. Thank you for... for everything. This isn't easy, but I'm glad I'm doing it. I just hope it gets easier with time.",
    "Therapist: It often does. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do it. I'm nervous, but I'm trying to remember what you said about facing these fears head-on. It's the only way through, right?",
