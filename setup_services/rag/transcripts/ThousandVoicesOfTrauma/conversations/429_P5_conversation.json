    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares lately, and I'm not sure I'm ready for this.",
    "Therapist: I understand. It's normal to feel anxious. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... I've spent so long trying to avoid thinking about my experiences in combat. The idea of purposely revisiting those memories feels terrifying. What if I can't handle it? What if it makes everything worse?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How about we discuss the purpose of this exercise?",
    "Client: Okay, I'm listening. But I'm still not sure about this whole thing. It feels like opening Pandora's box, you know? I've worked so hard to keep these memories locked away.",
    "Therapist: Imaginal exposure helps process trauma memories. It may be challenging, but it's a step towards healing. How does that sound?",
    "Client: I understand the logic, but it's still scary. I'm worried about losing control or getting overwhelmed by emotions I've been suppressing for years. Plus, with my depression, I'm concerned this might push me over the edge.",
    "Therapist: Your safety is our priority. We'll go at your pace and can stop anytime. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: That does make me feel a bit better. I appreciate knowing I have some control over the process. Can you tell me more about what exactly we'll be doing? What should I expect?",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit a specific memory. You'll describe it in detail, present tense. I'll guide you through it.",
    "Client: Okay, that doesn't sound too bad. But what if I start panicking or can't continue? And how long will this last? I'm worried about being stuck in that headspace for too long.",
    "Therapist: If you're uncomfortable, we'll pause. Sessions typically last 45-60 minutes. Your well-being is key.",
    "Client: Alright, I think I can manage that. It's a relief to know we can take breaks if needed. I'm still nervous, but I'm trying to remind myself that this is part of the healing process. Is there anything I can do to prepare myself?",
    "Therapist: Deep breathing can help. Remember, you're safe here. Your courage is admirable.",
    "Client: Thank you, that means a lot. I've been working on my breathing exercises, so I'll definitely use those. I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Can you just... stay with me through this? I'm afraid of getting lost in the memories.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'll be here throughout. Your strength in facing this is remarkable. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Okay, yes. I'm scared, but I'm also hopeful that this might help. Let's do it. I'm ready to face these memories and start healing.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's start with a deep breath. When you're ready, describe where you were..."
