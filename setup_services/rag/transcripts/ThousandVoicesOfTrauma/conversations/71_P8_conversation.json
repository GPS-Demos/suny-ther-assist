    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart is still racing, and I feel... I don't know, shaky? Like I can't quite catch my breath. The memories felt so vivid, almost like I was back there again.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: It's... it's the fear. I can still feel it in my chest. When I think about those moments of being bullied, it's like I'm that helpless kid again. I can hear their taunts, see their sneering faces. I remember feeling so small, so... worthless. And now, even though I know I'm safe here, part of me still feels trapped in that fear.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How does your body feel as you describe this?",
    "Client: Tense. Really tense. My shoulders are all hunched up, and I've got this knot in my stomach. It's like... like my body is getting ready to run or fight, even though there's nothing to run from here. And my hands... they're clammy. I keep wanting to clench them into fists.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking, \"Why me?\" Why did they choose to target me? Was I really that different, that weak? And then I feel angry. Angry at them, angry at myself for not standing up to them. But then... then I think about the topic we discussed, about human trafficking, and I feel... I feel guilty. Like my experiences are nothing compared to what those victims go through. And yet, here I am, still struggling with this.",
    "Therapist: How do those thoughts make you feel?",
    "Client: Confused. Conflicted. On one hand, I want to validate my own pain, my own experiences. But on the other... I feel like I should be stronger, that I shouldn't let this affect me so much after all these years. And when I think about human trafficking victims, I feel... I feel a deep sadness. A sort of... connection, I guess? Like I can understand a fraction of their fear and helplessness. It makes me want to do something, to help somehow, but then I feel overwhelmed because... because I can barely help myself sometimes.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to process. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I... I think I need reassurance. That it's okay to still be affected by this. That my feelings are valid, even if others have experienced worse. And... and maybe some hope? That I can work through this, that I can use these experiences to become stronger, to maybe even help others someday. But right now, it all feels so... so heavy.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are absolutely valid. How can we help you feel more grounded?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe... maybe if we could talk about some coping strategies? Something I can use when these memories and feelings become overwhelming. And... and maybe we could discuss more about how I can channel this experience into something positive? I know it sounds silly, but part of me wants to find a way to use this pain to make a difference, even if it's small.",
    "Therapist: That's not silly at all. It's very common. What kind of difference do you envision?",
    "Client: I've been thinking... maybe I could volunteer at a local youth center? Help kids who might be going through similar experiences. Or... or maybe I could get involved with anti-bullying campaigns in schools. I just... I want to turn this pain into something meaningful, you know? But then I worry... what if I'm not strong enough? What if helping others brings all these feelings back up again?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How might you address them?",
    "Client: I suppose... I could start small? Maybe look into online volunteering opportunities first, where I have more control over my involvement. And... and I could work on building up my own resilience through therapy and self-care. Maybe set some boundaries for myself, learn when to step back if it becomes too much. And... and maybe talking to others who've gone through similar experiences and are now helping others? That could be inspiring and give me some practical advice.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like thoughtful steps. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... a bit lighter, actually. Still shaky, still emotional, but... there's a glimmer of hope there. Like maybe I can use these experiences to grow, to help others. It doesn't erase the pain or fear, but it gives it... purpose, I guess? And talking about it, really diving into those memories and feelings... it's hard, but I think it's helping. It's like... like I'm slowly taking back control from those memories. They don't have as much power over me when I face them head-on.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's your next step?",
    "Client: I think... I think I want to continue with these exposure exercises. They're tough, but I can see how they're helping. And maybe we could spend some time in our next session discussing more concrete ways I can start working towards that goal of helping others? Nothing big yet, just... baby steps. And... and I'd like to work on some more grounding techniques for when the memories get overwhelming. Is that... is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll work on that together. How would you like to end today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to do a quick grounding exercise before I leave. Something to help me feel more centered and calm. And... and maybe we could end with a reminder of how far I've come? Sometimes I forget that, you know? I focus so much on how far I have to go that I forget to look back and see the progress I've made. It would be nice to end on a positive note, to carry that with me for the rest of the day.",
    "Therapist: That's a great idea. Let's do that. Ready to start the grounding exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, I'm ready. And... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It means more than I can say."
