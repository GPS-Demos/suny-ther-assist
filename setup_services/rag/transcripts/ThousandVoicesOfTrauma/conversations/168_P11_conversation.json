    "Therapist: How are you feeling after going through that memory today, Mr. Singh?",
    "Client: I... it's hard to put into words, really. The earthquake was so long ago, but reliving it just now... it's like I was right back there. I could feel the ground shaking, hear the screams... (pauses, takes a deep breath) It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. I remember holding onto my wife and children, trying to protect them, but feeling so... powerless. The earth was literally crumbling beneath our feet, and there was nothing I could do to stop it. It's... it's a feeling that's stayed with me all these years.",
    "Therapist: How does that feeling of helplessness affect you now?",
    "Client: It... it creeps up on me sometimes. Like when I'm at work and there's a big project I can't control, or when I hear about natural disasters on the news. I get this tight feeling in my chest, and I start to worry about my family's safety. It's... it's exhausting, honestly.",
    "Therapist: That sounds challenging. How did today's session compare to those moments?",
    "Client: It was... different, somehow. Talking through it, step by step... it was hard, but I felt more... in control, I guess? Like I could face the memory without being completely overwhelmed by it. It's still painful, but... maybe a bit less scary?",
    "Therapist: That's a significant observation. What do you think made the difference?",
    "Client: Well, having you here, guiding me through it... that helped. And knowing it was just a memory, not happening right now. I could... I could separate myself from it a bit, if that makes sense? It's like... I'm not that helpless person anymore. I've survived, I've grown stronger.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. How might this affect your daily life?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe I could try to remember that feeling when I start to get anxious? Like, remind myself that I've faced worse and come through it. It might help me stay calmer in stressful situations at work or home.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a helpful strategy. How do you feel about continuing this process?",
    "Client: It's... it's not easy. But I think it's helping. Each time we do this, it feels a little less overwhelming. And being able to talk about it afterwards, to process it... that makes a big difference. I'm... I'm willing to keep going.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is commendable. What would you like to focus on next time?",
    "Client: I think... maybe we could explore how the earthquake affected my relationship with my family? I've always felt this need to protect them, but sometimes I wonder if I'm too overprotective. It might be good to... to talk that through.",
    "Therapist: That's a thoughtful direction. Is there anything else you'd like to share?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I suppose. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's not easy to talk about, but... I think it's helping. I feel... lighter, somehow. Like I'm starting to let go of a weight I've been carrying for years.",
    "Therapist: Your progress is remarkable. How will you take care of yourself for the rest of the day?",
    "Client: I think I'll take a walk in the park near our house. Being in nature... it helps me feel grounded. And then maybe I'll cook dinner for my family. Doing something nurturing for them and for myself... it feels like a good way to end the day.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like an excellent plan. Remember to be gentle with yourself.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again. I... I'm looking forward to our next session, even though I know it won't be easy. But I feel like I'm making progress, and that's... that's worth a lot."
