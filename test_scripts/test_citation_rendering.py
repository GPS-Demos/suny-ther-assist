Therapist: Let's explore how you've been feeling about the exposure therapy exercises we've been practicing.
Client: I've been trying, but it's really hard. I get so anxious even thinking about going to crowded places.
Therapist: That's understandable. The anxiety you're experiencing is a normal part of the process. 
Client: Sometimes I wonder if we should try something else. This feels too overwhelming.
Therapist: I hear your concern. Let's discuss adjusting our approach to make it more manageable.
