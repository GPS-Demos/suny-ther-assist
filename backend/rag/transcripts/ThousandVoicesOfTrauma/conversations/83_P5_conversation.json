    "Therapist: Welcome, Ali. Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of reliving that time when I was falsely imprisoned... it's terrifying. My heart's already racing just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried that talking about it will bring back all those intense feelings of helplessness and fear. What if I can't handle it? What if I have a panic attack right here in your office? And... I'm scared that reliving it might somehow make things worse instead of better.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How about we discuss the purpose of this exercise?",
    "Client: Okay, that might help. Because right now, I'm struggling to see how this could possibly be beneficial. It feels like I've been trying so hard to forget, and now you're asking me to remember everything in detail. It's... it's really overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: I understand. The goal is to process the memory, reducing its power over you.",
    "Client: Process the memory? What does that mean exactly? And how can reliving something so traumatic possibly reduce its power? It feels like it would do the opposite.",
    "Therapist: By facing it in a safe environment, we can change how your brain responds to the memory.",
    "Client: I see... So, it's like exposure therapy for phobias, but for traumatic memories instead? That makes some sense, I guess. But it still sounds really intense. What should I expect during the session?",
    "Therapist: You'll describe the event in detail. It may be emotional, but I'll guide you through it.",
    "Client: Okay... That sounds challenging. Will I have to close my eyes? I'm not sure I can do that without feeling trapped again. And what if I start to panic? Or if I can't continue?",
    "Therapist: Eyes open is fine. We can pause anytime. Your safety is our priority.",
    "Client: That's a relief. I appreciate your flexibility. It helps to know I have some control over the process. I'm still nervous, but I think I'm willing to give it a try. How long will this session last?",
    "Therapist: About 45 minutes. We'll go at your pace and take breaks if needed.",
    "Client: Alright, I think I can manage that. It's shorter than I expected, which is good. Can you tell me a bit more about how this is supposed to help with my PTSD symptoms? I've been having such intense flashbacks and nightmares lately.",
    "Therapist: It helps your brain process the memory, reducing flashbacks and nightmares over time.",
    "Client: I see. That would be amazing if it works. The flashbacks have been really disrupting my studies and my relationship. My girlfriend tries to be supportive, but I know it's hard for her too. I'm hoping this therapy can help me get back to feeling like myself again.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. This is a big step towards recovery.",
    "Client: Thank you, that means a lot. I'm trying to be brave, but it's not easy. I keep reminding myself that I'm doing this to get better, to reclaim my life. Is there anything else I should know before we start?",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. We'll go through this together at your pace.",
    "Client: Okay. I appreciate your support. I'm nervous, but I think I'm ready to begin. Let's do this."
