    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. How are you feeling today as we begin our session?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about my experiences in the cult, and it's not easy to revisit those memories.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. I guess I should start with the day I first joined. I was feeling lost, you know? My girlfriend had just broken up with me, and I was struggling at work. This group promised answers, purpose. At first, it seemed so welcoming...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: They had these meetings where the leader would speak. He was so charismatic, so convincing. I remember sitting there, hanging on his every word. He talked about how we were special, chosen. But then things started to change. The demands became more intense. We were expected to cut ties with our families, donate more money...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) It's hard to admit how much control they had over me. They made me feel like I couldn't trust my own thoughts. If I questioned anything, they'd say I was being influenced by negative forces. I started to doubt everything about myself.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The emotional manipulation was constant. They'd praise me one minute, then tear me down the next. I remember one time, I missed a meeting because I was sick. When I came back, they acted like I had betrayed them. They made me stand in front of everyone and confess my 'sins'. I felt so small, so ashamed...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) The worst part was how they isolated us. They convinced me that my family didn't understand, that they were holding me back. I stopped talking to my parents, my sister... God, I missed so many important moments. Birthdays, holidays... I can't get that time back.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment if you need to. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (takes a few deep breaths) It's hard to believe I let it go on for so long. Two years of my life, just... gone. And when I finally started to see through it all, they turned on me so quickly. The same people who called me brother were suddenly treating me like an enemy. The things they said... it was like they were trying to break me.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Leaving was the hardest thing I've ever done. I felt so alone, so scared. I didn't know who I was anymore. Everything I thought I knew had been a lie. And the guilt... God, the guilt was overwhelming. For falling for it, for the things I'd said and done while I was in there...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're processing this well.",
    "Client: (wiping tears) Sometimes I still have nightmares about it. I dream that I'm back there, trapped. Or that they've found me, that they're going to drag me back. I wake up in a cold sweat, heart pounding. It's getting better, but... it's still there, you know?",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm trying to rebuild my life now. Reconnecting with my family has been... it's been hard, but good. They've been so understanding, more than I deserve. Work is getting better too. But sometimes I still feel so... damaged. Like I'll never fully trust myself or anyone else again.",
    "Therapist: You're showing remarkable resilience. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Drained, but... maybe a little lighter? Talking about it is hard, but I know it's necessary. I want to move past this, to not let it define me anymore. I just hope I can get there someday.",
    "Therapist: You're on the right path. We'll end here for today."
