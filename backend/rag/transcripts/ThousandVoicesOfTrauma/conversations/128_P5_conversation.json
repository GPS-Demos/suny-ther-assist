    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. Today we'll be focusing on imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of reliving my car accident... it's scary. Plus, with everything going on at work and the stress from that cyberbullying incident last month, I'm not sure I can handle it.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. Can you tell me more about your worries?",
    "Client: Well, I'm afraid I'll lose control. What if I can't handle the memories? And... I've been drinking more lately to cope with stress. I'm worried that might affect how I respond to the exercise.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your honesty. How do you think the drinking might impact today's session?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. Maybe it'll make it harder to focus? Or maybe I'll be too emotional? I just don't want to fall apart completely.",
    "Therapist: Your resilience is clear. Shall we discuss how we'll approach this together?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I need to know what to expect. Will it be like reliving the entire accident? Because that sounds terrifying. And how long will it last? I'm worried about getting too overwhelmed and not being able to go back to work afterwards.",
    "Therapist: We'll start gradually, focusing on manageable parts. It won't last the whole session. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's a relief. I was imagining having to go through the entire accident in vivid detail. But if we can take it step by step, that might be okay. Can you tell me more about what exactly we'll be doing?",
    "Therapist: We'll guide you through recalling the memory, focusing on sensory details. You're in control throughout. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: That sounds less scary than what I was imagining. But I'm still nervous about facing those memories. I've been trying so hard to avoid thinking about the accident. And with the recent cyberbullying, I feel like I'm already on edge. How will this help me in the long run?",
    "Therapist: It helps reduce PTSD symptoms by processing the memory. Your bravery in facing this is commendable.",
    "Client: Thank you. I guess I can see how it might help. I've been having nightmares and flashbacks, and they're affecting my work and relationships. If this can help reduce those, it might be worth it. But what if I get too upset during the exercise?",
    "Therapist: We can pause anytime. I'll be here to support you throughout. What coping strategies help you feel grounded?",
    "Client: Deep breathing helps sometimes. And I have a stress ball that I like to squeeze. Would it be okay if I brought that in with me? Also, is it normal to feel this anxious about the exercise?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely, bring your stress ball. Your anxiety is normal and understandable. How else can I support you?",
    "Client: Just knowing you'll be there helps. Could you maybe remind me to breathe if you see me getting too tense? And... I know this might sound silly, but could we have a code word if I need to stop? It might make me feel more in control.",
    "Therapist: Of course. What word would you like to use?",
    "Client: How about \"lighthouse\"? It reminds me of safety and guidance. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: \"Lighthouse\" it is. Anything else you'd like to discuss before we begin?",
    "Client: I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Thank you for being so patient with me. I know I've been difficult lately, especially with the drinking. I really want to get better, for myself and for my family. I'm scared, but I'm also hopeful that this might help me move forward.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is admirable. Shall we start with a brief relaxation exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, please. That would be really helpful. I can feel my heart racing already, so a relaxation exercise sounds perfect. Can we do some deep breathing together?",
    "Therapist: Certainly. Let's begin. Take a deep breath in..."
