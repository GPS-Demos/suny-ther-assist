    "Therapist: Alright, Miguel, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the memory of your cult experience.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm there. It's the day I realized I couldn't leave. The walls of the compound feel like they're closing in on me. I can smell the incense burning, and hear the chanting in the background. My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 6 out of 10. It's uncomfortable, but manageable.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue.",
    "Client: I see the leader approaching me. His eyes are intense, almost hypnotic. He's telling me that leaving would be betraying my family, my purpose. I feel trapped, like I can't breathe. My palms are sweating, and there's this knot in my stomach.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to an 8. I'm feeling really anxious.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I want to run, but my feet won't move. I see my parents in the background, nodding in agreement with the leader. I feel so alone, so betrayed. My chest is tight, and I'm starting to feel dizzy.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. How's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: I'm trying to speak, to say I want to leave, but no words come out. The leader is getting closer, his hand on my shoulder. I feel powerless, like I'm shrinking. My throat is dry, and I'm shaking.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: Still a 9. Maybe... maybe slightly less. Like an 8.5?",
    "Therapist: Good. You're processing it. Continue.",
    "Client: I... I see myself giving in. Nodding. Agreeing to stay. But inside, I'm screaming. I feel like I've lost a part of myself. The room starts to spin, and I feel nauseous.",
    "Therapist: How about now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually dropping. Maybe a 7? I feel sad more than anxious now.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. Keep going.",
    "Client: As I accept that I'm staying, I feel a strange calm. But it's not peaceful - it's more like resignation. I'm numb. The sounds around me become muffled, and I feel disconnected from my body.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6 now. I feel... hollow.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How do you feel physically?",
    "Client: My body feels heavy, like I'm moving in slow motion. The tightness in my chest is easing, but I feel drained. My head is pounding slightly.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue with the memory.",
    "Client: I see myself going through the motions in the following days. Participating in rituals, but feeling dead inside. I'm angry at myself for not being stronger, for not fighting back.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's a 5. I'm feeling more frustrated than anxious now.",
    "Therapist: That's natural. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm remembering the moment I finally decided to leave. It was weeks later. I felt a spark of hope, of determination. But also intense fear. My heart is racing again, but it's different this time.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a 4 now. I feel more in control remembering this part.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... stronger. Remembering how I eventually got out makes me proud. My breathing is easier, and the tension in my muscles is releasing. I'm exhausted, but there's a sense of relief.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's start wrapping up. Final SUDS?",
    "Client: I'd say it's down to a 3 now. I feel drained but... okay.",
    "Therapist: Well done, Miguel. You've made significant progress today."
