    "Therapist: Alright, Mr. Lee, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, you can stop at any time. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I understand this is important for my recovery.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your SUDS rating. From 0 to 100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: I'd say about 40. My heart is beating a bit faster than usual.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath and begin describing the home invasion.",
    "Client: It was a quiet evening. I was reading in my armchair when I heard a loud crash from the kitchen. At first, I thought maybe I'd left a window open and something had fallen, but then I heard unfamiliar voices. My heart started racing immediately. I... I froze in my chair, unable to move.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My palms are sweaty, and I can feel my heart pounding in my chest. It's like I'm right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to about 60, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Continue with what happened next.",
    "Client: I heard footsteps coming closer. I wanted to run, but my legs wouldn't move. Then I saw them - two men, both wearing dark clothes and masks. One of them saw me and shouted, \"We've got company!\" I... I've never felt so helpless in my life.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm shaking a little. My mouth feels dry, and there's this knot in my stomach.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 75 now. This is harder than I thought it would be.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. It's normal to feel distressed. Keep going.",
    "Client: The men started ransacking the living room. One of them grabbed my arm and demanded to know where I kept my valuables. His grip was so tight, I can almost still feel it. I stammered out that my safe was in the bedroom. I felt so ashamed, giving in so easily, but I was terrified they might hurt me.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight, and I'm having trouble catching my breath. It's like I'm right back there, feeling that same fear and shame.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 85 now. I didn't realize how much this still affected me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're safe here.",

    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm starting to calm down a bit. My breathing is slowing, but I still feel jittery.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's come down to about 70. Talking about it... it's hard, but I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: You've done very well. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm looking around the room, reminding myself where I am. I can feel the chair beneath me, see the sunlight coming through the window. I'm here, not there.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Better. My heart rate is almost back to normal. I feel... I feel a bit drained, but also somewhat relieved.",
    "Therapist: What's your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: I'd say it's down to about 45 now. It's amazing how much it fluctuated during this exercise.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've made great progress today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was tough, but I'm glad we did this. I feel like I understand my reactions better now.",
    "Therapist: That's the goal. We'll end here for today. Well done, Mr. Lee."
