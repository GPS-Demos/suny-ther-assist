    "Therapist: How are you feeling after today's imaginal exposure, Mr. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. Revisiting those memories of fleeing my village as a child... it's still so vivid. The sounds of gunfire, the panic in everyone's voices... it's like I was right back there again.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you most about that experience today?",
    "Client: The fear. God, the overwhelming fear. I remember clutching my little sister's hand so tightly, thinking if I let go, I'd lose her forever. And the chaos... people running in every direction, screaming... It's like my heart is still racing from it all.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. How are you coping with those feelings right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. My hands are still a bit shaky. But, you know, I'm surprised that I feel a little better than last time. Like, I can talk about it without feeling like I'm going to break down completely. Is that... is that progress?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What do you think has changed?",
    "Client: Well, I guess... I'm starting to see that remembering doesn't mean reliving. I mean, I still feel the emotions, but they're not consuming me like before. It's like... I can observe them without being completely overwhelmed. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. How might this relate to your everyday life?",
    "Client: Hm... I suppose it means that when I have flashbacks or nightmares, I might be able to handle them better? Like, recognize them for what they are without getting lost in them. It's a comforting thought, actually.",
    "Therapist: That's a great insight. What else have you noticed?",
    "Client: I've been thinking about my sister a lot. We lost touch after coming to this country. Part of me has always been afraid to reach out, scared it would bring back too many painful memories. But now... I'm wondering if reconnecting might actually help. Maybe sharing our experiences could be healing for both of us.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant consideration. How does that idea make you feel?",
    "Client: Nervous, definitely. But also... hopeful? For the first time in years, I'm feeling a glimmer of hope that I can reclaim some of what was lost. It's scary, but also exciting.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What do you think your next step might be?",
    "Client: I think... I might try to find her on social media. Just start small, you know? Maybe just a simple message to say hello. I don't want to rush into anything, but I feel ready to at least open that door.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful approach. How can we support that in our sessions?",
    "Client: Maybe we could work on what I might say? Or... or how to handle it if she doesn't respond or if it brings up more difficult memories? I think having a plan would help me feel more prepared.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll incorporate that into our next sessions. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... lighter, I think. Like I've put down a heavy load I've been carrying for years. It's not gone completely, but it feels more manageable now. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know we have more work to do, but for the first time, I really believe I can get through this.",
    "Therapist: Your progress is commendable. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss today?",
