    "Therapist: Welcome, Priya. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. My back's been acting up, and the thought of revisiting that night... it's making me tense up even more.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's start with some deep breaths. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Though part of me wants to run out that door.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember, you're safe here. Can you close your eyes and describe where you are at the beginning of the memory?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in my living room. It's late, maybe around 11 PM. I'm sitting on my sofa, reading a book. The lamp next to me is on, casting a warm glow. Everything feels... peaceful.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I hear a noise. At first, I think it's just the building settling, you know? But then... there's another sound. Louder. Like... like something breaking. My heart starts racing.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 40? It's building.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I put my book down. My hands are shaking. I'm trying to convince myself it's nothing, but deep down, I know something's wrong. I stand up, and that's when I hear footsteps. Heavy. Unfamiliar. They're in my home.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My chest is so tight. I can barely breathe. My legs feel weak, like they might give out. And I'm... I'm frozen. I can't move. I want to run, to scream, but I'm just... stuck.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're here with me, safe in my office. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I see a shadow. It's moving towards me. I can make out the shape of a man. He's big, much bigger than me. And then... then I see something glinting in his hand. A knife. Oh god, I can't... I can't do this.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Priya. You're safe here. Can you feel the chair beneath you?",
    "Client: Yes... yes, I can. It's... it's grounding me a bit.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue. What do you do when you see the knife?",
    "Client: I... I finally find my voice. I scream. It's loud, piercing. I surprise myself with how powerful it is. The intruder, he... he seems startled. He takes a step back.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 70. My heart's pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Priya. Keep going. What happens after you scream?",
    "Client: I... I look around frantically for something, anything to defend myself. My eyes land on a heavy vase on the side table. I lunge for it, nearly tripping over my own feet. My hands are shaking so badly, but I manage to grab it.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. But there's also this... this surge of determination. I'm thinking, \"I won't go down without a fight.\" I... I raise the vase, ready to throw it if he comes any closer.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: Tense. So tense. Every muscle is coiled, ready to spring. I can feel sweat trickling down my back. My mouth is dry. I... I think I'm holding my breath.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe, Priya. You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: The intruder, he... he takes another step back. I can see his eyes darting around, like he's reassessing the situation. He... he says something. His voice is gruff, threatening. He tells me to put the vase down, that he doesn't want to hurt me. But I don't believe him. I can't.",
    "Therapist: How do you respond?",
    "Client: I... I find my voice again. It's shaky, but I manage to yell, \"Get out! I've called the police!\" It's a lie, but... but I hope it scares him. I take a step forward, still holding the vase. I'm... I'm surprised by my own bravery.",
    "Therapist: That was very courageous. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix. I'm still terrified, but there's also this... this spark of strength. Like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe 65 now? It's still high, but... but I feel a bit more in control.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The intruder, he... he hesitates. For a moment, we're just staring at each other. I can hear my own heartbeat, it's so loud. And then... then I hear sirens in the distance. I don't know if they're coming here or not, but... but the intruder panics. He... he turns and runs.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. How do you feel in that moment?",
    "Client: Relief... overwhelming relief. But also... also this lingering fear. Like... like he might come back. I... I collapse onto the sofa, still clutching the vase. I'm shaking so hard I can barely hold onto it.",
    "Therapist: You're safe now, Priya. Remember, this is a memory. You're here with me.",
    "Client: Right... right. I'm here. I'm safe. It's... it's over.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. Exhausted. But also... also a bit proud? I stood my ground. I didn't... I didn't let him hurt me.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You showed incredible strength. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 50 now. Still there, but... but not as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well, Priya. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you name five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: Um... I see your desk, the plant in the corner, the bookshelf, the clock on the wall, and... and the painting of the ocean.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Now, can you tell me how this experience was different from the actual event?",
    "Client: Well... in reality, I didn't grab the vase. I... I just froze completely. The intruder, he... he took my wallet and jewelry and left. I felt so... so helpless.",
    "Therapist: It's common to freeze in traumatic situations. It's a natural response. How do you feel about your actions in today's imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I feel... stronger. Like maybe if it happened again, I could defend myself. It's... it's empowering, in a way.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive shift. Remember, the goal isn't to change the past, but to process it and reduce its power over you. How are you feeling overall now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. But also... also a bit lighter? Like I've let go of something heavy I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Priya. Let's end our session here. Remember to practice your breathing exercises this week. How are you feeling about our next session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm nervous, but also... also a bit eager? I feel like I'm making progress, even if it's hard.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. Take care of yourself this week, and I'll see you next time.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I appreciate your support."
