    "Therapist: Hello. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi, Dr. Chen. I'm... I'm not sure. A bit nervous, I guess. I know we talked about doing something different today, and it's making me anxious.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We'll take it slow.",
    "Client: Okay. I appreciate that. It's just... I've been trying so hard to avoid thinking about what happened, and now we're going to dive right into it? It feels counterintuitive, you know?",
    "Therapist: I hear you. Shall we discuss the purpose?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I need to understand why we're doing this.",
    "Therapist: It's to process the trauma and reduce symptoms.",
    "Client: I get that, but how? Won't reliving it make things worse? I'm already struggling with nightmares and flashbacks. I'm worried this might intensify them.",
    "Therapist: Valid concern. It may be difficult initially, but\u2014",
    "Client: (interrupting) Initially? How long are we talking about here? I'm not sure I can handle it if this goes on for too long. I've just started feeling a bit more stable lately.",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. You're in control.",
    "Client: Okay... that helps a bit. Can you tell me more about what exactly we'll be doing? I mean, do I just start talking about it, or...?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the experience in detail. I'll guide you.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) That sounds intense. Will I have to close my eyes? I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that. It might make me feel too vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: Eyes open is fine. Whatever feels safe.",
    "Client: Alright. And what if I start panicking? Or if it becomes too much?",
    "Therapist: We can pause anytime. I'm here to support you.",
    "Client: Okay. I appreciate that. It's just... this is all so overwhelming. Part of me wants to run away from this session right now. But I also know I need to face this eventually.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. This is a big step.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm trying to be brave, but it's hard. Can you tell me how this might help with my day-to-day symptoms? Like, how will talking about it now make a difference?",
    "Therapist: It helps process the memory, reducing its power over you.",
    "Client: I see. So, it's like... facing the monster under the bed? Once you look at it, it's not as scary anymore?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. Well put.",
    "Client: Okay. I think I'm starting to understand. It's still scary, but I can see how it might help. How long will this process take? Will we do this every session from now on?",
    "Therapist: We'll do it gradually. Not every session, but regularly.",
    "Client: Alright. I guess that's a relief. It gives me time to process between sessions. Is there anything I should do to prepare for this? Like, should I be doing breathing exercises or something?",
    "Therapist: Good idea. We'll start with relaxation techniques.",
    "Client: That sounds helpful. I'm still nervous, but I feel a bit more prepared now. Thank you for explaining everything. I guess... I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Yes, let's do this. I'm scared, but I trust you. And I want to get better. For myself, for my family... for my future.",
    "Therapist: That's the spirit. We'll take it step by step."
