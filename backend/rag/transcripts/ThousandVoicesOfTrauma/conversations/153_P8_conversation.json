    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is buzzing, you know? My hands are shaky, and my heart's racing. That memory... it brought me right back there, to that moment in the cult compound. I can still smell the incense and hear the chanting. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... shame? I feel ashamed that I let myself get caught up in all of that. I was supposed to be there as a soldier, to help people, but I got pulled in. It's like I failed my mission and myself.",
    "Therapist: How does that shame feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's heavy, like a weight on my chest. My stomach feels tight, and I have this urge to curl up and hide. I keep thinking about how my family would react if they knew. They'd be so disappointed.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind about that fear of disappointment?",
    "Client: I... I guess I'm thinking that I'm weak. That I should have known better. I was trained to resist manipulation, but I still fell for it. What if I'm not as strong as I thought I was? What if I can't trust myself anymore?",
    "Therapist: How does questioning your strength affect you?",
    "Client: It's terrifying, honestly. My strength was always something I could rely on, especially during my deployment. Now, it feels like that foundation is crumbling. I'm scared of what that means for my future, for my relationships. Will I always be this vulnerable?",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about how you're talking to yourself right now?",
    "Client: Oh... I see what you mean. I'm being pretty hard on myself, aren't I? It's like I'm expecting perfection, which isn't realistic. I know that logically, but emotionally, it's a different story. I just... I want to feel in control again.",
    "Therapist: How might self-compassion look in this situation?",
    "Client: Self-compassion? That's... that's tough. I guess I could try to remember that I was in a vulnerable position. The cult leaders were skilled manipulators, and I was dealing with the stress of my combat experiences. Maybe... maybe it's okay that I wasn't perfect. It doesn't erase everything else I've accomplished.",
    "Therapist: What's it like to consider that perspective?",
    "Client: It's a relief, actually. Like a little bit of the weight has lifted. I'm still struggling with the memories and the shame, but there's a part of me that recognizes I'm being too harsh. It's just... it's hard to let go of that perfectionism, you know?",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to let go of some of that perfectionism?",
    "Client: I think... I think it would mean accepting that I'm human. That I can make mistakes and still be valuable, still be strong. It's scary, though. If I'm not perfect, what if people leave me? What if I'm not good enough?",
    "Therapist: How does that fear of not being good enough relate to your experiences?",
    "Client: I guess it goes back to my childhood. My parents always had such high expectations. Then in the military, there was no room for error. And in the cult... they promised perfection, a perfect life if we just followed their rules. It's like I've always been chasing this impossible standard.",
    "Therapist: What do you need right now as you process these realizations?",
    "Client: I... I think I need some kindness. From myself, mostly. This is all so raw and painful. I'm realizing how much I've been carrying, how much I've been beating myself up. Maybe I need to give myself permission to be imperfect, to make mistakes. It's just... it's going to take time to really believe that.",
    "Therapist: How can you show yourself that kindness in the coming week?",
    "Client: I could... maybe I could start by acknowledging when I'm being too hard on myself. Like, when I catch those critical thoughts, I could try to pause and ask if I'd talk to a friend that way. And maybe... maybe I could try doing something nice for myself, like taking a relaxing bath or going for a walk in nature. Just small things to remind myself that I deserve care, even if I'm not perfect.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a compassionate approach. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... lighter, I think. Still shaky from the exposure, but there's a sense of hope too. Like maybe I can work through this, maybe I can learn to accept myself. It's scary, but it also feels like a step forward. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You've done important work today. How would you like to close our session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to take a moment to just breathe. To sit with this new perspective and let it sink in a bit. And maybe... maybe we could end with a reminder that I'm on a journey, that healing takes time, and that's okay. I don't have to have it all figured out right now.",
    "Therapist: That's a wonderful way to end. Let's take that moment together."
