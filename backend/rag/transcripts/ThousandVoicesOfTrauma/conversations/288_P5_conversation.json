    "Therapist: Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of revisiting that car accident... it makes my heart race just thinking about it. I'm not sure if I'm ready for this.",
    "Therapist: Your apprehension is normal. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried that reliving the accident will be too overwhelming. What if I can't handle it? I've spent so much time trying to avoid thinking about it. And... I'm embarrassed to admit this, but I'm afraid I might break down completely in front of you.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. Your feelings are valid. How can I support you?",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I guess I need reassurance that this is actually going to help. And maybe some explanation about what exactly we'll be doing? I'm not sure what to expect, and that's adding to my anxiety.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Imaginal exposure helps process trauma memories. We'll go slowly, and you're in control.",
    "Client: That's somewhat comforting. But what if I start panicking? Or if I can't continue? I don't want to disappoint you or waste our session time.",
    "Therapist: Your safety is priority. We can pause anytime. There's no failure here, only progress.",
    "Client: Okay, that helps. I suppose I'm also worried about how I'll feel afterwards. Will this make my symptoms worse? I've heard exposure therapy can be intense.",
    "Therapist: It can be challenging, but it's effective. We'll debrief after and plan coping strategies.",
    "Client: I see. That makes sense. I guess I'm just scared of facing those memories head-on. They've been locked away for so long. But I trust you, and if you think this will help, I'm willing to try.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. This work is crucial for healing. Any other questions?",
    "Client: Thank you, that means a lot. I do have one more question. How detailed do I need to be when recounting the accident? There are some parts that are still fuzzy, and others that are painfully clear.",
    "Therapist: Share what you remember. Gaps are normal. Focus on sensory details and emotions.",
    "Client: Alright, I think I understand. It's going to be hard, but I'm ready to give it a try. I appreciate your patience with all my questions and concerns. It helps to know that you'll be here guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: Your readiness is a big step. We'll take it moment by moment. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do this. I'm nervous, but I'm also feeling a glimmer of hope. Maybe this will finally help me move past the trauma and reclaim my life. I'm ready when you are."
