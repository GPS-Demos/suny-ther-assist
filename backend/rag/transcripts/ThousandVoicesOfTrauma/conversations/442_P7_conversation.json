    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure exercise. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the hostage situation?",
    "Client: Okay... I was at the hospital for a routine check-up. Everything seemed normal at first. I was sitting in the waiting room when suddenly there was a commotion. A man burst in, waving a gun. He was shouting about how the hospital had killed his wife. My heart started racing immediately.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: He ordered everyone to get on the ground. I remember the cold tile against my cheek. The smell of disinfectant was overwhelming. I could hear people crying softly around me. I was terrified, thinking about my family, wondering if I'd see them again.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I can hear the man pacing, his shoes squeaking on the floor. My hands are shaking. I'm trying to stay still, but I can't stop trembling. I'm worried he'll notice me. I can feel sweat running down my back.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: Hours seemed to pass. My body ached from lying still for so long. I kept thinking about my children, my husband. Would I make it home to them? The uncertainty was unbearable. I wanted to cry but was too afraid to make a sound.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: At some point, I heard police sirens outside. The man became more agitated. He started yelling louder, threatening to shoot if anyone tried to enter. I remember closing my eyes tightly, praying it would end soon.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there was a loud bang. I thought it was a gunshot at first, but it was the police breaching the door. Everything happened so fast after that. There was shouting, people scrambling. I felt someone grab my arm and pull me up. It was a police officer, leading me out.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I... I feel shaky. My heart is racing, just like it did that day. I can still smell that hospital disinfectant. It's making me nauseous.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) It's hard to talk about this. I've tried so hard to forget it, but it's always there, lurking in the back of my mind. Every time I have to go to a hospital now, I feel panic rising in my chest.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for facing this. Continue.",
    "Client: After we were led out, I remember standing in the parking lot. The sun was so bright it hurt my eyes. I was disoriented, unsure of what to do next. A paramedic came to check on me, but I couldn't stop shaking. I kept looking around, afraid the gunman would appear again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How did you feel then?",
    "Client: I felt... lost. Vulnerable. Like the world wasn't safe anymore. I wanted to call my husband, but my hands were shaking too much to use my phone. A kind nurse helped me make the call. When I heard my husband's voice, I broke down crying. I couldn't even speak.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel emotional. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The days after were a blur. I couldn't sleep. Every little noise made me jump. I kept replaying those moments in my head, wondering what I could have done differently. Should I have tried to escape? Should I have spoken to the gunman? It was torture.",
    "Therapist: There's no right or wrong in that situation. You survived.",
    "Client: I know, but it's hard not to second-guess everything. The anxiety has been overwhelming since then. I've had nightmares, panic attacks. Sometimes, I feel like I'm right back in that waiting room, helpless and terrified.",
    "Therapist: You're not helpless now. You're working through it.",
    "Client: You're right. It's just... it's changed me. I used to be so carefree, and now I'm always on edge. I hate that this experience has so much power over me. I want to feel normal again, but I don't know if that's possible.",
    "Therapist: It is possible. You're taking important steps.",
    "Client: I hope so. It's exhausting living like this, always afraid. But being here, talking about it... it's hard, but I think it's helping. At least I don't feel so alone with it anymore.",
    "Therapist: You're not alone. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I need a break now. This has been intense.",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've done excellent work today."
