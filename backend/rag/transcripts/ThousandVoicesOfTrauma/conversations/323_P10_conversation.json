    "Therapist: Welcome, Susan. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is terrified. My hands are already shaking a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to support you. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, probably a 6 out of 10. My stomach's in knots.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. When you're ready, close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Alright... I'm in our old house. It's evening, and I can hear the TV in the background. I'm in the kitchen, trying to get dinner ready. My hands are shaking as I chop vegetables. I keep glancing at the clock, knowing he'll be home soon.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you see, hear, smell?",
    "Client: The smell of onions... it's sharp. I can hear the knife hitting the cutting board. Thud, thud, thud. My heart's racing already. I... I hear his car pull up outside.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: The front door slams. I flinch, nearly cutting my finger. He's... he's stomping towards the kitchen. I can smell the alcohol on him before I see him. God, my chest feels so tight right now.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. (Voice shaking) He's in the doorway, swaying slightly. His face is red, and I can see the anger in his eyes. I'm frozen, still holding the knife.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens?",
    "Client: He starts yelling... something about dinner not being ready. I try to explain, but he cuts me off. He's getting closer, and I can't move. My whole body's trembling.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here with me, safe in the present.",
    "Client: (Breathing heavily) He... he knocks the cutting board off the counter. Vegetables scatter everywhere. I jump back, but he grabs my arm. It hurts so much. I can feel his fingers digging into my skin.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. (Sobbing) I can't... I can't do this.",
    "Therapist: You can. You're strong. Let's ground ourselves. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: (Deep breaths) Okay... okay. I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: He's... he's shouting in my face. I can smell the beer on his breath. I'm trying to pull away, but his grip is too tight. I'm begging him to let go, but it's like he can't even hear me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Terrified. Helpless. I... I want to fight back, but I'm too scared. My arm is throbbing where he's holding me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: He suddenly lets go and stumbles back. For a second, I think it's over. But then... then he picks up the knife from the counter. My blood runs cold. I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: (Shaky breath) He's waving the knife around, screaming about how useless I am. I'm backed up against the wall, trying to make myself as small as possible. I can't stop staring at the knife.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I think he might actually kill me this time. I'm looking for a way out, but he's blocking the door. I feel so trapped, so helpless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still a 9. My heart's pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. Feel your feet on the ground.",
    "Client: (Deep breaths) Okay... I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: He... he lunges forward with the knife. I scream and duck. The blade hits the wall where my head was. I can hear the sound of it hitting the plaster. I'm on the floor now, curled up, waiting for the next blow.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you feel?",
    "Client: Pure terror. My whole body's shaking. I can hear him breathing heavily above me. I'm... I'm waiting for the pain, for the knife to come down.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: There's... there's a loud crash. I risk looking up. He's... he's fallen. The knife is on the floor, and he's struggling to get up. He's so drunk he can barely stand.",
    "Therapist: What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I grab the knife. My hands are shaking so badly I can barely hold it. I'm pointing it at him, telling him to stay away. My voice sounds strange, like it's not even me speaking.",
    "Therapist: How does that feel?",
    "Client: Empowering... but also terrifying. I've never stood up to him like this before. He looks... he looks shocked.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 7. I'm still scared, but I feel... stronger.",
    "Therapist: Good. Take a deep breath. What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he backs away. Stumbles out of the kitchen. I can hear him fumbling with the front door. Then... then he's gone. The house is suddenly so quiet.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. How do you feel?",
    "Client: Relieved... but also numb. I'm still holding the knife, and I can't seem to let go. My legs give out, and I slide down the wall to the floor.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: That... that I can't do this anymore. That I need to get out. I'm... I'm crying, but it feels different. Like something's broken open inside me.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 5. I feel drained, but... but also like a weight has lifted.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. Let's start to bring you back to the present.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Okay... I'm opening my eyes now. The room looks so bright.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling?",
    "Client: Exhausted... but also... I don't know. Lighter, maybe? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after processing trauma. You've shown incredible strength today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I didn't think I could do it, but... I did.",
    "Therapist: Yes, you did. You should be proud of yourself. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay. (Deep breath) I'm feeling my feet on the floor... my hands on the armrests. The room is coming into focus more.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 3. I feel drained, but... calm.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. How do you feel about what we accomplished today?",
    "Client: It was hard... really hard. But I feel like I've faced something I've been running from for years. It's... it's empowering, in a way.",
    "Therapist: That's a great insight. Remember, healing is a process. We'll continue to work through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I'm starting to believe that I can get through this.",
    "Therapist: You absolutely can. You've already shown tremendous courage. Let's end here for today and discuss how you're feeling.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm... I'm ready."
