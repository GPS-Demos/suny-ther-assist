    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's begin when you're comfortable.",
    "Client: Okay, I'm ready. I'm sitting in my dorm room, scrolling through my phone. It's late at night, and I can't sleep. I open my social media app, and there it is - another hateful comment. My heart starts racing, and I feel sick to my stomach. The words blur on the screen, but I can't look away. It's from someone I thought was my friend. They're calling me names, saying I don't belong here, that I should go back to where I came from. I want to cry, but I feel frozen.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 6 out of 10. My hands are shaking a bit.",
    "Therapist: I see. Continue, please.",
    "Client: I keep reading the comments. More people are joining in now. They're sharing embarrassing photos of me, twisting my words, making fun of my accent. I feel so alone and exposed. My chest feels tight, and I'm having trouble breathing. I want to defend myself, but I'm afraid it'll make things worse. I remember the physical abuse I endured before, and this feels just as painful, even though no one is touching me.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to an 8. I feel like I'm right back in that moment.",
    "Therapist: That's tough. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I scroll through my contacts, looking for someone to talk to, but I feel too ashamed to reach out. What if they think I'm overreacting? What if they side with the bullies? I curl up in my bed, hugging my knees to my chest. The room feels so dark and cold. I can hear my roommate snoring in the next bed, completely unaware of what I'm going through. I feel so isolated, like I'm screaming but no one can hear me.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9 now. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) I'm trying. The messages keep coming, ping after ping. Each one feels like a punch to the gut. I start to wonder if maybe they're right. Maybe I don't belong here. Maybe I should just give up and go home. I feel so worthless and small. The walls feel like they're closing in on me. I can't stop shaking, and tears are streaming down my face. I want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: Current SUDS?",
    "Client: Still a 9. My heart is pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I don't know what to do. I feel paralyzed. Part of me wants to lash out, to hurt them back, but I know that's not right. Another part wants to delete all my accounts and hide forever. I feel so angry and hurt and scared all at once. The room starts to spin, and I feel like I might throw up. I can't believe people I trusted could be so cruel. It makes me question everything and everyone.",

    "Therapist: That's natural. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved? Talking about it is hard, but it also feels good to get it out. I've never really told anyone all the details before.",
    "Therapist: That's common. Shall we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. Thank you for listening.",
    "Therapist: You did well. We'll process this next time."
