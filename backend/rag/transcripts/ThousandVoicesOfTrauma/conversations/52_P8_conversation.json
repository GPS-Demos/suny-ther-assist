    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mr. Patel?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. It's as if I'm right back there in that moment, you know? My hands are trembling a bit, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's like I can still hear the shouting, the sound of fists hitting flesh. I keep seeing flashes of faces, angry and contorted. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... shame, I think. I feel ashamed that I let myself be manipulated for so long. I was 62 when I finally left the cult, for heaven's sake. I should have known better. I keep thinking about all the years I lost, all the relationships I damaged. My ex-wife, my children... I missed so much because I believed their lies.",
    "Therapist: How does that shame feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a heavy weight in my stomach. Almost nauseous. And there's this voice in my head that keeps saying, \"You fool, you gullible old fool.\" I feel small, you know? Like I want to disappear. But at the same time, there's this anger bubbling up. I'm angry at them for taking advantage of me, angry at myself for falling for it. It's all mixed up together.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about that anger?",
    "Client: It's... it's hot. Like a fire in my chest. My jaw is clenched, and I want to... I don't know, hit something? But I've never been a violent man. That's part of why the physical abuse was so shocking. I never thought I'd be in a situation like that. The anger makes me feel stronger, though. Less helpless than the fear and shame.",
    "Therapist: How does this compare to how you felt during the actual events?",
    "Client: Back then, I was... numb, I suppose. In shock. I couldn't believe it was happening. There was fear, yes, but mostly confusion. I kept thinking, \"This can't be real. These people are my friends, my family.\" Now, reliving it, the emotions are so much more intense. It's like I'm finally feeling everything I should have felt then.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you make that connection?",
    "Client: I... I feel sad. Profoundly sad. For that version of me who was so lost and confused. I want to reach back in time and tell him it's not his fault, that he needs to get out. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a bit proud? That I did eventually leave, that I'm here now, facing it. It's hard, but I'm doing it. That's something, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: Indeed it is. How do you feel about your progress in therapy?",
    "Client: It's... it's challenging. Some days I leave here feeling wrung out, like an old dishrag. But I also feel like I'm finally starting to understand myself better. I'm remembering things I'd pushed down for years. It hurts, but it's also... freeing, in a way. Like I'm finally being honest with myself. And I'm learning to be kinder to myself too, I think. It's a process, but I feel like I'm moving forward.",
    "Therapist: What aspects of your recovery journey stand out to you right now?",
    "Client: Well, I've been reconnecting with my daughter. That's been... emotional, but good. She's been so patient with me. And I've joined a support group for former cult members. It helps to know I'm not alone, that others understand. I'm also learning to trust my own judgment again. That's been hard after years of being told what to think and feel. But I'm getting there, slowly but surely.",
    "Therapist: How does that progress make you feel?",
    "Client: Grateful, I suppose. And hopeful. There's still a long way to go, but for the first time in years, I feel like I have a future. Like I'm not just existing, but living. It's scary sometimes, having to make my own decisions again. But it's also exhilarating. I'm rediscovering parts of myself I thought were long gone. It's like... like I'm finally coming home to myself, if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful image. What else comes to mind as we wrap up?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... tired, but in a good way. Like I've done something important. And I'm realizing that even though remembering is painful, it's also healing. Each time we do this, it gets a little easier. The memories are still there, but they don't have the same power over me. I'm starting to see them as just that - memories. Not my present, not my future. Just a part of my past that I'm learning to accept and move on from.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing, Mr. Patel. We'll end here for today.",
    "Client: Thank you, doctor. It's not easy, but I'm glad I'm doing this. See you next week."
