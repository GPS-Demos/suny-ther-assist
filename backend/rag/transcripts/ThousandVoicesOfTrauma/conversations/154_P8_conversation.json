    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling quite shaken, to be honest. It's like I was right back there, you know? I can still feel my heart racing a bit. The memory of that day when my ex-husband told me he was leaving... it's so vivid. I can see his face, hear his voice. It's bringing up a lot of emotions I thought I'd dealt with.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are you noticing?",
    "Client: Anger, definitely. But also this deep sadness and... shame, I think. I remember feeling so small in that moment, like I wasn't good enough. It's reminding me of all those times I was bullied in school, that same feeling of worthlessness. And there's this physical ache in my chest, like my heart is actually breaking all over again.",
    "Therapist: How does that ache feel in your body right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's heavy. Like there's this weight pressing down on me. My shoulders feel tense, and there's this knot in my stomach. I'm realizing now that I've been carrying this tension for years, probably since the divorce. It's exhausting, really. And my chronic pain seems to be flaring up too, especially in my lower back. It's like my body is remembering the stress of that time.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep hearing his words, \"I don't love you anymore.\" And then my mind jumps to all the things I could have done differently. Maybe if I'd been more attentive, or if I'd lost that extra weight... God, I sound just like I did when I was a kid being bullied. Always blaming myself. But there's also this small voice saying, \"It wasn't your fault.\" It's hard to believe that voice, though.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to hear that small voice?",
    "Client: It's... comforting, in a way. But also scary. If it wasn't my fault, then I have to accept that sometimes bad things just happen, and I can't control everything. That's a frightening thought. But it's also... freeing? I'm not sure. It's confusing. Part of me wants to hold onto the blame because it feels safer somehow.",
    "Therapist: What does safer mean to you in this context?",
    "Client: I guess... if it was my fault, then I can prevent it from happening again. But if it wasn't, then I'm vulnerable. And that terrifies me. It's like being back in school, never knowing when the next attack would come. But with my ex-husband, I thought I was safe. I trusted him. And now I'm struggling to trust anyone fully.",
    "Therapist: How does this lack of trust affect you now?",
    "Client: It's... it's isolating. Even though I'm remarried, I find myself holding back, always waiting for the other shoe to drop. I love my current husband, but there's this constant fear. And it affects my work too. I second-guess myself, worry that I'm not good enough. It's exhausting, always being on guard like this.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to feel safe. To know that it's okay to let my guard down sometimes. But I don't know how to do that. It feels like such a risk. And yet, holding onto all this pain and fear is hurting me too. I'm torn between wanting to protect myself and wanting to be free from all this.",
    "Therapist: How might you take a small step towards feeling safer?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I could try talking to my husband about these feelings? Not all at once, but bit by bit. And perhaps I could try some relaxation techniques for my chronic pain. It's all connected, isn't it? The emotional pain, the physical pain, the memories... I've been trying to compartmentalize everything, but maybe I need to start seeing it as a whole.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful approach. How do you feel about that idea?",
    "Client: It's scary, but also... hopeful? Like maybe there's a way forward that I haven't seen before. I've been so focused on protecting myself that I haven't really been living fully. And I'm tired of that. I want to feel whole again, to trust again. It won't be easy, but I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: What's giving you that sense of readiness?",
    "Client: I think... it's partly this session. Facing that memory was incredibly hard, but I survived it. And I'm starting to see how much energy I've been using to avoid these feelings. Maybe if I face them, I'll actually have more strength to enjoy my life. Plus, I'm proud of myself for getting through this exposure. It makes me feel... stronger, somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How can you build on this strength?",
    "Client: I think I need to keep challenging myself. Maybe I could start by sharing one small fear with my husband each week. And I want to explore more about how my past bullying experiences connect to my reactions now. It's like I'm seeing this thread running through my life, and I want to understand it better. And maybe... maybe I could join a support group? I've always been hesitant, but hearing others' stories might help me feel less alone.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like meaningful steps. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... drained, but in a good way? Like after a really intense workout. There's pain, but also this sense of accomplishment. And I feel more... present. Like I've been living in the past for so long, and now I'm starting to come back to the present. It's overwhelming, but also exciting. I think I'm ready to start really living again, not just surviving.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful shift. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think I'd like to delve more into how my past experiences with bullying are influencing my current relationships. And maybe we could explore some strategies for managing my chronic pain alongside the emotional work we're doing. I'm starting to see how interconnected everything is, and I want to address it all holistically.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. This was incredibly difficult, but I feel like I've taken a big step today. I'm nervous about what's ahead, but for the first time in a long time, I'm also feeling hopeful. It's like I can see a path forward now, even if it's still a bit foggy. I'm grateful for your guidance and support through this process.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Take care of yourself this week."
