    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I think so... I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I want to try.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay. So, I'm supposed to imagine the event, right? It's... it's hard to go back there.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. You're in control.",
    "Client: Alright. I'm... I'm back at the base. It's hot, and I can feel the sun beating down on me. I'm on patrol with my unit. We're walking through a small village...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud explosion. I feel the ground shake beneath my feet. People are screaming, and there's dust everywhere. I can't see clearly...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're safe here.",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I'm trying to locate my team members, but everything is chaotic. I hear gunfire... Oh God, it's getting louder.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Continue.",
    "Client: I take cover behind a crumbling wall. My hands are shaking as I ready my weapon. I see one of my teammates... he's down. There's so much blood...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel upset. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I want to help him, but I can't move. I'm frozen. The gunfire is getting closer. I can smell the smoke and... and something burning. I feel so helpless...",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. Keep going.",
    "Client: I hear someone shouting orders, but it's muffled. My ears are ringing from the explosion. I finally force myself to move towards my injured teammate. As I crawl, I see more bodies... civilians... oh God, there are children...",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. It's okay to feel.",
    "Client: I reach my teammate. His eyes are open, but he's not moving. I check for a pulse, but... but there isn't one. I feel sick. I want to scream, but no sound comes out.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: More explosions. The air is thick with smoke and dust. I can taste it. I hear someone calling my name, but I can't respond. I'm just staring at my teammate's face. I should have been faster. I should have...",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. Keep going.",
    "Client: I feel a hand on my shoulder. It's my sergeant. He's yelling at me to move, but I can't hear him clearly. He practically drags me away. We're running, and I can see more of our team. Some are injured, some are firing back...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. Continue.",
    "Client: We make it to a secure area. I'm shaking uncontrollably. Someone hands me water, but I can't drink. I just keep seeing those bodies... my teammate... the children. I feel like I failed them all.",

    "Client: The rest is a blur. I remember being evacuated, the sound of helicopters. But mostly, I just remember feeling numb. Like a part of me died there too.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. But also, maybe a little lighter? Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a common response.",
    "Client: I didn't think I could talk about it like that. It was hard, but... I did it.",
    "Therapist: Yes, you did. You showed great courage.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think... I think I might be ready to end for today.",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll process this more next time."
