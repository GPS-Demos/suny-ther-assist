    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Can you describe the scene when you witnessed the violence?",
    "Client: Okay... I was walking home from the library late one night. It was dark, and the street was mostly empty. I heard shouting coming from an alley up ahead. As I got closer, I saw two men fighting. One of them had a knife...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you saw.",
    "Client: The man with the knife was yelling at the other guy, demanding money. The victim was backing away, hands up, begging him not to hurt him. I froze, not knowing what to do. My heart was racing, and I felt like I couldn't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The attacker lunged forward, and I saw blood. The victim screamed and fell to the ground. I wanted to run, but my legs wouldn't move. I felt so helpless, like I should have done something, but I was paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. Keep going.",
    "Client: The attacker noticed me then. He looked right at me, and I thought I was next. I finally managed to turn and run. I could hear footsteps behind me, but I didn't look back. I just ran as fast as I could until I reached my apartment.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. What happened next?",
    "Client: I slammed the door shut and locked it. I was shaking so badly I could barely breathe. I kept seeing the victim's face, hearing his screams. I felt guilty for not helping, for running away. I couldn't sleep that night, or for many nights after.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those feelings. You're doing great.",
    "Client: For weeks after, I couldn't walk down that street. I'd take long detours to avoid it. Every time I saw someone in an alley or heard raised voices, I'd panic. I started having nightmares about the attack, but in my dreams, I was the one being stabbed.",
    "Therapist: You're brave for sharing this. How do you feel now, recalling it?",
    "Client: It's... it's still hard. My heart is racing, and I feel that same fear creeping back. But it's different now, like I'm watching it from a distance. I know I'm safe here, but part of me is still there in that moment, frozen and terrified.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're doing well processing these emotions.",
    "Client: I think what haunts me most is the guilt. I keep wondering if I could have prevented it, if I should have called for help or tried to intervene. But then I remember how scared I was, how dangerous it was, and I know I probably would have been hurt too.",
    "Therapist: It's important to remember you're not responsible for the attacker's actions.",
    "Client: I know that logically, but emotionally it's hard to accept. I've always thought of myself as someone who would help others in need, but when it actually happened, I froze. It's made me question who I am as a person.",
    "Therapist: Self-reflection is valuable. You're making progress.",
    "Client: Sometimes I still have flashbacks, especially when I'm stressed or tired. I'll suddenly be back there, seeing the glint of the knife, hearing the victim's pleas. It's like my brain can't let it go, can't stop replaying it over and over.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response to trauma. You're handling it well.",
    "Client: I've tried to tell myself that it's over, that I'm safe now, but my body doesn't seem to believe it. I'm always on edge, always watching for potential threats. It's exhausting, living like this. I want to move past it, but I don't know how.",
    "Therapist: You're taking important steps right now. Keep going.",
    "Client: I guess... I'm afraid of it happening again. Not just witnessing violence, but being helpless in any situation. It's like that night stripped away my sense of security, my belief that the world is generally safe. How do I get that back?",
    "Therapist: That's a great question to explore. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also a bit lighter. Talking about it is hard, but it's also a relief to get it out. I'm realizing that maybe I've been carrying this burden alone for too long. It's still painful, but maybe a little less overwhelming than before.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. We'll end here.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's tough, but I think this is helping. I appreciate your guidance and support through this process. I'm hopeful that with time, I'll be able to process this trauma and move forward.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great courage. We'll continue next session."
