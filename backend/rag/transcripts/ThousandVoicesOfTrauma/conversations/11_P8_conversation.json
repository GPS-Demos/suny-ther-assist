    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I'm right back there, you know? I can still hear the sound of glass breaking downstairs. It's so vivid.",
    "Therapist: What's the most prominent emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... anger? I'm angry that this happened to me, that someone violated my safe space. I keep thinking about how vulnerable I felt in that moment, frozen at the top of the stairs, listening to them rummaging through my things.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a heat in my chest. My jaw is clenched, and my fists are balled up. I want to punch something, but I also want to curl up and hide. It's confusing.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why me?\" and \"What if they come back?\" It's irrational, I know, but I can't shake this feeling that I'm still not safe. Even though it happened years ago, it's like it could happen again at any moment.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts impact your daily life?",
    "Client: They... they make me hypervigilant. I'm always checking locks, looking over my shoulder. I struggle to relax in my own home. It's exhausting, really. Sometimes I think about moving, but then I feel angry that I should have to uproot my life because of what they did.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your breathing right now?",
    "Client: Oh, um... it's shallow. Quick. I didn't even realize until you asked. My chest feels tight, like I can't get a full breath. It's how I felt that night, like I couldn't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Try taking a deep breath. How does that feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's helpful. My shoulders just dropped a bit. I didn't realize how tense I was holding myself. The memory is still there, but it feels a little less immediate now.",
    "Therapist: What's different about how you're feeling now compared to when the event happened?",
    "Client: Well, now I know I survived it. Back then, I wasn't sure if I would. There's a part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe proud? That I got through it. But there's still so much fear and anger mixed in. It's like a tangled ball of emotions.",
    "Therapist: How do you see this experience fitting into your broader life story?",
    "Client: I... I've never really thought about it that way. I suppose it's part of why I'm so independent now. I've always been self-reliant, but after that... I really doubled down on taking care of myself. Maybe to a fault. It's hard for me to let people in, to trust. But I'm also stronger in some ways. I've faced one of my worst fears and I'm still here.",
    "Therapist: What does that strength mean to you?",
    "Client: It means... it means I'm a survivor, I guess. That I can handle more than I thought. But it also means I've lost something. My sense of safety, my ability to relax fully. It's like I gained resilience but lost peace. I'm not sure how to reconcile that.",
    "Therapist: How might you use that resilience moving forward?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe I could use it to start taking back some of what I've lost? Like, actively working on feeling safe again, bit by bit. Or using my experience to help others who've been through similar things. I've always kept this to myself, but maybe sharing could be healing.",
    "Therapist: What would be a small step in that direction?",
    "Client: Hmm... maybe I could join a support group? Or volunteer at a crisis center? The thought makes me nervous, but also... I don't know, hopeful? Like maybe something good could come from this awful experience.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also lighter somehow. Like I've set down a heavy bag I've been carrying. The memory is still there, but it feels less overwhelming. And I feel a glimmer of something... maybe hope? That things could get better. It's small, but it's there.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant shift. What do you want to remember from today's session?",
    "Client: I want to remember that I'm strong, that I survived, and that there might be a way forward. That maybe I don't have to be controlled by this fear forever. And that breathing helps. I forgot how much just taking a deep breath can center me.",
    "Therapist: Those are powerful takeaways. How would you like to close our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to take a moment to just breathe. To sit with this feeling of... not exactly peace, but maybe potential? And to remind myself that I'm safe right now, in this moment. That feels important.",
    "Therapist: Let's do that. Take all the time you need."
