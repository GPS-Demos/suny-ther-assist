    "Therapist: Welcome, Priya. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is terrified. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see the cold, gray walls of the detention center. The fluorescent lights are so harsh, making everything look washed out and sterile. I'm sitting on a hard plastic chair, my hands trembling in my lap.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's happening around you?",
    "Client: There's a constant buzz of activity. Guards walking back and forth, their keys jangling. Other detainees are talking in hushed tones. I can hear someone crying softly in the distance. The air... it smells of disinfectant and fear.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. My heart is racing, and I can't stop shaking. I keep thinking about my family, wondering if they know where I am. Oh god, what if I never see them again?",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you?",
    "Client: It's... it's about an 80. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: A guard approaches me. He's tall, intimidating. He barks at me to follow him. I stand up, my legs feel like jelly. We walk down a long corridor, the sound of our footsteps echoing. I'm... I'm trying to stay calm, but I can feel panic rising in my chest.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: We stop at a small room. The guard opens the door and gestures for me to enter. It's an interrogation room, I realize. There's a table, two chairs, and a large mirror on one wall. I know they're watching me from behind it. I sit down, my hands clammy with sweat.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking at this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about my parents. How they always told me to be strong, to never show weakness. But right now, I feel so small, so helpless. I'm wondering if this is how they felt when they first came to this country, always looking over their shoulder, afraid of being sent back.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really difficult. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 90. I can feel my chest tightening.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here in the present. Can you tell me what you see in the room?",
    "Client: I see... I see my reflection in the mirror. I look pale, scared. My hair is a mess, and there are dark circles under my eyes. I haven't slept properly in days. The table in front of me is scratched and worn. I run my fingers over the surface, feeling every groove and dent.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: The door opens, and two men in suits walk in. One of them sits across from me, while the other stands in the corner. The sitting man opens a file and starts asking me questions. Where I'm from, how long I've been here, who I know. His voice is cold, detached. I try to answer, but my voice keeps cracking.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling as this is happening?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling so alone. So vulnerable. I keep thinking about my husband, my children. Are they worried? Do they know where I am? I want to cry, but I'm afraid to show any emotion. I feel like if I start, I won't be able to stop.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: The questions keep coming. They're relentless. I can feel myself getting more and more confused. I'm trying to remember dates, names, but everything is jumbled in my head. I'm so afraid of saying the wrong thing. What if they twist my words? What if they don't believe me?",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 95. I feel like I'm going to pass out.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here in the room with me. You're safe.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm trying. The interrogation seems to go on forever. My throat is dry, but they won't give me water. The man keeps repeating the same questions, as if trying to catch me in a lie. But I'm telling the truth. Why won't they believe me?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens after the interrogation?",
    "Client: They... they finally stop. The man closes his file and leaves without a word. I'm left sitting there, shaking. The guard comes back and leads me to a holding cell. It's small, with just a bench and a toilet. The door closes behind me with a loud clang, and I'm alone.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel in that cell?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel broken. Defeated. I sink onto the bench and finally let the tears come. I'm thinking about my children, wondering if I'll ever see them again. I'm angry at myself for putting my family in this situation. I'm scared of what's going to happen to me.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still at 95. I can feel my heart pounding in my chest.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe now. Can you tell me something you can see in this room with me?",
    "Client: I... I see the plant on your desk. The green leaves... they're so vibrant.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, can you continue with what happened in the cell?",
    "Client: I... I curl up on the bench, trying to make myself as small as possible. The cell is cold, and I'm shivering. I can hear other detainees in nearby cells, some crying, some arguing. I close my eyes and try to picture my home, my family. It feels so far away.",
    "Therapist: How long were you in that cell?",
    "Client: It felt like an eternity. Hours passed, maybe a day. I lost track of time. There were no windows, no clock. Just the harsh fluorescent lights that never turned off. I couldn't sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the faces of my children, wondering if they were okay.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling now, as you remember this?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... I'm feeling a deep sadness. A sense of injustice. I didn't do anything wrong. I was just trying to build a better life for my family. And now... now I might lose everything.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 85 now. I can feel my breathing getting a bit easier.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're doing really well. What happened next?",
    "Client: Eventually, a different guard came. He told me I was being released. I couldn't believe it at first. I thought it was some kind of trick. But then I was led out, given back my belongings. I remember stepping outside, feeling the sun on my face. It was... it was overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: How did you feel in that moment?",
    "Client: I felt... relief, but also fear. Relief that I was out, that I could see my family again. But fear that it could happen again at any moment. That I would never truly feel safe.",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to process. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling drained. Emotionally exhausted. But also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I survived something I didn't think I could.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after going through something traumatic. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about a 60. I feel like I can breathe again.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. You did really well today, Priya. How do you feel about the session?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel tired, but also a bit lighter. Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time. It was hard, but... I'm glad we did this.",
    "Therapist: I'm proud of you for facing this memory. We'll end here for today. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later.",
    "Client: Thank you. I will. I... I appreciate your help with this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
