    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Singh. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about the car accident, and just thinking about it makes my heart race a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I suppose we should. Where do you want me to start?",
    "Therapist: Start from the beginning of that day. What do you remember?",
    "Client: Okay... It was a Tuesday morning. I remember because I had an important meeting scheduled. I woke up early, around 6 AM. The sky was still dark, and there was a light drizzle. I... I can hear the soft patter of rain on the window.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happened next?",
    "Client: I got ready quickly. Shaved, put on my best suit. I remember the smell of my aftershave... it was strong, almost overpowering in the small bathroom. I... I had toast for breakfast. The toaster made that familiar 'ping' sound, and the kitchen filled with the aroma of slightly burnt bread.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: A bit tense. My shoulders feel tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you?",
    "Client: Maybe... 40?",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Right... So, I left the house around 7:30. The rain had picked up. I remember the windshield wipers squeaking as they moved back and forth. The roads were slick, reflecting the streetlights. I... I was driving carefully, both hands on the wheel. But then... Oh god...",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. What happened next?",
    "Client: A car... it came out of nowhere. Speeding through a red light. I saw a flash of red, heard the screech of tires. I... I tried to swerve, but it was too late. The impact... it was deafening. Metal crunching, glass shattering. I felt this... this intense pressure on my chest as the airbag deployed.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: My heart's racing. I... I can almost smell the burnt rubber and airbag powder.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 70 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here with me, safe.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. After the impact, everything went quiet for a moment. Then I heard people shouting, car horns blaring. I was... I was trapped in the car. The door was crushed. I could feel something warm trickling down my face... blood, I realized later. My leg... my right leg was pinned under the dashboard. The pain hadn't hit yet, but I couldn't move.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What were you thinking?",
    "Client: I... I was terrified. I thought, \"This is it. I'm going to die here.\" I could smell gasoline, and I was afraid the car might explode. I tried to call out for help, but my voice was weak. I remember looking at my watch... it was smashed, frozen at 7:52.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. It's... it's hard to breathe.",
    "Therapist: Let's take a moment. Focus on your breathing. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 80 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I could hear sirens in the distance. Getting closer. Someone was at my window, telling me to stay calm, that help was coming. But I couldn't focus on their words. All I could think about was the pain that was starting to set in. My leg... it felt like it was on fire. And my chest... every breath was agony.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What else do you remember?",
    "Client: The... the firefighters arrived. I could hear them working to cut me out of the car. The sound of metal being torn apart... it was so loud. I remember feeling rain on my face as they finally got the roof off. Someone was putting a neck brace on me, asking me questions. But I couldn't... I couldn't form the words to answer.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My hands are trembling.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember, you're here with me, safe in this room.",
    "Client: Right... right. I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still around 80.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: They... they finally got me out of the car. I remember the feeling of being lifted onto a stretcher. The sky above me was grey, rain falling on my face. I could hear people talking, but it all sounded muffled, like I was underwater. The pain... it was overwhelming. I think I passed out as they were loading me into the ambulance.",
    "Therapist: What's the next thing you remember?",
    "Client: Waking up in the hospital. The beeping of machines, the smell of disinfectant. My wife was there, holding my hand. She looked... she looked so worried. I tried to speak, but there was a tube in my throat. I panicked for a moment, feeling trapped again.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, remembering that?",
    "Client: Anxious. My throat feels tight, like that tube is still there.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Focus on your breathing. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 70 now.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're doing well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The next few days are a blur. Surgeries, pain medication, doctors coming and going. I remember feeling so helpless, so vulnerable. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that flash of red, heard the crunch of metal. I couldn't sleep without nightmares.",
    "Therapist: That must have been very difficult. How did you cope?",
    "Client: I... I tried to focus on my wife, on getting better for her. But it was hard. The physical pain was bad enough, but the fear... the constant replay of the accident in my mind... it was exhausting.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great strength by facing these memories. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired. Drained. But... also a bit relieved, I think. Like I'm finally letting some of this out.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to about 60 now.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. Let's continue. What happened as you started to recover?",
    "Client: The physical recovery was slow. Painful. I had to learn to walk again, to do simple things like dress myself. But the mental recovery... that was harder. I was afraid to get in a car, even as a passenger. Loud noises would make me jump. I felt... I felt like I wasn't myself anymore.",
    "Therapist: How did that affect your daily life?",
    "Client: It changed everything. I couldn't work. I withdrew from friends. I... I was irritable with my wife, even though she was trying so hard to help. I felt guilty for being a burden, angry at the world for what happened to me. It was like I was trapped in that car all over again, but this time in my own mind.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly challenging. How are you feeling now, talking about this?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. But also... I don't know, cathartic maybe? Like I'm finally acknowledging how much this affected me.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage. Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's around 50 now.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're doing well. Let's continue. How did you start to move forward?",
    "Client: It was... it was a slow process. I started seeing a therapist, like you. Talking about it, bit by bit. I joined a support group for accident survivors. Hearing others' stories... it helped me feel less alone. I started doing physio, pushing myself to get stronger physically. And slowly, very slowly, I started to feel more like myself again.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. What about getting back in a car?",
    "Client: That... that was one of the hardest parts. My wife, she was so patient. We started with just sitting in a parked car in our driveway. I'd have panic attacks at first, but we kept at it. Gradually, we progressed to short drives around the block. Each time, it got a little easier. But even now, I still get anxious sometimes, especially in heavy traffic or when it's raining.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible resilience. How do you feel about your progress?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm proud, I suppose. It's been a long, hard journey. There are still bad days, times when the memories hit me hard. But I'm here. I'm talking about it. That's something I couldn't have done a year ago.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You've come a long way. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... good. Like I've lifted a weight off my chest.",
    "Therapist: That's great to hear. Your final SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to about 30 now.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. You've done remarkably well today. How do you feel about ending our session here?",
    "Client: I think... I think that's good. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Remember, you have the strength to face these memories. We'll continue working on this in our next session."
