    "Therapist: Mr. Johnson, today we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: Oh, I'm not sure, doctor. To be honest, I'm a bit nervous. I've been trying not to think about my illness for so long. The idea of revisiting it... well, it's unsettling. Can you tell me more about what we'll be doing?",
    "Therapist: Of course. It's natural to feel nervous. Can you share what worries you most?",
    "Client: I suppose I'm afraid of feeling overwhelmed. When I was in the hospital, fighting for my life, it was... it was terrifying. The thought of reliving those moments makes my heart race. I've worked so hard to put it behind me. Why do we need to bring it all back up?",
    "Therapist: I understand your concern. How do you think avoiding these memories has affected you?",
    "Client: Well, I... I guess I haven't really dealt with it. I have nightmares sometimes, and I get anxious when I see anything related to hospitals on TV. I've been isolating myself more, too. My daughter says I'm not the same since the illness. But isn't it better to just move on?",
    "Therapist: Moving on is the goal, but facing memories can help. How does that sound to you?",
    "Client: I see what you're saying. It's just... it's scary, you know? I remember the beeping machines, the smell of disinfectant, the feeling of not being able to breathe properly. It's all so vivid. But if you think this will help, I trust you. Can you tell me more about what we'll actually be doing?",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit the memory gradually, with my support throughout. What questions do you have?",
    "Client: Well, how long will we spend on this? And what if I get too upset? I'm not as young as I used to be, and my heart isn't what it once was. I don't want to risk my health again. Also, will I have to close my eyes? I'm not sure I can do that without feeling panicked.",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace and can stop anytime. Your safety is my priority. Shall we discuss coping strategies?",
    "Client: Yes, that would be helpful. I used to do deep breathing exercises when I was recovering, but I haven't practiced in a while. Maybe we could go over those again? And... I don't know if this is silly, but could I hold something? Like a stress ball or something? I think having something to focus on might help ground me.",
    "Therapist: Excellent suggestions. We'll practice breathing and use grounding objects. Any other concerns?",
    "Client: I think that covers most of it. I'm still nervous, but I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. You know, when I was younger, I never thought I'd be in a situation like this. Life has a way of surprising you, doesn't it? But I suppose that's why we're here \u2013 to deal with those surprises. I'm ready to give this a try if you think it will help.",
    "Therapist: Your willingness is commendable. Shall we start with a brief relaxation exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. It might help calm my nerves a bit. You know, I used to think therapy was just for young people with their whole lives ahead of them. But here I am, learning new things at my age. It's funny how life works out sometimes. I'm glad I decided to give this a chance. Okay, I'm ready whenever you are, doctor.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad you're open to this. Let's begin with some deep breaths..."
