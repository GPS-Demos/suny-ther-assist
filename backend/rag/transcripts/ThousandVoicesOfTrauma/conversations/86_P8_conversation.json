    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mrs. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like I'm back there again, you know? The sounds of the gunfire, the screams... I can still hear them echoing in my head. My heart's racing, and my hands feel clammy. It's hard to shake off the fear, even though I know I'm safe here.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Guilt. Overwhelming guilt. I keep thinking about the others who didn't make it out. Why did I survive when so many didn't? I see their faces, Dr. Roberts. The children, the elderly... They haunt me. And then there's this anger bubbling up inside me. Why did this have to happen to us? We were just ordinary people living our lives.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt and anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's like a heavy weight on my chest, making it hard to breathe. My stomach's in knots, and there's this tension in my shoulders that won't go away. Sometimes, I feel like I'm going to be sick. It's exhausting, carrying all this around.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind as you sit with these feelings?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"I should have done more.\" Maybe if I'd gone back, I could have saved someone else. But then I remember the chaos, the panic... I was so focused on getting my grandchildren to safety. Was that selfish of me? And then I think about my life now, here in safety, and I feel guilty for even having moments of happiness or peace. It's like I don't deserve them.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts impact your daily life?",
    "Client: They're... they're always there, lurking in the background. Some days are better than others, but it's hard to fully enjoy anything. I find myself withdrawing from my family sometimes, even though they're so supportive. It's like I'm stuck between two worlds - the one I left behind and this new life I'm trying to build. I want to move forward, but part of me feels like that would be betraying those we lost.",
    "Therapist: What do you think might help you process these feelings?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Talking about it helps, even though it's painful. Sometimes I think about reaching out to other survivors, but I'm afraid of bringing up their trauma. Maybe... maybe finding a way to honor those we lost? I don't know. It's all so overwhelming sometimes.",
    "Therapist: How does sharing these experiences make you feel right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of emotions. There's relief, like I'm finally letting out something I've been holding in for so long. But there's also fear. Talking about it makes it real again, you know? And yet, there's a small part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe hopeful? Like maybe by facing this, I can start to heal. It's scary, but I think I need to keep talking about it.",
    "Therapist: What strengths have you discovered in yourself through this journey?",
    "Client: Strengths? I... I've never really thought about it that way. I suppose I've found I'm more resilient than I ever thought I could be. There are days when I didn't think I could go on, but I did. For my family, for my grandchildren. And I've learned to appreciate the small moments of peace and joy when they come. It's not easy, but I'm still here, still trying. That has to count for something, right?",
    "Therapist: How do you see your future as you continue to work through this?",
    "Client: That's... that's a difficult question. Some days, I can see a future where the pain isn't so sharp, where I can remember without feeling like I'm reliving it all over again. I hope I can find a way to honor those we lost while still living my life. Maybe I can use my experiences to help others somehow. It's hard to imagine, but I want to believe that there's a purpose to all of this, that something good can come from so much suffering.",
    "Therapist: What small step might you take this week towards that vision?",
    "Client: I think... I think I might try to write down some of my memories. The good ones, from before everything happened. It's painful, but I don't want to forget the beauty of my home, of our lives before. And maybe... maybe I could share some of those stories with my grandchildren. They deserve to know about their heritage, about the strength and resilience of our people. It's scary, but I think it might be healing, too.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling as we wrap up today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired, but in a good way, I think. Like I've done something important, even though it was hard. There's still a heaviness in my chest, but it feels a little lighter. And I'm nervous about writing those memories down, but also a bit excited. It's strange to feel hope after so long. Thank you, Dr. Roberts, for listening, for helping me face this. I know we have a long way to go, but I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can do this.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for your courage today, Mrs. Johnson. We'll continue next week."
