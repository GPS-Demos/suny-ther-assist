    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's always hard to go back to that moment, you know? Reliving the screeching tires, the crash, the screams... it's like I'm right there again. My heart's still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you this time?",
    "Client: The smell. I hadn't remembered the smell before. The burning rubber, the gasoline... it was so vivid this time. And the way the glass shattered... I could almost feel it on my skin again. It's strange how these details come back, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: Indeed. How did it feel to experience those sensations again?",
    "Client: It was... intense. Scary, but also... I don't know, maybe a little empowering? Like, I survived that. I'm here, talking about it. That's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What do you make of that feeling?",
    "Client: I guess... it's like I'm facing my fears head-on. Before, I'd do anything to avoid thinking about the accident. Now, it's still terrifying, but I'm not running away. I'm confronting it. That has to mean something, doesn't it?",
    "Therapist: It certainly does. How does this relate to your day-to-day life?",
    "Client: Well, I've noticed I'm less jumpy when I hear sudden noises now. And yesterday, I actually drove past the intersection where it happened. I was anxious, but I did it. That's progress, right?",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. How do you feel about these changes?",
    "Client: It's... a mix of emotions, really. I'm proud of myself, but there's also this guilt. Like, why did I survive when others didn't? And sometimes I worry that if I get better, I'm somehow forgetting what happened. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Many survivors experience similar feelings. How do you cope with these thoughts?",
    "Client: I try to remind myself that healing doesn't mean forgetting. It's honoring those who didn't make it by living my life fully. But it's hard, you know? Some days are better than others.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful perspective. What helps on the difficult days?",
    "Client: Talking to my husband helps. And the breathing exercises we've practiced. Oh, and I've started journaling. It helps me process things when my mind gets too noisy.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent strategies. How else has this process affected you?",
    "Client: I think I'm more patient with myself now. Before, I'd get so frustrated with my symptoms. Now, I understand it's a process. And I'm sleeping better too. The nightmares are less frequent.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful progress. What's your biggest takeaway from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... it's that I'm stronger than I thought. The memory is still painful, but I can face it now. And each time, it gets a little easier. I'm not letting the trauma control me anymore. I'm taking my life back, bit by bit.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: I'm... cautiously optimistic. It's not easy, but I can see the changes in myself. I want to keep going. I want my life back, you know? And for the first time in a long while, I feel like that's actually possible.",
    "Therapist: That's an inspiring attitude. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: I don't think so. I'm feeling drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've done something important. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. How will you take care of yourself for the rest of the day?",
    "Client: I think I'll take a long bath when I get home. Maybe call my sister for a chat. And definitely use those grounding techniques we've practiced if I start feeling overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: Excellent plan. I'm proud of your progress, Mrs. Johnson.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I'm starting to feel proud of myself too. It's been a long road, but I think I'm finally on the right path."
