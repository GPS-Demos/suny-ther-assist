    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the scene?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in my childhood home. I'm about 8 years old. My parents are arguing in the kitchen. I can hear their voices getting louder.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: I'm hiding behind the couch in the living room. The shouting is getting worse. I hear something crash - maybe a plate? My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe now.",
    "Client: My father's voice is so angry. I've never heard him like this before. I'm shaking. I want to cover my ears, but I can't move.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Keep going.",
    "Client: Suddenly, I hear my mother cry out. There's a loud thud. I peek around the couch and... and I see her on the floor. My father is standing over her, his fist still clenched.",
    "Therapist: I know this is difficult. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I... I can't breathe. I want to help her, but I'm frozen. My father turns and sees me. His eyes... they're so cold. I've never been more terrified in my life.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel scared. You're safe here now.",
    "Client: He starts walking towards me. I try to run, but my legs won't move. I'm crying now, begging him to stop. But he just keeps coming closer.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: I close my eyes, waiting for him to hit me too. But instead, I feel my mother's arms around me. She's crying, telling me it's okay. But I can see the bruise forming on her face.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... overwhelmed. Angry. Scared. Like that little boy all over again. But also... relieved? Like I'm finally letting this out after all these years.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are all valid. You're processing this well.",
    "Client: I remember the aftermath. The silence in the house for days. The way my mother avoided eye contact. The pit in my stomach every time my father came home from work.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job describing this. Continue.",
    "Client: It's like everything changed after that day. I became hyper-vigilant, always watching for signs of anger. I stopped bringing friends over. I felt like I was carrying this huge secret.",
    "Therapist: That must have been a heavy burden. You're strong for sharing this.",
    "Client: It was. I think that's when I started to withdraw from people. I never knew who I could trust. Even now, I struggle with letting people get close to me.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel drained, but also... lighter? Like I've finally put down a weight I've been carrying for decades. It's painful, but there's also a sense of relief.",

    "Therapist: That's an important insight. You've made great progress today.",
    "Client: I think I understand now why I've always had trouble with confrontation. Why I freeze up when people raise their voices. It all traces back to this moment.",
    "Therapist: That's a valuable connection you've made. How do you feel about ending our session here?",
    "Client: I think that would be good. This has been intense, but I'm glad we did it. I feel like I understand myself a little better now.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. We'll process this more in our next session."
