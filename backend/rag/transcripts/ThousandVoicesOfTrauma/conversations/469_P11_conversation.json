    "Therapist: How are you feeling after today's imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving that car accident... it's like I was right back there, you know? The screeching tires, the smell of burning rubber, the impact... (pauses, takes a deep breath) It's a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. In that moment, I couldn't do anything to stop it. It's... it's frustrating, you know? I've always prided myself on being in control, but in that car... I was just a passenger in my own life.",
    "Therapist: How did that feel today?",
    "Client: It was... difficult. But different from before. I noticed I could breathe through it better this time. Still scary, but... I didn't feel as trapped? Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. What do you think has changed?",
    "Client: Well, I've been practicing those grounding techniques you taught me. They... they really help. When I started feeling overwhelmed, I focused on my breathing, on the chair I was sitting in. It... it kept me present, I guess?",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How else has this impacted you?",
    "Client: I've noticed I'm less jumpy when I hear sudden noises. Used to be, a car honking would send me into a panic. Now, it still startles me, but... I recover faster? It's like... like I'm slowly reclaiming my peace, bit by bit.",
    "Therapist: That's significant. How does this relate to your goals?",
    "Client: I... I want to feel safe again. To not let this accident control my life. And I think... I think I'm getting there? Slowly, but... it's happening. I even considered visiting my grandkids next month. Haven't done that since... well, you know.",
    "Therapist: That's a big step. How do you feel about it?",
    "Client: Nervous, but... excited? I miss them so much. And I'm tired of letting fear dictate my life. I want to be the grandparent they deserve, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's very courageous. What's helping you move forward?",
    "Client: These sessions, for one. And... and my support group at the assisted living facility. There's this one lady there, Margaret. She... she went through something similar. Talking to her, it helps. Makes me feel less alone.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I think... I think I want to try driving again. Not far, just... around the block maybe? With someone else in the car. Baby steps, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How can we support that?",
    "Client: Maybe... could we work on some strategies for managing anxiety while driving? I want to be prepared, you know?",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll focus on that next time.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I never thought I'd get this far. After the accident, and then losing my partner... I felt so lost. But now, I feel... hopeful? Like maybe there's still some good years left in me.",
    "Therapist: That's beautiful. How does that hope feel?",
    "Client: It feels... warm. Like a little spark inside me. And every time I face one of these memories, or try something new, it grows a little brighter. I'm not saying it's easy, but... it's worth it. I'm worth it.",
    "Therapist: You absolutely are. What else would you like to share?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm finally starting to forgive myself. For surviving, for struggling... for everything. It's a process, but... I'm getting there. And that feels... it feels really good.",
    "Therapist: That's profound. How will you care for yourself today?",
    "Client: I think I'll call my daughter. Share some of this progress with her. And then maybe... maybe I'll take a walk in the garden. Enjoy the sunshine a bit. Life's too short to stay inside, right?",
    "Therapist: Sounds perfect. I'm proud of your progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I couldn't have done it without your help. This journey... it's tough, but I'm starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel. And for the first time in a long while, I'm looking forward to what comes next."
