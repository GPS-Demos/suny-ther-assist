    "Therapist: Welcome, Mark. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit anxious, to be honest. I know we talked about doing something different today, and I'm not sure what to expect.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We'll take it step by step.",
    "Client: Okay... I appreciate that. Can you tell me more about what we're going to do? I've been thinking about it since our last session, and I'm feeling a bit nervous.",
    "Therapist: We'll be doing imaginal exposure. It's a key part of your treatment.",
    "Client: Imaginal exposure? That sounds... intense. Is it going to be like reliving the plane crash? Because I'm not sure I'm ready for that. Just thinking about it makes my heart race.",
    "Therapist: It involves recounting the event, but you're safe here. How does that sound?",
    "Client: I mean, I trust you, but it sounds terrifying. I've spent so much time trying not to think about it. The idea of purposely bringing it up... it's a lot. Will it really help?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it's proven effective for PTSD. It helps process the trauma.",
    "Client: I see. I want to get better, I really do. It's just... the thought of talking about it in detail... I can already feel my palms getting sweaty. What if I panic? Or what if I can't do it?",
    "Therapist: Your reactions are normal. We'll go at your pace. I'm here to support you.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I appreciate your patience. I guess I'm worried about what might come up. There are parts of that day I've tried so hard to forget. Will this bring everything back?",
    "Therapist: It may bring up memories, but it's part of healing. You're very brave.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot. I've been feeling so stuck lately, like I can't move forward. If this can help... I want to try. Can you tell me more about what I'll need to do?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the event in detail. I'll guide you through it.",
    "Client: Okay. That sounds challenging, but I understand why it might be necessary. Will we do this every session from now on? Or is it a one-time thing?",
    "Therapist: We'll do it regularly, but not every session. It's part of a larger plan.",
    "Client: I see. That makes sense. I'm still nervous, but I think I'm ready to give it a try. Is there anything I can do to prepare myself? Or any techniques I can use if it gets overwhelming?",
    "Therapist: Deep breathing can help. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Alright. I'll try to keep that in mind. Deep breaths. I'm safe here. Okay... I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Let's do this."
