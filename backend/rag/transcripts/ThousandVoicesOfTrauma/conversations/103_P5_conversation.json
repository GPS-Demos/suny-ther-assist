    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. Work has been stressful lately, and I'm not sure what to expect from today's session. My anxiety has been acting up, especially when I think about the medical trauma we've discussed before.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll focus on imaginal exposure. Are you familiar with this?",
    "Client: Not really. I've heard the term, but I'm not sure what it entails. Can you explain it to me?",
    "Therapist: Certainly. It's a technique where you'll revisit your traumatic memory in a safe environment. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That sounds... challenging. I've been trying to avoid thinking about that experience. Won't it make things worse?",
    "Therapist: Your concern is valid. Can you tell me more about your worries?",
    "Client: Well, I'm afraid that reliving the experience might trigger a panic attack or make my anxiety worse. Plus, I've worked hard to keep those memories at bay. I'm not sure I'm ready to face them head-on.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your honesty. This process can be difficult, but it's designed to help. Shall I explain further?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I want to understand how this is supposed to help me when it seems so counterintuitive.",
    "Therapist: The goal is to process the memory safely, reducing its power over time. How does that align with your therapy goals?",
    "Client: I see. I do want to feel more in control and less anxious about my past experiences. But I'm still apprehensive about the process. How intense will this be?",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. You're in control throughout. What support do you need to feel comfortable?",
    "Client: I think I'd feel better if I knew I could take breaks if it becomes too overwhelming. And maybe if we could have some grounding exercises ready, just in case. Is that possible?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We can pause anytime, and I'll guide you through grounding exercises. Your safety is paramount.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I appreciate your understanding. I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be. What should I expect during the actual exposure?",
    "Therapist: You'll describe the traumatic event in detail, in the present tense. I'll be here to support you throughout.",
    "Client: Okay, that makes sense. It's still intimidating, but I understand the purpose better now. I'm willing to give it a try. Is there anything else I should know or prepare for?",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Remember, this is a step towards healing. Any other questions before we begin?",
    "Client: I think I'm okay for now. I'm still nervous, but I feel more prepared. Thank you for explaining everything and addressing my concerns. I'm ready to start when you are.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Let's begin when you're comfortable. Take a deep breath, and we'll start slowly."
