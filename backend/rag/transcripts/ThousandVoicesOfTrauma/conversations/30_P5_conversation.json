    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Abboud. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Samira. To be honest, I'm feeling a bit anxious. Ever since you mentioned we'd be starting this imaginal exposure thing today, I've been on edge. It's bringing back memories I've tried so hard to forget.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's talk about the process.",
    "Client: Alright. I appreciate your patience with me. It's just... the thought of revisiting those dark days in prison, it's overwhelming. I've spent years trying to build a new life, you know? But these memories, they still haunt me. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night, feeling like I'm back in that cell.",
    "Therapist: That's exactly why we're doing this. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried that reliving these experiences might make things worse. What if I can't handle it? What if it brings back the depression I've been fighting? I'm not as young as I used to be, and being alone... it's harder to cope with these feelings.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace and I'll support you throughout.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I suppose I should mention that since my wife passed, I've struggled with feeling vulnerable. The idea of opening up about this trauma... it's frightening. But I trust you, Dr. Samira. You've helped me through some tough times already.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad you feel that trust. What questions do you have about the process?",
    "Client: Well, how exactly does this work? Will I need to describe everything in detail? And what happens if I become too distressed during the session? I'm worried about losing control of my emotions.",
    "Therapist: You'll describe the event, and we can pause if needed. It's normal to feel distressed.",
    "Client: I see. That does make me feel a bit better. I guess I'm also wondering about the long-term effects. Will this really help reduce my PTSD symptoms? It's hard to imagine feeling better after intentionally revisiting such painful memories.",
    "Therapist: Yes, it can significantly reduce symptoms over time. Your courage is admirable.",
    "Client: Thank you, Dr. Samira. That means a lot coming from you. I suppose I'm ready to give this a try. It won't be easy, but if it can help me move forward and maybe even sleep better at night, it's worth it. I've carried this burden for so long... it would be nice to finally start letting it go.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Remember, you're in control. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm ready. Just... please be patient with me if I struggle. This isn't easy, but I'm willing to try. Let's do this."
