    "Therapist: Hello, Mr. Rodriguez. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hola, Dr. Thompson. I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. You mentioned last time we'd be talking more about the earthquake, and... well, I'm not sure I'm ready for that.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: It's just... every time I think about that day, my heart starts racing. I can still hear the rumbling, the screams... I worry that talking about it will make it all feel too real again. And with my depression, I'm not sure I can handle that right now.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are valid. Today, we'll start gently. Are you open to learning about imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: Imaginal exposure? That sounds... intimidating. What exactly does that mean?",
    "Therapist: It's a technique to help process traumatic memories. Shall I explain more?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I want to understand what I'm getting into.",
    "Therapist: We'll revisit the memory in a safe environment. It helps reduce its power over you.",
    "Client: Reduce its power? That sounds good, but... how? Won't reliving it make things worse?",
    "Therapist: Initially, it might be uncomfortable. But over time, it often lessens the memory's impact.",
    "Client: I see. But what if I panic? Or what if I can't handle it?",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. I'll be here to support you throughout. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It's a little reassuring. But I'm still scared. What if I disappoint you if I can't do it?",
    "Therapist: There's no disappointment. Your willingness to try is already courageous.",
    "Client: Gracias. That means a lot. I've been feeling so... stuck since the earthquake. Like I can't move forward.",
    "Therapist: This process aims to help you move forward. Are you ready to give it a try?",
    "Client: I... I think so. Can you tell me exactly what we'll do? I like to be prepared.",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll start with relaxation exercises, then gradually revisit the memory.",
    "Client: Okay. And you'll be here the whole time? You won't leave me alone with... with those memories?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'll be right here, guiding and supporting you throughout.",
    "Client: Alright. I trust you, Dr. Thompson. It's just... since retiring, I've had more time to think, and these memories... they've been haunting me more. My wife says I've been different since the earthquake.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. Shall we begin with a breathing exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would help. I'm feeling a bit calmer already, just talking about it.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's start. Take a deep breath in..."
