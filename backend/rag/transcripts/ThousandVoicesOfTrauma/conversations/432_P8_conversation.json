    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. My heart is still pounding. I can feel this tightness in my chest, you know? It's like I'm right back there, in that moment when I heard the window break downstairs.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: (exhales slowly) It's... it's the fear. The overwhelming fear. I remember lying in bed, hearing those footsteps coming up the stairs. I was frozen, completely paralyzed. I keep thinking, \"Why didn't I do something? Why didn't I run or call for help?\" But I couldn't move. I just... couldn't.",
    "Therapist: How does that memory make you feel in this moment?",
    "Client: Ashamed. Angry at myself. I feel so weak, so helpless. It's like I'm that scared little boy all over again, unable to protect myself. And then there's this... this rage. Towards the intruder, towards the world for letting this happen to me. It's all mixed up inside.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid feelings. How do these emotions manifest physically for you right now?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking. I can feel this knot in my stomach, like I'm going to be sick. My jaw is clenched so tight it hurts. And there's this... this heaviness on my chest. Like I can't get enough air. It's suffocating.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind as you experience these sensations?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"I'm not safe. I'll never be safe.\" Even though I know logically that I'm here in your office, a part of me is still there, in that bedroom, waiting for the worst to happen. And then I think about how this fear has controlled my life for so long. I've missed out on so much because of it.",
    "Therapist: How does revisiting this memory impact your view of your recovery journey?",
    "Client: It's... it's complicated. On one hand, I feel like I'm right back at square one, reliving all that terror and helplessness. But on the other hand, I'm here talking about it. I'm not running away from it anymore. That's... that's progress, right? Even if it doesn't feel like it right now.",
    "Therapist: Indeed. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much this experience has shaped me. The constant vigilance, the trust issues, the nightmares... they all stem from this. But I'm also noticing a small part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe proud? Proud that I survived, that I'm here facing this head-on. It's a weird mix of emotions.",
    "Therapist: How do you think this realization might affect you moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... I think it might help me be a bit kinder to myself. I've been so hard on myself for so long, blaming myself for not fighting back or doing more. But I was just a kid, scared out of my mind. Maybe... maybe it's time I start seeing myself as a survivor rather than a victim.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful shift. What feelings come up as you consider that perspective?",
    "Client: Relief, mostly. Like a weight is lifting a bit. There's still fear and anger, but there's also this... glimmer of hope? It's small, but it's there. I'm starting to see that maybe I'm stronger than I thought. That maybe I can get through this and come out the other side.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel now compared to when we started?",
    "Client: It's... it's different. The tightness in my chest is easing up a bit. My hands aren't shaking as much. I still feel on edge, but it's not as overwhelming. It's like... like I'm starting to come back to the present moment, if that makes sense.",
    "Therapist: What do you need right now to feel grounded?",
    "Client: I think... I think I just need a moment. To breathe, to remind myself that I'm here, that I'm safe. Maybe... maybe we could do one of those grounding exercises we've practiced? I feel like that might help bring me fully back to the present.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's do that. What would you like to focus on?",
    "Client: Can we do the one where we name things we can see, hear, and feel? That one usually helps me reconnect with my surroundings.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Whenever you're ready, start by naming five things you can see.",
    "Client: Okay... I see your bookshelf, the green plant in the corner, the clock on the wall, my shoes, and the painting behind you. I can hear... the ticking of the clock, cars passing outside, the hum of the air conditioner, and my own breathing. And I can feel... the softness of this chair, my feet on the carpet, the fabric of my shirt against my skin.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Better. More... present. The memory is still there, but it feels less immediate, less threatening. I'm here, in this room, not back there. It's... it's a relief.",
    "Therapist: What's your main takeaway from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's that I can face these memories and survive them. It's not easy, and it's scary as hell, but I can do it. And maybe, just maybe, by facing them, I can start to take back some of the power they've had over me for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's a profound insight. How would you like to close our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to sit here for a moment, just breathing and being present. To remind myself that I'm here, I'm safe, and I'm moving forward. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take a few moments to do just that."
