    "Therapist: Hello, Jake. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Thompson. I'm... I'm okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares lately, and I'm not sure if I'm ready for this.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... the idea of reliving those experiences with the cult, especially the... the abuse. It feels like I'm finally starting to forget some of it, and I'm scared that talking about it will bring everything back. Plus, I'm worried about how I'll react. What if I completely fall apart?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. Let's address them together.",
    "Client: Okay... I appreciate that. It's just hard to imagine how this could possibly help. I mean, isn't the goal to forget all of this? Why would we want to bring it back up?",
    "Therapist: The goal is actually to process the trauma, not forget it. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: I... I guess that makes sense. But how does reliving it help with processing? Won't it just make everything worse?",
    "Therapist: It can feel counterintuitive. The exposure helps reduce the power of the memories.",
    "Client: Really? That's... interesting. I never thought about it that way. So, what exactly will we be doing? How does this work?",
    "Therapist: We'll guide you through recounting the traumatic experience in detail. Are you comfortable with that?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. The idea of going into detail is scary. What if I can't handle it? What if I have a panic attack or something?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are normal. We'll go at your pace and I'll support you throughout.",
    "Client: Okay... that's reassuring. I trust you, Dr. Thompson. I just... I've never talked about this with anyone before. Not even my parents know the full extent of what happened. It's like I've been carrying this secret for so long, and the thought of finally letting it out is both terrifying and... I don't know, maybe a little relieving?",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. How do you think sharing might affect you?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me hopes it might lift some of this weight I've been carrying. But another part is terrified of being judged or not believed. And then there's the fear of how I'll feel afterwards. Will I be able to function? Will it make my anxiety worse?",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid concerns. We'll work through this together at your pace.",
    "Client: Thank you, that means a lot. I guess... I'm as ready as I'll ever be. What should I expect during the session?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the experience in detail. It may be emotionally intense, but I'm here to support you.",
    "Client: Okay... I think I can do that. It's going to be hard, but I want to get better. I'm tired of the nightmares and the anxiety. I want to be able to trust people again, to feel safe. If this can help with that, then I'm willing to try. Just... please be patient with me if I struggle or need to take breaks.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Your well-being is the priority. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do this. I'm scared, but I'm also ready to face this. Thank you for being here with me, Dr. Thompson. It means more than you know."
