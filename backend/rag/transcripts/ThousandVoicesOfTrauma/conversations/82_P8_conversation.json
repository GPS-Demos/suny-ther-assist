    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart's still racing, and I feel a bit shaky. That memory of the hostage situation... it's like I was right back there in that bank, you know? I can still hear the sound of the gunshots, the screaming... (pauses, takes a deep breath) It's hard to shake off.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: Well, I keep seeing the face of that young teller. She was so terrified, and I... I felt so helpless. I wanted to do something, anything to help her, but I was frozen. I couldn't move. And now, thinking about it, I feel this overwhelming sense of guilt. Like, maybe if I had done something, things would have turned out differently.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How does that guilt feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a heavy weight on my chest. And my stomach feels all knotted up. I know, logically, that there wasn't anything I could've done. But emotionally? It's like I failed everyone in that bank that day.",
    "Therapist: I see. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"Why didn't I do more?\" And then I feel angry at myself for being so scared. But then another part of me is saying, \"You were just trying to survive.\" It's like there's this constant battle in my head. And sometimes, I wonder if I'll ever feel safe in public places again. Every time I walk into a bank or any crowded place, I'm on edge, scanning for potential threats.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts affect your daily life?",
    "Client: They... they're exhausting. I'm always tense, always watching. I've stopped going out as much as I used to. I miss my old life, you know? Before all this happened. I used to love going out with friends, trying new restaurants. Now, the thought of being in a crowded place makes me anxious. And I hate that this experience has changed me so much. It's like the person I was before that day is gone.",
    "Therapist: What feelings come up when you think about that change?",
    "Client: Sadness, mostly. And a sort of... grief, I guess? For the person I used to be. I feel angry too, at the men who did this. They didn't just rob a bank that day, they robbed me of my sense of security, my peace of mind. And sometimes, I feel so alone in this. My family tries to understand, but unless you've been through something like this... (trails off, sighs)",
    "Therapist: It sounds like you're carrying a lot. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to curl up and hide away from the world. But another part knows that's not the answer. I guess... I need to find a way to feel safe again. To trust that the world isn't always a dangerous place. And maybe... to forgive myself for not being able to do more that day. Is that even possible?",
    "Therapist: What do you think about that possibility?",
    "Client: I want to believe it's possible. There are moments when I feel stronger, when I can see a future where this doesn't define me. But it's hard. It's like... climbing a mountain, and every time I think I'm near the top, I realize there's still so far to go. But I'm trying. I'm here, aren't I? Talking about it, facing it. That's got to count for something, right?",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to acknowledge that effort?",
    "Client: It's... kind of empowering, actually. I mean, reliving that memory was incredibly difficult. But I did it. And I'm still here, still talking. Maybe I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. (pauses, reflects) You know, I've never really thought about it that way before. Maybe facing this head-on, as terrifying as it is, is its own kind of bravery.",
    "Therapist: What does that bravery mean to you?",
    "Client: It means... hope, I think. Hope that I can work through this, that I can reclaim parts of my life that I thought were lost forever. It doesn't erase what happened, but maybe it means I can build something new from it. A new sense of strength, maybe? I don't know if I'm quite there yet, but just the idea that it's possible... it feels like a weight has lifted, just a little.",
    "Therapist: How would you like to carry this forward?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to focus on that idea of strength. Maybe start small, you know? Like, instead of avoiding crowded places entirely, maybe I could try going to a small caf\u00e9 during a quiet time. And remind myself that I'm brave for doing it, that each step is progress. And maybe, bit by bit, I can start to feel more like myself again. Not exactly who I was before - I don't think that's possible - but maybe someone new. Someone who's been through something terrible but came out the other side.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful approach. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... tired, but in a good way? Like I've done something important. And there's this tiny spark of... I don't know, maybe hope? It's small, but it's there. For the first time in a while, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this. It won't be easy, but... I'm willing to try.",
