    "Therapist: Welcome back. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm feeling a bit jittery, to be honest. But I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 4 right now. Just thinking about it is making me tense up a bit.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. When you're ready, close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Alright... I'm... I'm back in the refugee camp. It's crowded, noisy. The air is thick with dust and the smell of too many people in too small a space. I can hear children crying, people arguing in languages I don't understand. It's hot, so hot. The sun is beating down mercilessly.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see... rows and rows of tents. They're dirty, patched together with whatever materials people could find. There's laundry hanging between them, adding splashes of color to the drab surroundings. I'm standing in line for water. The line is long, stretching out of sight. People look tired, defeated. I can feel the grit of sand between my teeth.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My heart is racing a bit. I can feel my palms getting sweaty. It's... it's like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a commotion up ahead. I hear shouting, angry voices. People start pushing, trying to see what's happening. I'm jostled, nearly losing my footing. The crowd surges forward, and I... I can't breathe. It's too tight, too close.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here in my office. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe a 6 now? I feel trapped, like I did then.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep breathing. What do you see happening?",
    "Client: I see... I see two men fighting. One has a knife. Oh god, there's blood. People are screaming, running. I want to run too, but I'm frozen. I can't move. I can't... I can't...",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a moment. Breathe with me.",
    "Client: (Takes several deep breaths) Okay... okay. I'm here. I'm safe. But I can still see it so clearly.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're staying present. What happens next?",
    "Client: The guards come running. They're shouting, waving batons. One of them fires a warning shot into the air. The sound is deafening. People are screaming, pushing harder to get away. I'm knocked to the ground. I can taste dirt and blood in my mouth. Someone steps on my hand as they run past.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My heart is pounding. I feel... I feel helpless. Angry. Scared. Like I did then. Like I couldn't do anything to help, to stop it.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid feelings. Remember, you survived this. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to an 8 now. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Keep going. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I manage to crawl away from the crowd. My hand is throbbing. I make it to the edge of the camp, behind some tents. I can still hear the chaos, but it's more distant now. I'm shaking. I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... why us? Why do we have to live like this? We're human beings, not animals. I feel so... so powerless. So angry at the world for letting this happen.",
    "Therapist: Those are heavy emotions. How does your body feel?",
    "Client: Tense. So tense it hurts. My jaw is clenched. My shoulders are up to my ears. I feel like I might shatter into a million pieces.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Feel your feet on the ground. You're here, you're safe.",
    "Client: (Exhales slowly) Right. I'm here. I'm safe. But... but they're not. All those people I left behind.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that. What happens as the day goes on?",
    "Client: The camp slowly calms down. But there's a tension in the air, like electricity before a storm. People speak in whispers. I see the man who was stabbed being carried to the medical tent. His friend is sobbing. I... I want to help, but I don't know how. I feel useless.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, in this moment?",
    "Client: Drained. Hollow. Like I've been scraped out from the inside. My SUDS... maybe back down to a 6?",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Can you describe the rest of the day?",
    "Client: It's a blur of heat and dust and quiet desperation. I skip the food line. I can't bear to be in a crowd again. I sit in my tent, listening to the sounds of the camp. Children playing, despite everything. Women gossiping. Men arguing over a game of cards. It's so... normal. And yet nothing is normal.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking as the day ends?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm wondering how long we'll be here. If this is my life now. If I'll ever feel safe again. I'm scared of what tomorrow might bring. More violence? More helplessness? I feel... I feel lost.",
    "Therapist: Those are heavy thoughts. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Sad. So incredibly sad. For myself, for everyone there. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. You've done incredibly well today.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) Thank you. It's... it's hard to go back there.",
    "Therapist: I know. You've shown immense courage. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down. Maybe a 4 again? I feel drained, but... but also a bit lighter?",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've processed a lot today. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: Okay. I... I appreciate your guidance through this. It's not easy, but I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. Let's focus on some deep breathing exercises now.",
    "Client: (Breathes deeply) It's strange. I can still see it all so clearly, but it feels... less overwhelming now. Like I'm watching it from a distance.",
    "Therapist: That's a good sign. It means you're processing the memory. How do you feel physically?",
    "Client: Tired. Really tired. But the tension in my muscles is easing a bit. I feel... heavy, but in a good way? Like after a long workout.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Your body and mind have been working hard. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I think... I think I just need to sit quietly for a bit. To remind myself that I'm here, now. That I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: That's a good idea. Let's take a few minutes to do that. You've done excellent work today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's... it's not easy, but I'm glad we're doing this. I feel like I'm starting to understand my experiences better.",
    "Therapist: That's great to hear. Remember, healing takes time. Be patient with yourself.",
    "Client: I will. I'm... I'm actually looking forward to our next session. Is that strange?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It shows you're engaged in your healing process. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Calm, I think. Tired, but calm. My SUDS is probably down to a 2 now.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's end our session here. Remember to practice your coping strategies this week.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you again. This... this means a lot to me.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
