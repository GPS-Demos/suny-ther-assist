    "Therapist: Welcome, Rahul. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm feeling a bit uneasy, to be honest. My back is acting up again, and I'm not sure how that'll affect things.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's start with a SUDS rating. How would you rate your distress from 0 to 100?",
    "Client: Umm... probably around a 40 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Begin when you're ready.",
    "Client: Alright... (takes a deep breath) I'm eight years old. It's a warm evening, and I can hear the sounds of traffic outside our flat in Mumbai. My parents are arguing in the kitchen. Their voices are getting louder, and I'm... I'm trying to focus on my homework, but it's hard.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see my textbook on the table, but the words are blurry. My hands are shaking a bit. I can smell the spices from dinner earlier. The shouting gets louder, and I hear something crash. I... I jump in my chair.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I get up from my chair. My heart is racing. I want to hide, but I'm also worried about my mum. I tiptoe towards the kitchen doorway. The tiles are cool under my feet. I peek around the corner and... (voice trembles) I see my father grab my mother's arm. He's yelling in her face.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm terrified. My stomach feels like it's in knots. I want to help her, but I'm frozen. I can't... I can't move.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Rahul. Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 65.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) My father raises his hand. I want to shout, to stop him, but no sound comes out. He... he slaps my mother across the face. The sound echoes in the kitchen. I see her stumble back, her hand going to her cheek. There are tears in her eyes.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I can't take it anymore. I run into the kitchen, yelling \"Stop! Please stop!\" My father turns to me, his eyes wild with anger. I've never seen him look at me like that before. I feel so small, so helpless.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What's happening in your body?",
    "Client: My legs feel weak. I'm shaking all over. I can taste fear in my mouth, like metal. My chest is so tight, I can barely breathe.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm here. I'm safe now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: My father takes a step towards me. I flinch, expecting him to hit me too. But my mother grabs his arm, pleading with him to stop. He shakes her off, but he doesn't come any closer to me. I'm trembling, tears streaming down my face. I feel so ashamed, so useless.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in that moment?",
    "Client: I... I'm thinking that I should be stronger. That I should be able to protect my mother. But I'm just a child, and I feel so powerless. I hate myself for being scared.",
    "Therapist: Remember, it wasn't your fault. You were a child. What happens next?",
    "Client: My father storms out of the kitchen. I hear the front door slam. My mother sinks to the floor, sobbing. I... I go to her, wrap my arms around her. She holds me tight, and I can feel her whole body shaking.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm sad. Angry. My chest hurts. I want to comfort my mother, but I also feel this rage towards my father. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Rahul. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 80 now.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here in the present. You're safe.",
    "Client: (breathes deeply) Right. I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: We sit there on the kitchen floor for what feels like hours. I can smell my mother's perfume mixed with the scent of her tears. My legs are starting to cramp, but I don't want to move. I'm afraid if I let go, something worse will happen.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking that I need to be strong. That I need to protect my mother. But I also feel this deep, gnawing fear. What if he comes back? What if next time is worse?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How does your body feel?",
    "Client: My muscles are tense. My jaw is clenched so tight it hurts. I feel like I can't relax, like I always need to be on guard.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to release that tension. Breathe deeply.",
    "Client: (exhales slowly) Okay... I'm trying.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: Eventually, my mother stops crying. She wipes her eyes and looks at me. She tries to smile, but it doesn't reach her eyes. She says, \"It's okay, beta. Everything will be alright.\" But I don't believe her. I can see the bruise forming on her cheek.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Helpless. Angry. I want to believe her, but I know it's not true. Nothing feels okay.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I help her up. We clean up the broken dishes on the floor. Neither of us speaks. The silence feels heavy, suffocating. I keep glancing at the door, terrified that my father will come back.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Rahul. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still around 75.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember to stay grounded in the present. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: My mother sends me to bed, but I can't sleep. I lie awake, listening for any sound. Every car that passes makes me tense up. I... I feel like I should be doing something, but I don't know what. I feel so small, so useless.",
    "Therapist: It's not your responsibility to fix adult problems. You were a child.",
    "Client: I know that now, but... it's hard. I still feel that weight sometimes.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What else do you remember from that night?",
    "Client: I... I remember the sound of my father coming home late. I hear my mother's muffled voice, pleading. Then silence. I'm frozen in my bed, afraid to move, afraid to breathe. I spend the rest of the night like that, wide awake, every muscle tense.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. My back is aching. I feel a mix of sadness and anger, but also... relief? Like talking about it is lifting a weight off me.",
    "Therapist: That's good, Rahul. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 60, I think.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Let's start winding down. Take some deep breaths.",
    "Client: (breathes deeply) Okay... I'm here. I'm safe now.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You're safe. The memory can't hurt you anymore.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's... it's still hard to talk about, but I think it's getting easier.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great courage today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Tired, but... lighter somehow. Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after these sessions. Remember to be kind to yourself today.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Rahul. We'll end here for today. Well done."
