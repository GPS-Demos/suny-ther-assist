    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start with your current SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10. My stomach feels a little tight.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day. Describe what you see.",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in my apartment. It's early morning, and I can hear the wind howling outside. The news is on, warning about the approaching hurricane. I'm trying to decide if I should evacuate or stay put. My hands are shaking as I pack a bag, just in case.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My heart is starting to race. The memory feels so vivid. I can almost smell the rain in the air.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. I'm feeling more anxious now.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Keep going.",
    "Client: The power suddenly goes out. I'm plunged into darkness, and the wind is getting louder. I fumble for my phone to use as a flashlight. I'm scared, really scared. I can hear things hitting the building outside. What if the windows break? What if the roof comes off?",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. My palms are sweating, and I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I'm trying. In the memory, I'm huddled in my bathtub. It's the only place I feel somewhat safe. The noise is deafening. I can hear glass breaking somewhere in the apartment. I'm crying, praying for it to be over. I've never felt so alone and helpless in my life.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I... I can feel tears on my cheeks. My chest is so tight. It's like I'm back there again.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's a 9. I'm really struggling.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it if you can.",
    "Client: Okay... In the memory, water starts seeping under the bathroom door. I'm terrified it's going to keep rising. I'm shaking uncontrollably, clutching my phone, trying to call for help, but there's no signal. I feel so trapped, so vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: And now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm starting to feel a bit calmer. Like I'm coming out of it a little.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's dropped to about a 7. I'm still anxious, but not as overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. How do you feel physically?",
    "Client: My breathing is slowing down. The tightness in my chest is easing a bit. I still feel shaky, though.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Continue with the memory.",
    "Client: The storm starts to die down. The silence afterwards is almost as scary as the noise. I'm afraid to leave the bathroom. When I finally do, I see the damage. My windows are broken, there's water everywhere, my belongings are ruined. But I'm alive. I made it through.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5. I feel... I don't know, a mix of relief and sadness.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Drained, but also... maybe a little proud? I survived something terrifying. It was awful, but I got through it.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Final SUDS?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 3 now. I feel more grounded, more present here with you.",
    "Therapist: Well done. Let's take a moment to breathe before we discuss further."
