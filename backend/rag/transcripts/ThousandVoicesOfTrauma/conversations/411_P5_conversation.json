    "Therapist: Mrs. Lee, today we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. I've been dreading this part. The idea of reliving that horrible day at the bank... it makes my heart race just thinking about it. Is this really necessary?",
    "Therapist: Your hesitation is understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I've spent years trying to forget what happened. The thought of purposely remembering it in detail... it's terrifying. What if I can't handle it? What if it makes things worse?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How do you think revisiting the memory might help?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe it could help me process what happened? But I'm worried about losing control. That day, I felt so helpless. I don't want to feel that way again.",
    "Therapist: Feeling in control is important. How can we make you feel safe during this process?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe if you could explain what exactly will happen? And... could my husband wait outside, just in case I need him?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let's discuss the process and arrange for your husband to be nearby.",
    "Client: Thank you, that helps a bit. So, what exactly will happen during this... exposure?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the event in present tense. I'll guide you through it. Ready to hear more?",
    "Client: I think so. Please go on.",
    "Therapist: We'll focus on sensory details and your thoughts and feelings during the event.",
    "Client: That sounds intense. How long will it last? And what if it becomes too overwhelming?",
    "Therapist: It'll last about 45 minutes. We can pause if needed. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It's still scary, but I appreciate knowing I can take breaks. Will this really help my nightmares and flashbacks?",
    "Therapist: Many find it reduces symptoms over time. Your courage is admirable, Mrs. Lee.",
    "Client: Thank you. I suppose if it might help, it's worth trying. I'm tired of living in fear. But... will you stay with me through it all?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'll be here to support you every step of the way.",
    "Client: Okay. I think... I think I'm ready to try. Can we start with something small today, just to get used to it?",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll start gradually. Shall we begin with a brief overview?",
    "Client: Yes, that sounds manageable. Thank you for being so patient with me. I know I'm not the easiest patient, especially at my age. It's not easy to change old habits.",
    "Therapist: Your willingness to try is what matters. Shall we start?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do it. I'm nervous, but I'm also hopeful. Maybe this will finally help me move past that terrible day and enjoy my retirement with my husband. I'm ready."
