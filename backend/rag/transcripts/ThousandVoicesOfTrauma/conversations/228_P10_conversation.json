    "Therapist: Welcome, Anna. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm feeling a bit jittery, to be honest. But I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control. Let's start with a SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 6 out of 10. My hands are a bit clammy.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. When you're ready, close your eyes and describe the scene.",
    "Client: (inhales deeply) Alright... I'm... I'm back in the refugee camp. It's late afternoon, and the sun is beating down mercilessly. The air is thick with dust and the smell of too many people crammed together. I can hear children crying in the distance, and there's a constant murmur of voices speaking languages I don't understand. I'm sitting on the ground outside our family's tent, my knees pulled up to my chest. I'm trying to make myself as small as possible.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: Rows and rows of tents, stretching as far as I can see. They're all identical \u2013 faded blue tarps held up by metal poles. There's laundry hanging between some of them, adding splashes of color to the drab landscape. People are milling about, some carrying water jugs, others just... existing. I spot a group of men near the food distribution area, and my stomach tightens.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I can feel it pounding in my chest. My muscles are tense, especially in my shoulders and jaw. I'm... I'm scared.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay present in the memory. What happens next?",
    "Client: I see one of the men break away from the group. He's... he's walking towards me. Oh god, it's him. The one who... (voice breaks)",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Anna. You're safe here. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: (breathing shakily) It's... it's an 8 now. Maybe higher.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, this is just a memory. You're in control. Can you describe what you're seeing?",
    "Client: He's getting closer. I can see his face now \u2013 those cold, dark eyes. He's smiling, but it's not friendly. It's... predatory. I want to run, but I'm frozen in place. My heart feels like it's going to burst out of my chest.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: He... he stops in front of me. Looms over me. I can smell the cigarettes on his breath as he leans down. He says... he says, \"Hello, little one. Why don't you come with me? I have something to show you.\" His voice is sickeningly sweet, but there's an edge to it that makes my skin crawl.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Terrified. Disgusted. I feel like I'm going to be sick. My whole body is shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Anna. Remember, you're safe here. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I shake my head. I try to speak, but my voice comes out as a whisper. \"No... please, leave me alone.\" But he doesn't listen. He grabs my arm, his fingers digging into my skin. I can still feel it, even now. (voice trembling)",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. You're here, in my office. You're safe.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) Okay... okay. I'm here. I'm safe. (pauses) He... he starts pulling me up. I try to resist, but I'm so weak from hunger and fear. He's dragging me towards the edge of the camp, where the tents are more spread out. I'm looking around desperately, hoping someone will help, but everyone just turns away. They're all too afraid to interfere.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking that this is it. This is where I die. Or worse. I'm praying, begging God to save me, to send someone to help. But no one comes. I feel so alone, so helpless.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: He pulls me behind an empty tent. The sound of the camp fades away. It's just him and me now. He pushes me to the ground, and I can feel the rough, dusty earth beneath me. He's on top of me, his weight crushing me. I can't breathe. I... I can't... (starts hyperventilating)",
    "Therapist: Anna, focus on my voice. You're safe. Take a deep breath. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: (follows breathing instructions) I... I'm okay. I'm here.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. Maybe higher. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Remember, this is just a memory. You survived this. Can you continue?",
    "Client: (nods) He... he starts tearing at my clothes. His hands are everywhere, rough and demanding. I'm crying, begging him to stop, but it's like he can't even hear me. The world narrows down to just this moment, this horror. I close my eyes tight, trying to escape, to be anywhere else.",
    "Therapist: Stay present, Anna. What do you feel?",
    "Client: Pain. So much pain. It feels like I'm being torn apart. And shame. Deep, burning shame. I feel dirty, used, worthless. Like I'll never be clean again.",
    "Therapist: Those feelings are valid, but remember, this wasn't your fault.",
    "Client: (crying softly) I know that now, but in that moment... I felt like I must have done something to deserve this. Like I was being punished.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. You're doing incredibly well.",
    "Client: (takes a few deep breaths) Okay... After what feels like an eternity, it's over. He... he stands up, adjusts his clothes. He looks down at me with this... this smirk. Like he's proud of what he's done. He says, \"Thanks for the fun, little one. Our secret, yeah?\" And then he's gone, just like that. Leaving me there, broken and bleeding.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel in that moment?",
    "Client: Empty. Hollow. Like something fundamental has been ripped out of me. I can't move. I can barely breathe. I just lie there, staring up at the sky, wondering how the world can just go on like nothing happened.",
    "Therapist: What do you do next?",
    "Client: Eventually, I manage to pull myself up. My whole body hurts. I adjust my torn clothes as best I can and stumble back to our tent. My mother sees me and knows immediately that something is wrong, but I can't speak. I just collapse into her arms and sob.",
    "Therapist: That must have been so difficult. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. Exhausted. But also... I don't know. There's a part of me that feels stronger, having faced this memory again. My SUDS is probably down to a 7 now.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well, Anna. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves. Can you tell me five things you can see in this room?",
    "Client: (looks around) I see... your green plant in the corner. The painting of the ocean on the wall. My water bottle on the table. Your glasses. And the clock on your desk.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Now, four things you can feel.",
    "Client: The softness of this chair. My feet on the carpet. The tissue in my hand. And... the coolness of the air conditioning.",
    "Therapist: Good. Three things you can hear?",
    "Client: The ticking of the clock. Traffic outside. And... my own breathing.",
    "Therapist: Two things you can smell?",
    "Client: The lavender air freshener. And coffee \u2013 I think from your mug.",
    "Therapist: And finally, one thing you can taste?",
    "Client: The mint from the gum I was chewing earlier.",
    "Therapist: Well done, Anna. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Better. More... present. My SUDS is probably down to a 5 now. It's still there, that memory, but it feels less overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You've made incredible progress today. How do you feel about the session?",
    "Client: It was hard. Really hard. But... I feel like I've taken back some control. Like that memory doesn't have as much power over me anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant insight. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we end?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm okay for now. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know it's not easy to hear these things either.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Anna. Your strength and resilience are truly remarkable. Remember to use the coping strategies we've discussed if you feel overwhelmed later. Our time is up for today, but I'm proud of the work you've done. Take care of yourself, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. I will. See you next week."
