    "Therapist: Good afternoon. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is dreading it. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with your SUDS level.",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 6 right now. Just thinking about it is making me anxious.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we're here together. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Yeah, I think so. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day.",
    "Client: (Exhales slowly) It's... it's a sunny afternoon. I'm at home, scrolling through my phone. Suddenly, I see a video... oh God, it's another police brutality incident. My heart starts racing immediately.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see... I see a Black man, probably around my age, being thrown to the ground by officers. He's not resisting, but they're... they're so rough with him. I can hear him pleading, saying he can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's climbing... maybe an 8? My palms are sweating.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Shaky breath) I... I can't stop watching. The man on the ground, he reminds me so much of my brother. The one I lost. And I just keep thinking... that could've been him. That could've been me.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. I'm angry, I'm scared. I want to reach through the screen and help him, but I can't. I feel so... so powerless.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The video keeps playing. More officers arrive. They're not helping him up, they're... they're piling on. I can barely see the man anymore. His cries are getting weaker. I'm... I'm yelling at my phone now, telling them to stop.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. Maybe higher. I feel like I can't breathe either.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: (Audible gulp) Okay... okay. The video ends, but I can't stop staring at the screen. I'm shaking. All I can think about is my brother, how he died. How it could've been him in that video. How it could be me next time.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those thoughts. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I call my partner. I'm crying, I can barely get the words out. They rush home from work. I'm pacing, I can't sit still. When they get home, I just collapse into their arms. I feel so... so broken.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's still high... maybe an 8? My heart's still pounding.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep breathing. What happens after your partner arrives?",
    "Client: We sit on the couch. I'm trying to explain what I saw, but I keep choking up. My partner holds me, tells me it's okay to cry. But I feel... I feel this rage building up inside me. I want to scream, to break something.",
    "Therapist: Allow yourself to feel that anger. It's a natural response.",
    "Client: I start ranting about how nothing's changed, how my brother's death was for nothing. I'm sobbing and shouting at the same time. My partner just listens, lets me get it all out. But I feel so... so helpless.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still around an 8. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here in the present.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Okay... As the night goes on, I can't sleep. I keep replaying the video in my head, thinking about my brother. I feel this... this heaviness in my chest. Like I'm carrying the weight of every Black person who's ever been hurt by the police.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What does it make you want to do?",
    "Client: I... I want to do something. Anything. I start looking up protests, organizations to donate to. But there's also this part of me that feels... defeated. Like nothing will ever change.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7? I'm still tense, but talking about taking action helps a little.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Keep going.",
    "Client: The next few days are a blur. I'm glued to the news, watching for updates. I attend a local protest. Being there, surrounded by others who understand... it helps, but it also brings back all those feelings of anger and fear.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your body during the protest?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm on edge. Every time I see a police officer, my heart races. I'm chanting, my voice is getting hoarse. But there's also this... this energy. Like we're all connected by our pain and our hope.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that connection. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I see people of all races there. It makes me feel... less alone. But it also reminds me of how widespread this problem is. I keep thinking about my brother, wishing he could see this unity.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around a 6. The memory is still painful, but talking about the community support helps.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: As the days pass, the initial shock wears off, but the pain... it lingers. I find myself having trouble concentrating at work. I'm irritable, snapping at my partner over small things. I feel guilty about it, but I can't seem to control it.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with these feelings?",
    "Client: I... I try to channel it into something productive. I start volunteering at a local community center. It helps, but sometimes... sometimes it feels like a drop in the ocean. Like no matter what I do, it'll never be enough.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level as you think about that?",
    "Client: It's... it's hovering around a 5 or 6. The helplessness is still there, but it's not as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. Keep going.",
    "Client: I start having nightmares. Not just about the video, but about my brother. In my dreams, I'm there when he dies, but I can't save him. I wake up in cold sweats, my partner trying to comfort me. It's... it's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: How do these nightmares affect your daily life?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm always tired. I start dreading going to sleep. During the day, I'm jumpy, especially around police. Every siren makes me flinch. I feel like I'm constantly on guard.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's back up to a 7. Talking about the nightmares brings it all back.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Deep breath) Okay... As weeks pass, the intensity starts to fade a bit. But the sadness, the anger... they're still there. It's like a wound that keeps getting reopened every time I see another incident on the news.",
    "Therapist: How do you manage those emotions now?",
    "Client: I... I try to balance staying informed with taking care of my mental health. I limit my news intake. I talk to my partner, my friends. I keep volunteering. Some days are better than others. But the fear... it's always there in the background.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level as we near the end of this recollection?",
    "Client: It's... it's around a 5 now. Talking about it, reliving it... it's hard. But I also feel a bit... lighter? Like I'm not carrying it all alone anymore.",
    "Therapist: You've done very well today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. But also... I don't know, maybe a little proud? That I could get through this without falling apart. It's still painful, but maybe... maybe a bit more manageable.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's take a few deep breaths together to close the session.",
    "Client: (Deep breaths) Thank you... for listening, for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but... I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue to work through this together."
