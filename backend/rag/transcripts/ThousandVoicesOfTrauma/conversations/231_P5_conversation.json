    "Therapist: Good morning, John. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Morning, Dr. Thompson. I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been having more nightmares lately about... you know, the cult stuff.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. Are you ready to discuss it?",
    "Client: I think so. But I'm not sure what to expect. Can you explain a bit more about what we'll be doing?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Imaginal exposure involves revisiting your traumatic memories in a safe environment. It can help reduce PTSD symptoms over time.",
    "Client: That sounds... intense. I'm not sure I'm ready to relive those experiences. What if I can't handle it?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. We'll go at your pace, and I'll support you throughout. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It's a bit reassuring, but I'm still scared. Will this really help with the nightmares and flashbacks?",
    "Therapist: Many find it effective for those symptoms. Your bravery in facing this is commendable.",
    "Client: Thank you, I appreciate that. I guess I'm willing to try if it might help. What exactly will we do during the exposure?",
    "Therapist: You'll recount your traumatic experience in detail. I'll guide you through it, focusing on sensory details and emotions.",
    "Client: That sounds challenging. I've spent so long trying to forget those memories. Will bringing them up make things worse?",
    "Therapist: It's a common concern. While initially distressing, exposure often leads to reduced symptoms over time. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm nervous, but I trust you. If you think this will help, I'm willing to give it a shot. How long will the exposure last?",
    "Therapist: We'll start with about 30 minutes today. We can adjust based on your comfort level. What do you think?",
    "Client: That seems manageable. I appreciate your flexibility. Can we stop if it becomes too overwhelming?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're in control. We can pause or stop anytime. Your safety is my priority.",
    "Client: Okay, that makes me feel better. I'm still anxious, but I think I'm ready to try. What should I do to prepare?",
    "Therapist: Just focus on being present. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Alright, I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Let's do this."
