    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is spinning. I can still see those hateful messages flashing on my screen. My heart is racing, and I feel a tightness in my chest. It's as if I'm right back there, reading each cruel word all over again.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Shame. Overwhelming shame. I keep thinking, \"Why me? What did I do to deserve this?\" It's like I'm drowning in this feeling of worthlessness. And there's anger too, bubbling just beneath the surface. I want to scream at those faceless bullies, but I also want to hide away from the world.",
    "Therapist: How does that shame feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's heavy. Like a weight pressing down on my shoulders. My stomach is in knots, and I feel so small. I can feel my face burning with embarrassment, even though I know I'm safe here. It's as if everyone can see right through me, see all my flaws and weaknesses.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep hearing their words in my head. \"You're pathetic,\" \"No one likes you,\" \"Why don't you just disappear?\" And a part of me believes it. I'm thinking, \"Maybe they're right. Maybe I am worthless.\" But then there's this tiny voice fighting back, saying, \"No, this isn't fair. I don't deserve this.\"",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts relate to your past experiences?",
    "Client: It... it reminds me of when I witnessed that violent argument between my parents as a child. I felt so helpless then, just like I do now. I couldn't stop it then, and I can't stop these online attacks now. It's the same feeling of being trapped, of having no control.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about that connection?",
    "Client: I... I never realized how similar those feelings were. In both situations, I felt so powerless. But with the cyberbullying, it's like it's happening all over again, every time I open my computer or phone. It's a constant reminder of my vulnerability.",
    "Therapist: How does recognizing that connection impact you?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually a bit relieving, in a strange way. Like, maybe I'm not reacting irrationally to the cyberbullying. My response makes sense given my past. But it's also frustrating because I thought I had moved past the trauma from my childhood. Now it feels like I'm right back where I started.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you reflect on that?",
    "Client: A mix of emotions, really. There's sadness for that little girl who felt so helpless, and for the adult me who's struggling now. But there's also a glimmer of hope. If I've dealt with trauma before, maybe I can do it again. It's just... it's exhausting to think about going through that process all over again.",
    "Therapist: How does that glimmer of hope feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a small warm light in my chest. It's not much, but it's there. For the first time in a while, I'm thinking that maybe, just maybe, I can get through this. But it's scary too. What if I try and fail? What if I can't overcome this?",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to you if you could overcome this?",
    "Client: It would mean... everything. It would mean I'm stronger than I thought. That I'm not defined by what others say about me. That I can face my fears and come out the other side. It would mean freedom from this constant anxiety and self-doubt. But it feels so far away right now, like trying to climb a mountain when I can barely take a step.",
    "Therapist: How can we build on that small warm light?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe by reminding myself of times I've been strong in the past? Or by focusing on the people who do support me, instead of the nameless bullies? It's hard to see clearly right now, but I want to try. I'm tired of feeling this way.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you could take?",
    "Client: I... I could try to limit my time online, maybe? Give myself breaks from the constant barrage of messages. Or reach out to a friend when I'm feeling overwhelmed, instead of isolating myself. It's scary to think about, but I know I need to do something different.",
    "Therapist: How does thinking about that step make you feel?",
    "Client: Nervous, definitely. But also... a little excited? Like I'm taking back some control. It's a tiny step, but it feels like something I can actually do. And maybe if I can do this, I can do more. It's not much, but it's... it's something to hold onto.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing about yourself right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm actually breathing a bit easier. My shoulders feel less tense. I'm still anxious, but it's not as overwhelming as it was at the start of our session. It's like... like I've let out a breath I didn't know I was holding. And I feel... I don't know, maybe a little proud? That I made it through the exposure exercise, that I'm here talking about it.",
    "Therapist: How does that pride sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... it's unfamiliar. Almost uncomfortable. I'm not used to feeling proud of myself, especially not lately. But it's there, this tiny spark. And I want to hold onto it, nurture it. Maybe this is part of the healing process? Recognizing my own strength, even in small moments like this?",
    "Therapist: What would you like to remember from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I want to remember this moment right now. The feeling that maybe, just maybe, I can get through this. That I'm not alone in this fight. And that my past experiences have made me stronger, not weaker. It's a fragile feeling, but it's real. And I want to hold onto it, even when things get tough again.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How would you like to close our session?",
    "Client: I... I think I'd like to take a few deep breaths. To ground myself in this moment, in this feeling of cautious hope. And maybe... maybe set an intention for the week ahead. To be gentle with myself, to remember this spark of strength when things get hard. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's do that together.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay. I'm setting my intention to be kind to myself this week. To remember that I'm stronger than I think, even when it doesn't feel like it. And to reach out when I need support. Thank you for guiding me through this. It wasn't easy, but I feel... I feel like I've taken a small step forward.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. See you then."
