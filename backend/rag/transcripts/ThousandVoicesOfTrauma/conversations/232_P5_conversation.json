    "Therapist: Welcome back. Today, we'll start imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm honestly quite nervous. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of revisiting those memories from my time as a prisoner of war... it's terrifying. I've spent years trying to push those experiences away.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried that once I start talking about it, I won't be able to stop the flood of emotions. What if I completely fall apart? And... I'm scared of how real it might feel, like I'm back there again.",
    "Therapist: Those are common concerns. How can I support you today?",
    "Client: I'm not sure. Maybe... could you explain why we need to do this? And what exactly will happen? I think knowing more might help me feel a bit more in control.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Imaginal exposure helps process traumatic memories. We'll go through it step-by-step. Ready to hear more?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. Please go on.",
    "Therapist: You'll recount the event in present tense. I'll guide you. It may be uncomfortable, but it's safe here.",
    "Client: Okay, that makes sense. But what if I start to panic? Or if I can't continue?",
    "Therapist: We can pause anytime. I'll be here to support you throughout. How does that sound?",
    "Client: It's reassuring to know I have some control. I appreciate your support. I'm still scared, but I think I understand why this is important.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. This work is crucial for healing. Any other questions?",
    "Client: Just one more. After we do this, how will I feel? I'm worried about being overwhelmed for days afterward.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel emotional after. We'll debrief and I'll provide coping strategies. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Alright. I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Let's do this. Thank you for being so patient with me and explaining everything. It really does help.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Remember, we're in this together. Let's start when you're ready."
