    "Therapist: Alright, Sarah. Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know this is important. Let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Start by closing your eyes and bringing that memory to mind.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) I'm there. I can see the living room. The TV is on, but the sound is muted. I can hear raised voices from the kitchen.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, about a 4. I'm tense, but it's manageable.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: I'm frozen on the couch. I want to get up, but I can't move. The shouting gets louder. I hear a crash, like something breaking. My heart is racing now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with it. SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 6. My palms are sweaty, and I feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Keep going.",
    "Client: I see my mom stumble into the room. Her lip is bleeding. She's crying. I want to help her, but I'm so scared. I can hear him coming after her.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: (Voice shaking) It's an 8. I feel like I can't breathe. My chest is so tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a slow, deep breath. You're doing great.",
    "Client: (Inhales shakily) He's in the room now. He's yelling at her, calling her names. I can smell the alcohol on him. I'm shaking. I want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. How's your SUDS?",
    "Client: (Crying) It's... it's a 9. I feel so helpless. So small.",
    "Therapist: You're incredibly brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: He grabs her arm. She's begging him to stop. I close my eyes, but I can still hear everything. The sound of him hitting her. Her cries. I feel so guilty for not helping.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: (Sobbing) It's a 10. I can't... I can't do this anymore.",
    "Therapist: You can. You're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Takes a shuddering breath) I hear sirens. Someone must have called the police. He's cursing, stumbling out. Mom is on the floor, crying. I finally move to her.",

    "Client: It's... it's down to an 8. I feel drained, but less panicked.",

    "Client: I'm holding Mom. She's apologizing to me. I feel angry and sad and relieved all at once. The police are at the door now.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's a 6. I'm still shaky, but the worst has passed.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well. Let's start to bring you back to the present.",
    "Client: (Opens eyes, wiping tears) That was... intense. But I got through it.",
    "Therapist: You did. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but also... lighter? Like I've released something.",
    "Therapist: That's common. You've shown tremendous courage today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I could face that memory head-on like that.",
    "Therapist: You've made significant progress. How would you rate your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 3. I'm tired, but I feel... okay.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves before we end.",
    "Client: (Nods) Yeah, that sounds good. I'm proud of myself for getting through this.",
    "Therapist: As you should be. You've done incredible work today, Sarah."
