    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Start when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in Kabul. It's a hot day, and I can feel sweat trickling down my back. The air is thick with dust and the smell of exhaust. I'm on patrol with my unit, walking down a narrow street lined with mud-brick buildings. Suddenly, I hear shouting...",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level?",
    "Client: Um, about a 4 out of 10. I'm tense, but manageable.",
    "Therapist: Good. Continue.",
    "Client: The shouting gets louder. I see a crowd forming ahead. My heart starts racing. There's a local man arguing with two police officers. They're pushing him, and he's trying to resist. I feel my grip tightening on my rifle...",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 6. My palms are sweaty, and I'm feeling anxious.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Keep going.",
    "Client: One of the officers pulls out his baton. I want to intervene, but I'm frozen. The man is on the ground now, and they're... they're beating him. I can hear his cries, see the blood... Oh god, I should've done something!",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. SUDS?",
    "Client: It's an 8 now. I feel sick to my stomach. My chest is tight, and I can't seem to catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: I... I can't watch anymore. I turn away, but I can still hear the man's pleas. My squadmate grabs my arm, tells me we need to move on. I feel so helpless, so angry at myself for not stepping in...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still an 8. I'm shaking. I feel like such a coward.",
    "Therapist: It's a difficult memory. You're brave for facing it.",
    "Client: I just... I keep seeing his face. The fear in his eyes. It haunts me. I should have done more.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down a bit. Maybe a 7 now. I'm still shaky, but the nausea is fading.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Keep going.",
    "Client: We continue our patrol, but I can't shake what I saw. The sounds of the beating echo in my head. I feel disconnected from my body, like I'm watching myself from outside. The guilt is overwhelming...",
    "Therapist: How's your distress now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually dropping. Maybe a 5? I feel drained, but the intense anxiety is lessening.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. We'll stop here for today.",
