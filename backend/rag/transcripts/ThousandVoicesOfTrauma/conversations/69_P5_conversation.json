    "Therapist: Welcome back. Today, we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm nervous, to be honest. I've been dreading this all week. The idea of reliving that plane crash... it's terrifying. I've spent so much time trying to avoid thinking about it, and now you want me to face it head-on? I'm not sure I can do this.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. This can be challenging. What concerns you most?",
    "Client: I guess... I'm afraid of losing control. What if I panic? Or what if it makes everything worse? I've been having nightmares about the crash, and I'm worried this will make them more frequent. Plus, I'm embarrassed about crying in front of you.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. It's normal to feel apprehensive. How can I support you?",
    "Client: I appreciate you asking. Maybe... could you explain why we're doing this? And what exactly will happen? I think understanding the process might help me feel a bit more in control. Also, is it okay if we take breaks if it gets too intense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Let me explain the purpose and process. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm still nervous, but I want to understand. Go ahead.",
    "Therapist: Imaginal exposure helps process trauma memories. We'll revisit the event gradually, reducing its emotional impact over time.",
    "Client: That makes sense, I guess. But how does reliving it actually help? Won't it just make me more anxious?",
    "Therapist: Initially, anxiety may increase. But with repetition, your brain learns the memory isn't a current threat.",
    "Client: Okay, I can see how that might work. It's like... desensitization, right? Like how people overcome fears of spiders by gradually exposing themselves to them?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. You'll narrate the event in present tense. I'll guide you through it. Ready to discuss the process?",
    "Client: Yes, I think I'm ready. But can you tell me more about what I might experience during the session? I want to be prepared for any intense emotions or physical reactions.",
    "Therapist: You may feel strong emotions, physical sensations. We'll take breaks if needed. Your safety is priority.",
    "Client: That's reassuring. I'm glad we can take breaks if necessary. I'm still scared, but I think I understand why this is important. It's about facing the memory head-on instead of avoiding it, right?",
    "Therapist: Precisely. Your courage is commendable. Any other questions before we begin?",
    "Client: Thank you for saying that. It helps to hear you acknowledge how difficult this is. I do have one more question - after the session, what should I expect? Will I feel worse for a while? Should I plan to take it easy for the rest of the day?",
    "Therapist: It's normal to feel drained afterward. Plan for rest and self-care. We'll debrief and discuss coping strategies.",
    "Client: Okay, that's good to know. I'll make sure I don't have any plans for the rest of the day. I appreciate your patience with all my questions. I think... I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Your readiness is a big step. Shall we begin the exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, let's start. I'm nervous, but I trust you and I know this is important for my recovery. I'll do my best to stay present and work through it. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Remember, we're in this together. Let's start..."
