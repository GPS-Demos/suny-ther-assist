    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is still there, you know? My heart's racing, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. The memory feels so vivid, almost like it just happened. I can still smell the musty air of that abandoned building we were clearing. It's... overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: It's a mix of things. There's this intense fear, like I'm back there again. But there's also... guilt, I think. I keep seeing Private Johnson's face. He was so young, barely out of high school. I was supposed to have his back, but I... I froze. I couldn't move fast enough when the shooting started. God, I can still hear his screams.",
    "Therapist: You're carrying a lot. How does your body feel as you recall this?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking. They're clammy too. It's like my whole body is on high alert. My stomach feels like it's in knots, and I'm having trouble catching my breath. It's almost like I can feel the weight of my gear, the heat of that day. It's suffocating.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"I should have done more.\" I was the senior officer. I was responsible for those men. If I had been faster, smarter, maybe Johnson would still be alive. Maybe others too. I feel like a failure. Like I don't deserve to be here when they're not.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts impact you now?",
    "Client: They... they consume me sometimes. It's hard to enjoy anything without feeling guilty. I push people away because I don't feel worthy of their love or friendship. My husband tries to understand, but how can he? He wasn't there. He didn't see what I saw, didn't fail like I did.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm angry. At myself, at the situation, at the world. Why did it have to be us? Why did I have to make those decisions? I'm angry that I can't just move on, that I'm still stuck reliving this over and over. And I'm... I'm scared. Scared that I'll never be the person I was before. Scared that I'll always be this broken version of myself.",
    "Therapist: How does sharing this make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. Really hard. But there's also a small part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe relieved? Like I've been carrying this weight for so long, and for a moment, it's not just on my shoulders. But then I feel guilty for feeling relieved. It's like I don't have the right to feel better about this.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to run away, to hide from these feelings. But another part knows I need to face this. I guess... I need to know that it's okay to feel all of this. That I'm not weak for struggling with it. And maybe... maybe I need to know that there's hope. That one day, this won't consume me like it does now.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. What else is on your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about the contrast between then and now. Back there, everything was life or death. Every decision mattered so much. And now, I'm here in this safe room, talking about it, and it feels... surreal. Like I'm living two lives. The one where I'm that soldier, always on edge, always responsible for life and death. And this one, where I'm trying to be a wife, a professional, just a normal person. But the memories, the guilt, the fear - they bridge both worlds. It's exhausting, constantly navigating between the two.",
    "Therapist: How does this impact your daily life?",
    "Client: It's... it's everywhere. I struggle to sleep because of nightmares. Loud noises make me jump. I find myself constantly scanning for threats, even in safe places like the grocery store. It's hard to connect with people because I feel like they can't possibly understand. And the chronic pain... it's a constant reminder of what I've been through. Sometimes I wonder if it's some sort of punishment.",
    "Therapist: What helps you cope with these feelings?",
    "Client: I... I try to stay busy. Work helps sometimes, gives me something else to focus on. But it's also exhausting, trying to keep up this facade of normalcy. I've started doing some breathing exercises, which help a bit with the anxiety. And... talking about it, like this. It's painful, but there's a small part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe hopeful? Like maybe if I can face these memories, they'll lose some of their power over me.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How do you feel now, compared to when we started?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. Emotionally and physically. But there's also this weird sense of... I don't know, maybe accomplishment? Like I've faced something I've been running from for so long. I'm still shaky, still anxious, but it feels a tiny bit less overwhelming. Is that... is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Everyone's experience is unique. What matters is your journey.",
    "Client: I guess... I guess that makes sense. It's just hard to know what's 'normal' anymore. Everything feels so distorted through the lens of trauma. But maybe... maybe that's okay? Maybe I don't have to be 'normal'. Maybe I just need to focus on healing, whatever that looks like for me.",
    "Therapist: That's a valuable perspective. What's your takeaway from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'm realizing that healing isn't linear. It's messy and painful and sometimes it feels like I'm going backwards. But maybe that's part of the process. And maybe... maybe I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. Facing these memories is hard, but I'm doing it. That has to count for something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How would you like to close our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need a moment of quiet. To just sit with all of this. It's a lot to process, but I feel like I've taken a step forward today, even if it's a small one. And maybe that's enough for now. Just knowing that I can face these memories, that I can talk about them... it feels like progress. Scary progress, but progress nonetheless.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for your courage today. We'll continue next week."
