    "Therapist: Welcome, Fatima. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is terrified. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Yes, let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see the marketplace. It's bustling, noisy. The smell of spices and diesel fumes fills the air. I'm on patrol with my unit.",
    "Therapist: Good. What time of day is it?",
    "Client: It's mid-afternoon. The sun is beating down, and I can feel sweat trickling down my back under my gear.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Um... maybe a 40? It's uncomfortable, but manageable.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: We're moving through the crowd, staying alert. Suddenly, I notice a young girl, couldn't be more than 14. She looks... scared. A man is gripping her arm tightly, pulling her along.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: My gut is churning. Something's not right. I... I want to intervene, but we're not supposed to unless there's a clear threat.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I make eye contact with the girl. Her eyes are pleading, desperate. I take a step towards them, and suddenly... oh God...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Fatima. Remember, you're safe here. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 70. My heart is racing.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Feel your feet on the ground. When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. As I move towards them, there's a deafening explosion. The world goes silent for a moment, then erupts into chaos. People are screaming, running. There's dust and smoke everywhere.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I'm disoriented. My training kicks in. I'm scanning for threats, trying to locate my team. But all I can think about is that girl. Where is she? Did she...?",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. I can barely breathe. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: I start moving through the chaos, calling out to my team. There are bodies... so many bodies. The smell of blood and... and burning flesh. I'm searching frantically for the girl, but there are so many injured people. I... I don't know what to do.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Fatima. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's at 85 now. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: I know it is. You're very brave. Take another deep breath. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I finally spot her. She's lying motionless near a destroyed stall. The man who was with her is nowhere to be seen. I rush over, my heart pounding. As I get closer, I can see... oh God, there's so much blood.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it, Fatima. You're doing well.",
    "Client: I kneel beside her, checking for a pulse. Her eyes flutter open, and she looks at me. She tries to speak, but only blood comes out. I'm applying pressure to her wounds, calling for a medic, but I know... I know it's too late.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: I feel... helpless. Angry. Devastated. She's just a child, and I couldn't save her. I couldn't stop whatever was happening to her before the explosion, and now... now she's dying in my arms.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength, Fatima. What happens as you sit with her?",
    "Client: I... I hold her hand. I tell her it's going to be okay, even though I know it's a lie. She squeezes my hand weakly, and then... then she's gone. Just like that. And I'm left there, covered in her blood, as the chaos continues around me.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm at a 90. My chest hurts. I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Let's take a few deep breaths together.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. [Deep breaths]",
    "Therapist: Good. Can you continue?",
    "Client: Yes... I think so. After she... after she dies, I'm just numb. I go through the motions, helping with triage, securing the area. But all I can think about is her face, her eyes. I failed her.",
    "Therapist: What do you mean by that?",
    "Client: I... I should have acted sooner. I knew something was wrong when I first saw her. If I had just trusted my instincts, maybe... maybe she'd still be alive.",
    "Therapist: How does that thought make you feel?",
    "Client: Guilty. So incredibly guilty. And angry at myself, at the man who had her, at the world that allows this to happen.",
    "Therapist: Those are natural feelings, Fatima. What happened next?",
    "Client: The rest of the day is a blur. We secured the area, evacuated the wounded. I gave my report, but I couldn't shake the feeling of her hand in mine as she died. That night, I couldn't sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw her face.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, as you remember that night?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. My distress is probably around 75 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Can you tell me more about the days that followed?",
    "Client: I... I threw myself into work. Tried to push it out of my mind. But I started having nightmares. I'd wake up in a cold sweat, hearing the explosion, smelling the blood. I became hyper-vigilant, always looking for signs of trafficking, always on edge.",
    "Therapist: How did that affect your daily life?",
    "Client: It... it consumed me. I couldn't relax, couldn't enjoy anything. I started withdrawing from my team, my friends. I felt like no one could understand what I was going through.",
    "Therapist: That sounds very isolating. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 60. Talking about it... it helps, somehow.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. Can you tell me about any positive moments or realizations you've had since then?",
    "Client: I... I started volunteering with an organization that helps trafficking survivors when I got back home. It doesn't erase what happened, but... it helps me feel like I'm doing something. Like maybe her death wasn't completely in vain.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful way to honor her memory. How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... bittersweet. I still carry the guilt, the pain. But there's a sense of purpose now, too. Like maybe I can prevent other girls from suffering the same fate.",
    "Therapist: That's a very positive perspective, Fatima. As we start to wind down, how are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained, but also... lighter, somehow. Like I've set down a heavy burden, even if just for a moment. My distress is probably around 45 now.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. You've shown incredible strength today. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we end?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm starting to understand that it wasn't my fault. I couldn't have known what would happen. It still hurts, but... maybe I can start to forgive myself.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization, Fatima. You should be proud of the work you've done today. Let's take a few deep breaths together to close out the session.",
    "Client: Okay. [Deep breaths] Thank you... for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Fatima. Remember, healing is a process. We'll continue to work through this together."
