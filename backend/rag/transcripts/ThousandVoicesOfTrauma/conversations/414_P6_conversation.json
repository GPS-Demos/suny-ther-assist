    "Client: Okay... I was walking in the park near my daughter's house. It was a sunny day, and I thought a stroll would help with my mood. I noticed a large dog off-leash, but I didn't think much of it. As I got closer, I realized it was actually a coyote. My heart started racing immediately. The coyote looked at me and... and...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: It's about a 6. I can feel my palms getting sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The coyote started growling and showing its teeth. I froze, not knowing what to do. It lunged at me, and I screamed. I tried to back away, but I tripped and fell. The coyote was on top of me in seconds, biting at my arms as I tried to protect my face. I could smell its breath, feel its weight on me. I thought I was going to die right there in the park.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's an 8 now. My heart is pounding, and I feel like I can't catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I remember screaming for help, but no one was around. The coyote kept biting and clawing at me. I managed to kick it off momentarily, but it came back. I was in so much pain, and I felt so helpless. I thought about my late husband, wishing he was there to save me. Then I heard someone yelling, and the coyote ran off. A jogger had heard my screams and came to help. I was bleeding and in shock. The jogger called an ambulance, but I couldn't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's still an 8. I feel nauseous and my hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The ambulance came, and I was taken to the hospital. I had multiple bites and scratches. The doctors were worried about rabies and infections. I spent days in the hospital, feeling scared and alone. My daughter visited, but I felt so ashamed that I couldn't even take a simple walk without something terrible happening. I kept replaying the attack in my mind, wondering what I could have done differently. Maybe if I had been more aware of my surroundings, or if I hadn't gone to the park alone...",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's gone down to a 7. I still feel shaky, but talking about it... it helps somehow.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How did you cope after leaving the hospital?",
    "Client: I struggled a lot. I was afraid to go outside, even to get the mail. I had nightmares about the attack, waking up in cold sweats. My depression got worse. I felt like I couldn't trust the world anymore. Simple things became so hard. I... I still have trouble going to parks or any open spaces. I feel like danger is always lurking.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's back up to an 8. Thinking about how it's affected my life... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Take a moment to breathe.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) It's just... I feel so weak. I used to be independent, and now I rely on my family for everything. I hate feeling this way, but I don't know how to change it.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's staying at an 8. My chest feels tight, and I'm fighting back tears.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to cry if you need to. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Crying softly) I just want to feel normal again. I want to be able to enjoy a walk without panicking. I want to be the grandmother my grandkids deserve, not this scared, broken person.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually down to a 6 now. Crying helped a bit, I think.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing these emotions.",
    "Client: I guess so. It's just hard to see a way forward sometimes. But being here, talking about it... it does help. I know I can't change what happened, but maybe I can learn to live with it better.",
    "Therapist: That's a great perspective. Final SUDS?",
    "Client: It's a 5 now. I feel drained, but also a little lighter.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... hopeful? Is that strange?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a common feeling after processing trauma.",
