    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Patel. How are you feeling about our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is... hesitant. It's been years since the earthquake, but talking about it still makes my heart race.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to help you process these memories safely. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Yes, let's... let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm in my office. It's a normal Tuesday morning. The clock on the wall says 9:17. I remember because I was running late for a meeting. I'm shuffling papers on my desk, trying to gather my thoughts when suddenly... the ground starts to shake.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What's happening around you?",
    "Client: Everything's... everything's moving. The pictures on the wall are swaying. My coffee mug slides off the desk and shatters. I can hear people shouting in the hallway. I'm... I'm frozen. I can't move.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My heart is pounding. My palms are sweaty. I... I feel like I can't breathe. It's like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: The shaking gets more intense. I hear a loud crack, and part of the ceiling collapses near my door. I'm trapped. I... I crawl under my desk, holding onto the legs. The noise is deafening \u2013 crashing, screaming, the building groaning.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about an 80. This is harder than I thought it would be.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you survived this. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm curled up under the desk. My phone is in my pocket, but my hands are shaking so much I can barely use it. I try to call my wife, but the lines are jammed. I... I keep thinking about her, about our daughter. Are they safe? I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I might die here. I might never see my family again. The shaking seems to go on forever. I can smell dust and... something burning. My throat feels dry. I'm... I'm praying, begging for it to stop.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take another deep breath. What happens as the shaking begins to subside?",
    "Client: It... it feels like hours, but I know it was only minutes. The shaking stops, but I'm afraid to move. I can hear people crying, calling out. Someone's shouting for help. I... I want to help, but I'm paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? Give me a number.",
    "Client: It's... it's around 70. My heart is still racing, but... I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Good. You're doing well. What do you do once you feel it's safe to move?",
    "Client: I... I slowly crawl out from under the desk. My legs feel weak. There's debris everywhere. The door is blocked by fallen ceiling tiles. I... I make my way to the window. The view outside... it's chaos. Buildings have collapsed. There's dust everywhere. I can see people running in the streets.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind as you take in this scene?",
    "Client: I... I feel overwhelmed. Shocked. It's like I'm in a nightmare, but I can't wake up. I keep thinking about my family. Are they okay? Did our house survive? I... I need to get to them.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I try to clear the debris from the door. My hands are shaking, and I cut myself on some broken glass. But I don't care. I need to get out. I need to find my family. I... I manage to push the door open enough to squeeze through.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to be out in the hallway?",
    "Client: It's... it's surreal. The hallway is dark. Emergency lights are flickering. I can hear people calling out, some crying. The air is thick with dust. I... I start making my way towards the stairwell, trying to help others as I go.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm scared, but also determined. My fear for my family is driving me forward. But with each step, I'm also terrified of aftershocks.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, where's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 65. Reliving this is hard, but... I'm starting to feel a bit more in control.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Continue. What happens as you reach the stairwell?",
    "Client: The stairwell is... it's crowded. People are trying to get down, some are panicking. I can smell smoke. Someone says there's a fire on the lower floors. I... I feel trapped again. But I know I have to keep moving.",
    "Therapist: How do you manage in this situation?",
    "Client: I... I try to stay calm. I remember my emergency training. I start helping to organize people, telling them to stay low, to cover their mouths with cloth. We... we start moving down slowly, helping those who are injured.",
    "Therapist: That's very brave. How does it feel to be helping others?",
    "Client: It's... it's both terrifying and empowering. I'm still scared, but focusing on others helps me stay grounded. I keep thinking of my family, using that to push through my fear.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens as you get closer to the ground floor?",
    "Client: The smoke gets thicker. It's harder to breathe. People are getting more panicked. I... I find myself taking charge, directing people to stay calm, to keep moving. We finally reach the ground floor, and I help push open the jammed door.",
    "Therapist: And as you step outside?",
    "Client: It's... it's like stepping into another world. The streets are chaos. There's rubble everywhere. Cars overturned. People running, screaming. I... I feel overwhelmed again. The scale of the destruction... it's unimaginable.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaken. My heart is racing again. But I'm also feeling a strange mix of relief and guilt. I made it out, but... so many others didn't.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 60 now. Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also helping.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What do you do once you're out on the street?",
    "Client: I... I start moving towards home. The streets are a maze of debris and abandoned vehicles. I'm trying to call my wife again, but the networks are down. I... I help a few injured people along the way, but my mind is fixed on getting home.",
    "Therapist: How long does it take you to reach home?",
    "Client: It feels like forever. Hours of climbing over rubble, avoiding downed power lines. When I finally turn onto our street, I... I almost collapse. Our house is still standing, but there's significant damage.",
    "Therapist: What happens when you reach your house?",
    "Client: I... I call out for my wife and daughter. My voice is hoarse from the dust and smoke. For a moment, there's silence, and I feel my world crumbling. Then... then I hear my daughter's voice. They're okay. They're both okay.",
    "Therapist: That must have been an incredibly emotional moment. How do you feel now, remembering it?",
    "Client: I... I'm tearing up. The relief I felt in that moment... it was overwhelming. But also, guilt. So many others weren't as fortunate.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You've been through a lot. Where's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 50. Talking through this... it's helping me process it.",
    "Therapist: You've done an incredible job today. How do you feel about the session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, but also... lighter somehow. Like I've released some of the weight I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's great to hear. We'll end our session here. Remember to use your coping strategies if you feel overwhelmed later. You've made significant progress today.",
    "Client: Thank you. This... this wasn't easy, but I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself. We'll continue working through this in our next session. Take care, Mr. Patel."
