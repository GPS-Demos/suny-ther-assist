    "Therapist: Welcome, James. How are you feeling about our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I'm... I don't know. A bit jittery, I guess. My hands are kind of clammy. I've been thinking about this all week, and it's like my stomach's in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to help you process this. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Just give me a second to take a deep breath.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. When you're ready, close your eyes and bring yourself back to the day of the accident.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm... I'm in my car. It's a sunny afternoon, and I'm driving back from campus. The radio's on, playing some hip-hop track. I remember feeling good, you know? Like, life was going well. I had just aced an exam, and I was heading to meet my girlfriend for dinner.",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: I see... the road stretching out ahead. There are trees lining both sides. The sunlight's filtering through the leaves, creating this dappled pattern on the asphalt. It's beautiful, actually. But then... oh God...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it, James. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I see a car veering into my lane. It's coming fast, too fast. My heart starts racing, and I grip the steering wheel tighter. I try to swerve, but there's not enough time. The sound... the sound is deafening. Metal crunching, glass shattering. It's like the world is exploding around me.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's probably an 8. My palms are sweating, and I can feel my heart pounding.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going. What do you experience next?",
    "Client: Everything's spinning. I taste blood in my mouth. The airbag's deployed, and there's this acrid smell \u2013 burning rubber, maybe? I'm trying to move, but I can't. My leg... oh God, my leg is trapped. I can't feel it. I'm panicking, thinking I might lose my leg.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, James. You're safe now. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I hear sirens in the distance. They're getting louder. People are shouting outside the car, but it all sounds muffled, like I'm underwater. I'm fading in and out of consciousness. Each time I come to, the pain is worse. I'm scared... so scared I might die.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What happens as help arrives?",
    "Client: The firefighters, they're... they're using the jaws of life to cut me out. The sound of metal grinding is terrifying. I feel the car shifting around me. Someone's talking to me, telling me to stay still, that everything will be okay. But I don't believe them. I'm crying, begging them to save my leg.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. My chest feels tight. SUDS is probably a 9.",
    "Therapist: Remember your breathing techniques. Slow, deep breaths. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm breathing. They've got me on a stretcher now. The sunlight hurts my eyes. I catch a glimpse of my leg \u2013 there's so much blood. I'm being loaded into the ambulance. The paramedic is asking me questions, but I can barely focus. The pain is overwhelming. I keep thinking about my girlfriend, wondering if I'll ever see her again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, James. Keep going.",
    "Client: The ride to the hospital is a blur. Lights flashing, sirens wailing. I'm in and out of consciousness. When we arrive, it's chaos. Doctors and nurses everywhere. They're cutting off my clothes, sticking needles in me. Someone's shouting about internal bleeding. I'm terrified. I don't want to die. I don't want to lose my leg. I'm only 20, this can't be happening to me.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I... I can feel my heart racing. My hands are shaking. But... I'm here. I'm safe. SUDS is maybe a 7 now.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're doing great. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I'm being wheeled into surgery. The anesthesiologist is talking to me, but I can barely understand. I'm counting backward from 100, and then... nothing. When I wake up, everything's hazy. The pain is dulled, but it's still there. My girlfriend's by my side, crying. I try to speak, but my throat's so dry. A doctor comes in, starts explaining what happened. Multiple fractures, internal bleeding, but... but I still have my leg. The relief is overwhelming, but so is the realization of how close I came to dying.",
    "Therapist: You've been through so much. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of emotions. Relief, fear, gratitude. My SUDS is down to about a 5. Talking about it... it's hard, but it also feels like I'm regaining some control.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress, James. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Can you tell me three things you see in this room right now?",
    "Client: Um, I see... the painting on the wall, the plant in the corner, and your notepad.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, two things you can hear?",
    "Client: I hear the clock ticking and... traffic outside the window.",
    "Therapist: And one thing you can feel?",
    "Client: I can feel the cushion of the chair I'm sitting on.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Now, let's go back to the hospital. What happened in the days following your surgery?",
    "Client: The next few days were... tough. I was in a lot of pain, even with the medication. Physical therapy was excruciating. I remember the first time they made me try to stand. I was terrified my leg wouldn't support me. It did, but barely. I felt so weak, so helpless. My girlfriend was there every day, but I felt guilty for putting her through this.",
    "Therapist: How did you cope with those feelings?",
    "Client: I... I tried to put on a brave face. But at night, when everyone was gone, I'd often break down. The nightmares were intense \u2013 reliving the crash over and over. I'd wake up in a cold sweat, my heart racing. The nurses were kind, but I felt so alone.",
    "Therapist: That must have been very difficult. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's about a 6. Talking about the aftermath... it's bringing back a lot of emotions.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Take a deep breath. Can you tell me about your progress in the hospital?",
    "Client: Yeah... slowly, I started to improve. Each day, I could walk a little further. The pain began to lessen. But the emotional toll... that was harder to deal with. I kept replaying the accident in my mind, wondering if I could have done something differently. The guilt was overwhelming, even though logically I knew it wasn't my fault.",
    "Therapist: How did you start to work through those feelings?",
    "Client: I... I started talking to a therapist at the hospital. It was hard at first, but it helped. They encouraged me to focus on my recovery, to set small goals each day. Gradually, I started to feel more like myself. But leaving the hospital... that was scary too.",
    "Therapist: Can you elaborate on that?",
    "Client: It was like... stepping back into the real world. I was afraid of getting in a car again. The first time I did, I had a panic attack. My girlfriend had to drive us home. I felt so ashamed, so weak. But she was patient, encouraged me to take it slow.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, thinking about that time?",
    "Client: It's... it's not as intense as before. My SUDS is down to about a 4. Talking about it... it's helping me see how far I've come.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, James. Let's take another grounding moment. Can you name three things you're grateful for right now?",
    "Client: I'm grateful for... my recovery, my girlfriend's support, and... this therapy, actually. It's helping more than I expected.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful. Now, can you tell me about your ongoing recovery at home?",
    "Client: It was... it was a process. Physical therapy was tough, but I was determined. I wanted to get back to my normal life. The nightmares continued for a while, but they became less frequent. Driving was a huge hurdle. I'd get anxious even as a passenger. But slowly, with practice and support, I started driving short distances.",
    "Therapist: How did you manage your anxiety during those drives?",
    "Client: I... I used breathing techniques. Sometimes I'd have to pull over and just breathe for a few minutes. Music helped too \u2013 it distracted me from my thoughts. My girlfriend would often come with me, which made me feel safer.",
    "Therapist: That's great that you found strategies that work for you. How do you feel about driving now?",
    "Client: It's... it's better. I still get nervous sometimes, especially on the road where the accident happened. But I can do it. I'm proud of that progress. My SUDS is down to about a 3 now.",
    "Therapist: You've made incredible progress, James. How has this experience changed you?",
    "Client: It's... it's made me more aware of how fragile life can be. I appreciate things more now \u2013 my health, my relationships. I still struggle sometimes, but I feel stronger. Like I can handle more than I thought I could. And I'm more empathetic towards others who've been through trauma.",
    "Therapist: That's a profound insight. As we wrap up this session, how are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but in a good way. Like I've released something. My SUDS is down to a 2 now. Talking through it all... it's helped me see how far I've come.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today, James. Let's end with a relaxation exercise..."
