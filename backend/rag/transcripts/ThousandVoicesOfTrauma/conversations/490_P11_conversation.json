    "Therapist: How are you feeling after today's imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Going through that memory again, it's like I was right back there in that moment. The sounds, the smells, the fear... it all felt so real.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The noise. The deafening explosion and then... the eerie silence that followed. It's like time stood still for a moment. I could smell the burning metal and feel the heat on my skin. I remember thinking, \"This is it. I'm not going to make it.\"",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. My heart was racing, and I felt this tightness in my chest. I wanted to run away, to escape, but I knew I had to stay with it. It's strange, though. As terrifying as it was, there's a part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe a little stronger for having gone through it again?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. Can you say more about that?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... I've been avoiding these memories for so long, thinking they'd break me if I let them in. But going through it here, with you... it's still awful, but I'm starting to realize that maybe I can handle it. Maybe I'm stronger than I thought.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. How does this connect to your day-to-day life?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe it means I don't have to be so afraid all the time? Like, if I can face this memory here, maybe I can start facing other things too. The nightmares, the anxiety when I hear loud noises... Maybe I don't have to let them control me so much.",
    "Therapist: Excellent observation. What's one small step you could take?",
    "Client: Hmm... Maybe I could try going to the park with my husband this weekend. I've been avoiding open spaces, but... maybe I could give it a try. Just for a little while.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great idea. How are you feeling about continuing with these exposures?",
    "Client: It's scary, I won't lie. But I think... I think I'm ready to keep going. I want my life back, you know? I'm tired of feeling trapped by these memories and fears. If this can help me get there, then I want to keep trying.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is admirable. Any final thoughts about today's session?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I guess. For being here with me through this. It's not easy, but... I feel like I'm finally starting to see a glimmer of hope. Like maybe, just maybe, I can get through this and come out stronger on the other side.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work. We'll continue next time. Take care."
