    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken up, to be honest. It's always hard to go back to those moments, you know? Reliving the violence I witnessed as a child, it just brings up so many emotions. I can still hear the shouting, the crashes... (voice trembles) It's like I'm right there again.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most?",
    "Client: (deep breath) The fear. It was overwhelming. I remember hiding in my closet, trying to make myself as small as possible. I thought if I could just disappear, everything would be okay. But the sounds... they still reached me. I felt so helpless, so... alone.",
    "Therapist: How does that connect to now?",
    "Client: (pauses) I guess... I still feel that way sometimes. Like I'm that scared little girl again. When there's conflict at work or even a disagreement with my husband, I feel this urge to hide, to make myself small. It's frustrating because I'm an adult now, I should be able to handle these things, right?",
    "Therapist: It's a normal response. How else?",
    "Client: Well, I've noticed I'm always on edge, always waiting for something bad to happen. It's exhausting. And I think it affects my relationships. I have a hard time trusting people fully, even my husband sometimes. I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop, you know?",
    "Therapist: That makes sense. What's different now?",
    "Client: (thoughtfully) I suppose... I'm not actually in danger anymore. I have control over my life now. I'm not that helpless child anymore. It's just... it's hard to really believe that sometimes, to feel it in my bones.",
    "Therapist: That's insightful. What else?",
    "Client: I think... I'm starting to see how these experiences shaped me. My need for control, my anxiety... it all stems from feeling so out of control back then. But I'm also realizing that I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. I survived that, didn't I? Maybe I can face these fears now too.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How can you use this?",
    "Client: (nods slowly) I think... maybe I need to remind myself more often that I'm safe now. When I feel that urge to hide or when I'm feeling anxious, I can try to ground myself in the present. Remind myself that I have resources and support now that I didn't have then. And maybe... maybe I can be a little kinder to myself when these feelings come up.",
    "Therapist: Great insights. Next steps?",
    "Client: I want to keep working on this. It's hard, but I can feel it helping. I think I need to practice recognizing when I'm slipping into those old patterns of fear and avoidance. And maybe... maybe I can try opening up a bit more to my husband about this. He's always been supportive, but I've kept a lot of this inside.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a solid plan. Anything else?",
    "Client: (smiles slightly) Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm starting to see a path forward. I'm nervous about what's to come, but also... hopeful? Yeah, I think that's the word. Hopeful.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going."
