    "Therapist: Hello Sarah, how are you feeling today?",
    "Client: Hi Dr. Adams. I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about what we're going to do today. I've been thinking about it a lot since our last session.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... I'm not sure I'm ready to talk about my experience in the hospital. Every time I think about it, my heart starts racing, and I feel like I can't breathe. I'm worried that if we discuss it in detail, I might have a panic attack or something.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate your honesty. Let's address those fears.",
    "Client: Okay... I mean, I know you said this is supposed to help, but it feels counterintuitive. Like, won't talking about it make everything worse? I've been trying so hard to forget about what happened.",
    "Therapist: That's a common concern. How about we discuss the purpose of this exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I'd really like to understand why we're doing this.",
    "Therapist: Imaginal exposure helps process traumatic memories. It can reduce PTSD symptoms over time.",
    "Client: I see. But how does reliving it help? Won't it just make me more anxious?",
    "Therapist: Initially, it might increase anxiety. But with repetition, the memory's power diminishes.",
    "Client: That makes sense, I guess. It's just... the thought of going back there, even in my mind, is terrifying. I was so scared and in so much pain. I thought I was going to die.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. We'll go at your pace and pause if needed.",
    "Client: Thank you, that's reassuring. Can you tell me more about what exactly we'll be doing? What should I expect?",
    "Therapist: You'll describe the traumatic event in detail. I'll guide you through it supportively.",
    "Client: Okay. And what if I start panicking or can't continue?",
    "Therapist: We can take breaks or stop anytime. Your safety is my priority.",
    "Client: That's good to know. I'm still nervous, but I think I'm ready to try. Or at least, I want to be ready. This has been affecting my life so much - my studies, my relationships. I just want to feel normal again.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. This is a significant step towards healing.",
    "Client: Thank you. I really hope this works. I'm tired of feeling like this all the time. One more question - will we be doing this every session from now on?",
    "Therapist: We'll do it regularly, but not every session. We'll also work on other coping strategies.",
    "Client: Okay, that sounds good. I appreciate you explaining everything to me. It helps me feel more prepared. I think... I think I'm ready to start whenever you are.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's begin. Remember, you're safe here. Start when you're ready."
