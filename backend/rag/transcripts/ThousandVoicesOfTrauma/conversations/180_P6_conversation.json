    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Singh. Today we'll be doing an imaginal exposure exercise. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control. Let's start with your SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10. I'm anxious, but not overwhelmed yet.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and describe the memory of losing your wife.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) It was a Tuesday morning. I remember the sunlight streaming through the curtains. Priya, my wife, she... she wasn't waking up. I reached out to touch her hand, and it was so cold. I... I couldn't believe it. My heart started racing, and I felt like I couldn't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. I'm reliving that panic, that disbelief. It's... it's hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. I can feel my palms getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Keep going. What happened next?",
    "Client: I... I called for help, but I knew it was too late. The paramedics arrived, and they tried to revive her, but... (voice breaks) I just stood there, frozen. I couldn't process what was happening. It felt like the world was ending.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm shaking a bit. My throat feels tight, like I'm choking on the words.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. I can feel the grief washing over me again.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) After they pronounced her dead, I just... collapsed. I couldn't stop crying. Our children arrived, and seeing their faces... it made it all so real. I felt like I'd failed her somehow, like I should have known something was wrong.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My shoulders are tense, and I feel this heaviness in my chest. It's like I'm carrying all that grief again.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Still an 8. It's not getting worse, but it's not better either.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're handling this well. What happened after that?",
    "Client: The next few days were a blur. Planning the funeral, dealing with paperwork... I felt numb. But at night, when I was alone in our bed, the pain would hit me so hard. I'd wake up reaching for her, only to remember she wasn't there.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I can feel tears in my eyes. My throat is tight, and I'm having trouble swallowing.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. What's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe a 7 now. Talking about it... it hurts, but it's also a relief somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing the memory. Keep going.",
    "Client: The hardest part was facing our friends and family at the funeral. Everyone kept saying how strong I was, but inside, I felt like I was falling apart. I couldn't imagine life without her. We'd been together for 45 years, and suddenly... she was gone.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: I feel... sad, but also grateful for the time we had. My chest doesn't feel as tight anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's progress. What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's down to a 5. I still feel the pain, but it's not overwhelming me like before.",
    "Therapist: You're doing excellent work. Let's continue for a few more minutes.",
    "Client: Okay. In the months after, I struggled to find purpose. Our house felt so empty. I'd find myself talking to her, expecting a response. The silence was deafening. But slowly, with the help of our children and grandchildren, I started to find moments of joy again. It still hurts, but I'm learning to carry her memory with me in a different way.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter somehow. Like I've shared some of the burden.",
    "Therapist: And your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's a 4 again. I'm tired, but... okay.",
