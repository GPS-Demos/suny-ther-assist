    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, John?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving that moment when I heard about my brother's death at the hands of the police... it's like I'm right back there, you know? I can feel the shock, the disbelief, the anger... it's all so raw again.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. I keep replaying the moment I got that phone call. I was at work, and suddenly my whole world just... shattered. I remember thinking, \"This can't be happening. Not to us, not to him.\" It's like I was frozen in time, you know?",
    "Therapist: How did your body react during the memory?",
    "Client: My heart was racing, and I felt this tightness in my chest. My hands were shaking, just like they did that day. It's crazy how vivid it all still is, even after all this time.",
    "Therapist: Those physical reactions are common. How are you coping now?",
    "Client: It's... it's tough. I'm trying to use those breathing exercises we talked about, but sometimes it feels like it's not enough. The anger and the sadness, they're just so intense. I keep thinking about how unfair it all is, how my brother's life was just... taken. And for what?",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. What helps you get through?",
    "Client: Talking about it, I guess. Like this. And... remembering the good times with my brother. It's hard, but it also brings some comfort. I've been trying to focus on the positive memories, you know? But then I feel guilty, like I'm not honoring his death properly.",
    "Therapist: That's a common struggle. How else has this affected you?",
    "Client: It's changed everything. I find it hard to trust authority now. I'm always on edge, especially around police. And I worry constantly about my own kids, about their safety. It's like this constant cloud hanging over me.",
    "Therapist: How does that relate to your depression?",
    "Client: I guess... it's all connected. The loss, the fear, the anger - it all feeds into this deep sadness. Some days, it's hard to even get out of bed. I feel like I'm letting my family down, you know? My partner tries to understand, but... it's not easy.",
    "Therapist: You're working hard. What progress have you noticed?",
    "Client: Well, I'm here, talking about it. That's something, right? And... I've started volunteering at a community center. It helps, being around people who understand. Sometimes, I can even talk about my brother without breaking down. That feels like progress.",
    "Therapist: It absolutely is. What's your takeaway from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I'm realizing that it's okay to feel all these emotions. They're part of the process, right? And maybe, just maybe, by facing them head-on like this, I can start to heal. It's not easy, but... I want to keep trying. For my brother, for my family, for myself.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How will you care for yourself today?",
    "Client: I think I'll call my partner, maybe go for a walk together. And I'll try to do something that reminds me of my brother - maybe listen to his favorite music. It hurts, but it also helps, you know?",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a good plan. Remember, you're not alone in this.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I really appreciate that. Sometimes it feels like no one understands, but... being here, talking like this, it helps. It really does. I just hope I can keep this strength going when I leave here.",
    "Therapist: You're showing remarkable resilience. What's your focus for next time?",
    "Client: I want to work on managing those sudden flashbacks better. They catch me off guard sometimes, especially when I see news about police brutality. Maybe we could talk about more coping strategies?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll address that next session. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm finally starting to see a way forward. It's slow, and it hurts, but... I'm not giving up. I can't. For my brother's memory, for my family, I have to keep going.",
    "Therapist: You're doing important work, John. Take care until next time."
