    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's perfectly normal. Let's begin. Close your eyes and recall the car accident.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in the car with my wife, Maria. We're driving home from our grandson's birthday party. It's a warm evening, and we're chatting about how big he's getting. The radio is playing softly in the background. I remember feeling... happy.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 3. I'm a little tense, but okay.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue, please.",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud screeching noise. I turn my head and see headlights coming straight at us. I yell, \"Maria!\" and try to swerve, but it's too late. There's a deafening crash, and everything goes black for a moment. When I come to, there's glass everywhere. I can smell gasoline and... and blood. I turn to Maria, and she's... she's not moving. I reach out to touch her, but my arm won't move. I'm trapped, and I can't help her. I... I can hear sirens in the distance, but they sound so far away...",
    "Therapist: Carlos, what's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 7. My heart is racing, and I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) Okay. I... I remember the paramedics arriving. They're asking me questions, but I can barely focus. All I can think about is Maria. They're working on her, but I can't see what's happening. I'm trying to call out to her, but no sound comes out. I feel so helpless, so scared...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now? What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. My chest feels tight, and I can feel tears in my eyes.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Carlos. Remember, you're here with me, and you're safe.",
    "Client: (nods) The next thing I remember is being in the hospital. A doctor comes to tell me that Maria... that she didn't make it. I feel like the world is crumbling around me. How could this happen? We were just laughing together, and now she's gone. I keep thinking, if only I had reacted faster, if only we had left the party earlier...",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I feel overwhelmed with grief and guilt.",
    "Therapist: I hear how painful this is. You're very brave for facing these memories.",
    "Client: (voice breaking) I miss her so much. Every day, I wake up and for a split second, I forget she's gone. Then it all comes crashing back. The silence in our home is deafening. I keep expecting to hear her voice, to see her smile. But she's not there, and it's all because of that one terrible moment.",
    "Therapist: Carlos, how are you feeling now? What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's still a 9. I feel like I'm right back in that moment of loss.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) The days after the accident are a blur. Our children came to help with arrangements, but I felt so detached from everything. I couldn't believe I was planning Maria's funeral. We were supposed to grow old together, watch our grandchildren grow up. Now, I'm alone, and I don't know how to move forward without her.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down a bit. Maybe a 7 now. I feel drained, but talking about it... it helps somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress, Carlos. How about we start wrapping up?",
    "Client: Okay. (opens eyes slowly) That was... intense. But I feel like a weight has lifted a little.",
    "Therapist: You did wonderfully. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... lighter. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Carlos. We'll end here for today."
