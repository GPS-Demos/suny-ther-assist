    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like my whole body is vibrating. The memory of witnessing that violence, it's... it's so vivid now. I can still hear the shouting, the crash of objects breaking. My heart is racing, and I feel this tightness in my chest.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt in that moment. I was just a child, and I couldn't do anything to stop it. I... I remember wanting to disappear, to become invisible. There's this overwhelming sense of shame, like maybe I should have done something, anything. But I was so scared.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to have felt that way. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: My hands are clammy, and I feel a bit nauseous. It's like I'm right back there, you know? I can smell the alcohol on his breath, see the fear in my mother's eyes. God, I haven't thought about this in years, but it's all so clear now. I'm... I'm struggling with feeling angry too. Angry at him, angry at the situation, angry at myself for not being able to protect her.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a fire in my stomach. Hot and intense. My jaw is clenched, and I want to... I don't know, punch something? But at the same time, I feel this deep sadness. It's almost suffocating. I'm realizing how much this experience has affected me, how it's shaped so many of my relationships and reactions over the years.",
    "Therapist: That's a profound insight. What else are you noticing about your reactions?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm surprised by how vivid the memory is, but also by how I'm able to talk about it now. It's still painful, but it feels different. Like I'm observing it from a distance, if that makes sense? There's a part of me that feels stronger, like I'm finally facing this head-on instead of running from it.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant shift. How does it feel to be addressing this memory directly?",
    "Client: It's... it's both terrifying and liberating. I've spent so long trying to push these memories away, but now that I'm confronting them, it's like a weight is lifting. Don't get me wrong, it's still incredibly difficult. I feel exhausted, emotionally drained. But there's also this tiny spark of... hope? Like maybe I can work through this, maybe I'm not defined by what happened.",
    "Therapist: That spark of hope is important. What else are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... vulnerable, I guess. Talking about this, reliving it, it's bringing up all these insecurities. I'm worried about how this affects my relationships now, especially with my partner. Do I push people away because of this? Am I too guarded? It's making me question a lot about myself.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How do you see this experience influencing your current relationships?",
    "Client: I... I think I've always had trouble trusting people fully. I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop, you know? In arguments, I tend to shut down or get defensive really quickly. I realize now that it's probably because those moments remind me of the violence I witnessed. It's like I'm always on guard, always ready for things to turn bad.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful connection you've made. What else?",
    "Client: I'm also recognizing how much anxiety this has caused me over the years. The constant vigilance, always scanning for potential threats. It's exhausting. But now, talking about it, I'm starting to see how it's not serving me anymore. I don't need to be on high alert all the time. That realization is... it's both scary and freeing.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to have that realization?",
    "Client: It's... overwhelming, to be honest. There's a part of me that feels excited about the possibility of change, of not being controlled by this fear anymore. But there's also a part that's terrified. What if I can't change? What if I'm too broken? And then I feel guilty for even thinking about myself when my mother went through so much worse.",
    "Therapist: It's common to have mixed feelings. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I... I think I need some time to process all of this. It's a lot to take in. But I also feel like I need... support? Not just here in therapy, but in my daily life. I've kept this part of me hidden for so long, and now that it's out in the open, I feel... exposed. But also, maybe, ready to start healing? I don't know. It's all so confusing.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. How can we support you in this process?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need help learning how to open up to my partner about this. And maybe some strategies for managing the anxiety when it comes up. I want to work on not letting these past experiences control my present so much. It's scary, but I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: That's a courageous step. Is there anything else you want to share?",
    "Client: I... I just want to say thank you. For listening, for guiding me through this. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. And while it's still incredibly painful, I feel... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like maybe I can face this after all. It's a small step, but it feels significant.",
    "Therapist: You've shown tremendous strength today. How would you like to close our session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to take a few deep breaths. To ground myself back in the present. And maybe... maybe we could end with a reminder that I'm safe now? That what I experienced is in the past? I know it logically, but after reliving it so vividly, I think I need to hear it.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's do that together."
