    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. Going through that memory of losing my grandmother... it brought up so many emotions I thought I'd buried.",
    "Therapist: What stood out to you?",
    "Client: The smell of her house. I hadn't thought about that in years. It was like... cinnamon and old books. And her voice... I could hear it so clearly. It's strange how vivid it all was.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How did it feel to experience that?",
    "Client: It was... intense. I felt like a child again, you know? Scared and helpless. But also... there was this warmth. Like I was wrapped in her love one last time. It's confusing.",
    "Therapist: Confusing how?",
    "Client: Well, I've spent so long trying not to think about her death. Using substances to numb the pain. But now, remembering her... it hurts, but it's also... comforting? Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. What else?",
    "Client: I realized how much her loss affected me. I think... I think that's when I started pushing people away. Afraid to get close, you know? It's like I've been running ever since.",
    "Therapist: How does that connect to your current struggles?",
    "Client: Oh, wow. I guess... my relationship issues, the substance use... it all traces back to that fear of loss. I've been so scared of feeling that pain again that I've been avoiding real connections.",
    "Therapist: I see. What do you think about that?",
    "Client: It's... eye-opening. And a bit scary. I've been living my life around this fear for so long. But also... it feels like maybe there's hope? Like understanding this might help me change.",
    "Therapist: That's insightful. How might you use this understanding?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I need to start opening up more. To my partner, to friends. And... maybe it's time to really face my grief instead of running from it. It's terrifying, but... necessary?",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a big step. How do you feel about that?",
    "Client: Anxious, definitely. But also... determined? For the first time in a long time, I feel like I have a direction. Like I understand myself a bit better.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I want to keep doing these exposures. They're hard, but... I think they're helping. And maybe... maybe it's time to talk to my partner about all this. Share what I'm going through.",
    "Therapist: That sounds brave. Anything else?",
    "Client: Yeah, I... I think I want to visit my grandmother's grave. I've been avoiding it for years, but... maybe it's time to say a proper goodbye.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about today's session?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... good? Like I've done something important. Thank you for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I think it's worth it.",
    "Therapist: You've done well. Ready to wrap up?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. It's a lot to process, but... I'm glad we did this. Same time next week?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Take care."
