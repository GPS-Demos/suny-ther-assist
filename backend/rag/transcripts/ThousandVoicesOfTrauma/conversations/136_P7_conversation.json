    "Therapist: Welcome, Leilani. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I know we're going to be talking about some difficult experiences, and I'm not sure if I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We'll take it step by step.",
    "Client: Okay, I'll try. It's just... thinking about those times at university, when I was bullied because of my ethnicity, it still hurts so much.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Can you tell me more?",
    "Client: Well, it started in my first year. I was so excited to be there, you know? But from day one, I felt like an outsider. Some students would make comments about my accent, or ask if I knew how to use a computer because I'm from the Pacific Islands. It was subtle at first, but it got worse.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: There was this group of girls in my dorm. They'd mimic the way I spoke, laugh at my traditional clothing when I wore it. One time, they put a lei on the door of my room with a note saying \"Go back to your island.\" I felt so humiliated and alone.",
    "Therapist: That must have been very painful. You're brave for sharing this.",
    "Client: It was. I started avoiding common areas, eating alone in my room. I'd wake up dreading going to class, wondering what comments I'd hear that day. My grades started slipping because I couldn't concentrate. I felt like I didn't belong anywhere.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... angry. And sad. Like a weight on my chest. Why did they have to be so cruel? I was just trying to get an education, to make something of myself.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: There was this one day that really stands out. We had a group project, and no one wanted to work with me. The professor had to assign me to a group, and they made it clear they didn't want me there. They'd speak over me in meetings, ignore my ideas. During our presentation, one of them \"jokingly\" introduced me as the \"token diversity member\" of the group. Everyone laughed. I wanted to disappear.",
    "Therapist: That's incredibly hurtful. You're doing great sharing this.",
    "Client: I ran out of the classroom and cried in the bathroom for hours. I called my mom, wanting to quit and come home. She encouraged me to stay, to be strong, but she didn't understand how isolating and painful it was. I felt like I was drowning.",
    "Therapist: You're very resilient. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm shaking a bit. My heart is racing. It's like I'm back there, feeling all that pain and shame again. But... I also feel a bit lighter, like sharing this is releasing some of the pressure I've been carrying.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're doing wonderfully.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to talk about, but I think I need to. I've carried this for so long, feeling like I didn't deserve to be there, like I wasn't good enough. It's affected every part of my life since then. My confidence, my relationships, my career choices. I'm always waiting for the next insult, the next rejection.",
    "Therapist: You're very insightful. Can you tell me more?",
    "Client: I guess... I've always felt like an outsider since then. Even now, as an adult, I struggle to connect with people. I'm always second-guessing myself, wondering if they're judging me because of my background. It's exhausting, always being on guard. And it makes me so angry sometimes, that those experiences stole so much from me.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. You're doing great work here.",
    "Client: I think that's why I went back to school now, in my 40s. I want to reclaim what was taken from me. But it's scary. Sometimes I sit in class and I'm right back in that first year, feeling small and out of place. But I'm trying to push through it. I want to prove to myself that I belong, that I'm capable.",
    "Therapist: That shows incredible strength. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also a bit proud. Talking about this is hard, but I'm doing it. And maybe, just maybe, by facing these memories, I can start to heal from them. I want to move forward without this weight holding me back.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You've shown great courage today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think I need a moment to breathe. This has been intense, but I'm glad we're doing this work. I want to understand how these experiences have shaped me and learn how to not let them control me anymore. It's a long road, but I'm ready to walk it.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. We'll end here for today. Well done."
