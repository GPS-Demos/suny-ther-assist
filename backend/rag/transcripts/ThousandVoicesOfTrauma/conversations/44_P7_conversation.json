    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and take a deep breath.",
    "Client: Okay, I'm closing my eyes. I feel a bit nervous.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I'm remembering that day... I had just posted a selfie on Instagram. I thought I looked nice, you know? But then the notifications started coming in. At first, I was excited, thinking people liked my photo. But as I opened the app, my stomach dropped. There were so many cruel comments. They were calling me ugly, fat, saying I should kill myself. I couldn't believe it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I felt like I couldn't breathe. My hands were shaking as I scrolled through the comments. Some people I knew in real life were joining in, laughing at me. I felt so alone, so exposed. I wanted to disappear.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I... I remember running to the bathroom. I was crying so hard I could barely see. I looked in the mirror and all I could think was, \"They're right. I am ugly.\" I felt worthless, like I didn't deserve to exist. I wanted to hurt myself.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're brave for sharing this.",
    "Client: I sat on the bathroom floor for hours, just sobbing. My phone kept buzzing with more notifications, but I was too scared to look. I felt like my whole world was crumbling. I couldn't face going to school the next day. How could I, when everyone had seen those comments?",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I'm sorry, this is really hard. I feel like I'm back there again.",
    "Therapist: That's alright. Take a deep breath. You're here now.",
    "Client: Okay... I remember feeling so betrayed. These were people I thought were my friends. But they were tearing me apart online for everyone to see. I felt like I could never trust anyone again. I wanted to delete all my social media, change schools, just disappear completely.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The worst part was feeling like I had no one to turn to. I was too ashamed to tell my parents. I thought they wouldn't understand or would just tell me to ignore it. But I couldn't ignore it. It was all I could think about. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw those comments. I felt worthless, unlovable.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I started having nightmares about it. In my dreams, I was surrounded by faceless people all pointing and laughing at me. I'd wake up in a cold sweat, heart racing. Even now, talking about it, I can feel my heart pounding.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Keep going.",
    "Client: For weeks after, I couldn't eat properly. I lost weight, which only made me feel worse because I thought people would notice and make more comments. I started skipping classes, avoiding everyone. My grades started slipping. I felt like I was drowning and no one could see me struggling.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're handling this bravely.",
    "Client: I started drinking to numb the pain. It was the only way I could fall asleep without having nightmares. I knew it wasn't healthy, but I didn't care. I just wanted to stop feeling so awful all the time. I felt like I was losing myself.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to acknowledge these feelings. You're safe now.",
    "Client: Sometimes, I still have moments where I see a notification on my phone and I freeze, terrified it's going to be another cruel comment. It's like I can't escape that fear, even years later. I struggle to post anything online now, always second-guessing myself, wondering if I'm setting myself up for more ridicule.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Talking about it brings back a lot of those feelings, but also... I feel a bit lighter? Like I'm not carrying it all alone anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive step. You've done well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard, but I think it helps to talk about it. I want to learn how to move past this and not let it control me anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent goal. We'll work on that together."
