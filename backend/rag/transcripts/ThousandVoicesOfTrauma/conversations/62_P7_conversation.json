    "Therapist: Welcome back, Mr. Patel. Are you ready to continue our imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I suppose so, though I'm feeling a bit anxious about revisiting those memories again.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Yes, I know. It's just... every time I think about that night, my heart starts racing. I can still hear the shouting, the sound of glass breaking. My son was only 10 at the time, and I remember how terrified he looked, hiding behind me as we watched my daughter-in-law being struck by my eldest son.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The worst part was feeling so helpless. I wanted to intervene, to protect her, but I was frozen. The look in my son's eyes... it was like he was possessed. I'd never seen such rage before. And my poor granddaughter was wailing in the next room, but no one was attending to her.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I can smell the curry we had for dinner. It's still on the stove, forgotten in the chaos. The scent is mixing with the metallic smell of blood from my daughter-in-law's split lip. I feel sick to my stomach, but I can't move.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: My hands are shaking. I want to reach for the phone, to call for help, but I'm afraid it will make things worse. I can hear my wife sobbing quietly beside me. She's clutching my arm so tightly it hurts, but I barely notice the pain. All I can focus on is the scene unfolding before me.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I don't know if I can continue. The guilt is overwhelming. I should have done something, anything. But I just stood there, watching as my family fell apart.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... I remember my daughter-in-law finally breaking free and running towards us. She was crying, begging us to help her. And I... I just stood there, paralyzed. My son was shouting at her to come back, threatening her. The look of betrayal in her eyes when she realized we weren't going to do anything... it haunts me to this day.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel ashamed, angry at myself. My chest feels tight, and I'm having trouble breathing. It's like I'm right back there, in that moment, failing my family all over again.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here now. You're safe.",
    "Client: Yes, you're right. I'm here now. (Takes another deep breath) I remember the sound of sirens in the distance. Someone must have called the police. My son suddenly seemed to snap out of his rage. He looked confused, almost scared. And then he ran out of the house. We didn't see him for days after that.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job. Keep going.",
    "Client: The aftermath was almost worse than the incident itself. The shame, the whispers from neighbors, the pitying looks. Our family was never the same after that night. My daughter-in-law left with the children, and I don't blame her. But I miss them terribly. I keep thinking about all the things I could have done differently, how I could have prevented this from happening.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those thoughts. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. Sad. But also, oddly, a bit lighter. Like sharing this burden has lifted some of the weight off my shoulders. I've carried this guilt for so long, never really talking about it with anyone.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It still hurts, but maybe... maybe it's a step towards healing. I just wish I could go back and change things, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's been so long since that night, but sometimes it feels like it just happened yesterday. I wonder if I'll ever truly be able to forgive myself for not doing more.",
    "Therapist: Self-forgiveness is a process. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I hope so. I want to be able to think about my grandchildren without this cloud of guilt hanging over me. I want to be the grandfather they deserve, even if it's from a distance now. Do you think that's possible?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Your commitment to healing shows great potential.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'm grateful for your guidance through this. It's not easy, but I'm starting to see that maybe, just maybe, I can learn to live with what happened without letting it consume me. I want to be able to remember the good times with my family too, not just this one terrible night.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent goal. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. I feel emotionally drained, but also... hopeful? Is that strange?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a positive sign. Take care, Mr. Patel."
