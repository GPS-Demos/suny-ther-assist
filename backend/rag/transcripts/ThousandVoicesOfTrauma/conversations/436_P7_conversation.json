    "Therapist: Welcome, John. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about this session, to be honest.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We're here to support you.",
    "Client: Thanks. I've been thinking a lot about what happened with my son... the cyberbullying. It's been really hard to process.",
    "Therapist: I see. Are you ready to explore that memory?",
    "Client: I think so. Where should I start?",
    "Therapist: Begin with the moment you first realized something was wrong.",
    "Client: Okay... It was a Friday evening. I came home from work, and I could tell something was off. My son, Tim, he was usually so lively, but that day he was just... quiet. I found him in his room, staring at his computer screen. He looked... devastated.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: I asked him what was wrong, and he just... broke down. He showed me his social media accounts. There were these horrible messages, doctored photos... It was relentless. Kids from his school, they were... they were tearing him apart online. Calling him names, spreading rumors... I felt so helpless.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I didn't know what to do. I felt like I'd failed him somehow. Like I should have protected him better. He was suffering, and I hadn't even noticed. What kind of father does that make me?",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I remember holding him as he cried. He kept asking why they hated him so much. And I... I didn't have an answer. I felt so angry at those kids, at the school for not doing enough, at myself for not seeing it sooner. But mostly, I felt this overwhelming sadness. My boy was hurting, and I couldn't fix it.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The next few weeks were a blur. We reported it to the school, but they seemed more concerned about their reputation than helping Tim. We tried to get him to talk to a counselor, but he shut down. He stopped eating properly, barely left his room. It was like watching him fade away, and I felt so... powerless.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. You're doing fine.",
    "Client: Then came that awful night... I woke up around 2 AM, something just felt wrong. I went to check on Tim, and... and... (voice breaks) he wasn't in his bed. I found him in the bathroom. He had... he had tried to... (starts crying)",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (takes a shaky breath) He had tried to kill himself. There was so much blood... I called an ambulance, but those minutes waiting felt like hours. I kept thinking, 'This is it. I've lost him.' And it was all because of some cruel kids hiding behind screens.",
    "Therapist: You're being very brave. Keep going.",
    "Client: The hospital was a nightmare. Waiting to hear if he'd be okay, trying to understand how we'd gotten to this point. When they finally let us see him, he looked so small, so fragile in that hospital bed. I felt like I'd failed him all over again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained. Angry. Scared. It's been months, but talking about it, it feels like it just happened. I still have nightmares about finding him like that.",
    "Therapist: That's completely normal. You're processing a lot.",
    "Client: I know he's doing better now, but I can't shake this fear that it could happen again. Every time he's quiet or seems upset, I panic. I'm constantly checking his phone, his computer. I know it's not healthy, but I can't help it.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to feel protective. You're coping as best you can.",
    "Client: I just... I wish I could go back and change things. See the signs earlier, do more to help him. The guilt is overwhelming sometimes. And the anger... I'm so angry at those kids, at the school, at the whole system that lets this happen.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's... it's hard to talk about, but I know I need to. I want to be there for Tim, to help him heal. But how can I do that when I'm still struggling so much myself?",
    "Therapist: You're taking important steps by being here. That's commendable.",
    "Client: I suppose you're right. It's just... it's a long road ahead. Sometimes I wonder if things will ever feel normal again.",
    "Therapist: Healing takes time. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I hope so. I really do. For Tim's sake, and for our whole family. We've been through so much... I just want us to be okay again.",
    "Therapist: Your dedication is admirable. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Exhausted, honestly. But also... maybe a little lighter? Talking about it, as hard as it is, does help somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. You've done well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I know we're out of time, but... is it okay if we continue this next session? There's still so much to process.",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll pick up where we left off.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your support through all of this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, John. Take care until next time."
