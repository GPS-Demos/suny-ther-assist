    "Therapist: Today, we'll be starting imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about that?",
    "Client: Honestly, I'm a bit nervous. I've been dreading this part of the therapy. The idea of reliving that night... it's terrifying. I've spent so long trying to forget it all.",
    "Therapist: Your apprehension is understandable. Can you tell me more about your concerns?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... I've worked so hard to push those memories away. I'm worried that bringing them back up will undo all the progress I've made. What if I can't handle it? What if it makes everything worse? I mean, I'm already struggling with depression, and this feels like it could push me over the edge.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How do you think revisiting might help?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. I guess maybe it could help me process what happened? But it's hard to see how reliving such a traumatic experience could be beneficial. It feels counterintuitive, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. How about we discuss the purpose behind this exercise?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I think that would help. I need to understand why we're doing this if I'm going to go through with it. It's just so scary to think about facing those memories head-on.",
    "Therapist: The goal is to process the memory safely, reducing its power over time. What are your thoughts on that?",
    "Client: I suppose that makes sense. It's like... facing your fears, right? But it's hard to imagine that memory ever losing its grip on me. It's been controlling my life for so long. How can reliving it possibly make it less powerful?",
    "Therapist: By revisiting in a safe environment, we can work through the emotions attached to the memory.",
    "Client: I see. So, it's not just about remembering, but about processing it differently? That's... a little less frightening, I guess. But what if I panic during the exercise? What if I can't handle it?",
    "Therapist: We'll go at your pace. You're in control, and we can pause anytime. How does that sound?",
    "Client: That's reassuring. Knowing I have some control helps. I'm still nervous, but... I think I'm willing to try. Can you tell me more about what to expect during the exercise?",
    "Therapist: You'll describe the event in detail. I'll guide you through it, supporting you throughout.",
    "Client: Okay. And you'll be there the whole time? I'm worried about getting lost in the memory and not being able to find my way back out.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. I'll be here, grounding you in the present. You're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. That means a lot. I'm still scared, but I'm also... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful? If this could help me move past what happened, it might be worth it. I'm tired of letting that night control my life.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. This is a significant step towards healing. Ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. Yes. I'm ready. Let's do this before I lose my nerve. Just... please be patient with me if I struggle. This isn't easy for me.",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll take it slow. Your bravery will help you heal. Shall we start?"
