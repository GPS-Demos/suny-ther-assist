    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mr. Hernandez?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. It's like I'm right back there, you know? The screeching tires, the smell of burnt rubber... it's all so vivid. My heart is racing, and I can feel this tightness in my chest. It's hard to catch my breath.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: It's... it's the guilt. I keep thinking, if I had just left the house five minutes later, or if I had taken a different route... maybe my wife would still be here. I see her face, Dr. Thompson. The way she looked at me right before the impact. She was so scared, and I couldn't do anything to protect her. I was supposed to protect her.",
    "Therapist: How does that thought make you feel?",
    "Client: Helpless. Completely and utterly helpless. And angry. I'm angry at myself, at the other driver, at the world. It's not fair. We had plans, you know? We were going to travel, spend time with our grandkids. Now, I'm alone in this assisted living place, and she's... she's gone. It's like a part of me died with her that day.",
    "Therapist: I hear your pain. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I... I can feel this heaviness in my body. It's like I'm carrying around this enormous weight. And there's this constant knot in my stomach. Sometimes, I wake up in the middle of the night, and for a split second, I forget. I reach out for her, and when I realize she's not there... it's like losing her all over again.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with those moments?",
    "Client: I try to remember the good times. We had 52 years together, you know? But it's hard. The accident... it overshadows everything. I see flashes of it everywhere. A car horn honking, and suddenly I'm back in that intersection. It's exhausting, Dr. Thompson. I'm so tired of feeling this way.",
    "Therapist: What do you think this fatigue is telling you?",
    "Client: I... I think it's telling me that I need to let go. But I don't know how. It feels like if I let go of this pain, I'm letting go of her. And I'm not ready for that. I don't think I'll ever be ready for that. How do you move on when half of you is missing?",
    "Therapist: That's a profound question. What comes to mind when you think about moving forward?",
    "Client: Fear. Mostly fear. I'm afraid of forgetting her voice, her laugh. I'm afraid of what life looks like without her. But there's also... I don't know if I should say this... there's a tiny part of me that feels... relief? And then I feel guilty for feeling relieved. It's like I'm betraying her memory.",
    "Therapist: Can you tell me more about that relief?",
    "Client: It's... it's the idea that maybe, someday, it won't hurt this much. That I won't have to relive that moment every time I close my eyes. But then I think, what kind of husband am I if I don't carry this pain? If I don't suffer for her? She suffered. She died. And I'm still here, thinking about feeling better. It doesn't seem right.",
    "Therapist: How do you think your wife would feel about your healing?",
    "Client: I... I never thought about it that way. Maria, she... she always put others first. She would want me to be happy, I think. But it's so hard to imagine being happy without her. It feels impossible. Like trying to breathe underwater.",
    "Therapist: What small step could you take towards healing?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Maybe... maybe I could start looking at our photo albums again? I've been avoiding them. But perhaps remembering the good times might help balance out the trauma of that day. It's just... it's going to be so hard to see her smiling face and know that I'll never see that smile again in person.",
    "Therapist: That's a brave idea. How does it feel to consider that?",
    "Client: Scary. Really scary. But also... maybe a little hopeful? Like maybe there's a way to keep her memory alive without drowning in the pain of losing her. I don't know if I'm ready, but... but maybe it's time to try. For her. For me.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What else are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... overwhelmed. It's like I'm standing at the edge of something big, and I'm not sure if I have the strength to take that step. But I also feel... I don't know... maybe a tiny spark of something. Not happiness, exactly, but... possibility? Like maybe there's a future where I can remember Maria with love instead of just pain. It's terrifying, but also... maybe a little bit exciting?",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you consider this?",
    "Client: It's strange. The knot in my stomach is still there, but it's not as tight. And I feel... lighter somehow? Like some of that weight I've been carrying has shifted a little. My hands are shaking, but not from fear this time. It's more like... anticipation? I don't know. It's all so confusing.",
    "Therapist: Confusion can be part of healing. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need time. And maybe... maybe I need to be a little kinder to myself. Maria would want that. She always told me I was too hard on myself. I guess... I guess I need to learn how to live in a world without her, while still keeping her in my heart. It sounds impossible, but... but maybe it's not.",
    "Therapist: That's a profound insight. How do you feel about ending here today?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm okay with that. This session was hard, but... but good, I think. Thank you, Dr. Thompson. I know I have a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe... maybe there's a path forward. It's blurry and scary, but it's there.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today, Mr. Hernandez. Take care, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you, Doctor. I'll try to remember what we talked about. Maybe... maybe I'll even look at those photo albums before our next session. No promises, but... but I'll try."
