    "Therapist: Welcome back. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. There's a part of me that wants to do this, to face it head-on, you know? But another part is just... terrified. My hands are already shaking a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control here. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. Yes, let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I'm in the desert. The sun is beating down, and I can feel sweat trickling down my back. It's so quiet, eerily quiet. I'm on patrol with my unit.",
    "Therapist: Good. What time of day is it?",
    "Client: It's early afternoon. The heat is suffocating. I can taste dust in my mouth.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Um, maybe a 40? It's uncomfortable, but I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: We're moving slowly, carefully. Every sound makes me jump. I'm gripping my rifle so tightly my knuckles are white. Then... then I hear it. A faint click.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Terror. Pure, ice-cold terror. I know what that sound means. I try to shout a warning, but my voice catches in my throat. I... I can't...",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a deep breath. What do you see around you right now?",
    "Client: I... I see my office. Your chair. The bookshelf.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, can you go back to that moment? What happens after you hear the click?",
    "Client: The world explodes. There's a deafening boom, and I'm thrown backward. My ears are ringing, and I can't see anything through the dust and smoke. I taste blood in my mouth.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 75, maybe 80.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember to breathe. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm scrambling to my feet. My training kicks in, and I'm searching for threats, for my team. I hear screaming, but it sounds muffled, like I'm underwater.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see... oh god, I see Rodriguez. He's... he's on the ground. There's so much blood. His leg... it's... it's gone. I'm frozen. I can't move.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: (deep, shaky breath) Okay. I'm... I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: I snap out of it. I rush to Rodriguez, apply a tourniquet. My hands are shaking so badly, but I manage. I'm yelling for a medic, but my voice sounds strange, far away.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm nauseous. My heart's racing. It feels so real.",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's 90. Maybe higher.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here, you're safe. What's happening around you?",
    "Client: It's chaos. People are shouting, returning fire. I can smell burning metal and... and flesh. I'm dragging Rodriguez behind cover, leaving a trail of blood.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I... I'm thinking this is my fault. I should have been faster, should have warned them. Rodriguez might die because of me.",
    "Therapist: Those are common thoughts in traumatic situations. What happens next?",
    "Client: The medic arrives. I'm pushed aside, and I feel... useless. I should be doing something, but I'm just... standing there, watching.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Angry. Helpless. I... I want to scream, but I can't. I have to stay alert, protect the others.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 85?",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath. What do you see happening now?",
    "Client: The firefight is dying down. We've secured the area. I can hear choppers approaching. I'm... I'm sitting next to Rodriguez. He's unconscious, pale. I'm holding his hand, telling him to hang on.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Guilt. Overwhelming guilt. And fear. I'm terrified he won't make it.",
    "Therapist: Those are natural reactions. What happens as the choppers arrive?",
    "Client: It's a blur. They load Rodriguez first. I help with the others. I'm moving on autopilot. I can't feel anything anymore. It's like I'm watching myself from outside my body.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel in this moment?",
    "Client: Numb. Heavy. Like I'm moving through molasses. My ears are still ringing, and I have this metallic taste in my mouth.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to maybe 70? I feel... drained.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Can you describe what happens as you leave the scene?",
    "Client: We... we pile into the choppers. I'm sitting next to one of my teammates. He's saying something, but I can't hear him over the rotors. I'm staring at my hands. They're covered in blood \u2013 Rodriguez's blood.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that image. What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm wondering if I'll ever feel clean again. If this guilt will ever go away. I'm thinking about Rodriguez's family, how I'll face them if... if he doesn't make it.",
    "Therapist: Those are heavy thoughts. How does your body feel now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. I feel cold, even though it's still blazing hot. My stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What happens when you reach the base?",
    "Client: We land, and there's a flurry of activity. Medics rush to take the wounded. I... I stumble off the chopper. Someone's asking me if I'm hurt, but I can't find my voice.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep replaying that moment. The click, the explosion. I'm wondering if I could have done something differently, saved Rodriguez, saved everyone.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 60. I feel... exhausted.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Can you describe what happens next?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm taken to medical for a check-up. They're asking me questions, shining lights in my eyes. But I feel disconnected, like I'm not really there.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What does it feel like in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like I'm floating. My body feels heavy, but my mind is... somewhere else. I can hear people talking, but their words don't make sense.",
    "Therapist: What happens after the medical check?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm cleared. They tell me to rest, but I can't. I go to the showers instead. I stand under the water for... I don't know how long. I'm scrubbing my hands raw, trying to get the blood off.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What are you feeling in that moment?",
    "Client: Desperation. Anger. I... I want to cry, but the tears won't come. I feel... broken.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 50. I feel... drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved?",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Can you tell me what happens after the shower?",
    "Client: I... I go to my bunk. I sit on the edge of my bed, staring at the wall. My roommate tries to talk to me, but I can't respond. I just... sit there, for hours.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm replaying the event over and over. Wondering what I could have done differently. I'm thinking about Rodriguez, hoping he'll be okay. And I'm... I'm scared. Scared of what this means for me, for my future.",
    "Therapist: Those are all very normal thoughts after such an event. How does your body feel now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Every muscle aches. My head is pounding. But I can't sleep. I'm afraid of what I'll see when I close my eyes.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 40 now. I feel... drained, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like I've faced something I've been avoiding for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How do you feel about ending the exposure here?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm ready. It's been intense, but... I feel like I've really confronted it this time.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end.",
    "Client: (deep breath) Okay. I... I feel a bit shaky, but also... lighter, somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've processed a lot. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired, but... I think this helped. It was hard, but... I feel like I understand it better now.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength today. Let's talk about how you can take care of yourself for the rest of the day."
