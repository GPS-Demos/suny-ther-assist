    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. That memory of the home invasion... it's just so vivid, you know? Even though it happened months ago, it feels like it was yesterday when I talk about it like this.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sound of glass breaking. It's like I can still hear it echoing in my ears. And the fear... God, the fear was overwhelming. I remember hiding in my closet, trying not to breathe too loudly. I kept thinking, \"This is it. This is how I die.\" It's silly, I know, but in that moment, it felt so real.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. But different from before. I noticed that while I still felt scared, it wasn't as overwhelming as it used to be. Like, I could separate myself from the memory a bit more. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Can you tell me more about that?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... before, when I thought about the break-in, I'd be right back there, totally consumed by the fear. But today, even though I felt scared, there was a part of me that knew I was safe here, talking to you. It's a strange feeling, like I'm split in two almost.",
    "Therapist: That's an important observation. How does this relate to your daily life?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe it means I'm starting to gain some control? Like, maybe I don't have to be a slave to these memories and fears all the time. It's a small thing, but it feels significant, you know?",
    "Therapist: It is significant. How does this progress make you feel?",
    "Client: Hopeful, I think. And a little proud of myself, to be honest. I've been working so hard on this, and it's nice to see some change. But also... scared? Like, what if this is just a fluke and next time I'm right back where I started?",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. What do you think helped you today?",
    "Client: Um, maybe the breathing exercises we've been practicing? And just... talking about it over and over. It's like each time, it loses a little bit of its power over me. Oh, and reminding myself that I survived. I'm here, I'm safe, and I got through it.",
    "Therapist: Excellent insights. How might you use this moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I can try to bring that same mindset to my daily life? Like, when I start feeling anxious about my safety, I can remind myself that I'm okay now, that I've gotten through tough situations before. And maybe use those breathing exercises more often, not just during our sessions.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great plan. Any other thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I guess. This is hard work, and sometimes it feels like I'm not getting anywhere. But today... today I feel like maybe I am making progress after all. It's a good feeling.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. How do you feel about continuing with the exposures?",
    "Client: I'm nervous, but... I think I'm ready. It's not easy, but I can see now that it's helping. And I want to keep getting better, you know? I want my life back.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful motivation. Anything else you'd like to discuss?",
    "Client: No, I think that's it for now. I'm feeling pretty drained, to be honest. But also... lighter? Like I've put down a heavy backpack I've been carrying around. It's a weird mix of tired and relieved.",
    "Therapist: That's normal after an intense session. How will you take care of yourself today?",
    "Client: I think I'll take a long bath when I get home, maybe call my sister. She's been really supportive through all of this. And I'll make sure to use those grounding techniques we talked about if I start feeling overwhelmed again.",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a good plan. We'll pick this up next session. Take care, Sarah.",
    "Client: Thanks, Dr. Johnson. See you next week."
