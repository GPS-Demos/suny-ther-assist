    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart is still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. Going back to those cult experiences, it's like I'm right there again, you know? The fear, the confusion, it all comes rushing back.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sense of powerlessness, I think. I remember watching as the cult leader berated and physically intimidated one of the newer members. I wanted to step in, to do something, but I was frozen. I felt so... complicit. And that guilt, it's still with me now.",
    "Therapist: How does that guilt affect you today?",
    "Client: It... it seeps into everything. I second-guess my decisions, always wondering if I'm doing the right thing or if I'm just being manipulated again. It's exhausting, really. And it feeds into my depression, I think. This constant feeling that I'm not good enough, that I failed somehow.",
    "Therapist: I hear your struggle. How did it feel to confront that memory today?",
    "Client: Honestly? Terrifying at first. But as I went through it, there was also this... I don't know, maybe a sense of relief? Like, I'm finally facing it head-on instead of trying to push it away. It's still painful, but it feels different somehow.",
    "Therapist: Different how?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... I can see it more clearly now. I'm not just reliving it, I'm observing it too. I can recognize that I was young, scared, and in a manipulative environment. It doesn't make it okay, but it helps me understand why I acted the way I did.",
    "Therapist: That's an important insight. How might this new perspective impact your daily life?",
    "Client: I... I hadn't thought about that. Maybe it could help me be a bit kinder to myself? I've been so angry at myself for so long, but seeing it from this angle, I realize I was a victim too. It doesn't erase what happened, but maybe I don't need to carry all this guilt anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's one small step you could take with this new understanding?",
    "Client: Hmm... Maybe when I start feeling that guilt creeping in, I could try to pause and remind myself of what we talked about today. To remember that I was doing the best I could in a terrible situation. It sounds simple, but it feels like it could make a big difference.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent strategy. How are you feeling now compared to when we started?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, I think. Still a bit shaken, but there's a glimmer of hope there too. Like maybe I can actually work through this and come out the other side. It's scary, but also kind of exciting.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is commendable. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to explore more about how these experiences have shaped my relationships. Especially with my partner. I've always kept them at arm's length, afraid of being manipulated again. But maybe it's time to work on that.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a valuable direction. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I guess. For guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm finally making progress. It's like I can see a path forward now, even if it's still a bit hazy.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work. How will you take care of yourself for the rest of the day?",
    "Client: I think I'll go for a long walk in the park. Being in nature always helps ground me. And maybe I'll call my partner, share a bit about today's session. Not everything, but... opening up a little. That feels like a good step.",
    "Therapist: Excellent plan. Remember to be gentle with yourself. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, definitely. Thank you again. See you next week."
