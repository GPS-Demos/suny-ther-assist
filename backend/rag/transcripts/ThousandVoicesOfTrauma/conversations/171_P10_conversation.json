    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm feeling a bit jittery, to be honest. My hands are kind of shaky.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Okay... I'm as ready as I'll ever be, I guess.",
    "Therapist: Good. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm at the bank. It's a Tuesday afternoon, and I'm waiting in line to deposit my first paycheck. The air conditioning is blasting, and I'm shivering a little. There's soft music playing overhead, but I can barely hear it over the chatter of other customers.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud bang. At first, I think someone dropped something, but then I hear screaming. Three men in ski masks burst through the doors, waving guns. One of them shouts, \"Everybody get down!\" My heart is racing, and I can't breathe. I... I drop to the floor, my cheek pressed against the cold tile.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My chest is so tight. I can feel my heart pounding in my ears. My palms are sweaty, and I'm trembling all over. I want to run, but I'm frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about an 80. It feels so real.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Maria. Remember, you're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: One of the men is shouting at the tellers, demanding money. Another is pacing back and forth, keeping watch on us. The third... oh God, he's coming closer to where I'm lying. His boots are right in front of my face. I'm trying not to make a sound, but I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What do you hear? What do you smell?",
    "Client: I hear muffled sobs from somewhere behind me. The air smells like fear and sweat. And... gunpowder. One of them fired a shot into the ceiling earlier. My ears are still ringing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm scared, but also angry. Why is this happening? Why us? I keep thinking about my mom, how worried she'll be when I don't come home on time.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. Keep describing what's happening.",
    "Client: The man near me suddenly grabs a woman a few feet away. She screams as he yanks her up by her arm. He's yelling at her, asking if she pressed a silent alarm. She's sobbing, saying she doesn't know anything. I want to help her, but I'm paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind at this moment?",
    "Client: I... I feel so helpless. I keep thinking, \"This can't be real. This can't be happening.\" But it is. I can smell the gunman's sweat, hear the woman's sobs. It's all too real.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens next?",
    "Client: There's a commotion at the front. One of the tellers must have triggered an alarm because suddenly there are sirens outside. The robbers start panicking. They're yelling at each other, arguing about what to do. The one who grabbed the woman pushes her down roughly and she falls next to me. I can see the terror in her eyes.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 90. My heart is racing so fast.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Maria. Remember to breathe. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *takes a shaky breath* The police are outside now. I can hear them on megaphones, telling the robbers to surrender. But the men inside are getting more agitated. One of them grabs me and pulls me to my feet. He's using me as a human shield as he approaches the windows. I can feel the cold metal of his gun pressed against my temple.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you experiencing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. I can barely breathe. My legs feel like jelly, and I think I might pass out. The man holding me smells like cigarettes and fear. He's shouting demands at the police outside, but his voice is shaking. I realize he's just as scared as I am.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm angry. And scared. But also... determined. I keep thinking about my family, my friends. I don't want to die here. I start planning, wondering if I could somehow break free or distract him.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What happens next?",
    "Client: Everything happens so fast. There's a loud crash as the police breach the building. The man holding me panics. He spins around, dragging me with him. In the chaos, I stumble, and we both fall. I hear gunshots, people screaming. I curl up into a ball, hands over my head, praying it'll be over soon.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My heart is pounding so hard. But... I'm also feeling a strange sense of relief. Because I know how this ends. I survived.",
    "Therapist: That's right, you did survive. You're here now, safe. Can you tell me how the situation resolved?",
    "Client: It... it was over pretty quickly after that. The police subdued the robbers. I remember strong hands helping me up, asking if I was hurt. I was in shock, I think. Everything seemed distant, like I was watching it happen to someone else. They led me outside, and I remember blinking in the bright sunlight. There were so many people - police, paramedics, news crews. My mom was there, crying and hugging me so tight I could barely breathe.",
    "Therapist: You've done an excellent job, Maria. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. But also... lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling after these sessions. You've shown incredible strength today. How would you rate your distress now?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 40, I think. Still there, but not overwhelming anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves. Can you name five things you can see in this room?",
    "Client: Um, okay. I see... your desk, the painting on the wall, the plant in the corner, my water bottle, and the clock.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, four things you can touch?",
    "Client: The armrest of the chair, my jeans, my hair, and the tissue box.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Three things you can hear?",
    "Client: The air conditioning, cars outside, and... my own breathing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Two things you can smell?",
    "Client: The lavender air freshener and... coffee? I think you have a cup on your desk.",
    "Therapist: That's right. And finally, one thing you can taste?",
    "Client: The mint from the gum I was chewing earlier.",
    "Therapist: Great job, Maria. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Better. More... present. Like I'm fully back here in the room with you.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. You've made significant progress today. How do you feel about the session?",
    "Client: It was hard, really hard. But... I feel like I faced something I've been running from for a long time. I didn't think I could do it, but I did.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud of yourself. You showed incredible courage today. Remember, healing is a process, and you've taken a big step forward.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I'm starting to believe that I can get through this.",
    "Therapist: You absolutely can. We'll continue to work together, and you'll keep getting stronger. Do you have any questions before we end for today?",
    "Client: No, I don't think so. I'm just... ready to go home and rest.",
    "Therapist: That's a good idea. Make sure to be kind to yourself tonight. We'll discuss this further in our next session. You did great work today, Maria.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I'm starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel.",
    "Therapist: That's wonderful to hear. Take care, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Goodbye, and thank you again."
