    "Therapist: Welcome back, Sarah. Are you ready to continue our imaginal exposure work today?",
    "Client: I think so... I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with your SUDS rating.",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 4 out of 10 right now. Just thinking about revisiting the memory is making me a little anxious.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Let's begin. Close your eyes and describe the cyber bullying incident.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) I'm sitting in my room, scrolling through my phone. My heart starts racing as I see a notification. It's another cruel message from my ex-classmate. The words... they're so hurtful. I feel my chest tightening, and my hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. I can feel the panic rising in my throat.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what happened.",
    "Client: The message is full of lies about me, but it's posted where everyone can see it. I feel so exposed, so vulnerable. My stomach is in knots, and I'm starting to feel dizzy. I want to throw my phone across the room, but I can't stop reading the comments. People I thought were my friends are laughing at me.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. God, this feels so real again. My palms are sweating, and I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: I'm trying to defend myself in the comments, but my hands are shaking so much I can barely type. Every notification sound makes me flinch. I feel so alone, so helpless. The room seems to be spinning, and I'm fighting back tears.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's still an 8. My heart is pounding so hard, I can hear it in my ears. I remember curling up on my bed, hugging my knees to my chest, wishing I could disappear.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: I... I can't stop crying. The messages keep coming, each one worse than the last. I feel like I'm drowning in shame and fear. My whole body is trembling, and I'm struggling to catch my breath.",

    "Therapist: How's your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's still at 9. My chest feels so tight, like I can't get enough air.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what happened next.",
    "Client: I... I remember turning off my phone, but the damage was already done. I felt so exposed, so violated. The silence in my room was deafening. I couldn't stop replaying the messages in my head, wondering what I did to deserve this.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's starting to come down a bit. Maybe an 8 now. I'm still shaky, but I'm starting to remember that it's in the past.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Keep going.",
    "Client: I spent the whole night awake, afraid to check my phone. The next day at school was a nightmare. People were whispering and pointing. I felt like everyone was laughing at me. I wanted to disappear.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 7. I'm starting to feel a bit more grounded, but my heart is still racing.",
