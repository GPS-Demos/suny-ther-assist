    "Therapist: Welcome, Amir. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is really anxious about diving into these memories. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0-100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: Uh, probably around a 40? Yeah, 40.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we're here to process this together. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I guess so. Yeah, let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see the living room. It's dark, the curtains are drawn. I can smell my mom's cooking from the kitchen, but it's not comforting. It's making me feel sick because I know what's coming. My dad's footsteps are getting closer, and I'm frozen on the couch.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: He enters the room, and I can tell by his face that he's angry. He starts yelling about my grades, saying I'm lazy and ungrateful. I want to explain, but I can't speak. My throat feels tight, and my hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 60.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going. What does your dad do?",
    "Client: He... he grabs my arm and pulls me off the couch. I stumble, and he calls me pathetic. He's dragging me towards the stairs, and I know where we're going. I'm trying to pull away, but he's too strong.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My heart is racing. I feel like I can't breathe properly. My arm hurts where he's gripping it.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... We're at the basement door. He opens it, and it's pitch black down there. I'm begging him not to, but he shoves me inside and slams the door. I hear the lock click, and I'm alone in the dark.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. I hate the dark, and the basement is cold and damp. I'm pounding on the door, crying for him to let me out. But I know he won't. He never does.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's at 75 now. This is... this is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Amir. Keep going. What do you do in the basement?",
    "Client: I... I slide down against the door and just sit there. I can't see anything, but I can hear the pipes creaking and water dripping somewhere. I'm shivering, both from fear and the cold. I wrap my arms around my knees and try to make myself as small as possible.",
    "Therapist: How long are you there?",
    "Client: It feels like forever. I don't have my phone or watch, so I can't tell time. I try counting, but I keep losing track. My eyes start playing tricks on me in the dark, and I think I see shapes moving.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling emotionally?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm so angry. At my dad for doing this, at myself for not being good enough. But mostly, I feel helpless. Like I'll never be able to escape this, like I'll always be trapped here.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What else?",
    "Client: I... I start to feel like maybe I deserve this. Maybe if I was smarter or better behaved, this wouldn't happen. I'm worthless, just like he says.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 85 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Amir. Remember, you're safe now. This is just a memory.",
    "Client: Right... okay. I'm trying to remember that. It's just... it feels so real.",
    "Therapist: I know. Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I don't know how long it's been, but I hear footsteps upstairs. My heart starts racing again. I don't know if I want him to open the door or not. Part of me wants out so badly, but another part is afraid of what he'll say or do when he lets me out.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: My legs are cramped from sitting in the same position. My eyes hurt from straining in the dark. My throat is dry from crying.",
    "Therapist: And emotionally?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. But also on edge, like a coiled spring ready to snap.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens when the door opens?",
    "Client: The light... it's so bright it hurts my eyes. I blink, trying to adjust. My dad's standing there, looking down at me. He says, \"Have you learned your lesson?\" I nod, even though I don't know what lesson I was supposed to learn. I just want to get out of there.",
    "Therapist: What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I slowly stand up. My legs are shaky, and I have to lean against the wall. I don't look at him as I climb the stairs. I'm afraid if I make eye contact, he'll change his mind and lock me back in.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still around 80. My heart's still pounding.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Amir. Keep going. What happens when you're out of the basement?",
    "Client: I... I go straight to my room. I don't look at anyone. I can hear my mom in the kitchen, but she doesn't say anything. I close my door and just lie on my bed, staring at the ceiling. I feel... numb.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm wondering how long I was down there. I'm thinking about how I'll face my family at dinner. I'm dreading going to school tomorrow, pretending everything's normal.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel now?",
    "Client: It's... it's like all the tension is slowly draining out of me. But I still feel on edge, like I'm waiting for the next bad thing to happen.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe 70 now?",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this well. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I get up and look in the mirror. My eyes are red and puffy from crying. I splash some water on my face, trying to look normal. I hear my mom call for dinner, and my stomach churns. I don't want to go down there, but I know I have to.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about facing your family?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm scared. Angry. Ashamed. I don't want them to see how much this affected me. I want to act like nothing happened, but I don't know if I can.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What happens at dinner?",
    "Client: It's... it's so quiet. The only sound is forks scraping plates. My dad acts like nothing happened. My mom keeps glancing at me, but she doesn't say anything. My little sister looks confused, like she knows something's wrong but doesn't understand what.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking during dinner?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about how messed up this is. How we're all pretending everything's fine when it's not. I'm wondering if this is what my whole life is going to be like.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 65 now. I'm feeling more angry than scared at this point.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Keep going. What happens after dinner?",
    "Client: I... I go back to my room. I try to do some homework, but I can't focus. I keep replaying everything in my head, wondering what I could have done differently. I feel so... trapped. Like this is my life now and I can't escape it.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: It makes me feel... hopeless. Like no matter what I do, I'll never be good enough. Like I'll always be at the mercy of my dad's moods.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What do you do with those emotions?",
    "Client: I... I write in my journal. It's the only place I feel safe expressing myself. I pour out all my anger and fear and frustration onto the pages. It helps a little, but I still feel this heaviness in my chest.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 55 now. Writing helped.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're doing well, Amir. How does the night end?",
    "Client: I... I eventually fall into a restless sleep. I have nightmares about being trapped in dark spaces, about disappointing everyone. I wake up feeling exhausted, dreading the day ahead.",
    "Therapist: And how do you feel now, thinking back on all of this?",
    "Client: I feel... sad. Angry. But also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger? Like, I survived that. It was awful, but I got through it.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 40. I feel drained, but also like a weight has been lifted.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today, Amir. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. But I also feel like I understand what happened better now. It's still painful, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end the session.",
    "Client: Okay... [deep breath] Yeah, that helps. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Amir. You showed great courage today. We'll continue to work through this in our next session."
