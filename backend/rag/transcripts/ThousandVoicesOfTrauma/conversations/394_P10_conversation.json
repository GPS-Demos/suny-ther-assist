    "Therapist: Welcome back. Today we'll be doing an imaginal exposure exercise focusing on your experience of racial trauma. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. It's a bit daunting, to be honest. I'm feeling a mix of anticipation and unease.",
    "Therapist: That's completely understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Can you give me a SUDS rating before we start?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 5 out of 10. My stomach's a bit knotted.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Let's begin. Close your eyes and take us to that moment.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm at work. It's a typical Tuesday morning, and I'm heading to the conference room for our weekly team meeting. As I approach, I can hear laughter coming from inside. I pause for a moment, my hand on the door handle. Something doesn't feel right...",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you notice in your body?",
    "Client: My heart... it's starting to race a bit. I can feel my palms getting sweaty on the door handle.",
    "Therapist: Keep going. What happens next?",
    "Client: I take a deep breath and push the door open. As I step in, the laughter suddenly stops. I see my colleagues gathered around the table, and they all turn to look at me. There's this... awkward silence. I can feel their eyes on me, and it's like the air has been sucked out of the room.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Exposed. Vulnerable. Like I've walked in on something I wasn't supposed to see. My chest feels tight, and I'm having trouble catching my breath.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to breathe. You're safe here. Can you give me another SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up. Maybe a 7 now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I... I make my way to my usual seat, and I can hear whispers behind me. As I sit down, I accidentally knock my pen off the table. When I bend to pick it up, I overhear someone mutter, \"Typical islander, always clumsy.\" My face burns with shame and anger. I... I want to say something, but the words stick in my throat.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I feel so small. Like I don't belong. Part of me wants to stand up and confront them, but another part just wants to disappear. I'm... I'm remembering all the other times I've felt like this, all the little comments and looks over the years. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember to stay in the present moment. What do you notice around you?",
    "Client: The room feels colder now. I can hear the hum of the air conditioning, the shuffle of papers. Someone clears their throat, and I flinch. The meeting starts, but I can barely focus. My mind is racing, replaying what just happened, wondering if I imagined it all.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. Maybe an 8. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Feel your feet on the floor. Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... okay. I'm trying.",
    "Therapist: Good. When you're ready, continue with what happened next.",
    "Client: The meeting drags on, and I feel like I'm underwater. Everything sounds muffled. I catch people glancing at me, then quickly looking away. When it's my turn to speak, my voice comes out shaky. I stumble over my words, and I see a few smirks. I... I feel so humiliated.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's happening in your body?",
    "Client: My face is hot. My hands are trembling. I want to run, but I'm frozen in my seat. I feel like I'm going to be sick.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Remember, you're here now, you're safe. Can you give me another SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's still an 8. Maybe even a 9. I feel so trapped in this memory.",
    "Therapist: Take another deep breath. You're in control here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: The meeting finally ends, and people start to file out. I stay seated, pretending to organize my notes. I can't bear to face anyone. As the last person leaves, they pause at the door and say, \"You know, you people are so sensitive. Learn to take a joke.\" Then they're gone, and I'm alone in the room.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: Rage. Helplessness. Shame. It's all mixing together, and I feel like I'm going to explode. But I don't. I just sit there, silent, tears burning behind my eyes.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What do you want to do?",
    "Client: I want to scream. I want to throw something. I want to run after them and tell them how much they've hurt me. But I don't do any of that. I just... I just sit there, trying to pull myself together.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. How are you feeling right now, in this moment?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. My heart is pounding, and I feel sick to my stomach. But... but I also feel a little stronger, like I'm facing this head-on for the first time.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Can you give me another SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe a 7 now.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I finally manage to stand up. My legs feel shaky, but I force myself to walk out of the room. The hallway seems so long, and I can feel eyes on me as I pass by cubicles. I make it to the bathroom and lock myself in a stall. That's when the tears finally come.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... broken. Like I've been carrying this weight for so long, and it's finally crushing me. But there's also this tiny spark of anger, of defiance. I'm tired of feeling this way.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does your body feel now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix. I'm still shaking, but there's also this energy, like I want to do something, change something.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves again. Feel your feet on the floor, your back against the chair. You're here, you're safe.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Thank you. That helps.",
    "Therapist: Can you give me another SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down more. Maybe a 6 now.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. When you're ready, continue with what happened next.",
    "Client: I... I stay in the bathroom for a while, trying to compose myself. When I finally come out, I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror. My eyes are red, but there's something different. I look... determined. I wash my face, take a deep breath, and head back to my desk.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling as you walk back?",
    "Client: I'm scared, but there's also this new resolve. I'm tired of hiding, of pretending it doesn't hurt. I decide that I'm going to speak to HR, to document what happened. It's a small step, but it feels huge.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant decision. How does it feel to make that choice?",
    "Client: It's... it's empowering. Scary, but empowering. Like I'm finally standing up for myself, for my worth.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter. Like I've set down a heavy burden. There's still pain and anger, but also hope.",
    "Therapist: That's fantastic progress. Can you give me a final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's down to a 4 now. It still hurts, but I feel like I can breathe again.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well today. Let's take a few moments to process what we've worked through..."
