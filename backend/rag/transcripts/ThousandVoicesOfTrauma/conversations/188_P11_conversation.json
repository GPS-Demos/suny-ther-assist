    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken up, to be honest. It's not easy reliving that night. The shouting, the sound of glass breaking... it's all so vivid. I can still hear my neighbor's wife screaming for help. I feel like I'm right back there, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The helplessness. I remember standing there, frozen, not knowing what to do. I was so scared that if I intervened, things would get worse. But at the same time, I felt this overwhelming guilt for not doing anything. It's... it's a terrible feeling.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was tough, really tough. My heart was racing, and I felt this tightness in my chest. But... I don't know, maybe it's just me, but it felt a little less overwhelming than last time. Don't get me wrong, it's still awful, but I didn't feel like I was completely losing control this time.",
    "Therapist: That's an important observation. How do you make sense of that?",
    "Client: Well, I've been practicing those breathing exercises you taught me. I tried to use them during the exposure, and I think they helped a bit. It's like... I could remind myself that I'm here, in the present, not back there. It's still hard, but I felt a little more... grounded, I guess?",
    "Therapist: Excellent use of those skills. How does this connect to your goals?",
    "Client: I suppose it shows I'm making some progress, doesn't it? I mean, I've been so afraid of these memories, always trying to push them away. But facing them like this, it's... it's helping me realize that maybe I can learn to cope with them better. Maybe they don't have to control my life the way they have been.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm noticing that... well, it's not just about that one night anymore. Going through this process, I'm starting to see how it's affected so many parts of my life. My reluctance to form close relationships, my constant state of alertness... it all stems from this, doesn't it? It's like I've been living in the shadow of that night for years.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... it's a lot to take in. Part of me feels sad about all the time I've lost, you know? But another part... I don't know, maybe there's a glimmer of hope? If I can understand it better, maybe I can start to change things. It's scary, but also... maybe a little exciting?",
    "Therapist: That mix of emotions makes sense. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I think... I want to keep going with this. It's hard, and there are moments when I want to give up. But I'm starting to see that facing these memories might be the key to moving forward. I want to work on being more present in my life, maybe even try to connect with people more. It's terrifying, but I think it might be worth it.",
    "Therapist: That's a courageous stance. How can we support that?",
    "Client: Well, I'd like to keep practicing those coping skills. They really seem to help. And... maybe we could explore more about how to apply what I'm learning here to my day-to-day life? I'm not sure exactly how, but I feel like there's a connection there that could be really valuable.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll focus on that. Any final thoughts?",
    "Client: Just... thank you, I guess. This isn't easy, but I feel like I'm finally starting to see a path forward. It's a long road ahead, but for the first time in a long time, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can actually walk it."
