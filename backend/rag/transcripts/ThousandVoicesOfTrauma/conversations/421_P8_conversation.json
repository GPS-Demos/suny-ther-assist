    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is buzzing, but my mind feels foggy. The memory of that night, seeing those officers... it's all so vivid now.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: It's overwhelming. I can still hear the shouting, the sound of batons hitting flesh. My heart is racing, and I feel this tightness in my chest. It's like I'm back there, you know? Watching helplessly as they beat that man...",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Can you tell me more about those physical sensations?",
    "Client: My palms are sweaty, and I feel nauseous. It's like my body is preparing to run, but I'm frozen in place. I keep seeing flashes of that night - the man's bruised face, the officer's cold eyes. I feel... I feel so angry and scared at the same time.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings connect to your broader experience?",
    "Client: I guess... it reminds me of how powerless I felt growing up. My parents' neglect, never feeling safe or protected. And now, seeing this brutality... it's like the world isn't safe either. I don't know who to trust anymore.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why didn't I do something?\" I know logically that I couldn't have stopped it, but there's this guilt... And then I think about how this happens all the time, to people who look like me. It makes me feel... hopeless, I suppose. Like there's no justice in the world.",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts impact you day-to-day?",
    "Client: They... they make it hard to function sometimes. I'm always on edge, especially around authority figures. I've been avoiding going out, afraid I'll witness something like that again. It's affecting my work, my relationships... I feel isolated, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds challenging. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I... I'm realizing how much anger I'm carrying. Not just about that night, but about everything. My childhood, the systemic issues... it's like a weight pressing down on me. But talking about it now, I also feel a glimmer of... I don't know, maybe hope? Like maybe by processing this, I can start to heal.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How does that feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's scary, but also kind of liberating? Like maybe I'm not completely powerless. I've been carrying this for so long, and now it's like I'm finally starting to unpack it. It hurts, but... maybe that's part of healing?",
    "Therapist: You're showing a lot of strength. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I think... I need to sit with these feelings for a bit. They're intense, but not unbearable. And maybe... maybe I need to find ways to channel this anger into something positive. I've been thinking about getting involved in community activism, but I've been too afraid. Now, I'm wondering if that might be a way to reclaim some power.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful approach. How else might you support yourself?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to be gentler with myself. I've been so caught up in guilt and fear that I haven't allowed myself to just... feel. Maybe I need to find more ways to feel safe in my body again. Like, I used to love running, but I've been too anxious to go out. Maybe I could start with short walks, gradually building up to runs again.",
    "Therapist: That's a great idea. What else comes to mind?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much I've isolated myself. Maybe... maybe it's time to reach out to some friends, or even look into support groups for people who've witnessed similar things. I've felt so alone in this, but I'm starting to see that I don't have to be.",
    "Therapist: You're making important connections. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also lighter somehow. Like I've started to unload some of this burden. It's still there, but it feels more manageable. And I feel... I don't know, maybe a bit proud of myself for facing this head-on? It's not easy, but I'm doing it.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. What would you like to focus on next?",
    "Client: I think... I want to explore more about how my past experiences of neglect might be influencing how I'm processing this trauma. And maybe we could talk more about strategies for managing the anxiety and hypervigilance I've been experiencing? I want to feel safe in the world again, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. This was intense, but... good. Thank you for guiding me through this. I feel like I'm starting to see a path forward, even if it's still a bit hazy. I'm nervous about what might come up next time, but also... kind of looking forward to it? Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a positive sign. How will you take care of yourself today?",
    "Client: I think I'll take a long shower when I get home, maybe do some deep breathing exercises. And... you know what? I might call my friend Ahmed. I've been avoiding his calls, but I think I'm ready to connect again. Baby steps, right?",
    "Therapist: That sounds perfect. Take care, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. See you then."
