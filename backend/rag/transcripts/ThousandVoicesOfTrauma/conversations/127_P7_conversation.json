    "Therapist: Let's begin the exposure exercise. Can you describe the bullying incident?",
    "Client: Okay... It was during my first year at university. I was walking to class when a group of guys started shouting racial slurs at me. They were laughing and pointing. I felt so humiliated.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: I tried to ignore them, but they followed me. One of them pushed me, and I dropped my books. I was shaking, trying to pick them up. People were watching, but no one helped. I felt so alone and scared.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I can feel my heart racing just thinking about it. They kept taunting me, telling me to go back to where I came from. But I was born here! I've never felt so out of place in my own country.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Keep going.",
    "Client: I wanted to run, but I was frozen. One of them spat at me. I can still feel the disgust and shame. I finally managed to get away and hid in a bathroom stall. I cried for what felt like hours.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I missed my class that day. I was too afraid to leave the bathroom. When I finally did, I kept looking over my shoulder, terrified they'd be there. I felt so weak and powerless.",
    "Therapist: You're showing strength by facing this memory.",
    "Client: For weeks after, I couldn't focus on my studies. I'd have nightmares about being chased. I started skipping classes, afraid of running into them again. My grades suffered. I felt like I didn't belong anywhere.",
    "Therapist: You're processing this well. Continue.",
    "Client: I... I never reported it. I was too ashamed and scared. I thought maybe it was my fault for being different. I started to hate my own skin, my own culture. It's like they stole a part of me that day.",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. You're safe now.",
    "Client: Sometimes, I still feel that fear when I walk around campus. I've become hyper-aware of my surroundings, always on edge. It's exhausting. I wish I could just feel normal again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job expressing these feelings.",
    "Client: I've lost trust in people. I find it hard to make friends now, especially with people who aren't from my background. I feel like an outsider everywhere I go. It's like that incident drew a line between me and the rest of the world.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Keep going.",
    "Client: I feel angry too. Angry at them, at the bystanders, at myself for not standing up to them. Sometimes I fantasize about what I could have done differently, but then I just feel helpless all over again.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those thoughts. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: I've never told anyone all of this before. It feels both terrifying and... somewhat relieving to say it out loud. But I'm also scared. What if talking about it makes it worse?",
    "Therapist: You're showing tremendous courage. This process helps healing.",
    "Client: I hope so. I'm tired of letting this control my life. I want to feel safe again, to enjoy my studies, to make friends without constantly worrying about my race. But it feels so impossible sometimes.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is admirable. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I need a moment. This is more overwhelming than I expected. Can we take a short break?",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've done excellent work today."
