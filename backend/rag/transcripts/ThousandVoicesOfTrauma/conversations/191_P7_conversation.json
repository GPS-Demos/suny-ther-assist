    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe what happened during the police incident?",
    "Client: Okay... I was at a peaceful protest against police brutality. We were chanting and holding signs. Suddenly, I heard loud bangs and saw smoke. People started screaming and running. I froze, not knowing what to do.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you experienced.",
    "Client: The smoke was getting thicker, and my eyes started burning. I could barely see. Then I felt someone grab my arm roughly. It was a police officer in riot gear. He was yelling at me, but I couldn't understand what he was saying. I tried to explain that I wasn't doing anything wrong, but he twisted my arm behind my back.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What were you feeling?",
    "Client: I was terrified. My heart was racing, and I couldn't breathe. I thought they were going to hurt me or arrest me for no reason. The pain in my arm was intense, and I started crying. I kept thinking about all the news stories of police brutality, and I was sure I was going to be next.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The officer pushed me to the ground. My face hit the pavement hard, and I tasted blood. I was coughing from the smoke and crying from the pain and fear. People around me were screaming and running. I felt so helpless and alone.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) I... I don't know if I can continue. It's too much.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great. We can pause if you need to.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay... I'll try to continue. As I lay on the ground, more officers surrounded me. One of them put his knee on my back, making it hard to breathe. I was begging them to stop, telling them I hadn't done anything wrong. But they weren't listening.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel shaky and scared, like it's happening all over again. My heart is racing, and I feel a tightness in my chest.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: (nods) They handcuffed me and roughly pulled me to my feet. My face was bleeding, and my arm felt like it was on fire. They dragged me to a police van and threw me inside with others. We were all crying and in pain. I kept thinking about my family, wondering if I'd see them again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job. Keep going.",
    "Client: We were driven to a holding facility. The ride was rough, and we were all thrown around in the back. When we arrived, they processed us like criminals.

    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: I was put in a cell with others from the protest. We were all in shock, comparing our injuries and experiences. Hours passed, and we weren't given water or allowed to use the bathroom. My arm was swelling, and I was in so much pain. I felt completely powerless and violated.",
    "Therapist: You're very strong for getting through that. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel drained and sad. But also angry that this happened to me and so many others. It's hard to trust the police now. Every time I see a police car or an officer in uniform, I feel panicky and afraid.",
    "Therapist: Those are understandable reactions. You've done well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to talk about, but I think it helps to share it. I just wish I could feel safe again, you know? I used to believe that the police were there to protect us, but now I'm not so sure. It's changed how I see the world.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. Sometimes I feel guilty for being so affected by this when others have experienced worse. But then I remember how helpless and scared I felt, and how it's impacted my life. I have nightmares about it, and I avoid going to crowded places or events now.",
    "Therapist: It's important to acknowledge your own pain. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I hope so. I want to be able to move past this and feel normal again. But it's hard when the fear is always there in the back of my mind. I worry about my children and what might happen to them. I find myself being overprotective, always warning them about potential dangers.",
    "Therapist: That's a common response. We'll work on coping strategies.",
    "Client: I'd like that. I want to feel empowered again, not constantly afraid. It's exhausting living with this constant anxiety. But talking about it like this, even though it's difficult, does seem to help a little. It makes it feel less like a dark secret I'm carrying alone.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage. Let's end here for today.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you for listening and guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I'm glad I'm doing it. I hope that with time, it will get easier to talk about and that the memories won't have such a strong hold on me. I'm looking forward to our next session, even though I know it will be challenging."
