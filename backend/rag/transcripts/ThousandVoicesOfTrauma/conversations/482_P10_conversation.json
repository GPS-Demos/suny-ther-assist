    "Therapist: Welcome, Mrs. Patel. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Oh, hello Dr. Johnson. I'm... I'm a bit apprehensive, to be honest. My arthritis is acting up today, and I'm not sure how well I'll manage with this cyber bullying topic. It's all so new to me, you know?",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's start slowly. Can you tell me about the cyber bullying incident?",
    "Client: Well, it happened about six months ago. My granddaughter helped me set up a Facebook account so I could keep in touch with family back in India. At first, it was lovely. But then... (pauses, takes a deep breath) I started getting these horrible messages.",
    "Therapist: Take your time. What do you remember most vividly?",
    "Client: The messages... they were so cruel. Someone had made a fake profile pretending to be my late husband. They... they said awful things. That I was a burden, that I should... (voice trembles) that I should just die already.",
    "Therapist: That must have been terrifying. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed do you feel right now?",
    "Client: Oh, goodness. I'd say about a 70. My hands are shaking a bit.",
    "Therapist: Let's take a deep breath together. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: (breathes deeply) Thank you, that helps a bit.",
    "Therapist: Good. Can you describe what happened next, using present tense?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm sitting at my computer. The screen is so bright it hurts my eyes a little. I see a new message notification. My heart is racing as I click on it. The profile picture... it's my Raj. But it can't be. He's been gone for five years now.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. My hands are clammy on the mouse. I... I want to look away, but I can't stop reading.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What does the message say?",
    "Client: It... it says, \"You're nothing but a burden to everyone around you. Why don't you just do everyone a favor and end it all?\" I... I can't breathe. It feels like the walls are closing in on me.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Take another deep breath. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 85. I feel so alone and scared.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Can you ground yourself by naming five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: (looking around) I see... your desk, the plant in the corner, the clock on the wall, the painting of the ocean, and... and the box of tissues.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Now, what happens after you read the message?",
    "Client: I'm shaking. I close the laptop, but I can still see the words burned into my mind. I... I reach for my phone. I need to call someone, anyone.",
    "Therapist: Who do you call?",
    "Client: My daughter. I can barely speak through my tears. She... she tells me she's coming over right away. But I'm so ashamed. I don't want her to see me like this.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. How does your body feel as you wait for your daughter?",
    "Client: I feel nauseous. My heart is still racing. I keep looking at the closed laptop, terrified of what other messages might be waiting.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens when your daughter arrives?",
    "Client: She... she bursts through the door. She looks so worried. I try to explain, but I'm sobbing too hard. She hugs me, and I just collapse into her arms. I feel so weak, so foolish.",
    "Therapist: It's not foolish to feel hurt. What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 60. Remembering my daughter's support helps.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Can you tell me what your daughter does next?",
    "Client: She... she asks to see the messages. I'm reluctant, but I nod. We sit together at the computer. As she reads, I see her face change from concern to anger. She... she tells me this isn't really Dad, that someone is pretending to be him to hurt me.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization make you feel?",
    "Client: I feel... relieved, but also confused and angry. Why would someone do this? I thought the internet was supposed to bring people together, not tear them apart.",
    "Therapist: Those are valid feelings. What happens after that?",
    "Client: My daughter helps me report the profile and block it. She shows me how to adjust my privacy settings. I... I feel a little safer, but also so naive. I keep thinking about all the other older people who might fall for something like this.",
    "Therapist: You're not naive. This could happen to anyone. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. My chest doesn't feel as tight, but I'm drained. My distress is probably around 40 now.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant improvement. You've done really well today. How do you feel about what we've discussed?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard, but I think it helps to talk about it. I still feel embarrassed, but less alone. I just wish I could forget it ever happened.",
    "Therapist: Healing takes time. We'll work through this together. For now, let's end with a grounding exercise.",
    "Client: Okay. I... I appreciate your help, Dr. Johnson. It means a lot to have someone listen without judgment.",
    "Therapist: That's what I'm here for. Let's focus on your breath for a few moments.",
    "Client: (takes several deep breaths) That does help. I feel a bit more centered now.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. We'll continue working on this. Remember, you're stronger than you think.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'll try to remember that. Same time next week?",
    "Therapist: Yes, I'll see you then. Take care, Mrs. Patel."
