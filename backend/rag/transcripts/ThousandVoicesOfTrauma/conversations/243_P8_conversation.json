    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mr. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel... I don't know, kind of shaky? It's like I'm back there again, in that hospital room, strapped down and helpless. I can still smell the antiseptic and hear the beeping of the machines.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I guess. And anger. I keep thinking about how they treated me, like I wasn't even a person. Just a... a problem to be dealt with. I remember the cold metal of the restraints on my wrists and ankles. God, I felt so powerless.",
    "Therapist: How does that powerlessness feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a weight on my chest. Makes it hard to breathe sometimes. And my muscles are all tense, like I'm ready to fight or run away. But I couldn't do either back then. I was just... stuck.",
    "Therapist: And now?",
    "Client: Now? I... I guess I'm not stuck anymore, am I? But sometimes it still feels like I am. Like I'm trapped in that memory, you know? It's hard to shake off that feeling of helplessness.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts come with that feeling?",
    "Client: I think... I think about how unfair it all was. How they didn't listen to me, didn't believe me when I said I wasn't a danger to myself or others. I keep wondering what I could have done differently, if there was something I could have said to make them understand.",
    "Therapist: Hmm. How does that reflection impact you?",
    "Client: It makes me angry, honestly. And sad. I spent so much of my life helping others, you know? I was a teacher for 40 years. And then suddenly, I'm treated like I'm nothing. Like my words don't matter. It... it shook my faith in people, in the system. I used to trust doctors, but now... I don't know.",
    "Therapist: What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm realizing how much this experience has changed me. I used to be more outgoing, more trusting. Now I'm always on edge, always waiting for the other shoe to drop. It's exhausting, living like that. And it's not just me it affects - it's my relationships too. My kids, my grandkids... I feel like I've become a burden to them.",
    "Therapist: How does that thought sit with you?",
    "Client: It hurts. It really hurts. I never wanted to be a burden. I've always prided myself on being independent, on being the one people could rely on. Now... now I'm the one who needs help. It's... it's humiliating, in a way. Makes me feel old and useless.",
    "Therapist: I hear that's painful. What else?",
    "Client: I... I guess I'm also realizing that I'm still angry at myself. For not fighting harder, for not standing up for myself more. I keep thinking that if I had just been stronger, maybe things would have been different. But then I remember how scared I was, how confused and disoriented. It's... it's a lot to process.",
    "Therapist: Indeed. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired. Really tired. But also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Talking about it... it's hard, but it also feels like I'm letting go of something. Like I'm not carrying it all alone anymore. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. What's that like for you?",
    "Client: It's... it's a relief, I think. But also scary. I've been holding onto this for so long, it's become a part of me. Letting go... it's like I'm losing a piece of myself. But maybe... maybe that's not such a bad thing? I don't know. I'm just... I'm ready for things to be different.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. How so?",
    "Client: I want to feel like myself again. To be able to trust people, to not always be waiting for the worst to happen. I want to be present for my family without this cloud hanging over me. I'm tired of feeling like a victim. I want to feel... I don't know, empowered maybe? Like I have control over my life again.",
    "Therapist: What would that look like?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. I guess it would mean being able to go to doctor's appointments without having a panic attack. Being able to talk about what happened without feeling like I'm right back there. Maybe even being able to use my experience to help others somehow. I used to be good at that, you know? Helping people. I'd like to feel that way again.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful vision. How does it feel to imagine that?",
    "Client: It feels... hopeful. And a little scary. But mostly hopeful. Like maybe there's a light at the end of this tunnel after all. I haven't felt that way in a long time. It's... it's nice.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad you're feeling that. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. This has been... intense. But good. Thank you for listening, for helping me work through this. I know I've got a long way to go, but... I think I'm ready to keep moving forward.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Take care."
