    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving that animal attack during the flood... it's brought up a lot of emotions I've been trying to push down for a long time. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel a bit shaky.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sounds, I think. The roaring of the floodwaters, the panicked screams of people around me, and then that terrifying growl of the crocodile. It's like I was right back there in that moment, you know? I could almost feel the muddy water around my legs and the panic rising in my chest.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. Scary, but also... I don't know, maybe a bit liberating? Like, I've been avoiding thinking about this for so long, and now that I've faced it, it's still awful, but it doesn't have quite the same power over me. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it does. Can you elaborate on that?",
    "Client: Well, it's like... for years, I've been having these nightmares and flashbacks, always feeling on edge, especially during rainy season. But going through it step by step like this, it's helping me see it as just a memory. A terrible one, sure, but not something that's actively happening to me right now. I'm safe here, even if my body doesn't always believe it.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. How does this connect to your daily life?",
    "Client: I guess it explains a lot about why I've been so anxious lately. My partner's been wanting to plan a trip to the coast, and I've been making excuses not to go. The thought of being near water... it just brings it all back. And I feel guilty because I know she doesn't understand why I'm so reluctant.",
    "Therapist: What might help you feel more comfortable in those situations?",
    "Client: Hmm... Maybe talking to my partner about what happened? I've never really told her the full story. And perhaps... I don't know, maybe starting small? Like, visiting a local park with a pond before diving into a beach vacation?",
    "Therapist: Those sound like thoughtful steps. How do you feel about trying that?",
    "Client: Nervous, but... hopeful? I mean, if I can sit here and talk about the attack without falling apart, maybe I can start reclaiming other parts of my life too. It's not going to be easy, but I think I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: That's a brave outlook. What else came up for you during the exposure?",
    "Client: I realized how much anger I've been carrying. Not just about the attack itself, but about how it's affected my life. I used to love outdoor activities, you know? Hiking, fishing, camping. Now I can barely watch nature documentaries without getting anxious. It's like that crocodile didn't just attack me physically, it took away a part of who I am.",
    "Therapist: How might you start reclaiming that part of yourself?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe start small, like we talked about? Perhaps watching some of those nature shows, but with my partner there for support. Or maybe joining a support group for trauma survivors? I've been avoiding that, but hearing how others cope might help.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent ideas. How are you feeling now compared to before?",
    "Client: Still a bit shaky, but... lighter, I think? Like I've put down a heavy backpack I've been carrying for years. I know we'll have to do this again, and it won't be easy, but for the first time in a long while, I feel like there might be a way through this. Thank you for guiding me through it.",
    "Therapist: You did the hard work. What's your main takeaway from today's session?",
    "Client: That I'm stronger than I thought. And that avoiding the memory hasn't been protecting me, it's been holding me back. It's scary to face it, but it's also... freeing, in a way. I think I'm ready to start really dealing with this, to stop letting that one terrible day define the rest of my life."
