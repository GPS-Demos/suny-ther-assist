    "Therapist: Welcome back. Today we'll focus on an imaginal exposure exercise. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so... I'm a bit nervous, to be honest. This cyber bullying stuff still really gets to me.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're in control. Let's start with your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 4 right now. Just thinking about it makes my stomach churn a bit.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Take a deep breath and describe the memory.",
    "Client: Well, it started when I posted about the earthquake relief efforts... Suddenly, my notifications exploded. People were calling me terrible names, saying I was attention-seeking, that I didn't really care about the victims. It felt like a tidal wave of hate...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's climbing. Maybe a 6? My hands are getting clammy, and I can feel my heart racing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The messages just kept coming. Some people even found my personal information and started threatening me. I felt so exposed, so vulnerable. It was like the earthquake all over again, but this time, the ground shaking was inside me. I couldn't eat, couldn't sleep...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. God, I can almost feel my phone vibrating with those hateful messages. My chest feels tight, and I'm having trouble breathing.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay... I'm trying. It's just... it felt like the whole world was against me. I wanted to help, you know? After surviving the earthquake, I thought I could make a difference. But instead, I became a target. It was like surviving one disaster only to be thrown into another.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS?",
    "Client: Still pretty high... maybe a 7? My hands are shaking a bit, but I think I can continue.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage. Keep going.",
    "Client: I ended up deleting all my social media accounts. I felt so ashamed, so isolated. It was like I was trapped in my apartment, afraid to reach out to anyone. The cyber bullying brought back all those feelings of helplessness from the earthquake. I couldn't trust anyone, couldn't feel safe anywhere...",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually coming down a bit. Maybe a 6? Talking about it... it's hard, but it's also kind of relieving.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: My breathing is steadier now. I still feel a bit shaky, but not as bad as before. It's like... like I'm starting to see it from a distance, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's a positive sign. Continue with the memory.",
    "Client: Over time, I started to realize that those bullies didn't define me. My friends, the ones who stuck by me, they helped me see that. It was a slow process, but I began to rebuild my confidence. I still have moments of doubt, but I'm learning to trust again...",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS rating?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's down to a 4 now. Talking about how I've grown from this, it helps put things in perspective.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable resilience. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Drained, but... also kind of proud? Like, I faced this memory head-on, and I'm still standing. It doesn't have the same power over me that it used to.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's wrap up here. Well done today."
