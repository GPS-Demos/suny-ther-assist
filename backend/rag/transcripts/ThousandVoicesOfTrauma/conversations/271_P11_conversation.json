    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's like I was right back there, you know? The chaos, the fear, the uncertainty of leaving everything behind. It's still so vivid in my mind.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The moment we had to say goodbye to my grandmother. She was too old to make the journey, and... (voice breaks) we knew we might never see her again. I can still see her face, trying to be strong for us, but I could tell she was heartbroken.",
    "Therapist: That sounds incredibly difficult. How did it feel to revisit that memory?",
    "Client: It was... overwhelming. I felt this crushing guilt, like I abandoned her. But at the same time, I know we had no choice. We had to leave to survive. It's just... it's a lot to process, you know?",
    "Therapist: I hear you. How does this connect to your day-to-day life now?",
    "Client: I think... I think it's why I struggle with goodbyes so much. Even small ones. I'm always afraid it might be the last time I see someone. And I push people away sometimes, because it feels safer than risking that pain again.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How might recognizing this help you moving forward?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I can try to be more present in my relationships? Instead of always worrying about losing people, I could focus on appreciating the time we have together. It's just... it's scary to open up like that.",
    "Therapist: It takes courage. What's one small step you could take?",
    "Client: I guess... I could start by telling my partner how much they mean to me. I tend to hold back, but maybe sharing those feelings could help.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great idea. How are you feeling about continuing with these exposures?",
    "Client: It's tough, really tough. But... I think it's helping? I'm starting to understand myself better, even if it hurts. I just hope it gets easier.",
    "Therapist: It's normal to find it challenging. What helps you get through it?",
    "Client: Honestly? Knowing that you're here, listening without judgment. And reminding myself that I'm doing this to heal, to have a better life. It's hard, but... I think it's worth it.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad you feel supported. Is there anything else you want to share?",
    "Client: I... I'm proud of myself for doing this. It's not easy to face these memories, but I'm doing it. And that's something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Your courage is commendable. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Thank you for guiding me through this. It means a lot to have someone who understands and doesn't rush me. I'm exhausted, but I feel... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Take care of yourself this week.",
    "Client: I will. And... thank you. Really. I know I say it a lot, but I mean it. This process is changing my life, even if it's hard to see sometimes. I'm looking forward to our next session, even though I know it'll be challenging. But I feel like I'm finally moving forward, you know?",
    "Therapist: I'm glad you feel that way. See you next week."
