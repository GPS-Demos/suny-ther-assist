    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. There's a mix of emotions. Part of me wants to get this over with, but another part is terrified of revisiting those memories. It's like my stomach is in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 60? My heart's already racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I guess so. *deep breath* Where should I start?",
    "Therapist: Start with the day you were imprisoned. Describe it as if it's happening now.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm... I'm standing in my kitchen. It's early morning, and I'm making coffee. The house is quiet. Suddenly, there's a loud banging on the door. My heart jumps into my throat. I... I freeze. The banging continues, and I hear shouting. \"Police! Open up!\" I can't move. I'm trembling. My mind is racing, trying to understand what's happening.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What do you see? Hear? Feel?",
    "Client: I see the steam rising from my coffee mug. I hear my own rapid breathing, the pounding on the door echoing through the house. I feel... I feel like I'm going to be sick. My hands are shaking so badly I can barely hold onto the counter.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: They... they break down the door. The sound is deafening. I jump, knocking over my coffee mug. It shatters on the floor. Officers pour into my house, guns drawn. They're yelling at me to get down, but I can't comprehend what they're saying. It's like I'm underwater. One of them grabs my arm, roughly pulling me to the ground. The cold tile presses against my cheek. I'm... I'm crying now, begging them to tell me what's happening.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 75. My heart is pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Remember, this is just a memory. Keep going when you're ready.",
    "Client: *exhales slowly* Okay... They're handcuffing me. The metal is cold and biting into my wrists. I'm still in my pajamas as they drag me outside. My neighbors are watching from their windows and porches. I feel so exposed, so humiliated. They push me into the back of a police car. I can't stop shaking. I keep asking what I've done, but no one will answer me. The car starts moving, and I realize I'm leaving my home, my life, everything I know. I don't know if I'll ever come back.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I can't believe this is happening. I feel so helpless, so scared. I'm thinking about my husband, wondering if he knows what's happening. I'm worried about our business, our reputation. Everything we've worked for... it feels like it's crumbling around me. And I... I feel so alone. So incredibly alone.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 80 now. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel your feet on the floor.",
    "Client: *takes a deep breath* Okay... I'm at the police station now. They're processing me, taking my fingerprints, my photo. I feel like a criminal, but I haven't done anything wrong. I still don't know why I'm here. They take me to a holding cell. It's small, cold, and smells of disinfectant and sweat. The door clangs shut behind me, and the sound... it's so final. I sink onto the hard bench and wrap my arms around myself. I'm still in my pajamas. I've never felt so vulnerable in my life.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My shoulders are so tense they're aching. My stomach is churning. I feel... I feel small. Like I'm shrinking into myself.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What happens next?",
    "Client: Hours pass. Or maybe it's days. Time loses all meaning in that cell. I'm questioning everything. Did I do something wrong without realizing it? Is this all a terrible mistake? No one tells me anything. I'm given food, but I can't eat. I'm allowed to make a phone call, but my husband doesn't answer. I leave a message, my voice breaking as I try to explain what's happening. The uncertainty is the worst part. Not knowing why I'm here, how long I'll be here, what's going to happen to me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still around 80. My hands are shaking just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. This is just a memory. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *nods* Finally, after what feels like an eternity, someone comes to talk to me. It's a lawyer, not mine, just someone appointed to me. He explains that I'm being accused of fraud related to our business. I'm... I'm in shock. I try to explain that there must be a mistake, but he just keeps talking about bail and court dates. It's all so overwhelming. I feel like I'm drowning in legal jargon and accusations.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind at this point?",
    "Client: I... I can't believe this is happening. I'm angry, scared, confused. I keep thinking about all the people who must be talking about me, judging me. I'm worried about our employees, our clients. Everything we've built... it feels like it's slipping away. And I... I feel so betrayed. By the system, by everyone who's supposed to protect innocent people. I thought things like this only happened in movies or to bad people. Not to me. Not to us.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My SUDS is probably around 85. I feel... I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Focus on your breathing. In through your nose, out through your mouth.",
    "Client: *breathes deeply* Okay... I'm in court now. The courtroom is packed. I can feel everyone's eyes on me. My husband is there, looking worried and confused. I want to run to him, but I can't. I'm led to a table with my lawyer. The judge starts speaking, but I can barely focus on the words. All I can think about is how I ended up here, in this nightmare. They're talking about bail. It's set so high... I don't know how we'll afford it. I'm terrified they won't let me go home.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I feel... I feel exposed. Vulnerable. Like everyone can see right through me. My legs are shaking so badly I'm afraid I might collapse. I'm trying to look strong, but inside I'm falling apart.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: By some miracle, we manage to post bail. I'm released, but it doesn't feel like freedom. I have to wear an ankle monitor. I can't leave the house except for approved appointments. Our assets are frozen. Our business is in shambles. Friends stop calling. It's like... it's like I've become a pariah overnight. The worst part is, I still don't fully understand what I'm accused of. Every day is a struggle to keep going, to fight these charges, to prove my innocence.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: My SUDS is... it's around 90. I feel like I'm right back there, reliving it all.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. This is just a memory. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *breathes deeply* It's... it's hard. Even now, years later, I still feel the effects. The fear, the humiliation, the sense of injustice. We were eventually cleared of all charges, but the damage was done. Our business never fully recovered. Some friends never came back. I... I still have nightmares about being locked up, about losing everything. I don't trust the system anymore. I'm always looking over my shoulder, waiting for the other shoe to drop.",
    "Therapist: You've been through a lot. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. My SUDS is probably down to about 75 now. Talking about it... it's hard, but there's also a sense of relief. Like I'm finally letting it out.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",
    "Client: *nods* Okay... I'm here. In your office. I'm safe. It's over.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You're safe now. How do you feel about what we've discussed today?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. But also... I don't know, cathartic? I've never really talked about it like this before. It's always been too painful.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. You've shown great courage today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I think I need some time to process all of this.",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll end our session here. Remember to use the coping strategies we've discussed if you feel overwhelmed later.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you for... for listening. For helping me face this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Sarah. I'm proud of the work you've done today. We'll continue next week."
