    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. My stomach's been in knots all morning thinking about this.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess so. Where should I start?",
    "Therapist: Start by describing the scene just before the hostage situation began.",
    "Client: Okay... Um, I was at the bank. It was a Friday afternoon, and I remember thinking about my weekend plans. The line was moving slowly, and I was getting impatient. I kept checking my watch...",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: There are about ten people in line. The tellers look bored. I can smell someone's perfume... it's too strong. And then... oh god...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: The doors burst open. Three men in masks rush in, waving guns. One of them fires a shot into the ceiling. Everyone screams. I... I freeze. My heart is pounding so hard...",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Um... maybe 70? My hands are shaking just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Remember, you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Right... So, one of the men is shouting for everyone to get down. I drop to the floor, my legs feel like jelly. The marble is cold against my cheek. I can hear sobbing, probably from the woman next to me.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking in that moment?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking this can't be real. It has to be a nightmare. I'm trying to wake myself up, but I can't. And then I start worrying about my family, wondering if I'll ever see them again...",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you feel in your body?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. It's hard to breathe. My mouth is dry, and I can taste something metallic... fear, I guess. I'm shaking all over, and I feel like I might throw up.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Maria. Take a slow, deep breath.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Okay... The robbers are yelling at the bank manager now. They want him to open the vault. One of them is pacing, keeping an eye on us. His boots are so loud on the floor... each step makes me flinch.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: Someone's cell phone rings. The pacing robber freaks out. He grabs the person \u2013 an older man \u2013 and drags him to his feet. He's screaming at him, asking if he called the cops. The old man is crying, saying it's probably his wife...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Terrified. I'm... I'm 85, maybe 90 on that scale now. My heart is racing just talking about it.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here in my office. This is just a memory. Take another deep breath.",
    "Client: *breathes deeply* Okay... The robber hits the old man with his gun. There's blood. I close my eyes, but I can still hear the thud as he falls to the ground. Someone near me is praying softly in Spanish.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you experiencing?",
    "Client: I feel so helpless. I want to help the old man, but I'm paralyzed with fear. I can smell his blood. It mixes with the scent of gunpowder from the earlier shot. I'm trembling so hard I think the robbers will notice me.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Maria. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 85 now? I feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Remember, you survived this. You're here now, safe.",
    "Client: Right... safe... Um, so the vault is open now. Two of the robbers are inside, shoving money into bags. The one watching us keeps fidgeting, checking his watch. He seems nervous, which makes me even more scared.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking at this point?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm praying they'll just leave. Take the money and go. But I'm also worried they might not want to leave witnesses. I keep imagining them shooting us all before they leave. My mind is racing with all these horrible scenarios...",
    "Therapist: Stay present with what's actually happening. What do you observe?",
    "Client: I hear sirens in the distance. The robbers start panicking. They're shouting at each other. One of them grabs me and another woman. He says we're going with them... as human shields. Oh god, I thought I was going to die right then...",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. You're safe now.",
    "Client: *breathes shakily* He pulls me up roughly. My legs are numb from being on the floor so long. I stumble, and he jerks me hard. It hurts. The other woman is crying hysterically. We're being dragged towards the exit.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I'm thinking about my parents. How they'll react when they hear I've been taken. I'm thinking about all the things I never got to do. And I'm angry... so angry that this is happening to me.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that anger. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still pretty high. Maybe 80? My hands are sweating just talking about this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well, Maria. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... We're outside now. The sunlight is blinding after being inside. There are police cars everywhere. I can hear helicopters. The robber holding me tightens his grip. The gun is pressed against my temple. It's cold and hard...",
    "Therapist: What do you feel in your body at this moment?",
    "Client: I'm shaking uncontrollably. My heart is pounding so hard I think it might explode. I can barely breathe. The adrenaline is making me feel light-headed. I think I might pass out...",
    "Therapist: You're safe here, Maria. This is just a memory. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Right... The police are shouting at the robbers to let us go. Everything seems to be moving in slow motion. I can smell the robber's sweat. He's yelling something, but I can't make out the words over the sound of my own heartbeat in my ears.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud bang. At first, I think I've been shot, but then the robber's grip loosens. He falls, taking me down with him. There's chaos. People are shouting. Someone grabs me and pulls me away. It's a police officer. I'm safe, but I can't stop shaking...",
    "Therapist: You made it through, Maria. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I'm exhausted. Drained. But also... relieved? My distress level is maybe down to a 60 now. It's... it's over.",
    "Therapist: You did incredibly well today, Maria. How do you feel about the session?",
    "Client: It was tough... really tough. But I feel like I faced it, you know? Like maybe it doesn't have as much power over me now.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves before we end."
