    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Ah, you know... I'm feeling a bit... unsettled, I guess. It's been a rough week, thinking about this car accident again. I've been having more nightmares lately.",
    "Therapist: I understand. Let's start with a SUDS rating. How would you rate your distress right now, 0 to 100?",
    "Client: Hmm... probably around a 60. My stomach's in knots just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin the imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Yeah, I think so. Let's do this.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes if you're comfortable. Take us back to that day...",
    "Client: Okay... It's a sunny afternoon. I'm driving home from work, taking the usual route. The radio's on, playing some old salsa music. I remember feeling... content, you know? Just looking forward to getting home to Maria.",
    "Therapist: Good. What do you see around you?",
    "Client: I see the familiar streets, the trees lining the road. There's not much traffic. I'm approaching the intersection where it happened... My hands are starting to sweat just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that moment. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I see the other car. It's coming fast from the right. Too fast. I realize it's not stopping at the red light. My heart starts racing. I try to swerve, but there's no time. The impact... it's so loud. Metal crunching, glass shattering. I feel this... this incredible force pushing me sideways.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. My hands are shaking. It's like I'm back there, you know?",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Remember to breathe. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Takes a shaky breath) The airbag deploys. It hits me hard in the face. There's this... this burning smell. Smoke, maybe? I'm disoriented. Everything's spinning. I taste blood in my mouth. I'm trying to move, but my leg... it's trapped. The pain hits me all at once. It's excruciating.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I'm panicking. I think, \"This is it. I'm going to die here.\" I'm scared I'll never see Maria again. I'm angry at the other driver. Why weren't they paying attention? I hear people shouting outside. Someone's calling for help.",
    "Therapist: How would you rate your distress now, 0 to 100?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 80 now. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Carlos. Remember, you survived this. You're here now, safe.",
    "Client: (Nods) Right, right. I'm here. (Pauses) I'm still in the car. The pain is... it's overwhelming. I can smell gasoline. I'm terrified the car might catch fire. I'm calling out for help, but my voice sounds weak. I can barely hear myself over the ringing in my ears.",
    "Therapist: What do you see around you in the car?",
    "Client: Everything's a mess. There's glass everywhere. The dashboard is crumpled. I see blood on my shirt. My family photo... the one I keep in my wallet... it's on the floor, covered in glass. That hits me hard. I think about my kids, how I might not see them grow up.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. You're doing well.",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) I hear sirens in the distance. They seem so far away. I'm starting to feel lightheaded. The pain is... it's becoming duller. I'm scared I might pass out. I keep thinking about Maria, about our plans for the weekend. Will I make it? Will I be okay?",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. My heart's pounding. It feels so real, like I'm back there.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're here with me. You're safe. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Inhales deeply) Okay... okay. The paramedics arrive. I hear them working on the door, trying to get it open. There's a lot of commotion. Someone's talking to me, asking my name, telling me to stay calm. But I'm fading in and out. The pain comes in waves.",
    "Therapist: What sensations are you experiencing in your body?",
    "Client: My whole body aches. My head is throbbing. I feel this pressure on my chest, like I can't breathe properly. And my leg... it's like it's on fire.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. You're doing great, Carlos.",
    "Client: They finally get the door open. I feel a rush of fresh air. Someone's putting a neck brace on me. They're asking me questions, but I'm having trouble focusing. I keep thinking about my family, about all the things I still want to do. I'm scared this might be the end.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still around 80. Maybe 85. This is intense.",
    "Therapist: You're handling it well. Remember, you're here now, telling the story. You survived.",
    "Client: (Nods) Yeah... yeah, I did. They're moving me onto a backboard. The pain is excruciating when they lift me. I cry out. I hear them saying something about internal bleeding, but it's all a blur. I'm in the ambulance now. The sirens are so loud. I'm fading in and out of consciousness.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind in the ambulance?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm praying. Begging God to let me live. I'm thinking about all the things I regret, all the things I still want to do. I'm scared I'll never see my family again. The paramedic is talking to me, trying to keep me awake, but it's getting harder to focus.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Carlos. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: We arrive at the hospital. Everything's moving so fast. Bright lights, people shouting. I'm wheeled into the ER. I hear someone say my blood pressure is dropping. I'm terrified. I manage to ask about calling my wife, but I don't know if anyone hears me. Then... then everything goes black.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. My heart's still racing. It's like I've lived through it all over again.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well, Carlos. Let's take some deep breaths together.",
    "Client: (Breathes deeply) It's still so vivid, you know? Even after all this time.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's come down a bit. Maybe 70?",
    "Therapist: That's good. You've processed a lot today. How are you feeling about the session?",
    "Client: It was tough, but... I don't know. Maybe a little relieving? Like I've faced it head-on.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. We'll work on processing these emotions further. For now, let's do a grounding exercise before we end.",
    "Client: Okay. Yeah, that sounds good.",
    "Therapist: Alright, let's start by focusing on five things you can see in this room..."
