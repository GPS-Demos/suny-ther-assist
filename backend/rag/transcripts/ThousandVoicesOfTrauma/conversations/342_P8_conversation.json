    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. My heart's still racing a bit. It's like I can still hear the growling, you know? That moment when the dog lunged at me... it's so vivid. I can feel the fear rising in my chest again.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What physical sensations are you noticing right now?",
    "Client: Well, my palms are sweaty, and there's this tightness in my throat. It's like... like I can't swallow properly. And my shoulders are so tense, I hadn't even realized until now. It's as if my body's still bracing for impact, even though I know I'm safe here.",
    "Therapist: I see. And what thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... what if I hadn't been able to get away? What if it had been worse? And then I feel guilty because I know it wasn't as bad as it could have been, but I still can't shake this fear. It's like... like I'm always on edge now, waiting for something to attack me.",
    "Therapist: How does that feeling of being on edge affect you day-to-day?",
    "Client: It's exhausting, really. I'm constantly scanning my environment, especially when I'm outside. Every sudden movement makes me flinch. And the worst part is, I used to love animals. Now, even seeing a dog on a leash across the street makes my heart race. It's affecting my work too - I'm self-employed, and sometimes I need to visit clients' homes. I'm always worried they might have a dog.",
    "Therapist: What do you make of these changes in your life?",
    "Client: I... I hate it. I feel like I've lost a part of myself. I used to be this carefree, animal-loving person, and now I'm... I'm just scared all the time. It's frustrating because logically, I know not every dog is going to attack me, but my body doesn't seem to understand that. And it's not just dogs - I'm jumpier in general. The other day, my husband came into the room unexpectedly, and I nearly leapt out of my skin.",
    "Therapist: How has this experience affected your relationships?",
    "Client: Well, my husband's been really supportive, but I can tell he's worried about me. We used to love going for walks in the park, but now I avoid it. And our friends... they don't really understand. They keep saying things like \"It's been months, aren't you over it yet?\" And that just makes me feel worse, like there's something wrong with me for not being able to move past this.",
    "Therapist: What emotions come up when you think about your recovery journey?",
    "Client: It's a mix, really. Sometimes I feel hopeful, like when I manage to walk past a dog without panicking. But other times, I feel so discouraged. It's like... two steps forward, one step back. And there's this underlying anger too - anger at the dog, at the owner who didn't have it on a leash, and... and at myself for not being able to just 'get over it'.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with these intense emotions?",
    "Client: I... I try to use the breathing exercises we've practiced. Sometimes they help, but other times it feels like the anxiety is just too overwhelming. I've started journaling too, which helps me process my thoughts. But there are days when I just want to stay in bed and avoid the world. My chronic pain doesn't help either - it's like my body's constantly reminding me of my vulnerability.",
    "Therapist: What have you learned about yourself through this process?",
    "Client: That's... that's a tough one. I guess I've realized I'm stronger than I thought. Even on my worst days, I'm still here, still trying. And I've learned to be more compassionate towards myself. I used to beat myself up for being 'weak', but now I'm trying to acknowledge that what I went through was genuinely traumatic. It's a process, though. Some days are better than others.",
    "Therapist: How do you see your future as you continue to work through this?",
    "Client: I... I want to believe it gets better. I hope that one day I can walk in the park again without fear. Maybe even pat a friendly dog. But right now, that feels so far away. I just... I want to feel like myself again. To not have this constant undercurrent of fear in my life. I know it might not ever be exactly the same as before, but I hope I can find a new normal that isn't dictated by fear.",
    "Therapist: What small step could you take towards that future?",
    "Client: I've been thinking... maybe I could start by looking at pictures of dogs. Just on my phone, where I know they can't hurt me. It sounds silly, but even that feels challenging right now. But I think... I think I could try that. Maybe work up to watching videos with the sound off. It's not much, but it's a start, right?",
    "Therapist: That's a thoughtful approach. How does considering this step make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of emotions, really. There's a part of me that feels a glimmer of hope - like maybe this could be the beginning of taking my life back. But there's also this knot of anxiety in my stomach. What if even looking at pictures is too much? What if I have a panic attack just from that? But... but I also feel a tiny bit proud for even considering it. It's like I'm finally ready to start pushing back against this fear, even if it's just in a small way.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to you to overcome this fear?",
    "Client: God, it would mean everything. It would be like... like reclaiming my freedom. To be able to go for a walk without constantly looking over my shoulder, to visit friends without worrying about their pets, to just... exist without this constant undercurrent of fear. It would mean I could fully engage with my work again, maybe even expand my client base without worrying about potential dogs. And with my family... I could be present again, you know? Not always distracted by my own anxiety. It's like... it would be like coming home to myself.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful vision. How can we work towards that?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to take it slow. Maybe we could work on a plan together? Start with those pictures, like I mentioned, and then gradually work up to more challenging situations. And... and I think I need to work on accepting that it's okay if progress isn't linear. Some days might be harder than others, and that's okay. I also wonder if... if there are any support groups for people who've been through similar experiences? It might help to talk to others who really understand.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent ideas. Shall we discuss them further next session?",
    "Client: Yes, I'd like that. I feel... I feel a bit lighter now, actually. Like maybe there's a way forward. It's still scary, and I know it won't be easy, but... but I feel like I can see a path now, even if it's just the first few steps. Thank you for listening and helping me work through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue this journey together. Take care until next time."
