    "Therapist: Alright, Sarah. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm nervous, but I'll try my best.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the moment you discovered the cyberbullying posts.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm sitting at my desk, scrolling through my phone. My heart starts racing as I see the first post. It's a photo of me from last week's company event, but they've edited it to make me look... grotesque. The caption is cruel, mocking my appearance and my recent promotion. I feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Um, probably a 7 out of 10. My palms are sweaty just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Thank you. Continue.",
    "Client: As I keep scrolling, there are more posts. Comments from people I thought were my friends. They're saying I didn't deserve the promotion, that I must have... slept my way to the top. I feel so betrayed and humiliated. My chest feels tight, and I'm struggling to breathe normally.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. I feel so exposed and vulnerable.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I remember calling my husband, barely able to speak through my tears. He rushed home, but by then, I'd already seen dozens of hateful messages. I felt so alone, even with him there. It reminded me of when I lost my sister - that same overwhelming sense of isolation and helplessness.",
    "Therapist: SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's a 9. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (inhales shakily) It's just... it's all coming back. The shame, the anger. I wanted to disappear. I still do sometimes.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. SUDS?",
    "Client: Still a 9. My heart's pounding.",
    "Therapist: Keep breathing. What happened next?",
    "Client: I... I shut down my social media accounts. Stopped going to work. I couldn't face anyone. The thought of people seeing those posts, judging me... it was unbearable. I felt like I'd lost everything I'd worked for.",

    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Back to a 9. I miss her so much.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that. You're doing great.",
    "Client: (voice breaking) I just felt so alone. Like I'd lost my sister all over again. The cyberbullying... it brought back all those feelings of loss and abandonment.",
    "Therapist: SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Talking about it... it's hard, but I feel a little less overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. Keep going.",
    "Client: I started having nightmares. Dreaming of people pointing and laughing at me, of my sister turning her back on me. I'd wake up in cold sweats. During the day, I'd jump every time my phone buzzed, terrified of more cruel messages.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's a 7 now. Remembering is still painful, but... I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. You're doing well.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's... it's getting easier to talk about. I'm starting to see that those posts don't define me. I'm more than what they said about me.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's down to a 6. I feel... lighter, somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... okay. Like I've faced something I've been avoiding for a long time.",
