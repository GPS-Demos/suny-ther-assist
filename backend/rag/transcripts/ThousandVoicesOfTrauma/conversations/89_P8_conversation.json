    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Ahmed?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaky, to be honest. My hands are trembling slightly, and there's this tightness in my chest. It's like I'm right back there in that moment, you know? The sounds of gunfire, the smell of smoke... it's all so vivid.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix of things. There's this overwhelming sense of guilt. I keep seeing the faces of my fellow soldiers, especially those who didn't make it. I feel like I should have done more, should have been faster, smarter. And then there's this... anger. It bubbles up inside me, directed at the enemy, at the situation, even at myself.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a fire in my gut. My jaw is clenched, and I notice I'm balling my fists. But it's not just anger. There's fear too. Even though I know I'm safe here, my body is still on high alert, like I'm waiting for the next attack.",
    "Therapist: And what thoughts are accompanying these feelings?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why did I survive when others didn't?\" It doesn't seem fair. And then I think about how this experience has changed me. I'm not the same person I was before the war. Sometimes I wonder if my wife even recognizes me anymore. There's this... disconnect between who I was and who I am now.",
    "Therapist: How do you see that disconnect affecting you?",
    "Client: It's... it's like I'm living two lives. There's the me before the war - carefree, optimistic, full of plans for the future. And then there's... this version of me. Always on edge, struggling to connect with others, plagued by these memories. I feel like I've lost a part of myself, and I don't know how to get it back.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really challenging. What else are you noticing?",
    "Client: I... I'm realizing that I've been holding onto these memories so tightly. It's like they've become a part of my identity. But going through this exercise, reliving it... it's painful, but it's also... I don't know, maybe freeing in a way? Like I'm finally allowing myself to process what happened instead of just trying to push it down.",
    "Therapist: Mm. How does that feel, allowing yourself to process it?",
    "Client: It's... it's scary. But also... maybe a little hopeful? I've spent so long trying to avoid these memories, thinking that if I didn't think about them, they'd go away. But they haven't. They've just been there, under the surface, affecting everything. Maybe... maybe facing them head-on is the only way forward.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. What do you think that means for your recovery?",
    "Client: I think... I think it means I need to be braver. Not the kind of bravery I needed in combat, but a different kind. The bravery to face these memories, to feel these feelings, even when it's uncomfortable. And maybe... maybe it means I need to be gentler with myself too. I've been so angry at myself for so long, but maybe that's not helping.",
    "Therapist: How might being gentler with yourself look?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. I guess it might mean acknowledging that what I went through was really difficult, and that it's okay that I'm still struggling with it. Maybe it means allowing myself to feel sad or scared without judging those feelings. And perhaps... perhaps it means reaching out for help more, like talking to my wife about what I'm going through instead of trying to handle it all on my own.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like meaningful steps. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, to be honest. But it's a different kind of tired. Not the bone-deep weariness I usually feel after thinking about these memories, but more... I don't know, like I've done something important. My heart rate has slowed down, and that tightness in my chest has eased a bit. I feel... drained, but also a little lighter.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. What would help you feel grounded right now?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need a moment of quiet. Maybe some deep breaths. And then... I'd like to call my wife. Just hearing her voice, I think that would help bring me back to the present, remind me that I'm here, now, and that I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. Shall we take a few deep breaths together?",
    "Client: Yes, I'd like that. Thank you... for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I think... I think it's necessary. And maybe, just maybe, it's the start of something better.",
    "Therapist: You're very welcome, Ahmed. I'm here to support you through this journey."
