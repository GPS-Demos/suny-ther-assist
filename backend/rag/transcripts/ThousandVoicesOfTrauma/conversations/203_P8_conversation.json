    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. I can still see the hospital room so vividly. The beeping of the machines, the smell of disinfectant... it's all there.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you right now?",
    "Client: My heart is pounding. I feel this tightness in my chest, like I can't breathe properly. It's the same feeling I had when the doctor walked in with that look on his face. I knew something was wrong, but I couldn't process it. And now, reliving it... it's like I'm right back there, hearing those words again.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why me?\" Why did I have to go through this? And then I feel guilty for even asking that because so many people have it worse. But I can't shake this feeling of unfairness. Like, I did everything right, you know? I ate well, exercised, never smoked... and still, this happened. And then there's this voice in my head saying maybe it's because I'm Latino. Maybe they didn't care as much, maybe they missed something because of who I am.",
    "Therapist: How does that thought make you feel?",
    "Client: Angry. So angry. And scared. Because if that's true, then what's to stop it from happening again? I feel like I can't trust anyone in the medical system now. Every time I see a doctor or a nurse, I'm wondering if they're really seeing me, or if they're just seeing my skin color.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really challenging.",
    "Client: It is. And you know what's worse? I feel like I can't even talk to my parents about this. They're so proud that I'm living with them again, that I have a good job. They see it as success, but I feel like I've failed. I'm 51, single, living with my parents because of this medical issue. It's embarrassing. And I can't burden them with these thoughts about racial bias. They've been through so much already.",
    "Therapist: What do you think would happen if you shared these feelings with them?",
    "Client: I... I don't know. Part of me thinks they'd understand. They've faced discrimination too. But another part of me is afraid they'll think I'm being paranoid or ungrateful. They're just so happy I'm alive and recovering. I don't want to take that away from them.",
    "Therapist: How does keeping this from them affect you?",
    "Client: It's exhausting. I feel like I'm living a double life. At work, I'm the professional who's bounced back. At home, I'm the dutiful son. But inside, I'm a mess of anger and fear and doubt. Sometimes I feel like I'm going to explode.",
    "Therapist: What would it look like to let some of that out?",
    "Client: Honestly? I'm not sure. I've spent so long holding it in. The thought of letting it out is... it's scary. What if I can't stop once I start? What if I say something I can't take back? But at the same time, there's a part of me that's desperate to just scream, to let it all out.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you think about that?",
    "Client: It's... it's like there's this energy building up. My muscles are tense, especially in my jaw and my fists. I can feel this heat in my chest, like a ball of fire. And my throat... it feels tight, like all these words are stuck there, trying to get out.",
    "Therapist: What do those words want to say?",
    "Client: They want to say... \"I'm hurting. I'm scared. I don't know if I'll ever feel safe again.\" They want to scream, \"Why didn't you protect me?\" to the doctors, to the system, maybe even to myself. And they want to whisper, \"I need help. I can't do this alone anymore.\"",
    "Therapist: That's a lot to carry. What do you need right now?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to breathe. Just... just sit with this for a moment. It's the first time I've really let myself feel all of this. It's overwhelming, but also... there's a tiny bit of relief. Like maybe, just maybe, I don't have to keep holding it all in.",
    "Therapist: Take all the time you need. I'm here.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I appreciate that. It's strange, you know? I came here thinking we'd just talk about the medical stuff, but this... this feels important too. Like maybe the trauma isn't just about what happened in the hospital, but how it's changed everything. My relationship with my body, with the medical system, with my family... even with myself.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to make that connection?",
    "Client: It's... it's both scary and liberating. Scary because it means there's more to work through than I thought. But liberating because maybe it means I'm not crazy for feeling all of this. Maybe it's all connected, and if I can start to untangle one part, the rest might start to make more sense too.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight.",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, it is. I... I think I want to explore this more. Maybe... maybe even find a way to talk to my parents about some of it. Not all at once, but... baby steps, you know? Because keeping it all in, it's not working. And I want to feel whole again, not like I'm split into all these different versions of myself.",
    "Therapist: How would you like to move forward with this?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to keep doing these exercises. They're hard, really hard. But I feel like I'm finally starting to understand what's going on inside me. And maybe... maybe we could work on some ways to communicate some of this to my parents? Not the heavy stuff right away, but just... opening up a little?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I know we're almost out of time, but I just wanted to say... this was tough, but I think it was important. I feel... not better exactly, but maybe a little lighter? Like I've taken the first step on a long journey. It's scary, but... I think I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad you feel that way. We'll pick this up next session.",
    "Client: Okay. Thank you. I... I'll see you next week."
