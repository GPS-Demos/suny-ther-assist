    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. How are you feeling about our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. It's not easy to talk about this stuff, you know? But I guess I'm ready to give it a try.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with your SUDS level.",
    "Client: Uh, I'd say about a 6 out of 10. My stomach's a bit queasy just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Begin when you're ready.",
    "Client: Alright... *deep breath* I'm at the hospital. It's about two years ago. I'm there for a routine check-up, but something feels off. The waiting room is crowded, and I notice I'm the only Latino person there. Everyone else is white. I can feel eyes on me, like I don't belong.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body right now?",
    "Client: My shoulders are tense. I can feel my heart beating faster. It's like I'm back there, you know?",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: The nurse calls my name, but she butchers the pronunciation. I hear some snickers from the waiting room. As I stand up, I feel... small. Vulnerable. I follow her to the examination room, and she's talking to me slowly, like I can't understand English. It's humiliating.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's creeping up... maybe a 7 or 8. My palms are sweating just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: The doctor comes in. He barely looks at me. He's flipping through my chart, and I hear him mutter something about \"these people\" always having complications. I want to say something, to stand up for myself, but the words are stuck in my throat.",
    "Therapist: What do you want to say to him?",
    "Client: I... I want to tell him that I'm a human being. That I deserve respect. That I'm a professional, that I speak perfect English, that I was born here! But I just... I can't. I feel so powerless.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's happening in your body?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. It's hard to breathe. I can feel my face getting hot with anger and shame.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: The doctor starts the examination. His touch feels rough, uncaring. He's asking me questions, but he's not really listening to my answers. I mention some concerns I have, but he dismisses them. \"It's probably just stress,\" he says. \"You people tend to overreact.\"",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Furious. Devastated. I've worked so hard all my life to be taken seriously, and here I am, being treated like I'm stupid or hysterical just because of how I look.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: *deep breaths* Okay... The worst part is when he's writing his notes. I can see what he's putting down - \"non-compliant patient,\" \"possible drug-seeking behavior.\" I've never touched drugs in my life! I want to scream, to defend myself, but I'm paralyzed.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in that moment?",
    "Client: I need someone to believe me. To see me as a person, not a stereotype. I need... I need my dad. He always stood up for us, never let anyone treat us this way.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does thinking of your dad make you feel?",
    "Client: It makes me feel stronger, but also... sad. He's not here anymore to protect me. I have to learn to do it myself.",
    "Therapist: That's insightful. What happens next?",
    "Client: The doctor finishes up, barely looking at me as he leaves. The nurse comes back in, hands me some generic pamphlets about diet and exercise, like that's the solution to everything. As I'm leaving, I overhear her talking to another nurse, saying something about how \"those people\" never take care of themselves.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm shaking. With anger, with hurt. My SUDS is still at 9. I just want to disappear.",
    "Therapist: Stay with me. You're safe here. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I practically run out of the hospital. I get to my car and just sit there, trying not to cry. I feel so... violated. Not physically, but... my dignity, my humanity. It's like they stripped it all away.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful description. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm thinking... why did I let this happen? Why didn't I stand up for myself? I'm successful in my career, I'm educated, but in that moment, I felt like a child. Helpless. And then I feel guilty for feeling that way, like I'm letting down my whole community by not being stronger.",
    "Therapist: Those are complex emotions. How's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe an 8 now. Talking about it... it hurts, but it also feels like I'm taking some of the power back.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Keep going.",
    "Client: I sit in my car for a long time. I'm trying to calm down, but I keep replaying everything in my head. The looks, the comments, the dismissive attitude. I start to doubt myself. Maybe I am overreacting? Maybe I'm too sensitive? But then I remember all the times my parents warned me about this, how they always told me I'd have to work twice as hard to get half the respect.",
    "Therapist: How does that memory impact you?",
    "Client: It makes me feel... conflicted. Angry that they were right, that things haven't changed as much as I thought. But also... determined. Like I need to do something about this, not just for me, but for others who might not be able to speak up.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful shift. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I call my sister. She's always been my rock. I tell her everything that happened, and she listens. She doesn't try to minimize it or tell me I'm overreacting. She just... gets it. And that validation, it means everything.",
    "Therapist: How does talking to your sister affect your emotions?",
    "Client: It helps. My SUDS is down to a 6 or 7 now. I still feel hurt and angry, but not so alone. She reminds me of all the times we've faced this kind of thing before, how we've always come out stronger.",
    "Therapist: That's a great support system. What happens after the call?",
    "Client: I decide I'm not going back to that hospital. I start researching other options, looking for doctors who specialize in culturally competent care. It feels good to take action, to have some control back.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, as you take these steps?",
    "Client: I feel... empowered. Still hurt, still angry, but not helpless anymore. My SUDS is down to a 5. I'm starting to see this experience not just as something that happened to me, but as a call to action.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant shift. Can you elaborate?",
    "Client: Yeah, I... I start thinking about how I can use my professional skills, my connections, to make a difference. Maybe I can't change the whole medical system, but I can raise awareness, volunteer, maybe even mentor young Latino students who want to go into medicine.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a positive direction. How does it feel to consider these actions?",
    "Client: It feels... right. Like I'm turning this painful experience into something meaningful. My SUDS is down to a 4 now. I'm still upset about what happened, but I'm not drowning in it anymore.",
    "Therapist: You've come a long way. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... stronger. Like I've reclaimed some of the power I lost that day. It still hurts to think about, but it doesn't paralyze me anymore. I can see it as part of my story, not something that defines me.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to a 3 now. I feel... tired, but in a good way. Like I've worked through something important.",
    "Therapist: You have. How do you want to close this session?",
    "Client: I think... I want to remind myself that I'm not alone in this. That my experiences are valid, and that I have the strength to face these challenges and make a difference. And maybe... maybe I need to be a little kinder to myself too.",
    "Therapist: That's a wonderful way to end. You've done great work today, Carlos.",
    "Client: Thank you. It wasn't easy, but... I'm glad we did this. I feel like I understand myself a little better now.",
    "Therapist: That's the goal. We'll continue to work on this. For now, take some time to rest and process.",
    "Client: I will. Thanks again. This... it means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll pick up here next time. Take care, Carlos."
