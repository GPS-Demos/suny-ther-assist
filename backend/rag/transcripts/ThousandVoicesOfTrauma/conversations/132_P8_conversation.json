    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is buzzing, you know? My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel this tightness in my chest. The images from that night are so vivid now, like they're playing on a loop in my head. I can still hear the sirens, see the flashing lights... It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. But also... anger? Yeah, I'm angry. I keep thinking about how unfair it all was, how helpless I felt. I mean, we were just peacefully protesting, you know? We weren't doing anything wrong. And then suddenly, everything erupted into chaos. The police, they just... they didn't care who they were hurting. I remember seeing this young girl, couldn't have been more than 16, getting shoved to the ground. And I couldn't do anything to help her. I just froze.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind as you recall that moment?",
    "Client: I... I feel like a coward. Like I should have done more, somehow. But at the same time, I was terrified. I keep thinking, \"What if that had been my daughter?\" And then I feel guilty for even thinking that because it wasn't my daughter, it was someone else's child. And I did nothing. I just stood there, paralyzed. What kind of person does that make me?",
    "Therapist: How do these thoughts relate to your experiences of neglect?",
    "Client: Oh... wow. I hadn't even made that connection. But now that you mention it, it's like... it's the same feeling of helplessness, you know? When I was a kid, watching my mom struggle, wanting to help but not knowing how. And now, as an adult, I'm still just... standing by, unable to act. It's like I'm that scared little girl all over again, wanting to do something but feeling completely powerless.",
    "Therapist: Mhm. What else comes up for you?",
    "Client: I... I feel shame. Deep, gut-wrenching shame. Both for not doing more that night and for all the times I couldn't help my mom. And anger, too. At the police, at my father for leaving us, at myself for being so... weak. But there's also this... I don't know, this spark of something else. Maybe... determination? Like, I don't want to be that helpless person anymore. I want to find a way to make a difference, to stand up against injustice. But I'm scared. What if I freeze up again?",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you express these emotions?",
    "Client: It's... it's intense. My hands are shaking a bit, and I feel this heat in my face. My stomach's in knots, but at the same time, there's this energy coursing through me. Like I want to jump up and do something, anything. But I'm also exhausted. It's like my body can't decide if it wants to fight or collapse.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to feel safe. And understood. Part of me wants to curl up in a ball and hide from the world, but another part wants to scream from the rooftops, to make people understand what happened, what's still happening. I need... I need to know that it's okay to feel all of these things at once. That I'm not crazy for having such conflicting emotions. And I need to believe that I can make a difference, that I'm not doomed to always be that scared, helpless little girl.",
    "Therapist: How can you show compassion to that part of yourself?",
    "Client: That's... that's a tough one. I guess I could start by acknowledging that little girl inside me, the one who feels so scared and helpless. Maybe... maybe I could tell her that it's okay, that she did the best she could with what she knew at the time. Both as a child and that night at the protest. That feeling afraid doesn't make her weak, it makes her human. And that even though she couldn't act then, she can choose to act now. Maybe I could promise her that I'll use these experiences to grow stronger, to find ways to help others who feel powerless. Is that... is that what you mean?",
    "Therapist: Yes, exactly. How does that feel?",
    "Client: It feels... good. Scary, but good. Like I'm giving myself permission to be imperfect, but also challenging myself to do better. It's like I'm reconnecting with a part of myself I've been trying to ignore for so long. And it hurts, but in a way that feels... necessary? Like cleaning out an old wound so it can finally heal properly. I think... I think this might be a turning point for me.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you can take to move forward?",
    "Client: I... I think I want to look into local advocacy groups. Maybe find one that works with victims of police brutality or supports underprivileged families. I can't change what happened in the past, but maybe I can use my experiences to help others. It's scary to think about putting myself out there like that, but... I think it might be healing, too. To turn my pain into something positive, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a powerful step. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, somehow. Like I've set down a heavy burden I didn't even realize I was carrying. There's still fear and sadness, but there's hope too. And determination. I'm not naive enough to think it'll be easy, but for the first time in a long time, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can make a difference. Not just in my own life, but in others' lives too. It's scary, but it's also... exciting? Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a sign of growth. What else?",
    "Client: I'm realizing that... it's okay to be scared. That courage isn't about not feeling fear, it's about acting despite it. And maybe... maybe that's what I did that night at the protest. I didn't run away. I stayed, I witnessed, I remembered. And now I can use that memory, that experience, to fuel change. It doesn't erase what happened, or make it okay, but it gives it meaning. It's like... I'm reclaiming my power, bit by bit. And that feels... that feels really good.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing. We'll continue exploring this next time.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I never expected to feel this way after reliving such a difficult memory. But I'm grateful. It feels like I'm seeing things from a new perspective, like I'm starting to understand myself better. And even though it's challenging, it also feels like I'm finally moving in the right direction. I'm looking forward to our next session, to keep working through this. Thank you for guiding me through this process."
