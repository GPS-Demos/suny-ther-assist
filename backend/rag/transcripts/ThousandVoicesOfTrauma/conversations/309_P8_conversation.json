    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my body is buzzing, but also heavy at the same time. The memory feels so vivid, like I'm right back there in that moment. I can still hear the wind howling and feel the panic rising in my chest. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are coming up for you now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how helpless I felt during the earthquake. It's like... it's bringing up all these other times I've felt powerless. The abuse, you know? I never thought I'd feel that vulnerable again, but when the ground started shaking, it all came flooding back. I couldn't protect myself then, and I couldn't do anything during the earthquake either.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How does your body feel as you're talking about this?",
    "Client: My hands are shaking a little. My heart's racing, and I feel this tightness in my throat. It's like I can't swallow properly. And there's this heaviness in my stomach, like a rock sitting there. I'm trying to take deep breaths, but it feels like I can't get enough air.",
    "Therapist: What emotions are you experiencing right now?",
    "Client: It's a mix of... fear, definitely. But also anger. I'm angry that I still feel so affected by this. And there's shame too, like I should be over it by now. But mostly, I just feel sad. Sad for the little girl who went through the abuse, and sad for the woman I am now, still struggling with the aftermath of it all.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when you were in the actual situation?",
    "Client: They're... they're similar, but not as intense. During the earthquake, it was like every cell in my body was screaming. Now, it's more like an echo of that feeling. But the helplessness, that's just as strong. It's like I'm watching myself go through it all over again, but I still can't do anything to change it.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your ability to cope with these feelings now?",
    "Client: I... I guess I'm doing better than I thought I would. I mean, I'm still here, talking about it. Before, I would've probably turned to substances to numb everything out. But now, even though it's hard, I'm facing it. It's like... I'm stronger than I give myself credit for.",
    "Therapist: That's an important observation. How does recognizing that strength make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... strange. Part of me feels proud, like maybe I'm finally making progress. But there's also this voice in my head telling me not to get too confident, that I could still fall apart at any moment. It's hard to trust that I'm really getting better, you know? But I want to believe it. I want to feel like I'm not just a victim anymore.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean for you to not be \"just a victim\"?",
    "Client: God, that's... that's a big question. I think it would mean feeling like I have some control over my life. Like I'm not just reacting to things happening to me, but actually making choices. It would mean being able to feel safe in my own skin, to trust my instincts. And maybe... maybe it would mean being able to help others who've been through similar experiences. To use what I've learned to make a difference somehow.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... it's both exciting and terrifying. The thought of being that strong, that capable... it's almost hard to imagine. But there's a part of me that really wants it. It's like I can see this version of myself that's not defined by trauma, and I want to reach out and grab her. But then I worry, what if I can't be that person? What if I'm just kidding myself?",
    "Therapist: What would it take to become that person?",
    "Client: I think... I think it would take a lot of work. More of this, facing my fears head-on instead of running from them. Learning to trust myself and others. Maybe finding ways to give back, to use my experiences to help people. And I guess... I guess it would mean really believing that I deserve good things, that I'm worthy of happiness and peace. That's the hardest part, I think.",
    "Therapist: How does talking about this potential future self affect you?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually making me feel a bit lighter. Like, for the first time in a while, I can see a path forward. It's still scary, and I know it won't be easy, but... it feels possible. And that's... that's something I haven't felt in a long time. It's like a tiny spark of hope.",
    "Therapist: What do you want to do with that spark?",
    "Client: I want to nurture it. To protect it, but also let it grow. Maybe... maybe I could start by setting some small goals for myself. Things that push me out of my comfort zone a little, but aren't overwhelming. And I think I want to start journaling about this version of myself I'm imagining. Maybe if I can see her more clearly on paper, it'll be easier to become her in real life.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a thoughtful approach. How are you feeling now, compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, honestly. But it's a different kind of tired. Before, I felt drained by fear and memories. Now, it's like I've been working hard, but towards something positive. I still feel shaky, and there's still sadness there, but... there's also this tiny bit of excitement. Like maybe, just maybe, things really can get better.",
    "Therapist: Thank you for sharing so openly. What would you like to focus on in our next session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to explore more about this idea of not being 'just a victim'. Maybe we could talk about specific ways I can start reclaiming my sense of power? And... and maybe we could look at how my experiences with substance use tie into all of this. I'm starting to see how it was all connected, and I think understanding that better might help me move forward.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. We'll pick up there next time. How will you take care of yourself for the rest of the day?",
    "Client: I think I'll go for a walk in the park near my apartment. Being in nature always helps ground me. And then maybe I'll call my sister. She's always been supportive, and I think talking to her might help me hold onto this little bit of hope I'm feeling. Oh, and I'll definitely do some deep breathing exercises before bed. I want to try and get a good night's sleep.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent self-care strategies. I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I know I say this a lot, but I really appreciate your help. It means a lot to have someone to talk to who understands. I'll see you next week."
