    "Therapist: Alright, Mr. Lee, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I understand this is part of the process.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the airplane crash. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm at the airport in Bangkok. It's busy, people rushing everywhere. The air is thick and humid. I can smell the street food from nearby vendors. I'm boarding the plane, feeling excited about my business trip to Singapore.",
    "Therapist: Good. What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: Um, about a 3 out of 10. I'm okay so far.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue.",
    "Client: We're taking off now. The plane is shaking a bit, more than usual. I'm gripping the armrests. The woman next to me looks worried too. Suddenly, there's a loud bang, and the plane lurches to the side. People are screaming. I... I can feel my heart racing.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to a 6. My palms are sweating just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Keep going.",
    "Client: The oxygen masks drop down. I'm fumbling with mine, my hands are shaking so much. The plane is nosediving now. I can see the ground getting closer through the window. Oh God, I thought I was going to die. I can hear the engines screeching, smell something burning. My whole body is tense, waiting for impact.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's an 8 now. I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Okay. The impact is brutal. My head slams forward. There's a deafening crash, and then silence for a moment. Then screams, everywhere. Smoke is filling the cabin. I'm dizzy, disoriented. I unbuckle my seatbelt, but my legs feel weak. I'm crawling towards the emergency exit, choking on the smoke.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. My chest feels tight. I can almost smell the smoke again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you survived this.",
    "Client: Right, yes. I... I managed to get out onto the wing. The heat from the engines was intense. I jumped down and ran as far as I could. I remember looking back and seeing the plane engulfed in flames. The screams... I can still hear them sometimes.",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: Still a 9. I feel so guilty for surviving when others didn't.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. Let's stay with the memory.",
    "Client: I'm sitting on the grass, watching the chaos. Emergency vehicles are arriving. My clothes are torn, I'm covered in soot. I can taste blood in my mouth. I'm shaking uncontrollably, and I feel so... alone. So helpless.",
    "Therapist: And now?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe a 7. I'm starting to feel more present here in the room.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's continue for a few more minutes.",
    "Client: Okay. The paramedics are checking me. I'm in shock, I think. Everything feels surreal. I keep replaying the crash in my mind, wondering if I could have done something differently. The guilt is overwhelming. I can't stop thinking about the other passengers, their families...",
    "Therapist: SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's back to an 8. I feel so heavy with sadness and guilt.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're processing a traumatic event.",
    "Client: I know, but it's hard. I'm at the hospital now. They're treating my injuries, but I feel numb. I can't stop seeing the faces of the other passengers. I wonder about their stories, their lives. It's all so unfair.",
    "Therapist: And your final SUDS rating?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 6 now. I feel drained, but also a bit relieved to have talked through it.",
    "Therapist: Well done. Let's start grounding ourselves back in the present."
