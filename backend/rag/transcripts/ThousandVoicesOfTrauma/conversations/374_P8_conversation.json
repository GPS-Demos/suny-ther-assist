    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing but also blank at the same time. The memories of that day in the field hospital, they're so vivid now. I can still smell the antiseptic and hear the groans of the wounded soldiers. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear. Definitely fear. It's like this cold grip around my heart. I keep thinking about how close I came to dying that day. The mortar shells were falling so close, and I was trying to stabilize a soldier with a severe chest wound. I couldn't stop shaking, and I was terrified I'd make a mistake that would cost him his life.",
    "Therapist: How does that fear feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a heavy weight on my chest. My hands are clammy, and I can feel my heart racing. It's hard to breathe, like the air is too thick. I keep wanting to look over my shoulder, you know? Like I'm still there, waiting for the next attack.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"I can't do this. I'm not strong enough.\" It's the same thought I had that day. I was so scared of failing, of letting everyone down. And now, even though I'm safe here, I still feel like I'm failing. Like I should be over this by now, but I'm not. It's frustrating and... embarrassing, I guess.",
    "Therapist: How do these feelings compare to when you first returned home?",
    "Client: They're... they're not as intense, I suppose. When I first got back, I could barely function. I'd have panic attacks just hearing a car backfire. Now, it's more like this constant underlying anxiety. But revisiting that memory, it brings it all back so vividly. It's like I'm right back there in that moment.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about your ability to sit with these feelings now?",
    "Client: I... I guess I'm able to talk about it more. Before, I'd just shut down or try to push it away. Now, even though it's uncomfortable, I can at least put it into words. It's still scary, but maybe... maybe a little less overwhelming? I don't know. It's hard to tell sometimes.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you reflect on that?",
    "Client: A mix of things, really. There's a part of me that feels a tiny bit proud that I can talk about it now. But there's also this deep sadness. I think about all the time I've lost, all the relationships that have suffered because of this. And I feel angry too. Angry that this happened to me, that I'm still dealing with it years later. It's not fair, you know?",
    "Therapist: How do these emotions relate to your everyday life?",
    "Client: They... they color everything. My work suffers because I'm always on edge, waiting for something bad to happen. I push people away because I'm afraid of them seeing me like this. And the depression... it makes everything feel so hopeless sometimes. Like I'll never get better, never feel normal again. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: What strengths have you discovered in yourself through this process?",
    "Client: Strengths? I... I guess I'm more resilient than I thought. The fact that I'm here, talking about this, that's something. And maybe I'm braver than I give myself credit for. It takes courage to face these memories, right? Even if it doesn't always feel like it. And I've learned to be more compassionate, I think. Towards myself and others who are struggling.",
    "Therapist: How does that realization sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... it's strange. Part of me wants to dismiss it, to say I'm not strong or brave at all. But another part knows that's not true. I've survived something terrible, and I'm still here, still fighting. That has to count for something, right? It's just... it's hard to hold onto that feeling when the memories and emotions are so overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: What do you need in this moment?",
    "Client: I think... I think I just need to breathe for a minute. To remind myself that I'm here, in this room, and that I'm safe. And maybe... maybe I need to acknowledge that this is hard work, and that it's okay to struggle with it. I'm not failing just because it's difficult. Is that... is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Take all the time you need.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's... it's comforting to know that I can take a moment. I think I often push myself too hard, expect too much too soon. But this process, it's not a sprint, is it? It's more like a marathon. And maybe it's okay if I need to catch my breath sometimes.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now compared to the start of our session?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, honestly. But also a little lighter, if that makes sense. Like I've set down a heavy backpack I've been carrying. The memories and feelings are still there, but they feel a bit less suffocating. And there's a small part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe hopeful? Like maybe I can learn to live with this, to not let it control me so much.",
    "Therapist: What's one thing you want to remember from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I want to remember that I'm stronger than I often give myself credit for. That facing these memories, as painful as it is, is an act of courage. And that it's okay to struggle, to have setbacks. It doesn't erase the progress I've made. Yeah, I think that's what I want to hold onto.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How would you like to close our session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to take a few deep breaths. To ground myself in the present and remind myself that I'm safe now. And maybe... maybe I could think of one small thing I'm grateful for, to help shift my focus a bit. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a great way to end. Let's do that together."
