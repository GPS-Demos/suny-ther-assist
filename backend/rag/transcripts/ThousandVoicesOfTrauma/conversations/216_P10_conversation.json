    "Therapist: Good morning, Mr. Chen. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: Ah, good morning, Dr. Roberts. To be honest, I'm feeling a bit... unsettled. It's not easy to revisit these memories, you know? But I understand it's part of the process.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Let's... let's give it a try.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see my childhood home. It's a small apartment in Singapore. The walls are a faded yellow, and there's a slight musty smell in the air. I'm... I'm sitting on the worn-out sofa in the living room. My grandmother's favorite chair is empty.",
    "Therapist: Good. What time of day is it?",
    "Client: It's early evening. The sun is setting, and the orange light is streaming through the thin curtains. I can hear the neighbors' TV through the walls. It's... it's the day after my grandmother passed away.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: I feel... lost. Empty. There's this heaviness in my chest that I can't shake off. I'm only 12, but I feel so much older suddenly. The apartment seems bigger and emptier without her presence.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's happening around you?",
    "Client: My parents are in the kitchen, talking in hushed tones. I can hear my mother's muffled sobs. My younger sister is playing with her dolls on the floor, oblivious to what's happening. I... I want to tell her to stop, that it's disrespectful, but I can't find my voice.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about the last time I saw Ah Ma. She... she was in the hospital. She looked so frail, so unlike the strong woman who used to chase me around the playground. I... I didn't say goodbye properly. I was too scared. Now she's gone, and I'll never get the chance.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level right now, on a scale of 0 to 100?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 70. My hands are starting to shake a bit.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Okay... I'm looking at Ah Ma's chair. Her favorite shawl is still draped over the back. I... I can almost smell her jasmine perfume. I want to go sit in her chair, to feel close to her one last time, but I'm afraid. What if sitting there makes it real? What if I forget how she used to look sitting there, smiling at me?",
    "Therapist: Stay present in that moment. What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I stand up slowly. My legs feel heavy as I walk towards her chair. I reach out and touch the shawl. It's soft, just like I remember. I can feel tears starting to form in my eyes. I... I sit down in the chair. It still feels warm, as if she just got up.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel?",
    "Client: My chest feels tight. I'm trying not to cry, but it's getting harder. My throat hurts from holding back the tears. I curl up in the chair, hugging my knees to my chest. I can smell her scent on the fabric, and suddenly I can't hold it back anymore. I start sobbing.",
    "Therapist: Allow yourself to feel those emotions. What happens next?",
    "Client: My mother... she hears me crying and comes out of the kitchen. Her eyes are red and puffy. She sees me in Ah Ma's chair and for a moment, she looks... angry. But then her face softens. She comes over and wraps her arms around me. We cry together.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 85. This is... this is hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember to breathe. Can you tell me more about what's happening?",
    "Client: My father joins us. He's trying to be strong, but I can see tears in his eyes too. We're all huddled around Ah Ma's chair, grieving together. I... I feel guilty for breaking down. I should be strong for my sister, for my parents. But I can't stop crying.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to cry. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... I should have spent more time with her. I should have listened to her stories more carefully. I should have... I should have told her I loved her one last time. There's so much I wanted to say, so much I wanted to learn from her. And now... now it's too late.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I notice the silence. The apartment is so quiet without Ah Ma's humming or her favorite radio shows. It feels wrong. Empty. I... I want to scream, to fill the silence, but I can't. I just keep crying.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling physically?",
    "Client: My whole body is shaking. My eyes burn from crying so much. I feel exhausted, but I can't stop. It's like... like all the emotions I've been holding back are flooding out at once.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment to ground yourself. Feel the chair beneath you.",
    "Client: *takes a deep breath* Okay... I can feel the rough fabric of the chair. It's... it's grounding. I'm trying to focus on that sensation.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens as the evening progresses?",
    "Client: Eventually... eventually, the crying subsides. We're all exhausted. My sister has fallen asleep on the floor with her dolls. My father picks her up and carries her to bed. My mother... she starts tidying up the living room, as if keeping busy will keep the grief at bay.",
    "Therapist: And what about you?",
    "Client: I... I stay in Ah Ma's chair. I don't want to leave it. It feels like the last connection I have to her. I curl up and close my eyes, pretending for a moment that she's still here, that she's just gone to the kitchen to make her special herbal tea.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 60. I feel drained, but... but also a little calmer.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Can you tell me more about what you're experiencing?",
    "Client: As I sit there, I start... I start remembering all the good times with Ah Ma. The stories she used to tell me about her childhood in the village. The way she'd sneak me extra dessert when my parents weren't looking. Her laugh... it was so warm and full of life.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Focus on those positive memories.",
    "Client: I remember how she taught me to fold dumplings, her wrinkled hands guiding mine. How she'd sing old Chinese lullabies to me when I couldn't sleep. The pride in her eyes when I showed her my good grades... I... I miss her so much.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to miss her. How does remembering these moments make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's bittersweet. There's still this ache in my chest, but... but there's also warmth. Gratitude for the time we had together. I... I wish I had appreciated it more when she was here.",
    "Therapist: That's a natural feeling. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I get up from the chair. My body feels stiff from sitting for so long. I walk over to the small altar my parents set up. There's a picture of Ah Ma there, smiling. I light an incense stick and bow my head. I... I tell her I'm sorry for not saying goodbye. I tell her I love her.",
    "Therapist: That's a beautiful gesture. How does it make you feel?",
    "Client: It feels... it feels right. Like I'm honoring her memory. There's still sadness, but also... also a sense of peace. Like maybe... maybe she can hear me.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 40. I feel drained, but... but also lighter somehow.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well today. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Emotionally and physically. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a little bit stronger? Like I've faced something I've been avoiding for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end the session.",
    "Client: *takes several deep breaths* Thank you, Dr. Roberts. This was... this was hard, but I think it was important.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great courage today. We'll continue to work through this in our next session.",
    "Client: Okay. I... I think I'm ready for that. It's not easy, but... but I want to heal. For Ah Ma, and for myself.",
    "Therapist: That's a wonderful attitude. We'll end here for today. Take care of yourself, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thank you, doctor. I will. See you next week."
