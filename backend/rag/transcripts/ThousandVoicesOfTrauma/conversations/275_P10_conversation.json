    "Therapist: Welcome, James. How are you feeling about our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we've talked about this, but actually diving into it feels different. My hands are a bit clammy.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here together. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, I think so. Let's do this before I change my mind.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm standing on my front porch. It's a sunny day, but there's tension in the air. People are gathering down the street. I can hear chanting in the distance.",
    "Therapist: Good. What time of day is it?",
    "Client: It's late afternoon, maybe around 4 or 5 PM. The sun is still bright, but it's starting to get lower in the sky.",
    "Therapist: What are you wearing?",
    "Client: I've got on a blue t-shirt and jeans. My work boots too \u2013 I had just gotten home from the construction site.",
    "Therapist: And how are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm curious, but also wary. There's been talk about protests all week, but this is the first time it's come to our neighborhood. My heart's beating a bit faster.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: Uh, maybe a 30? It's not too bad yet, but I can feel the tension building.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: The crowd is getting louder. I can make out some of the signs now. \"Black Lives Matter,\" \"No Justice, No Peace.\" I... I want to join them, but I'm also scared. What if things get out of hand?",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I step off the porch. My wife calls from inside, asking what's going on. I tell her I'm just going to take a look. As I walk towards the crowd, I can feel my palms getting sweaty.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's creeping up. Maybe a 45? I'm getting more nervous as I get closer to the crowd.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: I join the edge of the crowd. People are angry, but it's peaceful. Then... then I hear sirens. Police cars are coming down the street, lights flashing. My heart starts pounding harder.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What do you see and hear?",
    "Client: The crowd is getting agitated. Someone shouts, \"Don't let them stop us!\" The police cars screech to a halt, and officers start pouring out. They're in riot gear... Oh God, this is where it all went wrong.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, James. How high is your distress now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 70. I can feel my chest tightening, just like it did that day.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're here in the office with me. You're safe. Can you continue?",
    "Client: Yeah... yeah, I can. The police form a line. They're shouting orders to disperse, but the crowd is pushing back. I'm caught in the middle, not sure which way to go. Then... then I see an officer raise his baton.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: It's chaos. People are screaming, running. I try to move back, but I'm pushed forward by the crowd. An officer grabs me, and I... I panic. I try to pull away, and suddenly I'm on the ground. My face is pressed against the hot asphalt.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Terror. Pure terror. I can't breathe. There's a knee on my back, and I... I think they're going to kill me. I'm not even part of this! I just came to see what was happening!",
    "Therapist: Your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's maxed out. 100. I'm shaking just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe with me. In... and out. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (breathing heavily) Okay... okay. I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: When you're ready, continue.",
    "Client: I... I'm still on the ground. I can hear more shouting, the sound of tear gas canisters. My eyes are stinging from the gas that's drifting over. The officer is yelling at me to stop resisting, but I'm not even moving. I'm frozen.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about my wife. Will I see her again? I'm thinking about all the stories I've heard, all the videos I've seen. Is this how it ends for me? Over nothing?",
    "Therapist: Stay with those thoughts. What happens next?",
    "Client: They... they pull me up roughly. My shoulders hurt from how they're twisting my arms. They're pushing me towards a police van. I'm trying to explain that I live here, that I wasn't part of the protest, but they're not listening.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. Maybe 90? I can feel my heart racing, just like it did then.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, James. Remember, you survived this. You're here now, telling the story.",
    "Client: Right... right. I'm here. I'm safe. (takes a deep breath) They push me into the van. It's dark, and there are others in there too. Some are crying, some are angry. I'm... I'm just numb.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My wrists hurt from the handcuffs. My face stings from being pressed into the ground. I can taste blood \u2013 I think my lip is split. And I'm shaking. I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those sensations. What happens as the van starts moving?",
    "Client: It's jerky. We're all being tossed around. Someone starts yelling that they need their medication. The officers ignore them. I... I start to pray. I've never been very religious, but in that moment, I'm begging for help.",
    "Therapist: How long does the ride feel?",
    "Client: It feels like hours, but it's probably only about 20 minutes. When we stop, I can hear more shouting outside. They start pulling us out one by one.",
    "Therapist: And how are you feeling at this point?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm angry now. The fear is still there, but there's this rage building up. This isn't right. None of this is right.",
    "Therapist: Let's pause for a moment. How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's come down a bit. Maybe 75? I'm still tense, but talking about it... it helps, somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing these emotions. When you're ready, continue with what happened next.",
    "Client: They... they process us at the station. Fingerprints, mugshots. I keep trying to explain, but no one's listening. They put me in a holding cell with others from the protest. It's crowded, uncomfortable.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking during this time?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm worried about my wife. She must be frantic. I'm angry at the system, at how easily this happened. And I'm... I'm scared about what this means for my future. Will I lose my job? Will this follow me forever?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How long were you held?",
    "Client: It felt like an eternity, but it was about 36 hours. My wife finally managed to get me out. When I saw her... (voice breaks) I broke down. I've never cried like that before.",
    "Therapist: That must have been an intense moment of relief. How do you feel now, remembering it?",
    "Client: It's... it's a mix. Relief, yes, but also this lingering anger and fear. Even now, months later, I tense up when I see a police car. I feel like I lost something that day \u2013 my sense of security, maybe.",
    "Therapist: That's a profound loss. How has this experience changed you?",
    "Client: I'm more cautious now. More aware of my surroundings. But I'm also more determined to speak up, to be involved. I don't want anyone else to go through what I did.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. As we come to the end of this session, how are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained, honestly. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe relief? Like talking about it is helping me process it better.",
    "Therapist: That's often the case with exposure therapy. Your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's down to about a 40, I think. Still there, but manageable.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress, James. You've shown incredible strength today. Let's take a few deep breaths together before we end.",
    "Client: (takes deep breaths) Thank you. This... this wasn't easy, but I'm glad we did it.",
    "Therapist: You did great. We'll continue working through this in our next session. For now, remember to use the coping strategies we've discussed if you feel overwhelmed.",
    "Client: I will. Thanks again, Doc.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, James. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
