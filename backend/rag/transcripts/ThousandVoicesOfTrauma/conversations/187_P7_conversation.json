    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the event?",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. It was during my second tour in Afghanistan. We were on a routine patrol when suddenly... (voice trembles) I heard an explosion. The Humvee in front of us was hit by an IED. There was smoke everywhere, and I could hear screaming...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I jumped out of our vehicle, my heart racing. The air was thick with dust and the smell of burning metal. As I ran towards the wreckage, I saw... (pauses, takes a deep breath) I saw bodies. Some were moving, others weren't. The first person I reached was Private Johnson. He was... he was barely recognizable. His legs were... (voice breaks)",
    "Therapist: It's okay. You're safe here. Take your time.",
    "Client: (wiping tears) His legs were gone. There was so much blood. I tried to apply a tourniquet, but my hands were shaking so badly. I kept telling him, \"Stay with me, Johnson. Stay with me.\" But his eyes... they were becoming vacant. I've never felt so helpless in my life.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: As I was working on Johnson, I heard more explosions. We were under attack. Bullets were flying everywhere. I had to make a choice \u2013 stay with Johnson or find cover. I... I left him there. (sobbing) I left him to die alone.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel emotional. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I ran back to our Humvee, ducking and weaving. I could hear the zip of bullets passing by my head. When I got there, I saw that our driver, Sarah, had been hit. She was slumped over the wheel, blood trickling from her mouth. I pulled her out and dragged her behind the vehicle.",
    "Therapist: Stay with the memory. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I checked her pulse \u2013 nothing. I started CPR, pushing hard on her chest. One, two, three, four... I kept counting, kept pushing. Her ribs cracked under my hands, but I couldn't stop. I don't know how long I kept going. It felt like hours, but it was probably just minutes. Eventually, someone pulled me away. They told me she was gone, that I needed to help the others. But I couldn't... I couldn't leave her.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Keep going.",
    "Client: The rest is a blur. More explosions, more gunfire. We managed to call for air support, but it felt like an eternity before they arrived. By the time the choppers came, half our unit was either dead or severely wounded. As we evacuated, I looked back at the burning vehicles, the bodies... (voice breaks again) I couldn't help but think about the families who would be getting those awful phone calls. And I felt... I felt so angry, so guilty for surviving when others didn't.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're processing this well.",
    "Client: When we got back to base, everything felt surreal. I kept replaying the events in my head, thinking about what I could have done differently. Maybe if I'd been faster, or if I'd made different decisions... (sighs heavily) I know logically that I did what I could, but the guilt... it never really goes away. Sometimes I still wake up in the middle of the night, hearing the explosions, smelling the smoke and blood.",
    "Therapist: You've shown remarkable courage. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Talking about it brings everything back so vividly. But there's also a small sense of... I don't know, maybe relief? Like sharing the burden makes it a tiny bit lighter. It's still painful, still haunting, but maybe... maybe it's a step towards healing?",
    "Therapist: That's a positive perspective. We'll end here for today."
