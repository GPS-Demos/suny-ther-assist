    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the combat situation?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in Afghanistan. It's hot, dusty. We're on patrol in a small village. The streets are narrow, buildings close together. I can smell spices from nearby homes mixed with diesel from our vehicles. My squad is spread out, alert. Suddenly, there's a loud explosion. I'm thrown to the ground, ears ringing...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: I... I can't see clearly. There's dust everywhere. I hear screaming, but it sounds muffled. My body feels heavy, and there's a sharp pain in my left arm. I try to get up, but I'm disoriented. I reach for my weapon, my hands shaking...",
    "Therapist: That's it. You're safe here. Keep going.",
    "Client: I see one of my squad members. He's not moving. There's blood... so much blood. I crawl towards him, my heart pounding. I can taste copper in my mouth. I'm terrified, but I need to check on him. As I get closer, I realize it's Mike. He's... he's not breathing.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (audible deep breath) I... I don't want to remember this part. It's too much.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel overwhelmed. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (voice shaking) Mike's eyes are open, but there's no life in them. I feel sick. I want to help him, but I know it's too late. There's more gunfire now. I should move, find cover, but I can't leave Mike. I'm frozen, staring at him, feeling guilty that I'm alive and he's not.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: I hear someone shouting my name. It snaps me out of it. I grab Mike's dog tags and force myself to move. My legs feel like lead. I make it to a nearby wall, leaning against it. My hands are covered in Mike's blood. I can't stop looking at them. The guilt is overwhelming. I should have been faster, should have protected him somehow.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel that way. Keep going.",
    "Client: The rest of the squad is regrouping. I hear orders being shouted, but they sound distant. I'm struggling to focus. My training kicks in, and I start assessing the situation, but part of me is still with Mike. I can't shake the image of his lifeless eyes. I feel angry, scared, and completely helpless all at once.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an incredible job. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. My heart is racing, and I'm sweating. It's like I'm back there again. I can still smell the dust and blood. I feel guilty for surviving when Mike didn't. And I'm angry - at the enemy, at myself, at the whole situation. But there's also a sense of relief, like I've finally let some of this out after holding it in for so long.",
    "Therapist: That's completely normal. You're very courageous.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to talk about this, but I think it's helping. I've never really described that day in such detail before. It's always been this jumbled mess of images and emotions in my head. Talking about it... it's painful, but it's also like I'm starting to make sense of it somehow.",
    "Therapist: You're making great progress. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: I think I can go on. It's tough, but I want to work through this. There's more to the story - what happened after, how we got out of there. It's all part of what's been haunting me. Is it okay if we keep going?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. You're in control here. Please continue.",
    "Client: Alright. So, after taking cover, I manage to pull myself together enough to check my radio. It's working, thankfully. I call for backup and medevac. My voice sounds strange to me, too calm given what's happening. The firefight is intensifying. I can hear the distinctive sound of AK-47s mixed with our M4s.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with those feelings.",

    "Therapist: You're handling this memory very bravely.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's strange, but talking about it like this, I can see how I was still functioning despite the shock. At the time, it felt like I was useless, but looking back, I was doing what I was trained to do.",
    "Therapist: You've shown incredible strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Emotionally drained. But there's also a strange sense of relief. Talking about it like this, it's like I'm finally acknowledging everything that happened, everything I felt. It's painful, but it also feels necessary, like I'm finally starting to process it all.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. You should be proud.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It still hurts, and I still feel the guilt, but it's different now. Like I'm looking at it from a slight distance. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's a common experience. You're doing great.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I think I need a break now, though. This has been intense. But I want to keep working on this. I feel like I'm finally starting to face it instead of running from it. It's scary, but also... I don't know, maybe hopeful? Is it okay if we stop here for today?",
    "Therapist: Of course. You've made excellent progress. We'll continue next time."
