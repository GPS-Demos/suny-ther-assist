    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the cult experience you mentioned?",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. It was about two years ago when I first got involved. I was feeling lost and lonely after moving to a new city for college. This group approached me on campus, saying they could offer friendship and purpose. At first, it seemed harmless...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: They invited me to meetings, which felt warm and welcoming at first. But gradually, things started to change. They began demanding more of my time, isolating me from my family and other friends. I remember one night when they kept us up for hours, chanting and meditating. I was so tired, but they wouldn't let anyone leave...",
    "Therapist: That sounds challenging. You're safe now.",
    "Client: It was exhausting. I felt like I couldn't think straight. They started controlling what I ate, when I slept, even what I wore. I lost touch with reality. There was this constant pressure to recruit others, to prove my loyalty. I felt guilty all the time, like I wasn't doing enough...",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Take a deep breath if you need to.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Thanks. It's hard to talk about. The worst part was when they started encouraging us to cut ties with our families completely. They said our families were holding us back from our true potential. I... I almost did it. I was so close to cutting off all contact with my parents...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel emotional. You're doing great.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) I feel so ashamed now. How could I have fallen for all of it? They made me believe that the outside world was evil, that only they had the truth. I lost almost two years of my life to them. I missed out on so much...",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. Stay with the memory.",
    "Client: It's just... I remember the day I finally decided to leave. There was this new recruit, a young girl who looked so scared and lost. Seeing her reminded me of myself when I first joined. Something in me just snapped. I realized I couldn't be part of this anymore. But leaving was terrifying...",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Keep going.",
    "Client: They tried everything to make me stay. Guilt, threats, love-bombing... It was like my mind was being torn apart. I felt like I was betraying the only family I had. But I knew I had to get out. I packed a bag in the middle of the night and just ran. I was so scared they would come after me...",
    "Therapist: You're doing really well. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... shaky. My heart's racing. But also... kind of relieved? It's like a weight is lifting, talking about it like this. I've never really told anyone the whole story before.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're processing it well.",
    "Client: I guess I am. It's still hard though. Sometimes I have nightmares about being back there, or I'll see someone on the street who reminds me of one of the leaders, and I'll panic. And the guilt... the guilt is still there. For the time I lost, for the people I recruited who might still be trapped...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have these feelings. You're safe now.",
    "Client: You're right, I am safe now. It's just... it's going to take time to really believe that, you know? To trust people again, to trust myself. But talking about it like this, it does help. It makes it feel less like this dark secret I'm carrying around.",
    "Therapist: You're making great progress. How do you feel about stopping here?",
    "Client: I think that's good for now. It's a lot to process, but I feel... lighter? Like I've taken a step forward. Thank you for listening and guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You did excellent work today. We'll continue next session."
