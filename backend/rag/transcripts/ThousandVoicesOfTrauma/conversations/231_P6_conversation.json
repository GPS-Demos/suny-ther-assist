    "Therapist: Alright, John, let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'm ready to try.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the cult experience we discussed.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back there. It's dark, and I can smell incense. The leader is speaking, his voice echoing off the walls. My heart is starting to race.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: Um, about a 4 out of 10.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The leader is getting louder, more intense. He's talking about sacrifice and loyalty. I feel trapped, like I can't breathe. My palms are sweating, and I'm starting to feel dizzy.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're doing well.",
    "Client: There are people all around me, chanting. I want to leave, but I'm afraid of what they'll do if I try. My chest feels tight, and I'm trembling.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 7.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant increase. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: I know, but it feels so real. The leader is singling me out now, calling me forward. I don't want to go, but my legs are moving on their own. I feel sick to my stomach.",
    "Therapist: Keep going. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: He's... he's grabbing my arm, pulling me closer. I can smell his breath. He's shouting about purification and pain. I'm terrified. I want to run, but I can't move.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. I don't know if I can keep going.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, John. Remember, you're here with me, safe in my office.",
    "Client: I... I know. It's just... it's overwhelming. He's raising his hand, and I know what's coming. I brace myself for the blow, my whole body tensing up.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're almost through.",
    "Client: The pain... it's sharp and sudden. I feel humiliated, ashamed. Everyone's watching, but no one helps. I feel so alone, so betrayed.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's still... still a 9. My heart's pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing really well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I can't take it anymore. I push him away and run. People are grabbing at me, but I fight through. I burst out into the cold night air, gasping, crying.",
    "Therapist: And now?",
    "Client: I... I'm starting to feel a little calmer. Maybe... maybe a 7?",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this well.",
    "Client: I'm running down the street, not knowing where I'm going. I just know I need to get away. My legs are aching, but I keep pushing.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 5, I think. I'm feeling less panicked.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I finally stop running, collapsing on a park bench. I'm sobbing, but I also feel... relieved? Like I've finally broken free.",
    "Therapist: And how do you feel now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm okay. My SUDS is probably around a 3 now. I feel drained, but also... lighter somehow.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well, John. Let's take a few deep breaths together."
