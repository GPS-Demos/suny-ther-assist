    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Mrs. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm not quite sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. My heart is still racing, and I feel a bit lightheaded. Those memories of being in the hospital after my accident, they're so vivid now. I can almost smell the antiseptic and hear the beeping of the machines.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I think. No, maybe it's more like... anxiety? It's this tight feeling in my chest, like I can't catch my breath. I keep thinking about how helpless I felt in that hospital bed, not knowing if I'd ever be able to walk again. And then there's this overwhelming sadness, too. It's all mixed up together.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How does your body feel as you're experiencing these emotions?",
    "Client: My shoulders are so tense, they're practically up to my ears. And my hands... I just realized I've been clenching my fists this whole time. It's like my body is bracing for something bad to happen, even though I know I'm safe here. I feel a bit nauseous, too. It's strange how these memories can affect me so physically, even after all these years.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep hearing the doctor's voice telling me about the extent of my injuries. It was so clinical, so matter-of-fact. But for me, it felt like my whole world was crumbling. I remember thinking, \"This is it. My life is over.\" And then I feel guilty for having those thoughts because I survived, and I know others haven't been so lucky. But at the same time, I'm angry. Angry at the drunk driver who hit me, angry at the doctors who couldn't give me a clear prognosis, angry at myself for... for what? I don't even know anymore.",
    "Therapist: How do these memories connect to your experiences now?",
    "Client: Well, I suppose they explain a lot about why I'm so anxious all the time, especially about health issues. Every little ache or pain sends me into a panic, thinking it might be something serious. And I've been so reluctant to try new things or take risks because I'm terrified of ending up helpless again. It's like I'm still stuck in that hospital bed sometimes, you know? But going through this exercise, as difficult as it is, it's helping me see how much these old fears are still controlling me.",
    "Therapist: What's different now compared to when you were in the hospital?",
    "Client: Oh, that's a good question. Well, for one thing, I'm not alone anymore. Back then, even with my family visiting, I felt so isolated in my pain and fear. But now, I have my support group, my therapist - you - and I've learned so many coping strategies. I'm stronger now, both physically and mentally. I can walk, I can take care of myself. I'm not that helpless person anymore, even though sometimes I still feel like her.",
    "Therapist: How does recognizing these differences make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... empowering, I suppose. A bit liberating. It's like I'm finally seeing the whole picture, not just the terrifying parts. Don't get me wrong, it's still scary to think about, and I still have a long way to go. But there's a glimmer of hope there that wasn't before. Maybe I can start to let go of some of this fear and anger. Maybe I can start to trust my body again, and trust that I can handle whatever comes my way.",
    "Therapist: What do you think this means for your recovery journey?",
    "Client: I think... I think it means I'm making progress, even when it doesn't feel like it. It's like I've been carrying this heavy backpack of trauma all these years, and now I'm finally starting to unpack it, piece by piece. It's painful and messy, but it's also a relief. I want to keep going, to keep facing these memories and working through them. I want to reclaim the parts of myself that I lost in that hospital room. It won't be easy, but for the first time in a long while, I feel like it might be possible.",
    "Therapist: How can we use this insight in our future sessions?",
    "Client: Well, I think I'd like to dive deeper into some of these memories and emotions. Maybe we could explore more about why I feel so guilty for surviving, or work on strategies to manage my anxiety about my health. And I'd really like to find ways to start taking more risks in my life, to push back against this fear that's been holding me back. I know it'll be challenging, but I feel ready to take those steps now.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a good plan. How are you feeling now compared to when we started?",
    "Client: I feel... lighter, I suppose. Still a bit shaky and emotional, but there's a sense of relief too. It's like I've let out a breath I've been holding for years. I'm tired, but it's a good kind of tired, if that makes sense. Like I've done something important, even though it was hard. And I'm proud of myself for getting through it. I know we have more work to do, but for the first time in a long while, I'm actually looking forward to it. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. Let's end here and pick up next time.",
    "Client: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your support and guidance. I'll see you next week."
