    "Therapist: Welcome, Margaret. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: Oh, hello Dr. Thompson. I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about the crash today, and it's making my stomach churn a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yes, I suppose we should. *deep breath* Where do you want me to start?",
    "Therapist: Start with boarding the plane. Describe what you see and feel.",
    "Client: Alright... I'm walking down the jet bridge. It's narrow and dim. I can smell that distinct airplane smell - a mix of fuel and recycled air. My carry-on bag feels heavy on my shoulder. I'm... I'm nervous, but excited for my trip to visit my sister in Perth.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I step onto the plane and the flight attendant greets me with a smile. She's young, probably in her twenties. I make my way down the aisle, looking for my seat. It's 14C, an aisle seat. I prefer the aisle, you know? Makes me feel less trapped.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What are you feeling as you sit down?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling a bit claustrophobic. The seats are so close together. A man in a business suit sits next to me by the window. He nods politely but doesn't say anything. I buckle my seatbelt and it feels tight across my lap. My heart is starting to beat faster.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: Um... about a 4, I'd say. It's uncomfortable, but manageable.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Continue describing what happens.",
    "Client: The plane starts to taxi. I can feel the vibrations through the floor. The flight attendants are going through the safety demonstration, but I'm not really paying attention. I've heard it all before. We're picking up speed now, and... oh god, this is when it starts to go wrong.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What do you see and hear?",
    "Client: There's a loud bang from the left side of the plane. People are gasping and looking around. The plane is shaking violently. I... I can hear the engines making a strange whining noise. It doesn't sound right. The man next to me grips the armrest, his knuckles turning white.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Margaret. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 7. My heart is racing. I can feel sweat on my palms.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Remember, you're safe here. Take a deep breath and continue.",
    "Client: The plane is lurching to the left. I can see the ground through the window, it's too close, we're not high enough. The oxygen masks drop down. There's chaos, people are screaming. I'm fumbling with my mask, my hands are shaking so much. I can't... I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: You're safe, Margaret. Focus on your breathing. What happens next?",
    "Client: The plane is losing altitude rapidly. I can hear the pilot's voice over the intercom, but I can't make out what he's saying. Everything is happening so fast. We're hitting trees now, I can hear the branches scraping against the fuselage. It's so loud, like being inside a tin can during a hailstorm.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My whole body is tense. My stomach feels like it's in my throat. I'm gripping the armrests so hard my fingers hurt. I... I think I'm screaming, but I can't hear myself over the noise.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 9. This is... it's too much. *starts breathing heavily*",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath, Margaret. Remember, you're here in my office. You're safe.",
    "Client: *takes a shaky breath* Okay... okay. I'm here. I'm safe. *pauses* The plane hits the ground with a massive impact. My head snaps forward, then back. Everything goes dark for a moment. When I come to, there's smoke everywhere. People are coughing, crying. The man next to me... he's not moving.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I unbuckle my seatbelt. My hands are shaking so much. I can smell fuel and something burning. There's a gap in the side of the plane where it split open. I... I crawl towards it. My leg hurts, I think it might be broken. I can hear people moaning in pain around me.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling right now, Margaret?",
    "Client: I'm terrified. Absolutely terrified. But also... determined. I need to get out. I need to survive.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: I manage to crawl out through the gap. The grass is wet with dew. It's early morning, the sun is just coming up. I can see flames at the front of the plane. I drag myself away, ignoring the pain in my leg. Other passengers are stumbling out too. We're in a field somewhere, I can see trees in the distance.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still high. About an 8. My heart is pounding remembering all this.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Take a moment to breathe. Remember, you survived this.",
    "Client: *takes a deep breath* Yes... I survived. I made it out. I... I remember sitting on the grass, watching the plane burn. Sirens in the distance getting closer. A woman is sobbing nearby. I feel... numb. Like it's not real.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now, in this moment?",
    "Client: I... I feel drained. Emotionally exhausted. But also... a bit lighter? Like talking about it has lifted some weight off my chest.",
    "Therapist: That's good, Margaret. You've done really well today. Let's take a few minutes to ground ourselves. Can you tell me five things you can see in this room?",
    "Client: Um... I see your bookshelf. The potted plant in the corner. The painting on the wall. The box of tissues on the table. And... my hands, they're still shaking a little.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, four things you can feel.",
    "Client: I feel the softness of this chair. The coolness of the air conditioning. My feet on the carpet. And my necklace against my skin.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Three things you can hear?",
    "Client: I hear the ticking of the clock. The faint sound of traffic outside. And... my own breathing, it's calmer now.",
    "Therapist: Very good. Two things you can smell?",
    "Client: I smell... your coffee. And the lavender air freshener.",
    "Therapist: Great. And finally, one thing you can taste?",
    "Client: I can taste... the mint from the water you gave me earlier.",
    "Therapist: Wonderful job, Margaret. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm feeling more grounded. More present. My heart rate has slowed down. I feel... okay. Tired, but okay.",
    "Therapist: That's great. You've made significant progress today. How would you rate your distress now, on the SUDS scale?",
    "Client: I'd say... about a 3 now. It's much better.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent. You've done incredibly well today, Margaret. We'll end our session here. Remember to practice your breathing exercises this week. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up?",
    "Client: No, I... I think I'm good. Thank you, Dr. Thompson. This was hard, but... I think it helped.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Margaret. I'm proud of the work you did today. We'll continue next week. Take care."
