    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. The memory of that airplane crash... it felt so real again. My heart is still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The noise. The deafening roar of the engines as the plane started to descend rapidly. I can still hear it echoing in my head. And the panic... the sheer terror on everyone's faces. It was like time stood still.",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to revisit that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... difficult. I felt my chest tighten, just like it did that day. But, um, I noticed something different this time. I was able to breathe through it a bit better. Maybe... maybe because I knew I was safe here?",
    "Therapist: That's an important observation. How does this connect to your daily life?",
    "Client: Well, I suppose... when I hear loud noises or feel trapped in small spaces, I get that same tightness in my chest. But if I can remember to breathe like we practiced, it might help me stay calmer.",
    "Therapist: Excellent insight. What else did you notice?",
    "Client: I... I realized I've been avoiding so much. Not just flying, but even watching movies with plane scenes or hearing about others' travel plans. It's like I've built this protective bubble around myself.",
    "Therapist: How has that impacted your life?",
    "Client: It's... it's limited me. I've missed family events, turned down job opportunities. My world has gotten so small. And you know what? I'm tired of it. I want my life back.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How does it feel to say that?",
    "Client: Scary, but... also liberating? Like I'm finally acknowledging how much this has controlled me. I don't want to be defined by this trauma anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. What do you think could help you move forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I need to start small. Like, watching a movie with a plane in it. Or visiting the airport, just to be around that environment again. Is that... is that something we could work on?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. How do you feel about that idea?",
    "Client: Nervous, but also... hopeful? For the first time in a long time, I feel like there might be a way through this. Like I'm not just stuck forever.",
    "Therapist: That's great progress. What else came up for you during the exposure?",
    "Client: I remembered something I had forgotten. There was a flight attendant who was so calm, so reassuring. She kept telling us it would be okay, even though I'm sure she was terrified too. I... I think I want to find that kind of strength in myself.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful memory. How might you apply that?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe I can try to be that calming presence for myself? Like, when I start to panic, I could try to speak to myself the way she spoke to us. Gently, reassuringly.",
    "Therapist: Excellent strategy. How do you feel about our session today?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... good? Like I've taken a step forward. It's hard, reliving these memories, but I can see how it's helping me process everything. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. What's your takeaway?",
    "Client: I think... I'm stronger than I've been giving myself credit for. And that there's hope for recovery. I'm not there yet, but I can see the path now, even if it's a challenging one.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How will you care for yourself today?",
    "Client: I think I'll take a long bath, maybe call my sister. Just... gentle things. And I'll try to remember to breathe if I start feeling anxious. Is that okay?",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a good plan. Anything else you want to discuss?",
    "Client: No, I think... I think I'm good for now. This was a lot, but in a good way. I'm looking forward to our next session, even though I know it'll be challenging. Thank you for your patience with me.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next time."
