    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the cult experience you mentioned?",
    "Client: Okay... I'll try. It was about five years ago. I had just moved to a new city and was feeling lonely. I met this group at a community center. They seemed so welcoming at first. They invited me to their gatherings, and I started attending regularly. It felt like I finally belonged somewhere.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue.",
    "Client: As time went on, things started to change. The leader, a man named David, became more controlling. He'd make us stay for hours, sometimes all night, listening to his teachings. If anyone questioned him, he'd become angry and threatening. I remember one night, I was so tired, I just wanted to go home, but David...",
    "Therapist: Take your time. You're safe here.",
    "Client: David grabbed my arm and yanked me back into the room. He started yelling at me in front of everyone, calling me weak and unfaithful. I was so scared and embarrassed. I can still feel his fingers digging into my skin...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with that memory.",
    "Client: (voice trembling) He pushed me down onto the floor. I hit my head on the edge of a chair. Everything was spinning, and I could hear others in the group chanting something. I felt so dizzy and confused. I wanted to run, but I couldn't move.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: (starts crying) I felt so helpless. David stood over me, screaming about how I needed to be purified. Two other members held me down while he... he poured some kind of oil on my face. I couldn't breathe. I thought I was going to die.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. Keep going.",
    "Client: (sobbing) I don't know how long it lasted. When they finally let me go, I was shaking uncontrollably. I stumbled out of there and drove home in a daze. I felt so ashamed and stupid for letting myself get into that situation. I couldn't tell anyone what happened. I just... I just...",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. You're doing incredibly well.",
    "Client: (taking deep breaths) For weeks after, I couldn't sleep. I kept seeing David's face, feeling those hands holding me down. I was terrified they would come after me. I changed my phone number, moved to a different apartment. I was always looking over my shoulder.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's... it's hard. My heart is racing, and I feel nauseous. But also... I don't know, maybe a little relieved? I've never told anyone all of this before.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You're processing it well.",
    "Client: I still have nightmares sometimes. And certain smells, like that oil, they can trigger panic attacks. But I'm trying to move forward. I started seeing a therapist - well, you - and I'm working on trusting people again. It's just... it's a slow process.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. That's commendable.",
    "Client: Thank you. It helps to talk about it, even though it's painful. I want to understand why I was so vulnerable to their manipulation. I think part of it was my loneliness, and maybe some unresolved issues from my childhood. My father was... he could be physically abusive too.",
    "Therapist: It's good you're making those connections.",
    "Client: Yeah, I'm starting to see patterns. Like how I tend to seek approval from authority figures, even when it's not healthy. I'm working on setting better boundaries now. It's hard, but I'm trying.",
    "Therapist: You're showing real insight. Well done.",
    "Client: Thanks. I still struggle with self-blame sometimes. Like, why didn't I leave sooner? Why did I let it get so far? But I'm trying to be kinder to myself. I know now that what happened wasn't my fault. I was manipulated and abused.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also a bit lighter. Talking about it is hard, but I think it helps. I want to keep working on this, to understand it better and move past it. I don't want this experience to define me forever.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. We'll continue working together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your support. It means a lot to have someone listen without judgment. I know I have a long way to go, but I feel like I'm finally on the right path.",
    "Therapist: You're making excellent progress. Shall we end here for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. This session was intense, but I'm glad we did it. Thank you for guiding me through it.",
    "Therapist: You did the hard work. Take care of yourself this week."
