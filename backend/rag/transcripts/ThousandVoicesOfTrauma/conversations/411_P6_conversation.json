    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I'll do my best.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Take a deep breath and begin when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back in the bank. It's a busy afternoon, and I'm waiting in line to deposit a check. Suddenly, there's shouting. A man with a gun bursts through the door. My heart starts racing, and I feel frozen in place.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 40. I'm starting to feel tense, but it's manageable.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The man is waving his gun around, screaming at everyone to get down. I drop to the floor, my legs shaking. I can hear people crying and whimpering around me. The smell of fear is thick in the air.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to about 60. My palms are sweating, and I'm starting to feel a bit lightheaded.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The gunman is pacing back and forth, demanding money from the tellers. I'm trying to make myself as small as possible, praying he doesn't notice me. My mouth is dry, and I can taste bile rising in my throat.",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 75 now. I feel like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. Take a moment if you need to.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) Okay. The police arrive outside. I can hear sirens and see flashing lights through the windows. The gunman starts panicking, shouting even louder. He grabs a young woman near him and puts the gun to her head. I'm terrified he's going to shoot her.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating at this point?",
    "Client: It's skyrocketed to 90. My heart feels like it's going to burst out of my chest.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. You're doing great staying with the memory.",
    "Client: The negotiator starts talking to the gunman through a megaphone. Hours pass, and we're all still on the floor. My legs are cramping, and I'm so thirsty. The woman he's holding hostage is sobbing quietly. I keep thinking about my family, wondering if I'll ever see them again.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's still around 85. I feel exhausted, but the fear isn't letting up.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: Finally, after what feels like an eternity, the gunman agrees to surrender. As he's putting down his weapon, there's a sudden movement, and a shot rings out. For a second, I think I've been hit. But it's the hostage \u2013 she collapses to the ground.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level right now?",
    "Client: It's at 95. I can barely speak. My whole body is shaking.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (breathing deeply) The police rush in. There's chaos everywhere. I'm being helped up, led outside. The bright sunlight hurts my eyes. I see the young woman being carried out on a stretcher. There's so much blood... I... I don't know if she survived.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's still very high, about 90. I feel drained, like I've relived it all over again.",
    "Therapist: You've done incredibly well. Let's start grounding yourself.",
    "Client: (nodding) Okay... I'm here in your office. I'm safe. The hostage situation is over. I survived.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You're safe now. How's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's coming down... maybe to 70 now. I feel exhausted, but also... I don't know, maybe a little stronger?",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You've shown great courage today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was hard, but... I think it helped, facing it like this.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. Let's take a few more minutes to fully ground ourselves before we end the session."
