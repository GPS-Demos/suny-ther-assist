    "Therapist: Welcome, Mr. Lee. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, I'll ask for your SUDS rating every few minutes. Are you ready?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but I understand this is part of the process.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Let's start. Close your eyes and recall the memory of losing your loved one.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... I'm back in the hospital room. The beeping of the machines is so loud. My sister... she looks so small in that bed. Her face is pale, and her breathing is labored. I'm holding her hand, but it feels cold.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating right now?",
    "Client: It's about a 6. I can feel my heart racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: Keep going. You're doing well.",
    "Client: The doctor comes in. His face is grim. He starts talking, but I can barely hear him over the rushing in my ears. \"I'm sorry, but there's nothing more we can do.\" Those words... they echo in my head. I feel like I'm underwater. My sister's hand goes limp in mine. I... I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8 now. My chest feels tight. I can feel tears in my eyes.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I start sobbing. Uncontrollably. I'm holding onto her, begging her to wake up. The nurses try to pull me away, but I can't let go. I feel so helpless, so angry at the world. Why her? Why now?",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's a 9. I feel like I'm reliving it all over again. My hands are shaking.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: (Voice trembling) I remember the silence after they turned off the machines. It was deafening. I sat there for hours, just... numb. I couldn't process it. My little sister, gone. All those childhood memories, our plans for the future... it all felt meaningless suddenly.",
    "Therapist: SUDS rating?",
    "Client: Still a 9. I feel exhausted, drained. But... but also like a weight is lifting, somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Continue.",
    "Client: As I left the hospital, the world seemed different. Colder. I remember thinking, \"How can everything just go on like nothing happened?\" I felt so alone, so... lost. But then I saw her favorite flower in the hospital garden. A small, purple lilac. And for a moment, I felt her presence. Like she was telling me it would be okay.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to a 7. I feel sad, but also... I don't know, maybe a little hopeful?",
    "Therapist: That's good. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Drained, but... lighter? Like I've released something I've been holding onto for years.",
    "Therapist: That's common. Well done today."
