    "Therapist: Welcome back, Sarah. Today we'll focus on an imaginal exposure exercise. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm a bit nervous, but I know it's important for my progress.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with your baseline SUDS rating.",
    "Client: I'd say about a 4 out of 10. I'm feeling a little anxious just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Close your eyes and describe the cyberbullying incident.",
    "Client: (takes a deep breath) I remember opening my social media and seeing dozens of notifications. As I started reading, my heart began to race. There were cruel comments about my appearance, my job, even threats... It felt like the whole world was against me.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's gone up to a 6. My palms are getting sweaty, and I feel a tightness in my chest.",
    "Therapist: Keep going. You're doing well.",
    "Client: The messages kept coming. I couldn't stop reading them. Some were from people I thought were friends. I felt so betrayed and exposed. My hands were shaking as I tried to delete the posts, but they just kept coming.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's a 7 now. I'm feeling really overwhelmed, like I'm right back in that moment.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Stay with it. What happened next?",
    "Client: I... I called in sick to work. I couldn't face anyone. I spent the whole day in bed, crying and checking my phone obsessively. The worst part was feeling so helpless and alone.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: My SUDS is at an 8. I'm having trouble breathing, and I feel like I might cry.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (inhales shakily) It's hard to talk about this. I felt so worthless, like maybe they were right about me. I started drinking that night, just to numb the pain.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: Still an 8. My heart is pounding, and I feel nauseous.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The next few days were a blur. I barely ate or slept. I was terrified to check my phone but couldn't stop myself. Every notification made me jump. I felt like I was losing my mind.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's actually gone down to a 7. I'm still anxious, but talking about it is helping a little.",
    "Therapist: That's good. Continue.",
    "Client: I finally reached out to a friend after a few days. She came over and helped me report the worst comments and block some accounts. It was the first time I felt a glimmer of hope.",

    "Therapist: You should be. We'll process this next session."
