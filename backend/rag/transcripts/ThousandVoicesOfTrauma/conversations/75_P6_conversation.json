    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, you're in control. Can you start by describing the airplane crash scene?",
    "Client: Okay... I'm sitting in my seat, feeling the vibrations of the plane. The turbulence is getting worse, and people are starting to look worried. I can hear the captain's voice, but it's muffled. My heart is racing, and my palms are sweaty.",
    "Therapist: How would you rate your distress right now, on a scale of 0 to 100?",
    "Client: I'd say about 40. It's uncomfortable, but I can manage.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Continue describing what you're experiencing.",
    "Client: The plane suddenly drops, and oxygen masks fall. There's chaos all around me. People are screaming, and I can't breathe properly. I'm trying to put on my mask, but my hands are shaking so much. The fear is overwhelming, and I feel like I'm going to pass out.",
    "Therapist: And your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about 75. I feel like I'm actually there again.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I can see the ground getting closer through the window. The plane is tilting, and luggage is falling from the overhead compartments. I'm gripping the armrests so tight my knuckles are white. I can't stop thinking about my family, wondering if I'll ever see them again. The noise is deafening - metal screeching, alarms blaring, people praying and crying.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm at 90. My chest feels tight, and I'm having trouble catching my breath.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great. Remember, this is just a memory.",
    "Client: (breathing deeply) Okay... The impact is violent. My body slams forward, then back. Everything goes dark for a moment. When I come to, there's smoke everywhere. I can smell fuel and something burning. People are pushing to get out. I'm frozen in my seat, unable to move. Someone grabs my arm, pulling me into the aisle. We're stumbling towards an exit, and I can see flames outside.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's 100. I feel like I can't breathe. My heart is pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. This is just a memory. Take another deep breath.",
    "Client: (taking shaky breaths) I... I made it out of the plane. But there's chaos on the ground. People are injured, crying for help. I can hear sirens in the distance. I'm shaking uncontrollably, looking back at the burning plane, realizing how close I came to death.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 85. I still feel shaky, but I know I survived.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. Let's stay with this for a bit longer.",
    "Client: The rescue teams are arriving. I'm being led away from the crash site, wrapped in a blanket. I'm in shock, I think. Everything feels surreal, like I'm watching it happen to someone else. But the smell of smoke is so strong, it keeps pulling me back to reality.",
    "Therapist: And your distress level?",
    "Client: It's about 70 now. I'm starting to feel a bit calmer, but still very shaken.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're processing this memory well.",
    "Client: I'm in a makeshift medical area. They're checking me for injuries, but I barely feel anything. I'm just numb. I keep replaying the crash in my mind, wondering how I survived when others didn't. The guilt is starting to set in.",
    "Therapist: How would you rate your distress now?",
    "Client: It's down to about 60. I'm feeling more grounded, but still emotional.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Let's wrap up the exercise. Take a few deep breaths and slowly bring yourself back to the present."
