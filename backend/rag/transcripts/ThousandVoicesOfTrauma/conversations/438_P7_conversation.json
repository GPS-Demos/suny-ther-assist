    "Therapist: Welcome, Carlos. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm... okay, I guess. A bit nervous about today's session, to be honest.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. We're here to support you.",
    "Client: Thanks. I've been thinking a lot about what we discussed last time, about the incident with the police. It's been hard to shake off.",
    "Therapist: I appreciate you sharing that. Are you ready to revisit that memory?",
    "Client: I think so. It's not easy, but I know it's important.",
    "Therapist: You're showing great courage. Let's begin when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm back there, on that street corner. It's late afternoon, and I'm waiting for the bus after work. I see two police officers approaching, and my heart starts racing. I've done nothing wrong, but I can't help feeling anxious.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: They come closer, and one of them starts asking me questions. His tone is aggressive, accusatory. I try to remain calm, but I can feel my hands shaking. I explain that I'm just waiting for the bus, but they don't seem to believe me.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The other officer starts circling behind me, and I feel trapped. My mouth goes dry, and I can barely speak. They keep pressing me, asking for ID, questioning why I'm in this neighborhood. I feel so... so humiliated and angry. Why am I being treated like a criminal?",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Continue.",
    "Client: I reach for my wallet to show my ID, and suddenly, one of them grabs my arm roughly. I flinch, and the next thing I know, I'm being slammed against the wall. The pain... the shock... it's overwhelming. I can't breathe. I keep thinking, \"This can't be happening. What did I do wrong?\"",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with it.",
    "Client: People are watching, but no one helps. I feel so alone, so powerless. They're twisting my arm behind my back, and I'm terrified they're going to break it. I try to explain, to plead with them, but they're not listening. It's like I'm not even human to them.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're strong.",
    "Client: I... I can't... This is too much. I feel like I'm back there, helpless and scared.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're here, you're safe.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Okay... okay. I'm here. It's just... it's so vivid. The fear, the anger, the shame... it all comes rushing back.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Shaken, but... maybe a little stronger? It's hard to face these memories, but talking about it... it helps somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. You should be proud.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still painful, but I feel like I'm starting to process it better. Is this... is this normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, it's a normal part of healing. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It's just... sometimes I wonder if I'll ever fully get past this. Will these feelings ever go away completely?",
    "Therapist: Healing takes time. We'll work through this together.",
    "Client: I hope so. It's exhausting carrying this around. But I'm glad I have a safe place to talk about it. I've never really opened up about this before, not even to my family.",
    "Therapist: That shows real strength. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, but also... lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been holding onto for too long. It's a strange feeling.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive sign. Would you like to end here?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. This was intense, but... good. Thank you for guiding me through it.",
    "Therapist: You did the hard work. We'll continue next session.",
    "Client: Okay. I'm actually looking forward to it, in a way. It's tough, but I feel like I'm making progress. Thank you again.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Carlos. Take care until next time."
