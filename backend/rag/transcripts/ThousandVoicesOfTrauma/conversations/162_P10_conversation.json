    "Therapist: Welcome back. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm feeling a bit uneasy, to be honest. But I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with your SUDS level.",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 5 or 6 right now.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Remember, we'll go at your pace. Begin when you're ready.",
    "Client: *deep breath* Alright... I'm at home. It's a regular Tuesday evening. I'm sitting on the couch, scrolling through my phone. The house is quiet, just the hum of the AC. I get a call from my sister. Her voice is... it's shaky. She says, \"It's Mom. She's gone.\" I... I can't breathe. The room starts spinning. I drop my phone. I can hear my sister's voice, tinny and far away, calling my name. But I can't... I can't respond.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My chest is tight. So tight. Like someone's sitting on it. My hands are trembling. I feel cold, but I'm sweating. It's... it's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: I... I finally pick up the phone. My sister's crying now. She's saying something about a heart attack, about how it was sudden. But the words aren't making sense. All I can think is 'Mom's gone. Mom's gone.' Over and over. I start to feel sick. I run to the bathroom and throw up. The tiles are cold against my knees. I can't stop shaking.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's an 8. Maybe 9. This is hard.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *audible breath* Okay... I'm still on the bathroom floor. My partner finds me there. They're asking what's wrong, but I can't speak. I just shake my head. They help me up, lead me back to the couch. I finally manage to choke out, \"Mom's dead.\" Saying it... saying it makes it real. I start sobbing. It's not just crying, it's... it's like my whole body is breaking apart. My partner holds me, but I barely feel it. All I can think about is Mom. How I just talked to her yesterday. How she was fine. How this can't be happening.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking about all the things left unsaid. All the times I was too busy to call. The last time I saw her, I was rushing to leave. I didn't even hug her goodbye properly. And now... now I'll never get the chance. It's crushing me. I can't breathe. I feel like I'm drowning in regret and sorrow.",
    "Therapist: Remember to breathe. You're here, you're safe.",
    "Client: *shaky breath* The night passes in a blur. I don't sleep. I just sit there, staring at nothing. My partner tries to get me to eat, to drink something, but I can't. Everything tastes like ash. The sun comes up, and it feels wrong. How can the world just go on when my mom is gone? I feel angry. At the world, at myself, even at her for leaving us. Then I feel guilty for being angry. It's a horrible cycle.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: Still high... maybe an 8. It's not getting easier.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The next few days are a haze. People come and go. I hear phrases like \"she's in a better place\" and \"time heals all wounds.\" I want to scream at them. They don't understand. Nothing will ever be okay again. I have to help with the funeral arrangements, but every decision feels impossible. Choosing a casket, picking out photos... it's surreal. Like I'm watching someone else do it.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you remember this?",
    "Client: Heavy. So heavy. Like gravity has intensified. My shoulders are slumped, my head hurts from crying. I feel exhausted, but I can't rest. Every time I close my eyes, I see her face.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What happens next?",
    "Client: The day of the funeral arrives. I'm standing in front of the mirror, trying to button my shirt, but my fingers won't cooperate. My partner helps me. We drive to the funeral home in silence. The air feels thick, oppressive. As we pull up, I see the crowd of people. Family, friends, colleagues. It hits me again - all these people are here because Mom is gone. I... I don't want to get out of the car. I can't face this.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. You're safe here.",
    "Client: *audible breath* Okay... I finally get out. People are hugging me, offering condolences, but it all feels distant. Like I'm underwater and they're on the surface. I make my way inside. The casket is there, surrounded by flowers. I can't look at it. I can't. But I have to. I force myself to approach. She looks... peaceful. But it's not her. Not really. I want to touch her hand, but I'm afraid. Afraid of how cold she'll be. I... I start to panic. I can't breathe. The room is closing in on me.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's a 10. I can't... I can't do this.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Remember, you're here with me. You're safe. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *shaky breath* I... I step back from the casket. My sister is there, she holds my hand. We sit down for the service. People speak about Mom - her kindness, her strength, her love for us. Each word is like a knife. I should be up there, saying something. But I can't. I'm frozen. The service ends, and we move to the cemetery. It's a beautiful day, which feels wrong. How can the sun be shining when we're burying my mother? They lower the casket, and it's final. She's really gone. I throw a handful of dirt into the grave, and the sound it makes... it echoes in my head. Over and over.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Empty. Hollow. Like a part of me is being buried with her. I want to collapse, to scream, to do something. But I just stand there, numb. People are leaving, offering more condolences. I barely hear them. All I can focus on is that mound of fresh earth. My partner gently leads me away. In the car, I finally break down. I cry until I have no tears left. We get home, and I go straight to bed. I don't want to face the world. I don't want to face a life without her.",
    "Therapist: You've done really well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. Emotionally and physically. But... there's a small sense of relief. Like I've let some of it out.",
    "Therapist: That's good. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's come down to about a 6, I think.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves. Look around the room and name five things you can see.",
    "Client: Okay... I see the painting on the wall, the plant in the corner, your desk, the clock, and the bookshelf.",
    "Therapist: Good. Now, take a deep breath. How do you feel?",
    "Client: A bit calmer. Still sad, but... not as overwhelmed.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. You did very well today. Remember, healing takes time. We'll continue to work through this together.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard, but... I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: I'm glad to hear that. We'll end our session here. Take care of yourself this week, and I'll see you next time."

We get home, and I go straight to bed. I don't want to face the world. I don't want to face a life without her.",
