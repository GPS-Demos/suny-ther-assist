    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the workplace accident?",
    "Client: Okay... I was working at the campus coffee shop. It was a busy morning, and I was making a latte. Suddenly, I heard a loud crash behind me. I turned around and saw that a heavy shelf had fallen, pinning my coworker Sarah underneath. There was so much noise, people screaming, coffee mugs shattered everywhere...",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you saw and felt.",
    "Client: I... I froze for a moment. My heart was racing, and I felt like I couldn't breathe. Sarah was crying out in pain, and I could see blood on the floor near her head. I wanted to help, but I felt paralyzed.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe now.",
    "Client: I finally snapped out of it and rushed to help. Other coworkers were already trying to lift the shelf. I remember the weight of it, how heavy it felt as we all struggled to lift it off Sarah. Her face was so pale, and she looked terrified. I kept thinking, \"What if we can't get her out? What if she's seriously hurt?\"",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with that moment.",
    "Client: As we lifted the shelf, I could hear Sarah's sobs of relief. But then I saw the extent of her injuries - her arm was bent at an unnatural angle, and there was a deep gash on her forehead. The sight of all that blood made me feel dizzy and nauseous. I remember the metallic smell, mixed with the aroma of coffee. It was overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: I helped Sarah sit up, trying to keep her calm while we waited for the ambulance. But inside, I was panicking. My hands were shaking, and I felt like I might faint. I kept replaying the moment of the crash in my head, thinking about what I could have done differently. Maybe if I had noticed the shelf was unstable earlier...",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those thoughts, but remember, it wasn't your fault.",
    "Client: After the paramedics took Sarah away, I had to stay and talk to the manager and police. I felt so detached, like I was watching everything happen from outside my body. For weeks after, I couldn't stop thinking about it. Every time I heard a loud noise, I'd jump. I started having nightmares about shelves falling and not being able to save people...",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job describing your experience. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I... I feel shaky, like my heart is racing again. Talking about it brings back those feelings of panic and helplessness. But also... I feel a little relieved to be sharing this. It's hard, but I think it's helping.",
    "Therapist: That's completely normal. You're very brave for facing this.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still difficult to think about, especially the \"what ifs.\" I worry about something like that happening again, and I'm not sure I could handle it. Sometimes I feel guilty for being so affected when Sarah was the one who got hurt.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. It's okay to be affected by what you witnessed.",
    "Client: I guess you're right. It's just... I've never experienced anything like that before. It made me realize how quickly things can go wrong, even in a seemingly safe place like a coffee shop. I keep thinking about how fragile life is, and it scares me.",
    "Therapist: That's a natural reaction to trauma. You're processing it well.",
    "Client: Sometimes I feel silly for being so shaken up about it. I mean, accidents happen all the time, right? But I can't seem to shake off the fear and anxiety. It's affecting my studies too. I have trouble concentrating in class because I'm always on edge, expecting something bad to happen.",
    "Therapist: Your reaction is not silly. It's a normal response to a traumatic event.",
    "Client: I appreciate you saying that. It helps to know that what I'm feeling isn't abnormal. I just want to be able to go about my day without constantly reliving that moment or being afraid of what might happen next. Is that possible?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. That's what we're working towards. You're making progress.",
    "Client: Thank you. I hope so. It's exhausting being on high alert all the time. I miss feeling carefree and relaxed. Even simple things like going to a caf\u00e9 with friends have become challenging. I'm always scanning for potential dangers, which makes it hard to enjoy myself.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. We'll work on coping strategies together.",
    "Client: I'd like that. I want to be able to feel safe again, to not let this experience control my life. It's frustrating because logically, I know the chances of something like that happening again are slim, but emotionally, I can't seem to convince myself of that.",
    "Therapist: Your awareness is a positive step. We'll build on that in our sessions.",
    "Client: I hope so. I'm tired of feeling this way, but talking about it like this... it does help a little. It's like each time I describe it, it loses a tiny bit of its power over me. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's exactly what we're aiming for. You're doing great.",
    "Client: Thank you. I feel drained after talking about it, but also a little lighter. It's strange how that works. I'm glad I decided to seek help instead of trying to deal with this on my own. It was hard to admit I needed support, but I'm starting to see how important it is.",
    "Therapist: Recognizing the need for help is a strength. You should be proud of yourself.",
    "Client: I'm trying to be. It's a process, I guess. But I'm committed to working through this. I want to be able to enjoy my college years without this constant fear hanging over me. I want to be able to work part-time jobs without panicking. I just want to feel... normal again.",
    "Therapist: That's an excellent goal. We'll work towards it together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I really appreciate your support and guidance through this. It means a lot to have someone listen and understand without judgment. I'm hopeful that with time and more sessions like this, I'll be able to move past this trauma and reclaim my life.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Your resilience is admirable. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. I feel emotionally drained, but in a constructive way, if that makes sense. Thank you again for your help and support. I'm looking forward to our next session and continuing this work.",
    "Therapist: You've done excellent work today. Take care, and I'll see you next time."
