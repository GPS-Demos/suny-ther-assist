    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mr. Alvarez?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling pretty shaken up, to be honest. It's like I was right back there, you know? The sounds, the smells, everything just came flooding back. I could feel my heart racing, just like it did that day.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The helplessness. I felt so... powerless. When I saw those officers beating that young man, I wanted to intervene, but I was frozen. I kept thinking, \"What if that was my son?\" It brought back all those memories of feeling neglected as a child, like no one was there to protect me.",
    "Therapist: How did reliving that memory feel different today?",
    "Client: It was... um, still difficult, but maybe a bit less overwhelming? I noticed I could breathe through it more easily this time. But the guilt... the guilt is still there.",
    "Therapist: What thoughts come up around that guilt?",
    "Client: I should have done something. I'm a coward for just standing there. What kind of man am I if I can't even protect others? It's like... like I'm that helpless child again, unable to change anything.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your everyday life now?",
    "Client: I... I guess I'm always on edge, especially around authority figures. I avoid police at all costs. And I'm overprotective of my kids, always worried something will happen to them. It's exhausting, living like this.",
    "Therapist: What progress do you notice in how you're handling these memories?",
    "Client: Well, I'm talking about it, aren't I? That's... that's something I couldn't do before. And like I said, I could breathe through it better this time. Maybe... maybe I'm not as weak as I thought.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. How might this impact your goals?",
    "Client: I... I want to feel safer in the world. Maybe if I can face this memory, I can start to trust that I can handle difficult situations. And maybe... maybe I can start to forgive myself for not acting that day.",
    "Therapist: What's helping you move forward?",
    "Client: Talking about it helps. And... and realizing that my reaction was normal, given my past. I'm starting to see that I'm not alone in this. It's still hard, but I feel like I'm finally facing it instead of running away.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's scary, but... I think I need to. I want to be there for my kids without this constant fear. And I want to feel like I have control over my life again. So yeah, I'm willing to keep going.",
    "Therapist: That takes courage. What support do you need?",
    "Client: I... I think I need reminders that I'm safe now. And maybe some more tools to handle the anxiety when it comes up. And... and just knowing that you believe in me, that helps too.",
    "Therapist: We'll work on that together. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, but... maybe a little lighter? Like I've put down a bit of the weight I've been carrying. It's a strange feeling, but not a bad one.",
    "Therapist: That's natural. What will you do to take care of yourself today?",
    "Client: I think I'll call my sister. She's always been supportive. And maybe go for a walk in the park. Being in nature helps calm me down. And I'll try those breathing exercises you taught me if things get overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Excellent plan. Anything else you want to discuss?",
    "Client: No, I think... I think I'm good for now. Thank you for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm finally moving forward.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great work. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, I'll be here. Thank you again."
