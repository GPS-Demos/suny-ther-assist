    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. My heart's still racing a bit, and I feel kind of shaky. But at the same time, there's this weird sense of relief? Like, I got through it, you know? It's hard to put into words.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sounds. God, the sounds were so vivid this time. The explosions, the shouting, the... the screams. It's like I was right back there in the thick of it. I could almost smell the smoke and feel the heat on my skin. It's strange how some details become so sharp while others fade away.",
    "Therapist: How did reliving those sounds affect you?",
    "Client: It was intense. My palms got all sweaty, and I felt this tightness in my chest. For a moment, I thought I might have a panic attack. But then I remembered the breathing exercises we've been practicing, and that helped ground me a bit. It's still scary, though. I hate how vulnerable it makes me feel.",
    "Therapist: You used your coping skills. That's progress.",
    "Client: Yeah, I guess so. It's just... it's frustrating, you know? I've been out of active duty for years now, but these memories still have such a hold on me. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever truly feel safe again.",
    "Therapist: What does safety mean to you now?",
    "Client: Hmm... that's a good question. I suppose safety means being able to go about my day without constantly looking over my shoulder. It means not flinching at every loud noise or getting anxious in crowded places. And maybe... maybe it means being able to talk about my experiences without feeling like I'm right back in the middle of it all.",
    "Therapist: How has your perception of safety changed?",
    "Client: It's definitely evolved. Before all this, safety was just... normal. I took it for granted. Now, it's something I have to actively work towards. It's not just about physical safety anymore; it's about feeling emotionally and mentally secure too. And that's a lot harder to achieve.",
    "Therapist: You're gaining insight into your needs.",
    "Client: I suppose I am. It's just... it's a long road, you know? And sometimes it feels like for every step forward, I take two steps back. Like today - I thought I was prepared for the imaginal exposure, but it still hit me hard. I'm worried about how I'll cope with these feelings once I leave here.",
    "Therapist: What specific concerns do you have?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried about the nightmares coming back. They had started to decrease, but after sessions like this, they tend to flare up again. And I'm concerned about how it might affect my relationship with my husband. He's been so supportive, but I know it's hard for him to see me struggle. Plus, there's the chronic pain to deal with on top of everything else. It just feels overwhelming sometimes.",
    "Therapist: How might you address these concerns?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. I guess I could try to be more open with my husband about what I'm going through. Maybe we could come up with a plan together for those tough nights. And I should probably be more diligent about my pain management routine. As for the nightmares... I suppose I could try writing them down when they happen, like we discussed before. It might help to get them out of my head and onto paper.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent strategies. How else can you support yourself?",
    "Client: Well, I've been thinking about joining that support group you mentioned. It might be helpful to connect with others who've been through similar experiences. And I know I need to be more consistent with my meditation practice. It really does help when I actually do it. Oh, and maybe I could schedule some extra self-care activities this week, like a massage or a long bath. Something to help me relax and process everything.",
    "Therapist: You're taking active steps. That's commendable.",
    "Client: Thanks. It's not easy, but I'm trying. I just hope it gets easier with time. Do you think it will? I mean, will there ever be a point where I can think about my experiences without feeling like this?",
    "Therapist: What are your thoughts on that?",
    "Client: I... I want to believe it will get better. Some days, I can see progress, you know? Like today, even though it was tough, I got through the exposure without completely falling apart. That's something, right? But other days, it feels like I'm right back at square one. I guess... I guess I'm hoping that eventually, the good days will outnumber the bad. That these memories will lose some of their power over me.",
    "Therapist: That's a realistic and hopeful outlook.",
    "Client: Yeah, I'm trying to stay hopeful. It's just... it's a daily battle, you know? But I'm committed to this process. I want to get better, not just for myself, but for my family too. They deserve to have me fully present, not constantly haunted by the past. So I'll keep pushing forward, even on the tough days. I have to believe it's worth it in the end.",
    "Therapist: Your determination is admirable. Shall we wrap up?",
    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. I'm feeling pretty drained after all of this. But... thank you. For guiding me through this and for helping me process everything. I know we still have a long way to go, but I feel like I'm starting to see a path forward. It's not easy, but at least I don't feel like I'm stumbling around in the dark anymore.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, Sarah."
