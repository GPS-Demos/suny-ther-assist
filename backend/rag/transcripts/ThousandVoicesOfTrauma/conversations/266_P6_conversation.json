    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure exercise. Can you share your initial SUDS rating before we start?",
    "Client: Um, I'd say about a 40. I'm feeling a bit nervous, but not overwhelmed yet.",
    "Therapist: Okay. Let's proceed. Describe the workplace incident.",
    "Client: Right... It was just after lunch. I was at my desk when the ground started shaking. At first, I thought it was just a tremor, but then it got stronger. Papers were flying off desks, and I could hear people shouting. The lights flickered, and then went out completely. I froze... I couldn't move.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's gone up to about 60. My heart's starting to race a bit.",
    "Therapist: That's normal. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: Okay... The shaking got worse. I could hear glass breaking and things falling. Someone yelled to get under the desks. I tried to move, but my legs felt like lead. I just sat there, gripping my chair. The ceiling started to crack, and bits of plaster were falling. I was certain the building was going to collapse on us.",
    "Therapist: And your SUDS now?",
    "Client: It's... probably around 75. I can feel my palms getting sweaty, and my chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: The shaking seemed to last forever. I could hear people crying and praying. I thought about my wife, wondering if I'd ever see her again. Then there was this loud crash - part of the ceiling had come down near the entrance. That's when I finally snapped out of it and dove under my desk. I was shaking so badly, I could barely breathe.",
    "Therapist: How's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 85 now. My heart's pounding, and I feel a bit dizzy.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) The shaking finally stopped, but the aftermath was chaos. People were panicking, trying to get out. The stairwell was jammed. I remember the acrid smell of dust and the sound of distant sirens. We had to climb over debris to get out. When we finally made it outside, the street looked like a war zone. Cars were crushed by fallen debris, and people were wandering around in shock.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... still around 85. I feel nauseous thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: We were herded to a nearby park. I couldn't get my phone to work to call my wife. I kept thinking about aftershocks, about the building collapsing with us inside. I felt so helpless, so... small. It took hours before I could reach my family. Those hours of uncertainty were almost worse than the quake itself.",
    "Therapist: And your current SUDS?",
    "Client: It's coming down a bit... maybe 70 now. I'm still shaky, but talking about it... it helps somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's good. How are you feeling overall?",
    "Client: Drained, but... oddly relieved. It's like... like I've been carrying this weight, and now I'm starting to put it down. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. That's a common experience.",
    "Client: I never realized how much this was still affecting me. Even now, when I'm in tall buildings, I find myself looking for exits, imagining what could happen. But talking about it... it's hard, but it feels important.",
    "Therapist: It is. What's your SUDS now?",
    "Client: Down to about 50, I think. I'm feeling calmer, though still a bit on edge.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. Well done.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's... it's tough to revisit, but I think I understand now why we're doing this. It's like... facing the memory head-on takes away some of its power, you know?",
    "Therapist: Exactly. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm willing to keep going. It's not easy, but I want to get better. I want to feel safe again, especially at work. I think this could help me get there.",
    "Therapist: That's a great attitude. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm feeling pretty exhausted, but also... lighter, somehow. Like I've taken a step forward.",
    "Therapist: You have. Remember to practice your breathing exercises.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you... for guiding me through this. It means a lot.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you next week."
