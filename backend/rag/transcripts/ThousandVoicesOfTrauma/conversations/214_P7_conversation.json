    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and bring yourself back to the car accident. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see the road ahead. It's dark, and there's a light drizzle. The windshield wipers are moving back and forth. I'm driving home from my friend's house. I feel... uneasy.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Stay with that memory.",
    "Client: The road curves slightly to the left. I'm following it, but then... suddenly, there's a bright light. Headlights. They're in my lane, coming straight at me. My heart starts racing. I... I can't...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I grip the steering wheel tightly. My knuckles are white. I try to swerve, but it's too late. There's a deafening crash. Metal crunching, glass shattering. I feel a sharp pain in my chest as the airbag deploys. Everything's spinning. I can't breathe. I'm... I'm terrified.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Keep going.",
    "Client: The car comes to a stop. It's silent now, except for the hissing of the engine and my own ragged breathing. I smell gasoline and burning rubber. My head is throbbing. I try to move, but I'm pinned. I can taste blood in my mouth. I want to call for help, but no sound comes out. I'm trapped, alone, in pain. I... I think I'm going to die.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Stay with those feelings.",
    "Client: I hear sirens in the distance. They're getting closer. I feel a mix of relief and panic. What if they don't get here in time? What if the car explodes? I'm struggling to stay conscious. The pain is overwhelming. I see flashing lights through my cracked windshield. Someone's shouting, but I can't make out the words. Everything's fading...",
    "Therapist: You're safe now. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: I... I remember being pulled from the wreckage. There are paramedics all around me. They're asking me questions, but I can barely respond. I'm on a stretcher now, being loaded into an ambulance. The lights are so bright. I'm shivering uncontrollably. I can't stop thinking about how close I came to dying. It's... it's too much.",
    "Therapist: You're doing incredibly well. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I feel... shaken. My heart's still racing, and my hands are trembling. But... I also feel a strange sense of relief. Like I've confronted something I've been avoiding for a long time. It's intense, but... I think I needed this.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal reaction. You've shown great courage.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this in such detail. It's always been too painful, too overwhelming. But somehow, doing this... it feels like I'm taking back control. Like I'm not just a victim anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. How do you feel about continuing?",
    "Client: I... I think I can go on. It's difficult, but I want to face this. I want to process what happened and move forward. Can we... can we talk about what happened at the hospital next?",
    "Therapist: Of course. Whenever you're ready, begin describing your experience at the hospital.",
    "Client: Okay. I remember being wheeled into the emergency room. The lights were so bright, and there was so much noise. Doctors and nurses were rushing around. I was still in shock, I think. They were cutting away my clothes, attaching monitors. I could hear the steady beep of a heart monitor. Someone was asking me questions - my name, if I had any allergies. I tried to answer, but my voice was shaky.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: They took me for scans - X-rays, CT scans. I remember feeling claustrophobic in the CT machine. The pain was getting worse as the adrenaline wore off. My whole body hurt, especially my chest and left arm. They told me I had broken ribs, a fractured arm, and a concussion. I kept asking about the other driver, but no one would tell me anything. I was scared... scared that I might have killed someone.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those concerns. You're handling this memory well.",
    "Client: I spent the night in the hospital. It was the longest night of my life. I couldn't sleep because of the pain and the constant noise. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw those headlights coming at me. I felt so alone and vulnerable. My parents arrived the next morning. Seeing them... it made everything real. I broke down crying when they hugged me. I realized how close I had come to never seeing them again.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful moment. How does recalling it make you feel now?",
    "Client: It's... it's still painful, but in a different way. I feel grateful that I survived, that I got to see my parents again. But I also feel a deep sadness for what I went through, for the pain I caused my family. And there's still this lingering fear... a fear of driving, of being in cars. It's like the accident is always there, just waiting to happen again.",
    "Therapist: Those are all valid feelings. You've shown incredible strength today.",
    "Client: Thank you. I never thought I'd be able to talk about this without completely falling apart. It's still hard, and I still feel shaky, but... I also feel a bit stronger. Like maybe I can face this and eventually move past it.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. How would you like to proceed?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need a moment to breathe. Can we take a short break? This has been intense, and I want to process what we've talked about before we continue.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let's take a few minutes. You've done excellent work today."
