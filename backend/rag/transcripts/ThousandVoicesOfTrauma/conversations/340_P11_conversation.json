    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. The memory of the car accident feels so vivid now. I can still hear the screeching of tires and smell the burnt rubber. It's like I'm right back there, you know? My heart is still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The helplessness, I think. I remember feeling completely frozen, unable to do anything as the other car came towards me. It's frustrating because I keep thinking maybe I could have done something differently, swerved or braked harder. But in that moment, I just... couldn't.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. How does reflecting on that helplessness feel now?",
    "Client: It's... uncomfortable. Makes me feel weak, I guess. Like I should have been able to do more. But at the same time, I know logically that it happened so fast. Maybe there really wasn't anything I could've done.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. How does it compare to your day-to-day feelings?",
    "Client: You know, now that you mention it, I think I've been carrying that feeling of helplessness with me. It's like I'm always on edge, waiting for something bad to happen that I can't control. It affects my work, my relationships... even just going out to the grocery store feels overwhelming sometimes.",
    "Therapist: I see. What connections are you making?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe this constant state of alertness, it's stemming from that moment in the accident. Like I'm trying to make up for not being able to prevent it by always being ready for the next disaster. But it's exhausting, and it's not really helping.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How might this awareness change things for you?",
    "Client: Well, maybe I can start to give myself a break. Recognize that I can't control everything, and that's okay. It might help me relax a bit more in my daily life. I've been so tense all the time, it's affecting my chronic pain too. Maybe if I can let go of some of this hyper-vigilance, it'll help with the pain as well.",
    "Therapist: Excellent observation. What's one small step you could take?",
    "Client: Hmm... Maybe I could try some relaxation techniques when I feel that tension building up. Or... you know, I've been avoiding driving on the highway where the accident happened. Maybe I could try taking a short trip there, just to prove to myself that it's not inherently dangerous.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like great ideas. How do you feel about trying them?",
    "Client: A bit nervous, to be honest. But also... hopeful? Like maybe I can start reclaiming some of the parts of my life that I've been avoiding. It won't be easy, but I think it'll be worth it.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. What else came up during the exposure?",
    "Client: I noticed I was really focused on the physical sensations. The jolting impact, the tightness in my chest. It made me realize how much tension I carry in my body all the time now. I wonder if that's contributing to my chronic pain issues.",
    "Therapist: Interesting connection. How might addressing one affect the other?",
    "Client: I suppose if I can find ways to release some of that physical tension, it might help with both the PTSD symptoms and the chronic pain. Maybe I need to pay more attention to my body in general, not just during these sessions.",
    "Therapist: That's a valuable insight. What support do you need moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe some guidance on body-awareness techniques? And... I know it's hard, but I want to keep doing these exposures. They're tough, but I can see how they're helping me process everything. I just might need some extra encouragement sometimes.",
    "Therapist: I hear you. Your commitment is commendable. Anything else you want to discuss?",
    "Client: I'm curious about how this trauma might be affecting my relationship. I've been pretty withdrawn lately, and I know it's putting a strain on things. I want to work on that too, if we can.",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. We'll address that in future sessions. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense. Like I've done some hard but important work. I'm looking forward to seeing how I can apply what we've talked about today in my daily life.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive outlook. Remember to be kind to yourself. See you next week?",
    "Client: Yes, definitely. Thank you for your help today. I'm glad we're doing this work together."
