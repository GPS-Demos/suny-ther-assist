    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. That was really intense, reliving the car accident. I could almost smell the burning rubber and feel the impact again.",
    "Therapist: That sounds overwhelming. What stood out most to you?",
    "Client: The sound. The screeching of tires and then the deafening crash. It's so different from the explosions I heard in combat, but somehow it brought all those memories flooding back too. I felt trapped, like I couldn't escape, just like in the war.",
    "Therapist: How did your body react during the memory?",
    "Client: My heart was pounding. I could feel myself tensing up, especially in my shoulders and jaw. My chronic pain in my back flared up too, which doesn't usually happen unless I'm really stressed.",
    "Therapist: That's insightful. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: A bit shaky, to be honest. But... also kind of relieved? It's weird. Like, I faced it and I'm still here.",
    "Therapist: That's a common experience. What thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how different my life would be if I hadn't been in that accident. Or the war. I'd probably still have my job, maybe even be married by now. It's hard not to feel angry about it all.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have those feelings. How does this connect to your day-to-day struggles?",
    "Client: I guess... I'm always on edge, waiting for the next bad thing to happen. It's exhausting. And it affects my relationships too. My girlfriend doesn't understand why I get so jumpy sometimes.",
    "Therapist: That sounds challenging. What have you learned from today's session?",
    "Client: I realized that even though the car accident and my war experiences are different, they affect me in similar ways. Maybe if I can work through one, it'll help with the other too? And... I think I'm stronger than I give myself credit for. Reliving that memory was tough, but I did it.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How can you use this moving forward?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I need to be more open with my girlfriend about what I'm going through. And perhaps I can try some of those grounding techniques we talked about when I start feeling overwhelmed by memories.",
    "Therapist: Excellent ideas. How do you feel about continuing with the exposures?",
    "Client: It's scary, but... I think it's helping. I want to keep going. I want my life back, you know?",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is admirable. What else would you like to discuss?",
    "Client: I'm worried about the nightmares. They've been getting worse since we started the therapy. Is that normal? Will they ever stop?",
    "Therapist: It's not uncommon. How are you coping with them?",

    "Therapist: That sounds difficult. What might help you feel safer at night?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe having a routine before bed? Or... talking to my girlfriend about it so I don't feel so alone?",
    "Therapist: Those are good suggestions. Anything else on your mind?",
    "Client: Yeah, actually. I've been thinking about looking for a job again. The idea terrifies me, but I can't stay unemployed forever. Do you think I'm ready for that?",
    "Therapist: What do you think about your readiness?",
    "Client: I don't know. Some days I feel like I could take on the world, and others I can barely get out of bed. But maybe... maybe that's okay? Maybe I don't have to be 100% better to start trying?",
    "Therapist: That's a mature perspective. How might job searching affect your recovery?",
    "Client: It could give me a sense of purpose again. Something to focus on besides my trauma. But it could also be really stressful. I'm worried about how I'll handle it if I get rejected or if I struggle to perform at work.",
    "Therapist: Valid concerns. How might you address those worries?",
    "Client: I suppose I could start small. Maybe look for part-time work or volunteering first. And I could use the coping strategies we've been working on if things get overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Excellent plan. Anything else you'd like to discuss today?",
    "Client: I think that's it for now. This session was tough, but... I feel like I'm making progress. Slowly, but it's there. Thank you for your help.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. I'm proud of your effort today."
