    "Therapist: Mrs. Patel, today we'll begin imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, Dr. Johnson. To be honest, I'm quite nervous. The idea of revisiting those memories from the hospital... it's frightening. I've spent so long trying to forget.",
    "Therapist: Your apprehension is understandable. Can you tell me more?",
    "Client: Well, it's just... every time I think about that day, I feel so helpless. The beeping machines, the smell of antiseptic, the doctors rushing around... It's like I'm right back there, trapped and alone. And then my mind wanders to all those poor souls I've seen on the news, victims of trafficking. It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: I see. How do you think facing these memories might help?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe it could help me process what happened? But I'm afraid it might make things worse. What if I can't handle it?",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. How shall we proceed?",
    "Client: I... I want to get better. My depression has been so difficult to manage lately. If this can help, I'm willing to try. But could you explain a bit more about what we'll be doing?",
    "Therapist: Of course. We'll revisit the memory gradually, with my support throughout.",
    "Client: That sounds a bit less daunting. Will I have to close my eyes? Sometimes when I do that, the memories feel too real.",
    "Therapist: You can keep your eyes open if you prefer. What else might help you feel safe?",
    "Client: Maybe... maybe if I could hold onto something? I have this small stone I carry sometimes. It helps ground me.",
    "Therapist: Excellent idea. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I think so. I'm still nervous, but I trust you, Dr. Johnson. You've been so patient with me these past few months. It's not easy opening up at my age, especially about such difficult topics. But I'm tired of letting these memories control my life. I want to be able to watch the news without falling apart, to visit the doctor without panic. So yes, I'm ready.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable, Mrs. Patel. Shall we start?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do it. I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Thank you for being here with me through this."
