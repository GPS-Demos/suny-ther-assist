    "Therapist: Welcome, James. How are you feeling about today's session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit on edge, to be honest. Knowing we're going to dive into this stuff, it's got my stomach in knots.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here. Shall we begin?",
    "Client: Yeah, let's do it. I'm as ready as I'll ever be, I suppose.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I see... I see the warehouse. It's dark, musty. The air feels heavy, like it's pressing down on me. There's a dim light flickering overhead, casting long shadows across the concrete floor.",
    "Therapist: Good. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I hear... I hear muffled sobs. Children. They're huddled in the corner, some of them so young. God, they look terrified. I... I can't believe I'm part of this.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Disgust. Shame. I feel like I'm going to be sick. My hands are shaking, and I can feel sweat trickling down my back.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about a 70. It's pretty intense.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing well. What happens next?",
    "Client: The boss comes in. He's smiling, but it's cold. He pats me on the back, says, \"Good work, James. These'll fetch a good price.\" I want to punch him, but I just nod.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I'm thinking about how I got here. How I let myself become this person. I feel trapped, like there's no way out. But there's also this voice in the back of my head screaming at me to do something, to help these kids.",
    "Therapist: Stay present. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I walk over to the kids. One of them, a little girl, she looks up at me. Her eyes... they're so full of fear. I kneel down, try to smile, but it feels wrong. I whisper, \"It's going to be okay.\" But I know it's a lie.",
    "Therapist: How does that make you feel?",
    "Client: Helpless. Angry. I'm furious at myself, at the situation. My chest feels tight, like I can't breathe properly.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. Where are you now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm still in the warehouse. The boss is talking numbers with someone on the phone. I'm standing there, feeling like a coward. I should do something, but I'm paralyzed by fear.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 85. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, James. Remember, you're safe here. What happens next?",
    "Client: I... I hear sirens in the distance. The boss starts panicking, yelling at everyone to move. There's chaos, people running everywhere. I'm frozen, can't move.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What are you experiencing?",
    "Client: My heart's racing. I can taste metal in my mouth. I'm terrified, but there's also this... this sense of relief. Like maybe this nightmare is finally ending.",
    "Therapist: Good. Keep going.",
    "Client: The police burst in. There's shouting, guns drawn. I put my hands up, fall to my knees. I'm crying, I realize. Tears are streaming down my face. I keep looking at the kids, hoping they'll be okay.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind at this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking this is it. My life is over. But I also feel... I don't know, almost grateful? Like maybe now I can start to make things right.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel?",
    "Client: Shaky. My legs feel weak, like they might give out. My stomach's churning. I feel like I might throw up.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Where are you now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm being led out in handcuffs. The sunlight is blinding after the darkness of the warehouse. I see news vans, crowds of people. I hang my head, can't bear to look at anyone.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 90 now. This is really intense.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, James. Remember, you're here, you're safe. What happens next?",
    "Client: I'm in the police car. It's quiet, just the radio crackling. I'm... I'm thinking about my family, how I've let them down. I feel hollow, like everything's been ripped away.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I see my reflection in the window. I barely recognize myself. I look... broken. But there's also this tiny spark of... I don't know, hope maybe? Like maybe this is rock bottom and I can only go up from here.",
    "Therapist: Good. How does that realization feel?",
    "Client: It's... it's overwhelming. I'm crying again, but it feels different. Like I'm mourning who I was, but also... also maybe starting to see a way forward.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe. Where are you now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm at the police station. They're processing me, taking my fingerprints. It all feels surreal, like I'm watching it happen to someone else.",

    "Therapist: How does your body feel now?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted. My whole body feels heavy, like I could sleep for days. But there's also this nervous energy, like I can't sit still.",
    "Therapist: What's your distress level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 75 now. Still high, but not as bad as before.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, James. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: Okay... okay. I'm breathing. It feels... it feels good to be back here.",
    "Therapist: Slowly open your eyes when you're ready. How are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. But also... I don't know, maybe a little lighter? Like I've let go of something I've been carrying for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's normal after an intense session like this. Well done, James. You showed incredible courage today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It was hard, but... but I think it was important. I feel like I'm starting to face things I've been running from for years.",
    "Therapist: That's a significant step. How are you feeling physically now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm tired. My muscles feel sore, like I've been in a fight. But my breathing's easier now, and the knot in my stomach has loosened a bit.",
    "Therapist: Good. Let's take a few moments to ground ourselves. Can you name five things you see in this room?",
    "Client: Uh, sure. I see... the plant in the corner, your degrees on the wall, the blue rug, the tissue box, and the clock.",
    "Therapist: Excellent. Now, four things you can touch?",
    "Client: The armrest of the chair, my shirt, my wedding ring, and... the soles of my shoes on the floor.",
    "Therapist: Great. Three things you hear?",
    "Client: The ticking of the clock, traffic outside, and... the hum of the air conditioner.",
    "Therapist: Two things you smell?",
    "Client: Coffee... and maybe some kind of air freshener? Something floral.",
    "Therapist: And finally, one thing you taste?",
    "Client: Just... the lingering taste of the mint I had earlier.",
    "Therapist: Well done, James. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: Better. More... more present. Like I'm fully back in my body.",
    "Therapist: That's great. We've covered a lot today. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I... I don't think so. This was a lot to process. I think I need some time to sit with it all.",
    "Therapist: That's completely understandable. Remember to be kind to yourself this week. We've stirred up a lot of difficult memories and emotions.",
    "Client: I will. Thank you... for guiding me through this. It was tough, but I think it was necessary.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, James. Your courage today was remarkable. We'll pick this up next week, but for now, focus on self-care. Do you have any questions before we end?",
    "Client: No, I think I'm good. Just... thank you again.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. Take care, James. I'll see you next week."
