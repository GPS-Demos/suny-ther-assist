    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure. Close your eyes and describe the airplane crash scene.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm on the plane. It's shaking violently. People are screaming. I can feel my heart racing.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you see and feel.",
    "Client: The oxygen masks drop down. I'm fumbling to put mine on. The plane suddenly dips, and I feel weightless for a moment. Oh god, this is terrifying.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The engines are making a horrible noise. Luggage is falling from the overhead compartments. I can hear a child crying nearby. I'm gripping the armrests so tightly my knuckles are white.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this bravely. Keep going.",
    "Client: The plane is losing altitude fast. The flight attendants are strapped in, looking panicked. I can see the ground getting closer through the window. I'm thinking about my family, wondering if I'll ever see them again.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're doing great.",
    "Client: We're hitting the treetops now. The impact is jarring. Metal is screeching, and glass is shattering. I'm being thrown around in my seat despite the seatbelt. I can smell smoke and feel heat.",
    "Therapist: You're very courageous. Continue describing what's happening.",
    "Client: The plane has come to a stop, but it's tilted at an angle. People are screaming and crying. I'm dizzy and in shock. My arm hurts badly - I think it might be broken. I'm trying to unbuckle my seatbelt, but my hands are shaking so much.",
    "Therapist: You're doing an excellent job. Keep going.",
    "Client: I manage to get the seatbelt off. There's chaos all around. Some people are unconscious, others are trying to help. I can see flames at the back of the plane. The emergency exits are jammed. I'm starting to panic, feeling trapped.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to feel scared. You're safe now. Continue.",
    "Client: Someone finally gets an exit open. People are pushing to get out. I'm hesitating, scared of the drop to the ground. But the smoke is getting thicker. I take a deep breath and jump. The impact when I hit the ground sends pain shooting through my injured arm.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm overwhelmed. My heart is pounding, and I feel like I can't catch my breath. It felt so real, reliving it like that.",
    "Therapist: That's completely normal. You did incredibly well.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to talk about, but... I think it helps, somehow. Like I'm processing it bit by bit.",
    "Therapist: That's exactly right. You're making progress.",
    "Client: I just... I keep thinking about the people who didn't make it. The guilt is sometimes overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to feel that way. We'll work through it together.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate your support. It makes facing these memories a little easier.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. How are you feeling now?",

    "Client: Yes, I think that would be good. This session was intense, but I feel like I've made some progress.",
    "Therapist: You absolutely have. We'll continue next time. Take care."
