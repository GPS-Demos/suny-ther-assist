    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. Let's begin our imaginal exposure exercise. Remember, you can stop anytime. Are you ready to start?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. I'm a bit nervous, but I want to try.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with your SUDS rating. How distressed are you feeling right now, on a scale of 0 to 100?",
    "Client: I'd say about a 40. My stomach feels a bit tight, but I'm okay.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and describe the memory we discussed.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm in our old apartment. It's late, maybe 11 PM. I can hear the traffic outside. Carlos just came home, and he's angry. I can smell alcohol on his breath. He's yelling about dinner not being ready. I'm trying to explain that I had a late meeting, but he's not listening. His face is red, and I can see the vein in his forehead pulsing. I'm backing away, but he's following me...",
    "Therapist: How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's going up. Maybe 60? My heart is racing, and my palms are sweaty.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: He's getting closer, and I'm running out of space. My back hits the wall, and I feel trapped. He's so much bigger than me. I can feel his spit on my face as he's screaming. Then... then he raises his hand. I flinch, waiting for the blow. It comes fast and hard across my cheek. The pain is sharp, stinging. I taste blood in my mouth...",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's your SUDS rating now?",
    "Client: It's... it's high. 80, maybe 85. I feel like I'm there again. My cheek actually hurts.",
    "Therapist: You're safe here. Keep breathing.",
    "Client: I'm sliding down the wall, trying to make myself small. He's still yelling, but it sounds muffled. I'm so scared he'll hit me again. I can't stop crying. Why didn't I just have dinner ready? Maybe if I had...",
    "Therapist: Remember, it wasn't your fault. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I know. It's just... It's hard. My SUDS is still around 80. My chest feels tight.",
    "Therapist: That's okay. You're doing great. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: I hear a loud crash. He's thrown something... a plate, I think. I can hear the pieces scatter across the floor. I'm shaking so much. I want to run, but I'm frozen. He storms off to the bedroom, slamming the door. I'm left there, on the floor, surrounded by broken ceramic. My face is throbbing, and I can taste salt from my tears mixing with the blood in my mouth...",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now? What's your SUDS?",
    "Client: It's... it's coming down a bit. Maybe 70? I feel drained, but also angry. Why did I put up with that for so long?",
    "Therapist: It's normal to have those feelings. You're processing a lot.",
    "Client: Yeah... I remember getting up slowly, my whole body aching. I catch a glimpse of myself in the hallway mirror. My left cheek is swollen and red. There's a small cut on my lip. I look... broken. That's when I knew I had to leave. I couldn't live like this anymore.",
    "Therapist: You made a brave decision. How's your distress level now?",
    "Client: It's lower now, around 55. I feel sad, but also... proud? Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a sign of growth. Let's wrap up. How do you feel overall?",
    "Client: Exhausted, but... lighter somehow. Like I've let something go. My SUDS is down to about 40 now.",
    "Therapist: That's excellent progress, Maria. We'll end here for today. Well done."
