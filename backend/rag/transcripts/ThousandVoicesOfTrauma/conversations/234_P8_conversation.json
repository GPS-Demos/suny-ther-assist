    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing, but also blank at the same time. My heart's still pounding a bit. I can feel this tightness in my chest, you know? It's like... like I'm back there again, in that room with all of them. The incense, the chanting... I can almost smell it.",
    "Therapist: What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I think. No, maybe... shame? It's this overwhelming sense of embarrassment mixed with fear. I can't believe I let myself get so caught up in it all. I was so naive, so desperate to belong somewhere. And now, remembering it, I just feel... stupid. So incredibly stupid.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to have those feelings. What thoughts are accompanying these emotions?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"How could I have been so blind?\" I was a good student, I thought I was smart. But I fell for their manipulation so easily. I let them isolate me from my family, my friends. I gave them my savings, my time, everything. And for what? Empty promises and... and emotional abuse. I feel like I've wasted years of my life that I can never get back.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel as you're sharing this?",
    "Client: My shoulders are so tense, they're practically up to my ears. My stomach feels like it's in knots. I have this urge to curl up into a ball and disappear. It's like... like I want to make myself as small as possible. I feel exposed, vulnerable. Like everyone can see what a fool I've been.",
    "Therapist: What do you notice about these physical sensations?",
    "Client: They're... they're familiar. It's how I felt all the time when I was in the cult. Always on edge, always afraid of saying or doing the wrong thing. Always trying to be perfect, to prove my devotion. It's exhausting. Even now, just remembering it, I feel drained.",
    "Therapist: How does recognizing these sensations impact you?",
    "Client: It's... oddly comforting, in a way? Like, I can see now that my body was trying to tell me something wasn't right, even when my mind was too confused to see it. But it's also frustrating. I wish I had listened to these feelings sooner. Maybe if I had, I wouldn't have stayed as long as I did.",
    "Therapist: What's coming up for you as you make that connection?",
    "Client: A mix of things, really. There's anger - at myself, at the cult leaders. But there's also a glimmer of... I don't know, hope maybe? Like, if I can recognize these feelings now, maybe I can trust myself more in the future. Maybe I can learn to listen to my instincts better. It's just... it's hard to trust myself after everything that happened.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea of rebuilding trust in yourself feel?",
    "Client: Scary, but... necessary? I know I can't go through life constantly second-guessing every decision I make. But it's hard to shake off that fear of being manipulated again. I want to believe that I'm stronger now, that I've learned from this. But there's still this voice in the back of my mind telling me I'm not smart enough, not strong enough.",
    "Therapist: What would it mean to you to challenge that voice?",
    "Client: It would be... liberating, I think. To be able to make decisions without this constant fear and self-doubt. To be able to form relationships without always wondering if someone has an ulterior motive. But it also feels... I don't know, risky? Like I'm setting myself up to be hurt again. It's this constant battle between wanting to move forward and being afraid to let my guard down.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your broader recovery journey?",
    "Client: I guess it's all part of the same process, isn't it? Learning to trust myself, to forgive myself, to believe that I deserve better. It's not just about getting over what happened in the cult, it's about rebuilding my entire sense of self. And that's... that's overwhelming sometimes. But moments like this, when I can see how far I've come, even if it's just in small ways... it gives me hope that maybe, someday, I can fully reclaim my life.",
    "Therapist: What's one small step you could take towards that goal?",
    "Client: I... I think maybe I could start by challenging some of those negative thoughts when they come up. Like, instead of just accepting that I'm \"stupid\" or \"weak,\" I could try to look at the situation more objectively. Maybe remind myself of the times I've been strong, or the things I've accomplished since leaving the cult. It's not easy, but... I think it could help.",
    "Therapist: How does that idea sit with you?",
    "Client: It's... it's a bit scary, to be honest. It's almost easier to just accept those negative thoughts as truth. But I know that's not healthy, and it's not fair to myself. I want to be able to look in the mirror and see someone worthy of respect and love. Someone who made mistakes, sure, but who's also resilient and capable of growth. It's just... it's going to take time and effort to get there.",
    "Therapist: What support do you need in this process?",
    "Client: I think... I think I need to keep talking about it, like we're doing now. Having someone to validate my feelings, to help me see things more clearly... it's invaluable. And maybe... maybe I need to start reconnecting with people outside of therapy. Rebuilding some of those relationships I lost. It's terrifying, the thought of being vulnerable again, but I know isolation isn't the answer either. I just... I need to find a balance, I guess.",
    "Therapist: How do you feel about our session today?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but in a good way, if that makes sense? Like I've released some of the pressure that's been building up inside me. It's still hard to talk about all of this, to relive those memories. But I also feel like I'm starting to understand myself better. I'm seeing connections I hadn't noticed before. It's... it's a strange mix of exhaustion and hope.",
    "Therapist: What will you take away from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... I think the biggest thing is realizing how much my past experiences are still affecting me physically and emotionally. But also, recognizing that I have the power to change how I respond to those feelings. It's not going to be easy, and I know I'll have setbacks. But for the first time in a while, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can reclaim control over my life. It's a small step, but... it feels important.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. How would you like to end our session today?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to take a moment to just breathe. To sit with these realizations and let them sink in. And maybe... maybe to thank myself for having the courage to face these memories. It's not easy, but I'm doing it. And that's something to be proud of, right?",
