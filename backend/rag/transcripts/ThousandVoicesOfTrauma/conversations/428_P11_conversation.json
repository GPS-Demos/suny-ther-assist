    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, John?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure, to be honest. It's a lot to process. The memory of that car accident... it felt so real again. My heart's still racing a bit.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The sound. The screeching of tires and then that awful crunch of metal. It's like... it's like I was right back there in that moment. I could smell the burning rubber and feel the impact. God, it's making me nauseous just thinking about it again.",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was tough. Really tough. I mean, I've avoided thinking about it for so long, you know? But... but I guess there was also something... I don't know, maybe cathartic about it? Like, I've been carrying this weight for years, and for once I didn't try to push it away. It's exhausting, though. I feel drained.",
    "Therapist: You showed a lot of courage today. How does this compare to your usual reactions?",
    "Client: Well, normally I'd do anything to avoid thinking about it. I'd probably be reaching for a drink right now, to be honest. But I'm here, I'm talking about it, and... I'm okay. Shaken up, but okay. That's... that's progress, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. What do you make of that progress?",
    "Client: I guess it shows that I can face this. It's not easy, and part of me still wants to run away from it all. But maybe... maybe I'm stronger than I thought. It's weird, but I feel a bit proud of myself. Is that strange?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. How might this relate to your broader recovery?",
    "Client: I suppose it means I don't have to let this control my life anymore. I've been avoiding so much - driving, certain roads, even watching car chases in movies. But if I can face the worst of it here, maybe I can start reclaiming those parts of my life. It's scary, but... also kind of exciting?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I think... I think I want to try driving again. Not far, just around the block maybe. But it's been years, and I'm tired of relying on others. My wife, she's been so patient, but I know she misses our road trips. Maybe we could plan a short one. Baby steps, right?",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a great goal. How can you prepare for that?",
    "Client: I could... maybe practice some of those breathing exercises we've worked on? And remind myself that it's okay to feel anxious, but that I'm safe now. Oh, and I should probably let my wife know. She's always been my rock, and I know she'd want to support me through this.",
    "Therapist: Excellent plan. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: Tired, but... good. Like I've accomplished something important. It's a strange mix of exhaustion and hope. I know we have more work to do, but for the first time in a long while, I feel like I might actually beat this thing. Thank you, really. I couldn't do this alone.",
    "Therapist: You're doing the hard work. What would you like to focus on next session?",
    "Client: I think... I'd like to delve deeper into how this accident has affected my relationships. Especially with my wife and kids. I've been so wrapped up in my own struggle, I haven't really thought about how it's impacted them. Maybe understanding that could help me connect with them better as I work through this.",
    "Therapist: That's a thoughtful direction. Anything else you'd like to add before we wrap up?",
    "Client: Just... thank you. For pushing me, but also for being patient. I know I'm not the easiest patient, especially with my depression on top of everything else. But I'm starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel. It's dim, but it's there. And that means everything.",
    "Therapist: You've made significant progress today, John. Take care, and I'll see you next week.",
    "Client: Thanks, Doc. See you then."
