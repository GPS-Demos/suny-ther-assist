    "Therapist: Welcome, Maria. How are you feeling today?",
    "Client: I'm feeling a bit nervous, to be honest. I know we're going to talk about the earthquake again, and it's always hard for me.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, you're safe here.",
    "Client: Thank you. I'll try my best. Where should I start?",
    "Therapist: Begin with the moment you first felt the tremors.",
    "Client: Okay... I was at work, in the office. It was just a normal day, you know? I remember I was typing an email when suddenly everything started shaking. At first, I thought it was just a small tremor, but then it got stronger and stronger. The whole building was swaying, and I could hear things falling and crashing all around me. I... I froze. I couldn't move. I just sat there, gripping my desk, thinking this was it, this was how I was going to die.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Maria. Keep going.",
    "Client: The shaking seemed to last forever. I could hear people screaming, and the lights were flickering on and off. I remember thinking about my family, wondering if they were okay. I felt so helpless and scared. I wanted to run, to get out of there, but I was paralyzed with fear. The sound was deafening - it was like the whole world was falling apart around me.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. You're safe now.",
    "Client: It's hard... I can still feel that fear, that panic. After what felt like an eternity, the shaking finally stopped. But then there was this eerie silence, followed by people crying and shouting. I finally managed to get up, but my legs were shaking so badly I could barely walk. The office was a mess - papers everywhere, broken glass, toppled furniture. I made my way to the stairwell with my coworkers, and we all rushed down. I was so scared there would be aftershocks, that the building would collapse with us inside.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Keep going.",
    "Client: When we got outside, it was chaos. There were people everywhere, some injured, others just looking lost and shocked. I remember the sound of sirens in the distance, getting closer. I tried to call my family, but the lines were jammed. I felt so alone and terrified, not knowing if they were okay or if our home was still standing. I just stood there, in the middle of all that destruction, feeling completely helpless and overwhelmed. It's... it's still hard to think about.",
    "Therapist: I know it's difficult. You're doing incredibly well.",
    "Client: Thanks... It's just... even now, sometimes when I feel a small vibration or hear a loud noise, I'm right back there. I feel that same panic, that same helplessness. It's affected my whole life. I lost my job because I couldn't bring myself to go back into that building. I have trouble sleeping, always worried another earthquake might hit. I feel like I'm constantly on edge, waiting for the next disaster. It's exhausting.",
    "Therapist: Your feelings are valid. You've been through a lot.",
    "Client: I know... I just wish I could move past this. I want to feel normal again, to not be scared all the time. But it's like that day changed everything. I see the world differently now. I'm always looking for exits, always prepared for the worst. It's no way to live, but I don't know how to stop.",
    "Therapist: It takes time, but you're making progress.",
    "Client: I hope so. Sometimes it feels like I'll never be the same person I was before the earthquake. I miss feeling carefree and safe. I miss not jumping at every little sound or movement. I want to be able to work again, to feel productive and useful. But every time I think about being in another office building, I start to panic. It's frustrating because I know, logically, that earthquakes don't happen every day, but emotionally, I can't seem to convince myself of that.",
    "Therapist: Your awareness is a positive step.",
    "Client: I suppose you're right. It's just... it's hard to see progress sometimes. I feel stuck, like I'm constantly reliving that day. But I am trying. I'm here, talking about it, even though it's painful. I want to get better. I want to feel safe again. I just don't know how long it will take or if I'll ever fully recover.",
    "Therapist: Every step counts. You're showing real courage.",
    "Client: Thank you. I appreciate that. It helps to know that someone understands, that I'm not alone in this. I know it's a long process, but I'm committed to working through it. I want to reclaim my life, to not let this trauma define me. It's just... it's a daily struggle, you know? But I'm here, and I'm trying. That has to count for something, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Your effort is commendable.",
    "Client: Thanks. I think... I think I need a moment. Talking about this always leaves me feeling drained. But also, in a way, a little lighter? Like each time I share it, it loses a tiny bit of its power over me. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's a common experience. Take your time.",
    "Client: Okay... I'm ready to continue. There's something else I wanted to talk about. Since the earthquake, I've been having these recurring nightmares. They're not always exactly the same, but they all have this theme of being trapped, of the earth opening up and swallowing me. Sometimes I wake up in a cold sweat, feeling like I can't breathe. It's affecting my sleep, which in turn is affecting everything else in my life. Do you think these nightmares will ever stop?",
    "Therapist: With time and work, they often do improve.",
    "Client: I hope so. It's just... it's exhausting, you know? Feeling like I can't even escape this trauma in my sleep. But I'm trying to stay positive. I've started keeping a dream journal like you suggested. It's hard to write about the nightmares, but I can see how it might help to get them out of my head and onto paper. And I've been trying those relaxation techniques before bed. Sometimes they help, sometimes they don't. But I guess that's progress, right? Even if it's small?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Small steps lead to big changes.",
    "Client: That's a good way to look at it. I'm trying to focus on those small victories. Like yesterday, I heard a loud crash outside - it was just a car backfiring, but for a moment, I thought it was another earthquake starting. My heart started racing, but I managed to use the breathing exercises we've practiced. It took a while, but I calmed down without having a full-blown panic attack. That's progress, isn't it?",
    "Therapist: Definitely. You're applying what you've learned.",
    "Client: Thank you. It helps to hear that. Sometimes I feel like I'm not making any progress at all, but when I stop and really think about it, I can see small changes. I'm still scared, still struggling, but I'm also fighting back against this fear. I'm here, talking about it, working through it. That's something the old me, the me right after the earthquake, couldn't have done. So maybe I am stronger than I give myself credit for.",
    "Therapist: You are. Your resilience is remarkable.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think... I think I'm ready to end for today. This has been intense, but also helpful. Is there anything specific you want me to focus on before our next session?",
    "Therapist: Continue with your relaxation exercises and journaling.",
    "Client: Okay, I can do that. Thank you for today. It's never easy, but I always feel a bit better after our sessions. See you next week?",
    "Therapist: Yes, take care. You did well today."

      "Client: Thank you. It helps to hear that. Sometimes I feel like I'm not making any progress at all, but when I stop and really think about it, I can see small changes. I'm still scared, still struggling, but I'm also fighting back against this fear. I'm here, talking about it, working through it. That's something the old me, the me right after the earthquake, couldn't have done. So maybe I am stronger than I give myself credit for.",

      "Client: Thank you. I think... I think I'm ready to end for today. This has been intense, but also helpful. Is there anything specific you want me to focus on before our next session?"
