    "Therapist: Let's begin the imaginal exposure. Can you describe the event involving police brutality?",
    "Client: Okay... It was a warm evening in July. I was walking home from the grocery store, carrying my bags. I saw two police officers approaching a young man on the street corner. They seemed aggressive, and I felt uneasy. As I got closer, I could hear them yelling at him. Suddenly, one of the officers grabbed the man and slammed him against the wall. I was shocked and scared.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Continue describing what you saw.",
    "Client: The man was crying out in pain, begging them to stop. The other officer started hitting him with a baton. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I wanted to help, but I was frozen in place. The sound of the baton hitting him... it was terrible. I felt so helpless.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What were you feeling?",
    "Client: I felt... terrified. My heart was racing, and I couldn't breathe properly. I kept thinking, \"What if they turn on me next?\" I wanted to run away, but my legs wouldn't move. The groceries felt so heavy in my hands, but I couldn't let go. I just stood there, watching this poor man being beaten.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The man fell to the ground, and they kept hitting him. He was curled up, trying to protect himself. There was blood on the sidewalk. I could hear him sobbing and pleading. I felt sick to my stomach. I wanted to scream, to tell them to stop, but I was too afraid. I kept thinking about my own children and grandchildren, wondering if this could happen to them.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel these emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I... I'm sorry, this is hard. (pauses, takes a deep breath) The beating seemed to go on forever. Finally, they handcuffed him and dragged him to their car. His face was swollen and bloody. As they drove away, I just stood there, shaking. I felt so guilty for not doing anything. I should have helped him, or at least called for help. But I was too scared.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this very well. How did you feel afterwards?",
    "Client: I felt... ashamed. And angry. I couldn't sleep that night. I kept replaying the scene in my head, thinking of all the things I should have done. I was angry at the police, at myself, at the world. I didn't feel safe anymore. Every time I saw a police car after that, my heart would start racing. I stopped going out in the evenings. I felt like I couldn't trust anyone anymore.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to have those feelings. You're doing great processing this.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to talk about. I've never told anyone the full story before. I feel like I failed that young man. I keep wondering what happened to him, if he's okay. Sometimes I have nightmares about it, where I'm the one being beaten, and no one helps me. I wake up feeling terrified and alone.",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. How do you feel now, talking about it?",
    "Client: It's... it's difficult, but also a bit of a relief. My heart is still racing, and I feel anxious, but not as bad as I thought I would. I guess I've been carrying this around for so long, it feels good to finally let it out. But I still feel guilty. I wish I had done something, anything, to help.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to have those feelings. You're processing this well.",
    "Client: I suppose so. It's just... it changed how I see the world. I used to feel safe in my neighborhood, but now I'm always on edge. I worry about my grandchildren when they're out. I want to protect them, but I know I can't always be there. And I feel angry that this kind of thing happens at all. No one should have to go through that, or witness it.",
    "Therapist: You're showing a lot of strength. How are you feeling right now?",
    "Client: I'm feeling... tired, I guess. Drained. But also a little lighter, if that makes sense. Talking about it is hard, but it's also like I'm finally facing it instead of running away from the memory. I still feel sad and angry, but maybe a little less afraid. Is that normal?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's a normal response. You're doing very well.",
    "Client: Thank you. I think... I think I need a moment. This is a lot to process. But I'm glad I'm finally talking about it. Maybe it will help me start to move past it, or at least learn to live with the memory without it controlling me so much. I just hope that by facing this, I can become stronger and maybe even find a way to make a difference, so things like this don't happen to others.",
    "Therapist: That's a positive outlook. Let's take a break here."
