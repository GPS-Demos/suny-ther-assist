    "Therapist: Welcome, Rahul. Are you ready to begin our imaginal exposure session today?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm feeling a bit on edge, to be honest. But I know this is important.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Let's start with a SUDS rating. How distressed are you feeling right now, on a scale of 0 to 100?",
    "Client: Um, probably around a 40? My stomach's a bit tight.",
    "Therapist: Okay, thank you. Remember, we'll go at your pace. When you're ready, close your eyes and describe the night of the home invasion.",
    "Client: (Takes a deep breath) Alright... I'm in my living room. It's late, maybe around 11 PM. I'm watching TV, feeling relaxed after a long day of work. The lights are dim, and I can hear the faint sound of traffic outside.",
    "Therapist: Good. What happens next?",
    "Client: Suddenly, there's a loud crash. It... it comes from the kitchen. My heart starts racing immediately. I jump up from the couch, knocking over my glass of water. The sound of breaking glass seems so loud in the quiet house.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm terrified. My hands are shaking, and I can feel sweat breaking out on my forehead. I'm frozen in place, straining to hear any other sounds.",
    "Therapist: What do you do?",
    "Client: I... I try to move towards the kitchen, but my legs feel like lead. Each step is so difficult. I can hear rustling and low voices now. Oh God, there's definitely someone in my house.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to about 70. My heart's pounding so hard.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. Remember, you're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: (Breathes deeply) Okay... I reach for my phone on the coffee table, but my hands are shaking so much I can barely grip it. I'm trying to dial 999, but I keep misdialing. The voices are getting louder, they're coming closer.",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. What happens next?",
    "Client: Two men burst into the living room. They're wearing dark clothes and... and masks. One of them spots me and shouts, \"Don't move!\" I... I drop my phone. It clatters to the floor, and I feel so helpless.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling in this moment?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm absolutely terrified. My whole body is trembling. I can feel my heart pounding in my ears. I want to run, but I'm paralyzed with fear.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: The larger man grabs me roughly by the arm. His grip is so tight, it hurts. He's yelling at me, asking where I keep my valuables. I can smell alcohol on his breath. I'm stammering, trying to answer, but I can barely form words.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I keep thinking, \"This can't be happening. Please, let this be a nightmare.\" But it's real. So real. The other man is ransacking my living room, throwing things around. The noise is overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that feeling. What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 85. I feel like I can't breathe.",
    "Therapist: Take a moment. Breathe deeply. You're safe here.",
    "Client: (Takes several deep breaths) Okay... The man holding me shoves me onto the couch. He's screaming at me to stay put. I curl up, trying to make myself as small as possible. I can hear them moving through the house, opening drawers, breaking things.",
    "Therapist: What are you feeling in your body?",
    "Client: My... my whole body is tense. My muscles ache from being so rigid. I can feel my heart racing, and I'm struggling to breathe normally. My throat feels tight, like I might cry, but no tears come.",
    "Therapist: Continue. What happens next?",
    "Client: They... they come back to the living room. One of them is holding my laptop and some jewelry. The other one, the one who grabbed me, he comes close again. I can see the anger in his eyes through the mask. He... he raises his hand...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're doing well.",
    "Client: (Voice shaking) He... he hits me. Hard. Across the face. The pain is shocking, and I taste blood in my mouth. I fall to the floor, and he kicks me in the stomach. I can't breathe. I'm gasping, trying to curl up to protect myself.",
    "Therapist: What's your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's 95. I feel like I'm right back there.",
    "Therapist: Remember, you're safe here. This is a memory. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: (Breathes deeply, voice still shaky) They... they're leaving now. I hear the front door slam. I'm lying on the floor, in pain, terrified they might come back. The house is so quiet now, but I can hear my own ragged breathing.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking I should call the police, but I'm too scared to move. What if they come back? I feel so weak, so helpless. I hate myself for not being able to do anything.",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. What do you do next?",
    "Client: I... I lie there for what feels like hours. Eventually, I manage to crawl to my phone. My hands are shaking so much, but I finally dial 999. When I hear the operator's voice, I break down sobbing.",
    "Therapist: How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted. Drained. But also relieved that it's over. My face is throbbing, and my ribs hurt when I breathe. I feel so... violated. This was my home, my safe place, and now...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel that way. What's your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's down to about 75 now. I'm... I'm starting to come back to the present.",
    "Therapist: You've done very well. Let's take a moment to ground ourselves.",

    "Client: I'm... I'm drained, but also a bit proud that I got through it. It was hard, but... I did it.",
    "Therapist: You should be proud. You showed great courage. Let's end here for today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It... it helps to talk about it, even though it's difficult.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. We'll continue working through this together.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. I... I think I'm ready to go now.",
    "Therapist: Take care, Rahul. I'll see you next week."
