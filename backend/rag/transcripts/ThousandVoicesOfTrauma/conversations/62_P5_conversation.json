    "Therapist: Mr. Singh, today we'll start imaginal exposure. How are you feeling about this?",
    "Client: I'm... not sure, to be honest. I've been dreading this part. The idea of reliving that night... it's terrifying. I've spent years trying to forget, and now you want me to remember? I don't know if I can do this.",
    "Therapist: Your concerns are valid. Can you tell me more about your fears?",
    "Client: Well, I'm worried that if I start talking about it, I won't be able to stop. That I'll be overwhelmed by the memories and emotions. I've worked so hard to keep it all bottled up. What if I fall apart? At my age, I don't know if I can put myself back together again.",
    "Therapist: I understand. How do you think revisiting might help?",
    "Client: I suppose... maybe it could help me process what happened? But I'm scared of the pain it might bring up. Since my wife passed, I've been feeling more vulnerable. The depression doesn't help either. I'm just not sure I'm strong enough for this.",
    "Therapist: Your strength in being here is admirable. How can I support you?",
    "Client: I appreciate that. Maybe... could you explain more about what exactly we'll be doing? And perhaps, if it gets too much, could we have a way for me to signal that I need a break? I'm also worried about how this might affect my work. I can't afford to fall apart.",
    "Therapist: Of course. Let me outline the process and we'll establish a signal.",
    "Client: Thank you. That would help. I'm still nervous, but knowing what to expect might make it easier. Can you also tell me how this is supposed to help with my PTSD symptoms? I've been having more nightmares lately, and I'm hoping this might help with that.",
    "Therapist: Certainly. Exposure often reduces nightmares. Shall we discuss specific goals?",
    "Client: Yes, please. I'd like to be able to sleep through the night without waking up in a cold sweat. And maybe... maybe not feel so jumpy all the time. Sometimes the smallest things startle me, and it's embarrassing, especially at work. If this could help with that, I think it would be worth trying.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent goals. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I... I think so. I'm still scared, but I'm also hopeful. This is the first time I've felt like there might be a way forward. Just... please be patient with me if I struggle. And thank you, for being willing to guide me through this. It means more than you know.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is inspiring. Let's start slowly. Remember, you're in control.",
    "Client: Okay. I'll try my best. Where do we begin? Should I close my eyes? And what should I do if I start to feel overwhelmed? I'm worried about getting lost in the memories.",
    "Therapist: Eyes open or closed, your choice. If overwhelmed, use our signal.",
    "Client: Alright. I think I'll keep my eyes open for now. It might help me stay grounded. I'm ready... I think. Let's do this before I lose my nerve. Where do you want me to start? The beginning of that night, or...?",
    "Therapist: Start wherever feels right. Take your time.",
    "Client: Okay. I'll start with when I first heard the shouting..."
