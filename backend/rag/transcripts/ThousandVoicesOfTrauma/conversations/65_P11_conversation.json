    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Ahmed?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm not sure. It's a lot to process. The memory of that home invasion feels so vivid now. I can still hear the sound of glass breaking, and my heart is racing a bit. It's like I'm right back there, you know?",
    "Therapist: That sounds intense. What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The fear, definitely. I remember hiding in my closet, praying they wouldn't find me. I felt so helpless, so... small. It's embarrassing to admit, but I was shaking uncontrollably. I've never felt that level of terror before.",
    "Therapist: It's understandable to feel that way. How does reflecting on it now feel different?",
    "Client: It's strange. I still feel anxious, but... there's also a sense of relief? Like, I survived it. I'm here now, talking about it. That feels... significant somehow.",
    "Therapist: That's an important realization. How does this connect to your everyday life?",
    "Client: I guess... I've been avoiding a lot of things. I rarely go out at night, and I'm always checking locks. But going through this memory, as awful as it is, makes me realize I'm stronger than I thought. Maybe I don't need to be so afraid all the time?",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful insight. What might that mean for your recovery?",
    "Client: I think... maybe I could start challenging myself more? Like, perhaps I could try going for a short walk in the evening. Or invite a friend over without triple-checking every window. It's scary to think about, but also... exciting?",
    "Therapist: Those sound like great ideas. How do you feel about continuing this work?",
    "Client: It's tough, I won't lie. But I'm starting to see how it could help. I want to feel normal again, you know? To not jump at every sound or live in constant fear. If this is the path to get there, then... I'm willing to keep going.",
    "Therapist: Your commitment is commendable. What's one thing you'll take away from today's session?",
    "Client: I think... the realization that I'm not as helpless as I felt during the invasion. I survived it then, and I'm surviving it now by facing it. That feels... empowering, in a way I didn't expect.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful takeaway. How might you remind yourself of this strength?",
    "Client: Hmm... Maybe I could write it down somewhere? Or set a daily reminder on my phone? Something like, \"I am stronger than my fears.\" It sounds a bit cheesy, but... I think it might help.",
    "Therapist: That's a great idea. Is there anything else you want to discuss about today's experience?",
    "Client: I... I'm grateful for your guidance through this. It's not easy, but I feel like I'm making progress. There's still a long way to go, but for the first time in a while, I feel... hopeful? Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. Hope is a crucial part of healing. How will you care for yourself after this session?",
    "Client: I think I'll take a long shower when I get home. Maybe call my best friend \u2013 I've been avoiding him lately. And... I might try that short evening walk we talked about. Baby steps, right?",
    "Therapist: Sounds like a solid plan. Remember, you're not alone in this journey.",

    "Therapist: Not strange at all. It shows your readiness to heal. Shall we wrap up for today?",
    "Client: Yes, I think so. Thank you again. I'll... I'll see you next week.",
    "Therapist: Take care, Ahmed. You've done great work today."
