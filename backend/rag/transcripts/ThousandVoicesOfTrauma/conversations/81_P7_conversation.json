    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Can you describe the bullying incident that's been troubling you?",
    "Client: Okay... It was during my freshman year of high school. I had just broken up with my girlfriend, and I was feeling really vulnerable. There was this group of seniors who always hung out near my locker. One day, they started making fun of me, saying things like, \"Hey, look at the little heartbroken baby!\" and \"Did she dump you because you're such a loser?\" I can still hear their laughter echoing in the hallway...",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: Their words cut deep, you know? I tried to ignore them, but they wouldn't stop. Every day, it was the same thing. They'd push me around, knock my books out of my hands, and call me names. I started dreading going to school. I can feel my heart racing just thinking about it now...",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel this way. You're safe here.",
    "Client: I remember one day, it got really bad. They cornered me in the bathroom and... (voice trembles) they started pushing me around, taking turns shoving me into the wall. I can still smell the musty air and feel the cold tiles against my back. I was so scared and humiliated...",
    "Therapist: Stay with it. You're doing well.",
    "Client: I wanted to fight back, but I was outnumbered and terrified. They were laughing and recording it on their phones. I felt so powerless and alone. After they left, I just sat on the floor, crying. I didn't want anyone to see me like that, so I stayed there until the bell rang. I can still hear the sound of that bell, signaling that I had to face the world again...",
    "Therapist: You're very brave for sharing this. Keep going.",
    "Client: The worst part was, I didn't tell anyone. Not my parents, not my teachers. I was too ashamed. I started skipping classes, my grades dropped, and I pushed away my friends. It felt like my whole world was falling apart, and I couldn't stop it. Every night, I'd lie in bed, replaying those moments in my head, wondering what I did to deserve this...",
    "Therapist: It's not your fault. You're handling this well.",
    "Client: (deep breath) It's hard to talk about this. Even now, years later, I still struggle with trusting people. I feel like I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop, you know? Like someone's going to turn on me at any moment. It's affected all my relationships since then...",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Continue.",
    "Client: I wish I could go back and stand up for myself. Tell someone what was happening. But I felt so trapped and alone. Sometimes, I still have nightmares about being cornered in that bathroom. I wake up in a cold sweat, feeling like that scared freshman all over again. It's frustrating that it still affects me so much...",
    "Therapist: It's understandable. You're doing great processing this.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's hard to talk about, but I guess it helps to get it out. I just want to move past this, you know? I want to be able to trust people again, to not flinch when someone raises their voice or makes a sudden movement. I want to feel safe in my own skin...",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. How do you feel now?",
    "Client: I feel... drained, but also a little lighter? Like I've been carrying this weight for so long, and now I'm finally starting to put it down. It's still painful to remember, but talking about it makes it feel less overwhelming. I just hope that one day, these memories won't have so much power over me...",
    "Therapist: That's a positive outlook. Well done today."
