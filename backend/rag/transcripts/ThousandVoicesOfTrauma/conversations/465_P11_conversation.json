    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Sarah?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Reliving that moment when I found out about my mom's cancer diagnosis... it's bringing up a lot of emotions I thought I'd buried.",
    "Therapist: What stood out to you most?",
    "Client: The fear, I think. That overwhelming sense of helplessness. I remember standing in the hospital corridor, and it felt like the walls were closing in on me. I couldn't breathe, couldn't think straight. It's like... like the world had suddenly tilted on its axis, you know?",
    "Therapist: How did it feel to go through that memory today?",
    "Client: It was... intense. I could feel my heart racing, just like it did that day. My palms got sweaty, and for a moment, I thought I might actually be back there. But then... I don't know, something shifted. It's like, I could observe the memory without being completely consumed by it. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: It does. What do you make of that shift?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe it's because I know I'm safe here? Or because I've had time to process it a bit? It's still painful, don't get me wrong, but it feels... I don't know, more manageable somehow.",
    "Therapist: How does this connect to your everyday experiences?",
    "Client: Well, I've been avoiding hospitals like the plague since then. Even seeing medical shows on TV can send me into a panic. But going through this memory... it's making me wonder if maybe I can face those triggers head-on. Maybe they don't have to control me anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. How else might this apply?",
    "Client: I guess... maybe it's not just about hospitals. I've been pushing people away, afraid of getting close in case I lose them too. But if I can face this memory, maybe I can start opening up again? It's scary, but... I think I want to try.",
    "Therapist: That takes courage. What's your next step?",
    "Client: Um, maybe... maybe I could try visiting a friend who's in the hospital? Not for anything serious, just a routine thing. But it would be a start, right? And... and maybe I could talk to my roommate about what happened. I've never really opened up about it before.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like meaningful goals. How do you feel about them?",
    "Client: Nervous, definitely. But also... kind of excited? Like, for the first time in a while, I feel like I'm moving forward instead of just treading water. It's a good feeling, even if it's scary.",
    "Therapist: What will help you follow through?",
    "Client: I think... maybe writing it down? Like, making a concrete plan. And... and maybe telling you about it next session? Having someone to be accountable to might help. Oh, and I could use some of those breathing exercises we've practiced when I start feeling anxious.",
    "Therapist: Excellent strategies. Any final thoughts on today's session?",
    "Client: It was tough, really tough. But... I feel lighter somehow? Like I've put down a weight I didn't even realize I was carrying. And I'm... I'm proud of myself for getting through it. I didn't think I could, but I did. That means something, right?",
    "Therapist: It certainly does. Well done, Sarah."
