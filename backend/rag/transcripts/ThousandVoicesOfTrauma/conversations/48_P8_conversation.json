    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise, Susan?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's all a bit overwhelming. My heart's still racing, and I feel like I can't catch my breath. The memories, they're so vivid. I can still hear the explosions, smell the smoke. It's like I'm right back there in the combat zone.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's coming up for you now?",
    "Client: I feel... guilty. So incredibly guilty. I keep seeing the faces of my fellow soldiers, the ones who didn't make it. I was their commanding officer. I was supposed to protect them. But I couldn't. I failed them.",
    "Therapist: Hmm. Tell me more about that guilt.",
    "Client: It's crushing. I mean, I know logically that we were in a war zone and casualties happen. But emotionally? I can't shake the feeling that I should have done more. Maybe if I had made different decisions, they'd still be alive. And then I feel guilty for even being alive when they're not.",
    "Therapist: I see. What else are you experiencing?",
    "Client: Anger. I'm angry at the enemy, at the war, at the whole situation. But mostly, I'm angry at myself. I've spent years trying to push these feelings down, but they're always there, just below the surface. And now, reliving it all... it's like ripping open an old wound.",
    "Therapist: How does that anger feel in your body?",
    "Client: It's... it's like a fire in my chest. My jaw is clenched, and my fists are balled up. I want to hit something, to scream. But at the same time, I feel so helpless. It's this bizarre mix of rage and powerlessness.",
    "Therapist: And what thoughts are going through your mind?",
    "Client: I keep thinking, \"Why me? Why did I survive when others didn't?\" And then I feel selfish for even having that thought. I think about how I've never really talked about this with anyone before. My parents... they don't understand. They're proud of my service, but they have no idea what it was really like. I've always felt so alone with these memories.",
    "Therapist: How does it feel to share them now?",
    "Client: It's... terrifying, honestly. But also, there's a small part of me that feels... I don't know, maybe relieved? Like I've been carrying this massive weight for so long, and now I'm finally setting it down. But then I feel guilty for feeling relieved. It's all so confusing.",
    "Therapist: That confusion is normal. What else?",
    "Client: I keep thinking about how this has affected my whole life. I've never been able to maintain a relationship. I push people away before they can get close. And work... I throw myself into it because it's the only thing that makes me feel in control. But at the end of the day, I go home to an empty apartment, and all these memories come flooding back.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with that?",
    "Client: I... I don't, really. I drink more than I should. I work longer hours. I try to stay busy so I don't have to think. But it's always there, just waiting for a quiet moment to resurface. And now, doing this exposure therapy, it's like I can't hide from it anymore.",
    "Therapist: What's that like for you?",
    "Client: It's scary. Really scary. But also... I don't know. Maybe necessary? I've been running from this for so long. Maybe it's time I faced it. But I'm afraid of what will happen if I do. What if I can't handle it? What if I fall apart completely?",
    "Therapist: Those are valid concerns. How do you feel right now?",
    "Client: I feel... raw. Exposed. Like I've been turned inside out. But also, there's this tiny glimmer of... hope, maybe? Like maybe by facing this, I can finally start to heal. But it's so faint, and I'm so scared.",
    "Therapist: That hope is important. What else?",
    "Client: I'm realizing how much this trauma has shaped my entire life. My depression, my isolation, my workaholic tendencies... it all stems from this. And that's... that's hard to accept. But maybe understanding it is the first step to changing it?",
    "Therapist: That's an insightful observation. How does that realization make you feel?",
    "Client: It's a mix of emotions. Part of me feels sad for all the years I've lost to this pain. But there's also a sense of... I don't know, maybe empowerment? Like now that I can see the connection, maybe I can start to address it. It's scary, but also... maybe a little exciting? Is that weird?",
    "Therapist: Not at all. It's a natural response. What's next for you?",
    "Client: I... I think I want to keep going with this therapy. It's painful, and it's scary, but for the first time in years, I feel like maybe there's a path forward. I don't want to be controlled by these memories anymore. I want to learn how to live with them without letting them consume me. Is that possible?",
    "Therapist: It is. How does that possibility feel?",
    "Client: It feels... hopeful. Terrifying, but hopeful. Like maybe I can finally start to build a life that isn't defined by trauma. Maybe I can learn to connect with people again, to find some peace. It's going to be a long road, I know that. But for the first time in a long time, I feel like maybe it's a road worth traveling.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm exhausted, emotionally and physically. But there's also this strange sense of... I don't know, maybe clarity? Like I've taken the first step on a long journey. I'm scared, but I'm also... ready. Ready to face this, to work through it. I don't want to be a prisoner of my past anymore.",
    "Therapist: That's a brave stance. Anything else?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm okay for now. This session has been intense, but I feel like I've turned a corner somehow. Thank you for guiding me through this. I know we have a lot more work to do, but I feel like maybe, just maybe, I can do this.",
    "Therapist: You've shown great courage today. We'll continue next time.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I'm looking forward to it. And dreading it a little too, if I'm honest. But mostly, I'm grateful. Grateful that I'm finally facing this after all these years."
