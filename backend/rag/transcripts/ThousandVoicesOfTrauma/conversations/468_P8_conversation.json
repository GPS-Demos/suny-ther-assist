    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure exercise?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. It's like my mind is racing but also blank at the same time. My heart's still pounding a bit. I can feel this tightness in my chest, you know? It's like I'm right back there, seeing the waves crash over the houses, hearing the screams... God, it's so vivid.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. What's the strongest emotion you're experiencing right now?",
    "Client: Fear, I think. No, maybe more like... helplessness? Yeah, that's it. I feel so incredibly helpless. Just like I did when the tsunami hit. I keep thinking about all the people I couldn't save, all the destruction... It's overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: Hmm. Can you tell me more about that feeling of helplessness?",
    "Client: It's... it's like I'm paralyzed. I want to do something, anything, but I can't move. I'm frozen in place, watching everything fall apart around me. And I know, logically, that there wasn't much I could've done. But emotionally? I feel like I should've been able to do more, save more people, you know? It's this crushing weight of guilt mixed with the helplessness.",
    "Therapist: I see. How does your body feel as you describe this?",
    "Client: Tense. Really tense. My shoulders are all bunched up, and I can feel this knot in my stomach. It's like my whole body is bracing for impact, even though I know I'm safe here. And my breathing... it's shallow, like I can't quite get enough air. It's the same feeling I had when I was trying to stay afloat in the flood waters.",
    "Therapist: Mmm. What thoughts are going through your mind right now?",
    "Client: I keep thinking... \"Why did I survive when so many others didn't?\" It doesn't seem fair. And then I feel guilty for even thinking that because I should be grateful to be alive, right? But then I remember the faces of those who didn't make it, and I wonder if I could've done more to help them. It's this endless loop of guilt and questioning and... and just feeling so damn powerless.",
    "Therapist: That sounds really challenging. How do these thoughts and feelings compare to when you first experienced the trauma?",
    "Client: I... wow, I hadn't really thought about that. I guess... I guess they're not as intense now? Like, when it first happened, these thoughts and feelings were all-consuming. I couldn't function, couldn't sleep, couldn't eat. Now, they're still there, still painful, but... I don't know, maybe a bit more manageable? It's like I can step back from them a little bit, even if it's just for a moment.",
    "Therapist: That's an important observation. What do you make of that change?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Part of me feels relieved, you know? Like maybe I'm starting to heal or something. But then another part of me feels guilty about that too. Like, do I have the right to feel better when so many people lost everything? It's confusing. But I guess... I guess it's progress? Even if it's small?",
    "Therapist: Hmm. How does recognizing this progress make you feel?",
    "Client: It's... complicated. There's a glimmer of hope, I think. Like maybe I won't always feel this way, maybe things can get better. But it's also scary. What if I forget? What if moving on means I'm dishonoring those who died? And then there's this weird sense of... I don't know, maybe pride? That I've managed to make even this small step. It's all mixed up together.",
    "Therapist: I understand. What do you think has helped you make this progress?",
    "Client: I... I guess talking about it helps. Like here, in therapy. And maybe... maybe allowing myself to remember? It's painful, God it's so painful, but facing it head-on in these sessions... it's like lancing a wound, you know? It hurts, but it helps drain the infection. And... and I've been trying to do those grounding exercises you taught me. They don't always work, but when they do, it's like... it's like I can separate myself from the memory a bit. See it for what it is - something that happened, not something that's happening right now.",
    "Therapist: That's really insightful. How might you use these strategies moving forward?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to keep talking about it. Not all the time, but... not bottling it up either. And maybe... maybe I can try to be a bit kinder to myself? Like, acknowledge that I did what I could in an impossible situation. It's hard, but... maybe it's part of healing? And I want to keep practicing those grounding techniques. They help me feel more... present, I guess. Less lost in the memories.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like positive steps. How are you feeling now compared to when we started?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm exhausted, to be honest. Emotionally drained. But also... maybe a little lighter? Like I've set down a heavy backpack I've been carrying. The weight's not gone, but it's... it's shifted a bit. And I'm proud, I think. Proud that I made it through this session, that I faced these memories. It's hard, but... but I think it's important. Does that make sense?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Is there anything else you'd like to share before we wrap up?",
    "Client: I... I don't think so. Just... thank you, I guess. For listening, for guiding me through this. It's not easy, but I think it's helping. And... and I'm going to try to remember what we talked about today. About progress and self-compassion and all that. It's a lot to process, but... but I'm glad we did this.",
    "Therapist: You've done great work today. How would you like to close our session?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'd like to do one of those grounding exercises we talked about. Just to help me transition back to the here and now, you know? And maybe... maybe set an intention for the week. Something about being kind to myself or... or acknowledging my progress, even when it feels small. Yeah, I'd like that.",
    "Therapist: That sounds like a wonderful idea. Let's do that together."
