    "Therapist: Let's begin our imaginal exposure session. Remember, you're safe here. Can you describe the natural disaster you experienced?",
    "Client: Okay... It was during my deployment in Afghanistan. We were at our base when suddenly the ground started shaking violently. It was an earthquake, a big one. I remember the deafening sound of buildings collapsing and people screaming. The air filled with dust, making it hard to breathe or see anything.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: As the shaking continued, I saw our barracks crumbling. My first instinct was to run, but I couldn't. My training kicked in, and I started helping others evacuate. The chaos was overwhelming. People were panicking, running in all directions. I could hear the sound of glass shattering and metal twisting.",
    "Therapist: Stay with that moment. What else do you recall?",
    "Client: I remember the smell of smoke and dust. It was suffocating. I saw a fellow soldier trapped under a fallen beam. His face was covered in blood, and he was crying out for help. I rushed over with a few others to lift the beam. My heart was racing, and I felt this surge of adrenaline.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this well. Continue.",
    "Client: As we lifted the beam, aftershocks hit. The ground beneath us felt unstable, like it could give way at any moment. I was terrified but knew I had to stay focused. We managed to pull him out, but his leg was badly injured. I remember the warm, sticky feeling of blood on my hands as I applied a tourniquet.",
    "Therapist: It's okay to feel those emotions. You're safe here.",
    "Client: The aftershocks kept coming, and we had to move quickly to a safer area. I helped carry the injured soldier, but all around us, there was destruction. Buildings I had walked past every day were now piles of rubble. I saw bodies... people I knew... crushed under debris. The guilt of not being able to save everyone was overwhelming.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great. Keep going.",
    "Client: As we reached the evacuation point, I looked back at our base. It was unrecognizable. The place that had been our home, our safe haven in a war zone, was now a disaster area. I felt so helpless, so small against the power of nature. And yet, in the midst of all this destruction, I saw acts of bravery and kindness. People risking their lives to save others, comforting those who were injured or had lost loved ones.",
    "Therapist: You're showing incredible strength. Continue.",
    "Client: The hours that followed were a blur of rescue efforts, tending to the wounded, and trying to establish communication with command. The aftershocks continued, each one bringing a fresh wave of fear. I remember thinking about my family back home, wondering if I'd ever see them again. The uncertainty was almost as terrifying as the earthquake itself.",
    "Therapist: You're handling this memory well. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling shaky. My heart is racing, and I can almost feel the ground moving beneath me. But I also feel... I don't know, maybe a bit proud? Proud that I was able to help, that I didn't freeze up when it mattered most. But there's still so much guilt and sadness for those we couldn't save.",
    "Therapist: It's natural to have mixed feelings. You did well today.",
    "Client: Thank you. It's still hard to talk about, but I think it's getting a little easier each time. I just wish I could shake off this feeling of vulnerability, you know? Like at any moment, everything could just fall apart again.",
    "Therapist: That's a common feeling. We'll work through it together.",
    "Client: I appreciate that. It helps to know I'm not alone in this. Sometimes I wonder how I managed to get through it all. There are moments when I can still hear the rumbling, feel the dust in my throat. But being here, talking about it... it makes it feel less overwhelming somehow.",
    "Therapist: You're making progress. How do you feel about ending here today?",
    "Client: I think that would be good. It's exhausting to relive it, but I do feel a bit lighter. Like I'm slowly unpacking this heavy burden I've been carrying. Is it normal to feel both drained and somewhat relieved at the same time?",
    "Therapist: Yes, that's very normal. We'll pick up here next time.",
    "Client: Okay, thank you. I'm looking forward to it, even though it's difficult. I'm starting to see how facing these memories might help me in the long run. It's just... it's a lot to process, you know? But I'm glad I have this space to work through it.",
    "Therapist: You're doing important work. Take care of yourself this week.",
    "Client: I will, thank you. I think I'll try some of those grounding techniques we talked about if the memories get too intense. It's reassuring to know I have tools to help me cope outside of our sessions. I'm grateful for your guidance through all of this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome. We'll continue next week. Take care."
