    "Therapist: Welcome, Sarah. How are you feeling about today's imaginal exposure session?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm a bit apprehensive, to be honest. Talking about my time in prison isn't easy. It brings up a lot of difficult memories and emotions.",
    "Therapist: That's understandable. Remember, we're here to work through this together. Are you ready to begin?",
    "Client: I suppose so. Yes, let's do it.",
    "Therapist: Alright. Close your eyes and take us back to that day. What do you see?",
    "Client: I... I see the prison gates. They're huge, made of steel. The sound of them clanging shut behind me is deafening. It's like... like a final reminder that I'm trapped here.",
    "Therapist: Good. Stay with that moment. What are you feeling?",
    "Client: Terror. Absolute terror. My heart is racing, and I feel like I can't breathe. The guard is pushing me forward, but my feet feel like lead.",
    "Therapist: On a scale of 0 to 100, how distressed are you right now?",
    "Client: It's... it's about an 80.",
    "Therapist: Okay, take a deep breath. You're safe here. Continue when you're ready.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Right... As I walk through the corridors, the smell hits me. It's a mix of disinfectant and... something else. Something oppressive. The walls are a dull gray, and there are bars everywhere. God, it's suffocating.",
    "Therapist: What happens next?",
    "Client: They... they take me to a small room. It's for processing. They make me strip down, and I've never felt so exposed, so vulnerable in my life. I'm shaking, trying not to cry. I keep thinking, \"This can't be happening. This can't be real.\"",
    "Therapist: Stay with those feelings. What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I... I'm thinking about my family. My kids. How I've let them down. How I might never see them again. It's... it's overwhelming. I feel like I'm drowning in shame and regret.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's up to 90. This is really hard.",
    "Therapist: You're doing well, Sarah. Remember, you're here now, safe. Take another deep breath.",
    "Client: *breathes* Okay... After processing, they lead me to my cell. It's tiny, with just a bed and a toilet. The door slams shut behind me, and I'm alone. Completely alone. I sit on the bed, and it's hard as a rock. I can hear other inmates shouting, crying. It's chaos.",
    "Therapist: What do you do in that moment?",
    "Client: I... I curl up on the bed. I'm trying to make myself as small as possible. I'm crying, but silently. I don't want anyone to hear me. I'm terrified of drawing attention to myself.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel?",
    "Client: Tense. So tense it hurts. My muscles are aching, and I feel sick to my stomach. I'm cold, too. The cell is freezing, and the thin blanket they gave me does nothing.",
    "Therapist: Stay with those physical sensations. What else do you notice?",
    "Client: I... I can hear my heart pounding in my ears. My mouth is dry, and I have this metallic taste. I'm so thirsty, but I'm too scared to ask for water. The lights are so bright, and they never turn them off completely. It's disorienting.",
    "Therapist: What are you thinking about now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about how long I'll be here. How I'll survive. Will I ever feel normal again? Will my family forgive me? It's... it's like a loop of despair playing in my head.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's still at 90. Maybe even 95. This is excruciating.",
    "Therapist: You're doing great, Sarah. Remember, you've survived this. You're here now.",
    "Client: Right... right. *takes a shaky breath* The first night is the worst. I can't sleep. Every sound makes me jump. I keep expecting something terrible to happen. When morning finally comes, I feel like I've aged years.",
    "Therapist: What happens in the morning?",
    "Client: They... they come to take us to breakfast. The guard bangs on the door, and I nearly jump out of my skin. As we walk to the cafeteria, I can feel everyone's eyes on me. I'm fresh meat, and they all know it.",
    "Therapist: How do you handle that?",
    "Client: I... I try to make myself invisible. I keep my head down, don't make eye contact. But I can feel the tension in the air. It's like... like being in a cage with predators. I'm terrified of saying or doing the wrong thing.",
    "Therapist: What's going through your mind?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm thinking about how I ended up here. The accident. The trial. It all feels like a nightmare I can't wake up from. I keep wondering if I could have done something differently, if I could have prevented all of this.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level now?",
    "Client: It's... it's around 85. Still high, but... I'm starting to feel a little more grounded.",
    "Therapist: That's good. You're doing well. Keep going.",
    "Client: After breakfast, they assign me to work detail. I'm in the laundry. The noise is deafening, and the heat is oppressive. I'm folding sheets, and my hands are shaking so badly I can barely manage it. I keep dropping things, and I can see the other inmates getting annoyed.",
    "Therapist: How do you cope with that?",
    "Client: I... I try to focus on the task. Just fold, stack, repeat. I'm trying to disappear into the routine. But my mind keeps wandering. I'm thinking about my life before, my job, my friends. It all seems so far away now.",
    "Therapist: What else do you notice?",
    "Client: The... the constant vigilance. I'm always watching, always on edge. Every movement, every sound could be a threat. It's exhausting. By the end of the day, I'm physically and emotionally drained.",
    "Therapist: How does your body feel now?",
    "Client: Heavy. So heavy. My muscles ache from tension. I have a headache that won't go away. And I'm so, so tired. But I know I won't be able to sleep.",
    "Therapist: Your SUDS level?",
    "Client: It's... it's down to about 75 now. I'm starting to feel a bit more distant from it all.",
    "Therapist: That's good progress, Sarah. Let's start to bring you back to the present. Take a deep breath.",
    "Client: *inhales deeply* Okay... I'm here. I'm safe.",
    "Therapist: That's right. You're here, and you're safe. How are you feeling now?",
    "Client: I'm... I'm drained. But also... I don't know. There's a sense of relief, I guess. Like I've faced something I've been avoiding for a long time.",
    "Therapist: That's a normal response. You've done really well today, Sarah. Is there anything else you want to share before we end?",
    "Client: I... I think I'm okay. It was hard, but... I feel like I can breathe a little easier now. Thank you for guiding me through this.",
    "Therapist: You're welcome, Sarah. Remember, you're strong, and you've survived this. We'll continue to work through these memories together."
