    "Therapist: How are you feeling after that imaginal exposure, Mrs. Johnson?",
    "Client: I... I'm feeling a bit shaken, to be honest. It's strange, you know? Going back to those moments, it's like I'm right there again. I can feel the tension in my shoulders, the knot in my stomach. It's not as overwhelming as it used to be, but it's still... there.",
    "Therapist: Mm-hmm. What stood out to you this time?",
    "Client: Well, I... I noticed something new. When my former boss was making those racial comments, I realized I wasn't just feeling hurt. There was anger there too. A lot of anger, actually. I've always tried to be so... composed, you know? But reliving it, I wanted to scream at him.",
    "Therapist: That's an important observation. How does recognizing that anger feel?",
    "Client: It's... liberating, in a way. But also scary. I've spent so long trying to be the \"model minority,\" always calm, always professional. Admitting I'm angry feels like I'm somehow proving them right about their stereotypes. But... it also feels honest. Real.",
    "Therapist: You're allowing yourself to feel. How might that impact your day-to-day life?",
    "Client: I... I'm not sure. Maybe I'll be more assertive? Stand up for myself more? It's hard to imagine, though. I've spent 65 years trying to fit in, to not make waves. But I'm tired. So tired of carrying all this... this weight.",
    "Therapist: That fatigue is understandable. What would it look like to set some of that weight down?",
    "Client: Oh, wow. Um... Maybe not laughing off racist jokes anymore? Or... or telling my children about these experiences instead of hiding them? I've always wanted to protect them, but maybe... maybe they need to know.",
    "Therapist: Those sound like meaningful steps. How do you feel about trying one this week?",
    "Client: Terrified, to be honest. But... also a little excited? Like I'm finally going to be true to myself. It's about time, right? At 65, I should be able to stand tall and be proud of who I am.",
    "Therapist: Your courage is admirable. What support do you need to take that step?",
    "Client: I... I think I need to practice. Maybe role-play some scenarios? And... and maybe talk to my husband about it. He's always been supportive, but I've never really opened up about how deep this pain goes.",
    "Therapist: Those are excellent ideas. Shall we start with a role-play now?",
    "Client: Yes, let's do that. I... I think I'm ready. It's strange, you know? I came here thinking I was too old to change, that I'd just have to live with this pain. But now... now I feel like I'm just starting to really live. It's scary, but... but it's good.",
    "Therapist: That's a powerful realization. Where would you like to start?",
    "Client: Let's... let's practice how I might talk to my daughter about this. She's always been so strong, so outspoken. I think she'll understand, but... but I'm nervous.",
    "Therapist: Alright, I'll play your daughter. How would you begin?",
    "Client: Okay, um... \"Sweetheart, there's something I need to talk to you about. It's... it's not easy for me, but I think it's important.\" Oh, this is harder than I thought. My heart's racing just thinking about it.",
    "Therapist: Take a deep breath. You're doing great. What next?",
    "Client: Right, okay. \"I've... I've experienced a lot of racism throughout my life. And I've never really talked about it, because I thought I had to be strong, to just push through. But I'm learning that it's okay to acknowledge the pain, to be angry about it. And I wanted you to know.\"",
    "Therapist: Well done. How do you feel saying those words?",
    "Client: It's... it's emotional. There's a lump in my throat, but also... also a sense of relief? Like I'm finally letting go of a secret I've been carrying for far too long. It's freeing.",
    "Therapist: That's significant progress. What's your next step?",
    "Client: I think... I think I'll actually have this conversation with my daughter this week. And maybe start journaling about my experiences. It's time to stop hiding from my past and start facing it head-on.",
    "Therapist: That's a courageous plan. We'll discuss how it went next session.",
    "Client: Thank you. I... I never thought I'd be doing this at my age, but... but I'm grateful. For the first time in a long time, I feel... hopeful.",
    "Therapist: That hope is powerful. We'll build on it next time.",
    "Client: Yes, let's do that. I'm looking forward to it. It's like... like I'm finally becoming the person I was always meant to be. Better late than never, right?",
    "Therapist: Absolutely. Your journey is inspiring, Mrs. Johnson.",
